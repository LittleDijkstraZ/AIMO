The equation is $ ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$

This equation equals to 0 if either of the two factors equals to 0.

Therefore, we have:

1) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or
2) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first equation, both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ cannot be negative, therefore, they must equal to 0. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. Solving these equations gives us the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

For the second equation, both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2$ cannot be negative, therefore, they must equal to 0. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. Solving these equations gives us the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The lines form a square with side length 10, therefore, the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$

Approach:

 The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This results in the four lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.
Similarly, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which results in the four lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.
The intersection of these lines form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:


The given equation is of the form $(A)(B) = 0$, which implies either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. We consider both cases.

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.

This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these equations are all the points $(x, y)$ that lie on the square with vertices $(0, 10), (10, 0), (0, -10)$ and $(-10, 0)$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

This implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are all the points $(x, y)$ that lie on the square with vertices $(8, 8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$ and $(8, -8)$.

The convex polygon enclosed by the points satisfying the given equation is the intersection of the two squares, which is also a square. The side length of this square is the shorter of the two side lengths of the original squares, which is 10. Therefore, the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:

 The equation in the problem represents a set of points that satisfies the equation, and the area of the polygon formed by these points is what we need to find.

1. First, we recognize that the equation is the product of two expressions equal to zero, which means that either one of the expressions must be zero for the equation to hold. So we have two cases:

   Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
   Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

2. For Case 1, the expressions $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ are both squares, so they are both non-negative. Their sum being zero means that both of them must be zero, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This results in a square with side length 10.

3. For Case 2, the expressions $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2$ are both squares, so they are both non-negative. Their sum being zero means that both of them must be zero, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This results in a square with side length 16.

4. The polygon formed by the points that satisfy the equation is the intersection of the two squares. This intersection is another square, whose side length is the minimum of the side lengths of the two squares. Therefore, the side length of the intersection square is 10.

5. The area of a square is given by the square of its side length. So the area of the intersection square is $10^2 = 100$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points satisfying the equation is 100. The answer is: $100$
