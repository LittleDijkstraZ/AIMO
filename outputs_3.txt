Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



We have a function with two variables $x$ and $y$. The function equals zero if and only if at least one of the two terms equals zero.

Each term is a product of two other terms. So, if the entire function equals zero, then at least one of the terms equals zero. This gives us four conditions:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From the first condition, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
From the second condition, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

This gives us 8 possible combinations of values for $x$ and $y$. Each combination gives us a line segment on the plane. When we plot these line segments, we get a square with side length 16.

The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



We have the condition $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

This equation equals zero if either of the two products equals zero. This translates to:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From 1, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
From 2, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

This gives us a total of 4 equations:

1. $x + y = \pm 10$
2. $x - y = \pm 10$
3. $x = \pm 8$
4. $y = \pm 8$

These 4 equations define the vertices of a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256.
The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



We need to find the area of the region enclosed by the points satisfying the equation $ ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

First, we need to understand the condition $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. It's equal to 0 if either of the two products is 0. This gives us two sets of equations:

1) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

2) Either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and either $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From 1), we get four points: $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$. From 2), we get four more points: $(10,0)$, $(-10,0)$, $(0,10)$, and $(0,-10)$.

The eight points form a square with side length 16. So the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$. The value $256$ is a positive integer as required.
The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, we need to understand the expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

The product of two expressions equals zero if and only if at least one of the expressions equals zero. Thus, the given equation is equivalent to the following system of equations:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From equations 3 and 4, we find that $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$, which implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

From equations 1 and 2, we find that $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$. Considering all possible combinations of the values of $x$ and $y$ from the above results, we can draw the following conclusions:

- If $x = 8$ and $y = 8$, then $x + y = 16 > 10$ and $x - y = 0 < 10$, which does not satisfy the conditions $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$.
- If $x = 8$ and $y = -8$, then $x + y = 0 < 10$ and $x - y = 16 > 10$, which does not satisfy the conditions $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$.
- If $x = -8$ and $y = 8$, then $x + y = 0 < 10$ and $x - y = -16 < 0$, which does not satisfy the conditions $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$.
- If $x = -8$ and $y = -8$, then $x + y = -16 < 0$ and $x - y = 16 > 10$, which does not satisfy the conditions $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$.

Therefore, the only possible solution is $x = 8$ and $y = -8$ or $x = -8$ and $y = 8$. In either case, the points lie on a rectangle with side lengths of 16 and 16.

The area of this rectangle is $16 \times 16 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: 256.
