Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to the system of equations:
   $$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0,$$
   $$(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0,$$
   $$(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0,$$
   $$(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0.$$

2. Each of these equations has only two solutions. The first two equations are satisfied if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies that $x = \pm 5$ and $y = \pm 5$. The last two equations are satisfied if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

3. The points that satisfy all these conditions are: $(5, 5)$, $(5, -5)$, $(-5, 5)$, $(-5, -5)$, $(8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, and $(-8, -8)$. These points form a square with side length $10$.

4. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $100$.

Now, let's write the entire script in python to solve the problem:

```python

from sympy import symbols, Abs, Eq, solve

def area_of_polygon():
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # Solve the system of equations

    # Calculate the area of the square formed by the solutions
    side_length = max([abs(x - y) for x, y in solutions])
    area = side_length**2

    return area

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. This means that the points that satisfy the equation are either on the curves defined by the equations:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

The first equation simplifies to $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$. These are the equations of two pairs of parallel lines, so they form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

The second equation simplifies to $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. These are the equations of two pairs of parallel lines, so they form a square with side length 8. The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$.

Since the points that satisfy the given equation are either on the square with side length 10 or the square with side length 8, the convex polygon formed by these points is the union of these two squares. The area of this convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares, which is $100 + 64 = 164$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 164 square units. The answer is: $164$

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. 

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, and this expression is zero if and only if both $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two squares with side length 10 centered at the origin.

The second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$, and this expression is zero if and only if both $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two squares with side length 16 centered at the origin.

The points that satisfy either of these conditions are the vertices of the convex polygon that encloses the region where both conditions are satisfied. The vertices of the first square are $(10,0)$, $(0,10)$, $(-10,0)$, and $(0,-10)$, and the vertices of the second square are $(8,0)$, $(0,8)$, $(-8,0)$, and $(0,-8)$. The convex polygon formed by the intersection of these two squares is a square with side length 8.

The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 64. The answer is: $64$

Assistant:

 The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The solutions to these equations are:
- For $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$: $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which gives $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
- For $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$: $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which gives $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
- For $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$: $\vert x \vert = 8$, which gives $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
- For $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$: $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.
The solutions to these equations form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $AB = 0$ implies that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. So we have two cases to consider:

1) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This equation implies that both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which further implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the four vertices of the square: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$.

2) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This equation implies that both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which further implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations, we get the four vertices of the square: $(8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(8, -8)$.

The convex polygon is the union of the two squares, so it is a 4x4 square. The area of this square is $4^2 = 16$. The answer is: $16$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The expression $A = ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ equals zero if and only if at least one of the factors equals zero. This gives us four conditions:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ which implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ which implies $\vert y \vert = 8$.

Each of these conditions defines a square on the coordinate plane. The first two conditions give squares with side length 20, and the last two conditions give squares with side length 16. The intersection of these squares is a square with side length 8, which is the convex polygon we are looking for.

The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$. So, the area of the convex polygon is 64. The answer is: $64$

Assistant:


The given equation is equal to zero if and only if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
From $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
Similarly, from $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
And from $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$, which implies $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
And from $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.
By combining these conditions, we find that the points $(x, y)$ must satisfy one of the following sets of equations:
1) $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, which gives $x = 10$ and $y = 0$.
2) $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$, which gives $x = 0$ and $y = 10$.
3) $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$, which gives $x = -10$ and $y = 0$.
4) $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$, which gives $x = 0$ and $y = -10$.
5) $x = 8$ and $y = 8$.
6) $x = 8$ and $y = -8$.
7) $x = -8$ and $y = 8$.
8) $x = -8$ and $y = -8$.
The points $(x, y)$ that satisfy these conditions form a square with side length $20$. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.
The answer is: $400$

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, we need to understand that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if and only if either $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$ or $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

2. The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of a square with side length 10.

3. The equation $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of a square with side length 16.

4. Therefore, the points satisfying the original equation are the vertices of two squares: one with side length 10 and the other with side length 16.

5. The area of a square with side length $a$ is $a^2$. Therefore, the area of the square with side length 10 is $10^2 = 100$ and the area of the square with side length 16 is $16^2 = 256$.

6. The convex polygon enclosed by the points is the union of these two squares. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares, which is $100 + 256 = 356$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 356. The answer is: $356$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is given as 
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]

This equation is equal to zero if either of the two factors is equal to zero. Therefore, we have two sets of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first set of equations, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$. This implies that $-10 \leq x + y \leq 10$ and $-8 \leq x \leq 8$. Similarly, for the second set of equations, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $-10 \leq x - y \leq 10$ and $-8 \leq y \leq 8$.

These four inequalities define a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.
2. The first term is zero when either $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which simplifies to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two lines in the plane.
3. The second term is zero when either $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which simplifies to $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two lines in the plane.
4. The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 16.
5. To find the area of the square, we simply square the length of its side, which gives $16^2 = 256$.

Now let's write a Python script to calculate the area:

```python
