The equation $A \cdot B = 0$ is equivalent to $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. 

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$, which form a rectangle with vertices at $(0, 10), (10, 0), (0, -10)$ and $(-10, 0)$. 

The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This forms a square with vertices at $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8)$ and $(-8, -8)$. 

The convex polygon formed by the intersection of the two figures is the intersection of the rectangle and the square, which is another square with side length $10$. 

The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $100$. The answer is: $100$
=======
Approach:



The equation is $ ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$

This equation equals to 0 if either of the two factors equals to 0.

Therefore, we have:

1) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or
2) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first equation, both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ cannot be negative, therefore, they must equal to 0. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. Solving these equations gives us the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

For the second equation, both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2$ cannot be negative, therefore, they must equal to 0. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. Solving these equations gives us the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The lines form a square with side length 10, therefore, the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$

<<<<<<< HEAD

If the product of two numbers is zero, then at least one of the numbers must be zero. Therefore, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The only way for the square of an absolute value to be equal to zero is if the absolute value itself is zero. So, we have the following possibilities:
1. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$, which gives $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, or $x + y = \pm 10$.
2. $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which gives $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, or $x - y = \pm 10$.
3. $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$, which gives $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $x = \pm 8$.
4. $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which gives $\vert y \vert = 8$, or $y = \pm 8$.
These conditions form a square with vertices at $(8,8)$, $(-8,8)$, $(-8,-8)$, and $(8,-8)$.
The length of each side of the square is 16 (since the distance between $(8,8)$ and $(-8,8)$ is 16), so the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.
The area of the convex polygon formed by the solutions is 256.
The answer is: $256$

 The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This results in the four lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.
Similarly, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which results in the four lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.
The intersection of these lines form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, notice that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Thus, we have two cases to consider:
1. Either $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$, or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. Both equations are equal to zero.
For the first case, we have:
$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
The solutions to these absolute value equations are all the points $(x, y)$ that lie on a square with side length 20 centered at the origin.

For the second case, we have:
$(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The solutions to these absolute value equations are all the points $(x, y)$ that lie on a square with side length 16 centered at the origin.

The intersection of these two regions is the convex polygon formed by the intersection of the two squares. The side length of the smaller square is 16, and the side length of the larger square is 20, so the polygon formed by their intersection is a square with side length equal to the difference of their side lengths, which is $20 - 16 = 4$. The area of this square is $4^2 = 16$. The answer is: $16$

Assistant:

Approach:


The given equation is of the form $(A)(B) = 0$, which implies either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. We consider both cases.

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.

This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these equations are all the points $(x, y)$ that lie on the square with vertices $(0, 10), (10, 0), (0, -10)$ and $(-10, 0)$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

This implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are all the points $(x, y)$ that lie on the square with vertices $(8, 8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$ and $(8, -8)$.

The convex polygon enclosed by the points satisfying the given equation is the intersection of the two squares, which is also a square. The side length of this square is the shorter of the two side lengths of the original squares, which is 10. Therefore, the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, notice that the expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These equations give us four lines: $x + y = \pm10$ and $x - y = \pm10$.
Similarly, if $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These equations give us four lines: $x = \pm8$ and $y = \pm8$.
The intersection of these lines form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $\boxed{256}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The product of two factors equals zero if and only if at least one of the factors is zero. Thus, the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
For the first case, we have $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This can only be true if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These equations represent the equations of two lines, so the set of points that satisfy them form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.
For the second case, we have $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This can only be true if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These equations represent the equations of two circles, so the set of points that satisfy them form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
The intersection of these two regions is empty, so the region enclosed by the points satisfying the original equation is the union of the two regions. Therefore, the area of this convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two regions, which is $100 + 256 = 356$.
The answer is: $356$.

1. First, we recognize that the equation is the product of two expressions equal to zero, which means that either one of the expressions must be zero for the equation to hold. So we have two cases:

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression is equal to zero if either the first term or the second term is equal to zero. This gives us two sets of conditions:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first set of conditions:

- $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$.
- $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$.
- $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = \pm 8$.

The intersections of these conditions are $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$.

For the second set of conditions:
=======
   Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
   Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

2. For Case 1, the expressions $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ are both squares, so they are both non-negative. Their sum being zero means that both of them must be zero, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This results in a square with side length 10.

3. For Case 2, the expressions $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2$ are both squares, so they are both non-negative. Their sum being zero means that both of them must be zero, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This results in a square with side length 16.

4. The polygon formed by the points that satisfy the equation is the intersection of the two squares. This intersection is another square, whose side length is the minimum of the side lengths of the two squares. Therefore, the side length of the intersection square is 10.

5. The area of a square is given by the square of its side length. So the area of the intersection square is $10^2 = 100$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points satisfying the equation is 100. The answer is: $100$
>>>>>>> 6f0b69cb07fbcd5ccae9b1688198c8331f697675

- $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = \pm 10$.
- $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$.
- $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = \pm 8$.

The intersections of these conditions are $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$.

All these points lie on a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{256}$. The answer is: $\boxed{256}$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The given equation is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. The product of two factors is zero if and only if at least one of the factors is zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these two equations are the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle with sides of length $20$ and $10\sqrt{2}$, so the area of this rectangle is $20 \times 10\sqrt{2} = 200\sqrt{2}$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = 8$ or $x = -8$, and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length $16$, so the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon formed by the intersection of the points satisfying the given equation is the sum of the areas of the rectangle and the square, which is $200\sqrt{2} + 256$. However, this number is not a positive numerical value.

We must have made a mistake in our calculation. Let's reevaluate the areas of the rectangle and the square.

For the rectangle:
The sides have length $20$ and $10\sqrt{2}$, so the area is indeed $200\sqrt{2}$.

For the square:
The side length is $16$, so the area is indeed $256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is indeed $200\sqrt{2} + 256$. However, this number is not a positive numerical value, so there must be another mistake.

We re-examined our calculations and discovered that we made an error in the calculation of the area of the rectangle. The side lengths of the rectangle are actually $10\sqrt{2}$ and $20$, so the area should be $200\sqrt{2}$. However, this does not change the sum of the areas of the rectangle and the square, which still equals $200\sqrt{2} + 256$.

To find the numerical value of this sum, we can use a calculator: $200\sqrt{2} + 256 \approx 448$.
The value of the area of the convex polygon is 448 square units. The answer is: 448

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The expression equals zero if either of the two factors is zero.
So, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
For $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$.
This gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.
For $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
This also gives us four lines: $x - y = 10$, $x - y = -10$, $x + y = 10$, and $x + y = -10$.
For $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$.
This gives us two lines: $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.
For $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert y \vert = 8$.
This also gives us two lines: $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.
Combining all these lines, we see that the points that satisfy the equation form a square with side length 16.
The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
So the area of the convex polygon is 256.
The answer is: $256$.
