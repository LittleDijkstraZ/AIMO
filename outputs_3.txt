The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

<<<<<<< HEAD
The first term is zero when $|\pm x \pm y| - 10 = 0$, which implies $|\pm x \pm y| = 10$. This equation represents a square with side length 20.

The second term is zero when $|\pm x| - 8 = 0$ or $|\pm y| - 8 = 0$, which implies $|\pm x| = 8$ or $|\pm y| = 8$. This equation represents a square with side length 16.

The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon that encloses the points that satisfy the equation. This convex polygon is a square with side length 8 (the smaller square).

The area of a square is given by the square of its side length. So, the area of the convex polygon is $8^2 = 64$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 64 square units. The answer is: $64$

The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. Therefore, the equation is satisfied if either of the terms is zero. 

The solutions of the equation $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ are the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$. 

The solutions of the equation $|x - y| - 10 = 0$ are the lines $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$. 

The solutions of the equation $|x| - 8 = 0$ are the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$. 

The solutions of the equation $|y| - 8 = 0$ are the lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$. 

The lines form a cross, and the enclosed area is a square with side length 16. Therefore, the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. So, the answer is $256$. The script to solve this problem is not needed as it is a simple mathematical problem and the answer can be directly calculated.
The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The expression $AB=0$ is true if and only if $A=0$ or $B=0$. So, the given equation is satisfied if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = \pm 10$.
From $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x - y = \pm 10$.
From $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert x \vert = 8$, which implies $x = \pm 8$.
From $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $y = \pm 8$.

These equations represent a square with side length 16 (since the distance between the lines $x + y = \pm 10$ is 16, and similarly for the other three lines).

The area of a square with side length $s$ is $s^2$. Therefore, the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.
Solving these equations gives us the four lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.
Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
So the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$ are also the sides of the polygon.
These eight lines form a square with side length 10, since the distance between the parallel lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$ is 10 (by setting $y = 0$ and solving for $x$), and similarly for the other two pairs of parallel lines.
Therefore, the area of the square is $10 \times 10 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

Assistant:

 The given equation is $0$ if and only if both the factors are $0$.
The factors are $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2$.
For the first factor to be $0$, we need $\vert x + y \vert = 10$.
This represents a square with side length $20$ centered at the origin.
For the second factor to be $0$, we need $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
This represents a square with side length $16$ centered at the origin.
The intersection of these two squares is a smaller square with side length $16 - 8 = 8$ centered at the origin.
The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $64$. The answer is: $64$.

<<<<<<< HEAD

The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero, the second term is zero, or both are zero.

The first term is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, and this equals to zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$, which gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

The second term is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$, and this equals to zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$, which gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 10 (the distance between the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$ or $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$). The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 100.

The python code to compute this is:
=======
The given equation is a product of two expressions, each of which must be equal to zero in order for the product to be zero. Therefore, we have two separate cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

For the second case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersection of these lines form a square with side length 10 (since the distance between $x = 8$ and $x = -8$ is 16, and the distance between $y = 8$ and $y = -8$ is 16 as well, and the distance between $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$ is 20, and the distance between $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$ is 20 as well). The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100.

To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

In order for the product of two terms to be zero, either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. This gives us two separate cases to consider.

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
This equation can only be true if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations gives us the vertices of the polygon.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This equation can only be true if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these four equations gives us the vertices of the polygon.

By analyzing both cases, we find that the polygon is a square with side length 16. To find the area of the square, we simply square the side length, which gives us $16^2 = 256$. So the area of the polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, let's understand the problem. We are given an equation and we are asked to find the area of the region that it encloses.
2. The equation is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
3. This equation is equal to zero if and only if both terms are equal to zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
4. Each of these equations implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
5. These equations represent four lines in the plane: $x + y = \pm 10$, $x - y = \pm 10$, $x = \pm 8$, and $y = \pm 8$.
6. The intersections of these lines form a rectangle with side lengths of 16 and 20.
7. The area of this rectangle is $16 \times 20 = 320$.

So the area of the region enclosed by the equation is 320. The answer is: $320$

1. First, we notice that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to the system of equations:
   $$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0,$$
   $$(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0,$$
   $$(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0,$$
   $$(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0.$$

2. Each of these equations implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

3. Solving these equations, we get four pairs of $(x, y)$: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$. These points are the vertices of a square with side length 16.

4. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256.

=======
1. First, we notice that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Thus, we have two cases:

   a) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
   b) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

2. From the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that all points $(x, y)$ satisfying these equations are at a distance of 10 from the line $x + y = 0$ or $x - y = 0$. These lines are the bisectors of the angles formed by the coordinate axes. Therefore, all points $(x, y)$ satisfying the first case are at a distance of 10 from one of these bisectors.

3. From the second case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that all points $(x, y)$ satisfying these equations are at a distance of 8 from the x-axis or y-axis. Therefore, all points $(x, y)$ satisfying the second case are at a distance of 8 from one of the coordinate axes.

4. The intersection of the regions defined by the above conditions is a square with side length 16 (since the square with side length 10 centered at the origin is entirely contained in the square with side length 16). Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$.

=======
The expression $A \cdot B = 0$ is equivalent to saying that at least one of the expressions $A$ or $B$ is equal to zero. Hence we have two separate cases to consider:
1) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, and
2) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first case, we have:

1) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.

This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

This gives us the following four equations:

1. $x + y = 10$
2. $x + y = -10$
3. $x - y = 10$
4. $x - y = -10$

The solutions to these equations give us the vertices of the square.

For the second case, we have:

2) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

This gives us the following four equations:

5. $x = 8$
6. $x = -8$
7. $y = 8$
8. $y = -8$

The solutions to these equations give us the vertices of the square.

Now we have the vertices of the square, we can calculate its area. The side length of the square is the maximum of the absolute values of the coordinates of the vertices, which is 10 (from the first case). Hence, the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$
