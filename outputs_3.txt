Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The condition $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only way both equalities can hold is if $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$.

Similarly, the condition $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

The solution to the problem consists of the intersection of these two conditions, which gives us a square with side length 10 (the maximum of $|x|$ and $|y|$) centered at the origin. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. 

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solve, simplify

def area_of_polygon():
    # The side length of the square
    side_length = 10

    # Calculate the area of the square
    area = side_length ** 2

    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

100

The area of the convex polygon is $100$ square units. The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The equation is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. We need to find the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy this equation. The product of two factors equals zero if and only if at least one of the factors is zero. So we have two cases to consider:
   a) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
   b) $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. For case a), we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us the points $(8, 2), (8, -2), (2, 8), (-2, 8), (2, -8), (-2, -8), (0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0)$.
3. For case b), we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us the same points as in case a).
4. Therefore, the points that satisfy the equation are exactly the points we found in step 2. These points form a square with side length 10.
5. To find the area of this square, we use the formula $A = \text{side}^2$. The side length is 10, so the area is $A = 10^2 = 100$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $f(x, y) = (\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ has the property that $f(x, y) = 0$ if and only if $(x, y)$ is one of the four vertices of a square with side length 16. The square has vertices at $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8),$ and $(-8, -8)$. Therefore, the enclosed region is a square of side length 16.

The area of the square is the side length squared, so the area is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that both $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which can only happen if $x = y = \pm 10$ or $x = -y = \pm 10$. These give us the coordinates $(10,10)$, $(10,-10)$, $(-10,10)$, $(-10,-10)$.

Similarly, the expression $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that both $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which can only happen if $x = y = \pm 8$ or $x = -y = \pm 8$. These give us the coordinates $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, $(-8,-8)$.

The convex polygon formed by the intersection of these points is a square with side length $20$. To find its area, we simply square the side length: $20^2 = 400$.

The answer is: $400$

Since the area is 0, it means that the polygon is a degenerate case (a single point). However, the problem seems to be intended to form a polygon. Let's analyze the problem again.

The expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This forms a square with side length 20 centered at the origin.

Similarly, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which forms a square with side length 16 centered at the origin.

The intersection of these two squares is another square, which is the convex polygon we are looking for. The side length of this square is the minimum of the side lengths of the two squares, which is 8. So the area of the convex polygon is $8^2 = 64$.

However, this doesn't seem to be the answer the problem is expecting. Let's reconsider the problem.

The expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This forms a square with side length 20 centered at the origin.

Similarly, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which forms a square with side length 16 centered at the origin.

The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for. The convex polygon is the smaller square inscribed in the larger square. The side length of the smaller square is the difference of the side lengths of the two squares divided by 2, which is $20 - 16/2 = 12$. So the area of the convex polygon is $12^2 = 144$.

However, this still doesn't seem to be the answer the problem is expecting. Let's reconsider the problem again.

The expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This forms a square with side length 20 centered at the origin.

Similarly, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which forms a square with side length 16 centered at the origin.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

 The given equation is equal to zero, which means that either the first expression in the parentheses is zero or the second expression in the parentheses is zero or both are zero.
If the first expression in the parentheses is zero, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.
Solving these equations, we get four lines: $y = -x + 10$, $y = -x - 10$, $y = x + 10$, and $y = x - 10$.
Similarly, if the second expression in the parentheses is zero, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
Solving these equations, we get four lines: $y = 8$, $y = -8$, $x = 8$, and $x = -8$.
These lines enclose a rectangle with side lengths of 16 and 20.
To find the area of this rectangle, we multiply the side lengths: $16 \times 20 = 320$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 320 square units.
The answer is: $320$

 The given equation is a product of two expressions, and for the product to be zero, at least one of the expressions must be zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From case 1, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that either $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$, or $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$. These are the equations of four lines.

From case 2, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that either $x = 8$ or $x = -8$, or $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. These are the equations of four more lines.

The intersection of these lines form a square with side length 16. Therefore, the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$

The equation is equivalent to two cases: either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, or either $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The first case gives us $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which represents a square with side length 20 centered at the origin. The second case gives us $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which also represents a square with side length 20 centered at the origin.

The third case gives us $\vert x \vert = 8$, which represents a square with side length 16 centered at the origin. The fourth case gives us $\vert y \vert = 8$, which also represents a square with side length 16 centered at the origin.

The intersection of all these squares forms a square with side length 16, which is the convex polygon. Therefore, the area of this convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of them is zero. Hence we have either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This gives us the following system of equations:

1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$
2. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$
3. $\vert x \vert = 8$
4. $\vert y \vert = 8$

From 3. and 4., we get four points: $(8, 0)$, $(8, 0)$, $(-8, 0)$ and $(0, 8)$ and $(-8, 0)$.

For the remaining points we can use 1. and 2.

1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ gives us two equations: $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.
2. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ gives us two equations: $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.

By solving these eight equations we get the vertices of the polygon:

$(8, 0)$, $(8, 0)$, $(-8, 0)$ and $(0, 8)$ and $(-8, 0)$, $(0, -8)$ and $(-8, 8)$ and $(8, -8)$.

The polygon is an octagon, and its area can be calculated using the formula for the area of a square and the area of a triangle. The side length of the square is 16, so its area is $16^2 = 256$. There are four right triangles with legs of length 8, so the total area of the triangles is $4 \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot 8 \cdot 8 = 128$. Hence the area of the octagon is $256 - 128 = 128$. However, this is the area of the octagon in the first quadrant, and we need to consider all eight quadrants. Therefore, the total area of the octagon is $8 \cdot 128 = 1024$.

So, the area of the polygon is 1024.

Note that this problem can also be solved using Python and the `sympy` library, but for this specific problem, it's easier to solve it manually and get the numerical answer. Here is the Python code to solve it using the sympy library:

```python

    eq4 = Eq(abs(y) - 8, 0)

```

However, this method is too complicated and time-consuming to find the area of the octagon manually. Instead, the analytical method is much easier to solve this problem. The area of the octagon is $1024$. The answer is: $\boxed{1024}$.

1. The given equation is a product of two terms equals to 0. So one of the terms must be 0. This implies that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

2. For each of the terms to be 0, it means that $|x + y| = 10$, $|x - y| = 10$, $|x| = 8$, or $|y| = 8$. 

3. These conditions represent four lines in a plane, forming a rectangle with sides of length 16 and 20. 

4. The area of this rectangle is $16 \times 20 = 320$. So, the area of the convex polygon is 320.

Now, let's write the Python code to calculate the area:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def calculate_area():
    # The sides of the rectangle
    length = 16
    width = 20

    # Calculate the area
    area = length * width

    return area

result = calculate_area()
print(result)
```

320

CODE RESULTS 320

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
320
```
The area of the convex polygon is 320 square units.
The answer is $\boxed{320}$.

## QUESTION 3 - 10 
- TIME_SPENT : 659 secs

10_User:

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, notice that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, we can set each factor in the product equal to zero and solve for the points that satisfy the equation.

The first factor is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$. This means that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. 

The second factor is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. This means that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

Now let's solve each set of equations:

1) For the first set of equations:
$\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
The solutions for these equations are the points $(x, y)$ that form a square with side length 10. The vertices of this square are $(5, 5), (5, -5), (-5, 5),$ and $(-5, -5)$.

2) For the second set of equations:
$\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The solutions for these equations are the points $(x, y)$ that form a square with side length 16. The vertices of this square are $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8),$ and $(-8, -8)$.

Now we need to find the intersection of the solutions from the first and second sets of equations. The intersection is the square with side length 10, which is the smaller square enclosed by the larger square.

The area of the smaller square is $10^2 = 100$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units.
The answer is: $100$
