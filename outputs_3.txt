Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, we can see that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, -2)$, and $(-8, 2)$.

The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$.

The vertices of the polygon are the intersections of these squares, which form a larger square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$. The area of this square is $(10\sqrt{2})^2 = 200$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 200.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import sqrt

def polygon_area():
    # Side length of the square
    side_length = 10 * sqrt(2)

    # Area of the square
    area = side_length**2

    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

200

CODE RESULTS 200

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
200
```
The area of the convex polygon is $200$. The answer is: $200$

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. This expression equals zero if and only if both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these equations are all points of the form $(x, y)$ where the distance from the origin to $(x, y)$ is 10. This is the equation of a circle centered at the origin with radius 10.

The second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. This expression equals zero if and only if both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are all points of the form $(x, y)$ where the distance from $(x, y)$ to the origin is 8. This is the equation of a circle centered at the origin with radius 8.

The intersection of these two circles is a square with side length 16 (since the difference in the radii of the two circles is 2, and the side length of the square is twice the radius of the smaller circle). The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    side_length = 2 * 8  # The side length of the square is twice the radius of the smaller circle
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

256

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is $\boxed{256}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ will be zero only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm10$ and $x - y = \pm10$. Solving these equations, we get four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

2. Similarly, the expression $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ will be zero only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm8$ and $y = \pm8$. So we get four more lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

3. These eight lines enclose a rectangle with vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(8, -8)$.

4. The area of this rectangle is the product of its side lengths, which are both 16. So the area is $16 \times 16 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

1. The expression $ ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ will be zero if either of the two factors are zero.

2. Each of the factors is a sum of squares, which will be zero if and only if each term is zero. This gives us four systems of equations to solve:

   a. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$
   
   b. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$
   
   c. $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$
   
   d. $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$

3. Solving each of these systems of equations, we find the vertices of the polygon:

   a. $(x, y) = (0, 0)$
   
   b. $(x, y) = (8, 8)$
   
   c. $(x, y) = (-8, 8)$
   
   d. $(x, y) = (8, -8)$
   
   e. $(x, y) = (-8, -8)$

4. The polygon is a square with side length 16. Its area is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$
