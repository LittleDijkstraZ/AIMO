**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let \[f(x) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
-x + 3 & \text{if } x \le 0, \\
2x - 5 & \text{if } x > 0.
\end{array}
\right.\]How many solutions does the equation $f(f(x)) = 4$ have?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
To solve the equation $f(f(x)) = 4,$ we first find the values $x$ such that $f(x) = 4.$

Either $f(x) = -x + 3$ (for $x \le 0$) or $f(x) = 2x - 5$ (for $x > 0$). If $-x + 3 = 4,$ then $x = -1.$ Note that this value satisfies $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = 4,$ then $x = 9/2.$ Note that this value satisfies $x > 0.$ Therefore, the solutions to $f(x) = 4$ are $x = -1$ and $x = 9/2.$

Next, we solve for the values $x$ such that $f(x) = -1.$ If $-x + 3 = -1,$ then $x = 4.$ This value does not satisfy $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = -1,$ then $x = 2.$ This value satisfies $x > 0.$

Finally, we solve for the values $x$ such that $f(x) = 9/2.$ If $-x + 3 = 9/2,$ then $x = -3/2.$ This value satisfies $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = 9/2,$ then $x = 19/4.$ This value satisfies $x > 0.$

Therefore, the equation $f(f(x)) = 4$ has the solutions $x = 2,$ $-3/2,$ and $19/4,$ for a total of $\boxed{3}$ solutions. The answer is $\boxed{3}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $2$, i.e., $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Multiplying through by $100$ gives $100 < m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are precisely the integers from $101$ to $199$, inclusive. To find the number of these integers, we subtract the smallest integer from the largest and add $1$. So the number of positive integers $m$ is $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def count_m():
    """For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"""
    m_min = 100
    m_max = 200
    count = m_max - m_min
    return count

result = count_m()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 100

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
100
```
The number of positive integers $m$ is $100$. However, this result indicates that there are $100$ integers from $101$ to $200$, but we need to consider that the problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$, not the number of integers from a specific range. Therefore, we need to add $1$ to the result to account for the integer $100$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def count_m_corrected():
    """For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"""
    m_min = 100
    m_max = 200
    count = m_max - m_min + 1
    return count

result = count_m_corrected()
print(result)
``````output

CODE RESULTS 101

INTERMEDIATE OUT :

101
```
The number of positive integers $m$ that make the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have $4$ distinct solutions is $101$.
The answer is: $101$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many solutions does the equation \[\frac{(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)\dotsm(x-100)}{(x-1^2)(x-2^2)(x-3^2)\dotsm(x-100^2)} = 0\]have for $x$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Any solution to this equation must make the numerator of the left-hand side zero, while keeping the denominator non-zero. The numerator is zero when $x$ is one of the numbers $1, 2, 3, \dots, 100.$ However, for any value in this list that is a perfect square, the denominator will also be zero, so that value of $x$ will not be a root. Therefore, we want to find the number of integers in the list $1, 2, \dots, 100$ which are not perfect squares. The perfect squares in the list are $1^2, 2^2, \dots, 10^2,$ so there are $10$ perfect squares, and \[100 - 10 = \boxed{90}\]integers which are not perfect squares. The answer is $\boxed{90}$

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly four distinct solutions. 

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is equivalent to the system of equations $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.

For each of these equations, we can split the absolute value into two cases: $x-1 -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $-(x-1) -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, and $x-1 -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$ and $-(x-1) -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.

This gives us a total of four equations to solve:
1. $x-3 = \frac{m}{100}$
2. $1-x = \frac{m}{100}$
3. $x-3 = -\frac{m}{100}$
4. $1-x = -\frac{m}{100}$

Solving these equations gives us the four solutions:
1. $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$
2. $x = 1 - \frac{m}{100}$
3. $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$
4. $x = 1 + \frac{m}{100}$

For the equation to have exactly four distinct solutions, the four values of $x$ must be distinct. This gives us the following system of inequalities:
1. $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq 1 - \frac{m}{100}$
2. $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq 3 - \frac{m}{100}$
3. $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq 1 + \frac{m}{100}$
4. $1 - \frac{m}{100} \neq 3 - \frac{m}{100}$
5. $1 - \frac{m}{100} \neq 1 + \frac{m}{100}$
6. $3 - \frac{m}{100} \neq 1 + \frac{m}{100}$

Solving this system of inequalities gives us $1 < m < 100$. The number of positive integers in this range is $99$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly four distinct solutions is $99$. The answer is: $99$

## QUESTION 2 - 5

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"For certain ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ of real numbers, the system of equations
\[\begin{aligned} ax+by&=1 \\ x^2 + y^2 &= 50  \end{aligned}\]has at least one solution, and each solution is an ordered pair $(x,y)\,$ of integers. How many such ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ are there?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The graph of $ax+by=1$ is a line, while the graph of $x^2+y^2=50$ is a circle centered at the origin. Therefore, $(a, b)$ satisfies the conditions if and only if the line and circle intersect at least once, and they intersect only at lattice points (points with integer coordinates).

Knowing this, it makes sense to look for lattice points on the circle whose equation is $x^2+y^2=50$. Testing cases, we find that there are twelve lattice points on the circle: $(\pm 1, \pm 7)$, $(\pm 7, \pm 1)$, and $(\pm 5, \pm 5)$ (where the two $\pm$ signs in each pair are independent of each other).

There are $\tbinom{12}{2} = 66$ pairs of these points, and each pair determines a line. However, the graph of $ax+by=1$ can never pass through the origin $(0, 0)$, since if $x=y=0$, then $ax+by=0 \neq 1$. Therefore, the six pairs which consist of diametrically opposed points are invalid, since the line through them passes through the origin. This corrects our count to $66 - 6 = 60$.

In addition, for each of the twelve points, there is a line tangent to the circle at that point, so that the only solution to the system is that one point. This brings the final total to $60 + 12 = \boxed{72}$. The answer is $\boxed{72}$

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions.

First, we can observe that the right-hand side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be positive, so $m$ must be a positive integer.

Next, we can analyze the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. The expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is equal to 0 when $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$, which gives us two cases: $x-1 = 2$ or $x-1 = -2$. Solving these gives $x = 3$ or $x = -1$.

Now, we want the expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ to be equal to $\frac{m}{100}$. This means that the distance between $x$ and the points $3$ and $-1$ must be $\frac{m}{100}$. Since the distance between $3$ and $-1$ is $4$, we must have $\frac{m}{100} = 1$. This gives us $m = 100$.

So, the only value of $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is $m = 100$. Therefore, the number of such positive integers $m$ is $1$. The answer is: $1$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many integers are solutions to the equation $$(x-2)^{(25-x^2)}=1?$$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
We need some basic facts from number theory: $a^0 = 1$ for any $a,$ $1^b = 1$ for any $b,$ and $(-1)^c = 1$ if $c$ is an even integer. Unless the base is a complex number (which is excluded since we are looking for integer solutions), there are no other ways to get an RHS of $1.$ Thus, either the exponent is zero $($giving the equation $25 - x^2 = 0),$ the base is $1$ $($giving $x -2 = 1),$ or the base is $-1$ and the exponent is even $($giving the simultaneous equations $x - 2 = -1$ and $25 - x^2 = 2n$ for some integer $n).$ Solving the first equation gives $x = \pm 5,$ and solving the second gives $x = 3.$ The third equation implies that $x = 1,$ in which case $25 - x^2 = 24$ is indeed even, so $x = 1$ is a valid solution. In all, there are $\boxed{4}$ integer solutions. The answer is $\boxed{4}$

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we can start by analyzing the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.
This equation has 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is an integer between 1 and 2 (inclusive).
So we need to find the number of integers $m$ such that $1 \leq \frac{m}{100} \leq 2$.
Multiplying all sides of the inequalities by 100, we get $100 \leq m \leq 200$.
The number of integers in this range is $200 - 100 + 1 = 101$.
Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 101.
The answer is: $101$

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $2$. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a graph that is a series of V-shapes, with the $i$-th "V" being at $x=i$, and the height of each "V" being $1$. Therefore, the equation has $4$ distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $2$, or equivalently, $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. This gives $100 < m < 200$, so the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy this condition is $200 - 100 - 1 = 99$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $99$. The answer is: $\boxed{99}$

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The number of distinct solutions to the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $4$ if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $2$. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a graph that is a series of V-shapes, with the $i$-th "V" being defined by the interval $[i-1, i+1]$. So for $\frac{m}{100}$ to have $4$ distinct solutions, it must be strictly between $1$ and $2$. This means $\frac{m}{100}$ must be in the interval $(1, 2)$, or equivalently, $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Multiplying all sides of the inequalities by $100$ gives $100 < m < 200$. The number of positive integers $m$ in this interval is $200 - 100 - 1 = 99$. So there are $99$ positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. The answer is $\boxed{99}$.

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The number of solutions of the equation depends on the value of $m$. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 1 and 2. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ oscillates between 1 and 2 as $x$ varies over the real numbers. Therefore, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be strictly between 1 and 2 for the equation to have 4 distinct solutions. This means $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, or equivalently, $100 < m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are exactly the integers from 101 to 199, inclusive. To count the number of such integers, we subtract the smallest integer from the largest and add 1. So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$. The answer is: $\boxed{99}$
