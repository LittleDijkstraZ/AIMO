**Problem:** 
"What is the minimum value of the expression $x^2+y^2+2x-4y+8$ for real $x$ and $y$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Rearranging the expression, we have  \[x^2+2x+y^2-4y+8\]Completing the square in $x$, we need to add and subtract $(2/2)^2=1$. Completing the square in $y$, we need to add and subtract $(4/2)^2=4$. Thus, we have \[(x^2+2x+1)-1+(y^2-4y+4)-4+8 \Rightarrow (x+1)^2+(y-2)^2+3\]Since the minimum value of $(x+1)^2$ and $(y-2)^2$ is $0$ (perfect squares can never be negative), the minimum value of the entire expression is $\boxed{3}$, and is achieved when $x=-1$ and $y=2$. The answer is $\boxed{3}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
**Problem**
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


This problem is a bit tricky to solve directly. However, we can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to solve it.

The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states that for any real numbers $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$ and $b_1, b_2, ..., b_n$, we have:
\[(a_1^2 + a_2^2 + ... + a_n^2)(b_1^2 + b_2^2 + ... + b_n^2) \geq (a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 + ... + a_nb_n)^2.\]

Let's apply the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to the given problem. Let $a_1 = x$, $a_2 = y$, $b_1 = 1$, and $b_2 = -2$. Then we have:
\[(x^2 + y^2)(1^2 + (-2)^2) \geq (x - 2y)^2.\]
Simplifying the left side gives:
\[(x^2 + y^2)(1 + 4) \geq (x - 2y)^2 \Rightarrow 5(x^2 + y^2) \geq (x - 2y)^2.\]

Now, let's look at the other condition: $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. By the triangle inequality, we have:
\[|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |(x-2y) - (y-2x)| = |x - 2y - y + 2x| = |3x - 3y| = 3|x - y| = 40.\]
So, we have $3|x - y| = 40$, which implies $|x - y| = \frac{40}{3}$.

Now, let's substitute this into the inequality we derived from the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality:
\[5(x^2 + y^2) \geq \left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{1600}{9}.\]

Finally, let's look at the expression we want to minimize: $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$. We can rewrite this as:
\[5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy = 5(x^2 + y^2) - 4(2xy) = 5(x^2 + y^2) - 4[(x+y)^2 - (x^2 + y^2)] = 9(x^2 + y^2) - 4(x+y)^2.\]

By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we know that $5(x^2 + y^2) \geq \frac{1600}{9}$, so $x^2 + y^2 \geq \frac{1600}{45}$.

Also, by the triangle inequality, we have $(x+y)^2 \leq (|x| + |y|)^2 \leq (|x - 2y| + |2x - y|)^2 = 40^2 = 1600$. So, $(x+y)^2 \leq 1600$.

Therefore, we have:
\[9(x^2 + y^2) - 4(x+y)^2 \geq 9\left(\frac{1600}{45}\right) - 4(1600) = \frac{14400}{45} - 6400 = \frac{14400 - 288000}{45} = -\frac{273600}{45} = -\frac{54720}{9}.\]

However, this result is not possible because the expression we want to minimize is clearly non-negative. So, we must have made a mistake somewhere.

Let's go back and re-examine the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. We applied it incorrectly. The correct application should be:
\[(x^2 + y^2)(1^2 + (-2)^2) \geq (x - 2y)^2 \Rightarrow 5(x^2 + y^2) \geq (2y - x)^2.\]
And the other condition should be $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. By the triangle inequality, we have:
\[|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |(x-2y) + (y-2x)| = |-x + y| = |y - x| = 40.\]
So, we have $|y - x| = 40$, which implies $y - x = \pm 40$.

Now, let's substitute this into the inequality we derived from the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality:
\[5(x^2 + y^2) \geq (2y - x)^2 = (y - x + y)^2 = (40 \pm y)^2 = 1600 \pm 80y + y^2.\]

Now, let's look at the expression we want to minimize: $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$. We can rewrite this as:
\[5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy = 5(x^2 + y^2) - 4(2xy) = 5(x^2 + y^2) - 4[(x-y)^2 - (x^2 - y^2)] = 9(x^2 + y^2) - 4(x-y)^2.\]

By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we know that $5(x^2 + y^2) \geq 1600 \pm 80y + y^2$, so $x^2 + y^2 \geq \frac{1600 \pm 80y + y^2}{5}$.

Also, by the triangle inequality, we have $(x-y)^2 \leq (|x| - |y|)^2 \leq (|x - 2y| + |2x - y|)^2 = 40^2 = 1600$. So, $(x-y)^2 \leq 1600$.

Therefore, we have:
\[9(x^2 + y^2) - 4(x-y)^2 \geq 9\left(\frac{1600 \pm 80y + y^2}{5}\right) - 4(1600) = \frac{14400 \pm 720y + 9y^2}{5} - 6400 = \frac{14400 \pm 720y + 9y^2 - 32000}{5} = \frac{14400 \pm 720y - 18400 + 9y^2}{5} = \frac{14400 \pm 720y - 18400 + 9y^2}{5} = \frac{-4000 \pm 720y + 9y^2}{5}.\]

This expression is minimized when $y = 0$, and the minimum value is $-\frac{4000}{5} = -800$. However, this result is not possible because the expression we want to minimize is clearly non-negative. So, we must have made another mistake somewhere.

Let's go back and re-examine the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality again. We applied it incorrectly. The correct application should be:
\[(x^2 + y^2)(1^2 + (-2)^2) \geq (x - 2y)^2 \Rightarrow 5(x^2 + y^2) \geq (2y - x)^2.\]
And the other condition
