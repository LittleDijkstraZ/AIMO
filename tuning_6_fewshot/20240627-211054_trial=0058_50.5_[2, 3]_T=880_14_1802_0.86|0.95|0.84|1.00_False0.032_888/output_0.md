**Problem:** 
"The graph of the quadratic $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ is a parabola that passes through the points $(-1,7)$, $(5,7)$, and $(6,10)$.  What is the $x$-coordinate of the vertex of the parabola?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
We could substitute the points into the equation $y = ax^2 + bx + c$, solve for $a$, $b$, and $c$, and then complete the square to find the coordinates of the vertex.

However, a much faster way is to recognize that two of the points, namely $(-1,7)$ and $(5,7)$, have the same $y$-coordinate.  Therefore, these two points are symmetric about the parabola's axis of symmetry.  The axis must pass through the midpoint of the segment connecting these two symmetric points, so the axis must pass through $\left(\frac{-1+5}{2},\frac{7+7}{2}\right)$, which is $(2,7)$.  Therefore, the axis of symmetry is a vertical line through $(2,7)$.  This line is the graph of the equation $x=2$.  The axis of symmetry also passes through the vertex of the parabola, so the $x$-coordinate of the vertex is $\boxed{2}$. The answer is $\boxed{2}$

**Problem**
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"

First, let's find the $x$-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$. Since the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$, we can set $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$ and solve for $x$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"The graph of $y=ax^2 + bx + c$ is a parabola with vertical axis of symmetry.  The vertex of this parabola is $(2,3)$ and the parabola contains the point $(4,4)$.  Find the value of $y$ when $x=6$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Because the parabola has vertex $(2,3)$, it is the graph of  \[y=a(x-2)^2+3\] for some number $a$.  In order for the graph to contain the point $(4,4)$, we must also have  \[4=a(4-2)^2+3=4a+3,\] so $a=\frac14$, and our parabola is the graph of \[y=\frac14(x-2)^2 + 3.\] Setting $x=6$ in this gives us  \[y = \frac14(6-2)^2 + 3 = 4+3=\boxed{7}.\] The answer is $\boxed{7}$

**Problem**
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


To solve this problem, we first need to find the x-coordinates of points A and B, then we can calculate the distances from A and B to the origin and square them. Finally, we sum up the squared distances.

1. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$, so we set $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$, which simplifies to $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$. Let's call this equation (1).

2. The distance between A and B is given as 6. By the distance formula, we know that if $x_1$ and $x_2$ are the x-coordinates of A and B, then $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 6^2 = 36$. By Vieta's formulas, we know that $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$. So, $(x_1 - x_2)^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 4x_1x_2 = 4 - 4\frac{l - 4}{k} = 4 - \frac{4l - 16}{k}$. Setting this equal to 36, we have $4 - \frac{4l - 16}{k} = 36$, which simplifies to $\frac{4l - 16}{k} = -32$, or $4l - 16 = -32k$.

3. Solving for $l$ in terms of $k$, we get $l = 4k - 8$. Substituting this into equation (1), we have $kx^2 - 2kx + 4k - 8 - 4 = 0$, or $kx^2 - 2kx + 4k - 12 = 0$. The discriminant of this quadratic is $b^2 - 4ac = (-2k)^2 - 4*k*(4k - 12) = 4k^2 - 4k*(4k - 12) = 4k^2 - 16k^2 + 48k = -12k^2 + 48k$. For the parabola to intersect the line $y = 4$, the discriminant must be nonnegative, so $-12k^2 + 48k \geq 0$. Factoring out $-12k$, we have $-12k(k - 4) \geq 0$. This inequality is satisfied when $0 \leq k \leq 4$.

4. The x-coordinates of A and B are the solutions of the quadratic $kx^2 - 2kx + 4k - 12 = 0$, which are given by $x = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{(-2k)^2 - 4*k*(4k - 12)}}{2k} = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{4k^2 - 16k^2 + 48k}}{2k} = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{-12k^2 + 48k}}{2k}$. Since the discriminant is nonnegative, these are real numbers. Let's call these x-coordinates $x_1$ and $x_2$.

5. The distances from A and B to the origin are $|x_1|$ and $|x_2|$, respectively. The sum of the squares of these distances is $|x_1|^2 + |x_2|^2$. By the distance formula, we have $|x_1|^2 + |x_2|^2 = (x_1^2 + x_2^2)$. Since $x_1 + x_2 = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{4k - 12}{k}$, we can use the identity $(x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = x_1^2 + x_2^2$ to find that $(x_1^2 + x_2^2) = (2)^2 - 2*\frac{4k - 12}{k} = 4 - \frac{8k - 24}{k} = \frac{4k + 24}{k}$.

6. Substituting $l = 4k - 8$ into this expression, we have $(x_1^2 + x_2^2) = \frac{4k + 24}{k} = \frac{4k + 24}{k}$. This is the sum of the squares of the distances from A and B to the origin.

To find the numerical answer, we can now substitute a value of $k$ that satisfies $0 \leq k \leq 4$. For example, let's choose $k = 1$. Then $l = 4 - 8 = -4$. The sum of the squares of the distances is then $\frac{4 + 24}{1} = 28$.

So the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $28$. The answer is: $28$

**Problem:** 
"The graph of the quadratic $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ is a parabola that passes through the points $(-1,7)$, $(5,7)$, and $(6,10)$.  What is the $x$-coordinate of the vertex of the parabola?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
We could substitute the points into the equation $y = ax^2 + bx + c$, solve for $a$, $b$, and $c$, and then complete the square to find the coordinates of the vertex.

However, a much faster way is to recognize that two of the points, namely $(-1,7)$ and $(5,7)$, have the same $y$-coordinate.  Therefore, these two points are symmetric about the parabola's axis of symmetry.  The axis must pass through the midpoint of the segment connecting these two symmetric points, so the axis must pass through $\left(\frac{-1+5}{2},\frac{7+7}{2}\right)$, which is $(2,7)$.  Therefore, the axis of symmetry is a vertical line through $(2,7)$.  This line is the graph of the equation $x=2$.  The axis of symmetry also passes through the vertex of the parabola, so the $x$-coordinate of the vertex is $\boxed{2}$. The answer is $\boxed{2}$

**Problem:** 
"The smallest distance between the origin and a point on the parabola $y=x^2-5$ can be expressed as $\sqrt{a}/b$, where $a$ and $b$ are positive integers, and $a$ is not divisible by the square of any prime.  Find $a+b$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the distance formula, we are trying to minimize $\sqrt{x^2+y^2}=\sqrt{x^2+x^4-10x^2+25}$. In general minimization problems like this require calculus, but one elementary optimization method that sometimes works is completing the square.  We have $$\sqrt{x^2+x^4-10x^2+25}=\sqrt{(x^2-9/2)^2+(25-81/4)}.$$This expression is minimized when the square equals $0$, i.e. when $x=\pm 3/\sqrt{2}.$ For this value of $x$, the distance is $$\sqrt{25-\frac{81}{4}}=\frac{\sqrt{19}}{2}.$$Hence the desired answer is $\boxed{21}$. The answer is $\boxed{21}$

**Problem**
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



Step 1: Setting up the equation of the parabola and line.
The equation of the parabola is given as $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$. The equation of the line is given as $y = 4$.

Step 2: Setting up the equation of the intersection points.
The intersection points of the parabola and line are found by setting the equations equal to each other: $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$.

Step 3: Setting up the equation for the distance between the intersection points.
The distance between the intersection points is given as 6. Using the distance formula, we can set up the equation: $|x_2 - x_1| = 6$, where $x_1$ and $x_2$ are the x-coordinates of the intersection points.

Step 4: Setting up the equation for the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin.
The squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin are given as $x_1^2 + y_1^2$ and $x_2^2 + y_2^2$, where $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ are the coordinates of the intersection points. Since $y_1 = y_2 = 4$, we can simplify the equations to $x_1^2 + 16$ and $x_2^2 + 16$.

Step 5: Summing the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin.
The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is given as $(x_1^2 + 16) + (x_2^2 + 16) = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32$.

Step 6: Simplifying the equation.
Using the distance formula, we have $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 36$, and expanding gives $x_2^2 - 2x_1x_2 + x_1^2 = 36$. Since $x_2^2 + x_1^2 = x_1^2 + x_2^2$, we can substitute this into our equation to get $2x_1^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 36$.

Step 7: Solving for $x_1x_2$.
We can rearrange the equation to get $x_1x_2 = x_1^2 - 18$.

Step 8: Substituting $x_1x_2$ into the equation for the sum of the squares of the distances.
We substitute $x_1x_2 = x_1^2 - 18$ into the equation $x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32$ to get $x_1^2 + (x_1^2 - 18) + 32 = 2x_1^2 + 14$.

Step 9: Simplifying the equation.
The equation simplifies to $2x_1^2 + 14$. Since the value of $x_1^2$ does not affect the sum of the squares of the distances, the sum is just $14$.

So the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $14$.
The answer is $\boxed{14}$.

Assistant:

 The problem is a bit complex, but we can break it down into several smaller steps:

1. First, we need to find the $x$-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$. These are the solutions to the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$.
2. We know that the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, which means the difference of the $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$ is 3 (since the parabola is symmetric).
3. We can use the quadratic formula to find the $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$ in terms of $k$, $l$, and $x$.
4. Then, we can use the distance formula to find the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin.
5. Finally, we need to find the sum of the squares of these distances.

Let's start by writing the python code for each step:

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, we need to find the points of intersection of the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ and the line $y = 4$. This is done by setting the two equations equal to each other and solving for $x$. We get:
$$4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l.$$

2. Rearrange the equation to a standard quadratic form:
$$kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0.$$

3. Let $x_1$ and $x_2$ be the roots of this quadratic equation. By Vieta's formulas, we know that the sum of the roots is $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and the product of the roots is $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$.

4. We're given that the distance between points $A$ and $B$ is 6. The distance between two points $x_1$ and $x_2$ is given by $|x_2 - x_1| = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2} = \sqrt{(x_1 + x_2)^2 - 4x_1x_2}$. Since we know $|x_2 - x_1| = 6$, we can substitute the values we found from Vieta's formulas:
$$6 = \sqrt{(2)^2 - 4(\frac{l - 4}{k})} = \sqrt{4 - \frac{4l - 16}{k}} = \sqrt{\frac{4k - 4l + 16}{k}}.$$

5. Squaring both sides to eliminate the square root gives:
$$36 = \frac{4k - 4l + 16}{k} \Rightarrow 36k = 4k - 4l + 16 \Rightarrow 32k = -4l \Rightarrow l = -8k.$$

6. Now, we need to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. For point $A$ with coordinates $(x_1, 4)$, the distance is $\sqrt{x_1^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{x_1^2 + 16}$. Similarly, for point $B$ with coordinates $(x_2, 4)$, the distance is $\sqrt{x_2^2 + 16}$.

7. The sum of the squares of the distances is then $(\sqrt{x_1^2 + 16})^2 + (\sqrt{x_2^2 + 16})^2 = x_1^2 + 16 + x_2^2 + 16 = (x_1^2 + x_2^2) + 32$.

8. By the identity $(x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = x_1^2 + x_2^2$, we can substitute the values we found from Vieta's formulas:
$$x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 2^2 - 2(\frac{l - 4}{k}) = 4 - 2(\frac{-8k - 4}{k}) = 4 + 16 + \frac{8}{k} = 20 + \frac{8}{k}.$$

9. Substituting this into the sum of the squares of the distances gives:
$$\text{Sum of squares of distances} = (x_1^2 + x_2^2) + 32 = \left(20 + \frac{8}{k}\right) + 32 = 52 + \frac{8}{k}.$$

10. Substitute $l = -8k$ back into the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0$:
$$kx^2 - 2kx + (-8k - 4) = 0.$$

11. We can use the discriminant $\Delta = b^2 - 4ac$ of this quadratic equation. Since we want the parabola to intersect the line at two distinct points, we need $\Delta > 0$. We get:
$$\Delta = (-2k)^2 - 4(k)(-8k - 4) = 4k^2 + 32k^2 + 16k > 0.$$

12. Simplifying the inequality gives:
$$36k^2 + 16k > 0.$$

13. Dividing by 4 gives:
$$9k^2 + 4k > 0.$$

14. This inequality holds for all $k > 0$. So, we can substitute $k = 1$ into the equation $l = -8k$ to get $l = -8$.

15. Substituting $k = 1$ and $l = -8$ into the sum of squares of distances gives:
$$\text{Sum of squares of distances} = 52 + \frac{8}{1} = 60.$$

So, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is 60. The answer is: $60$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. Find the x-coordinates of points A and B by setting the y-values of the parabola and line equal to each other and solving for x.
2. Since the points A and B are distance 6 apart, we can use the distance formula to set up an equation in terms of x.
3. Solve this equation for x to find the x-coordinates of A and B.
4. Substitute these x-coordinates into the equation of the parabola to find the y-coordinates of A and B.
5. Calculate the distances from A and B to the origin using the distance formula.
6. Square these distances and sum them up.

Now let's implement these steps using sympy:

```python

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve, sqrt

def distance_sum_squared():
    # Define symbols
    x, k, l = symbols('x k l')

    # Set up equation for intersection
    equation = Eq(k*x**2 - 2*k*x + l, 4)

    # Solve for x
    solutions = solve(equation, x)

    # Let's assume the distance between A and B is 6
    # Then |x1 - x2| = 6/2 = 3
    # Using the quadratic formula, we have
    # sqrt((2k)^2 - 4*k*(l - 4)) = 3
    # Square both sides
    # (2k)^2 - 4*k*(l - 4) = 9
    # Simplify
    equation_simplified = Eq((2*k)**2 - 4*k*(l - 4), 9)

    # Solve for k
    k_solution = solve(equation_simplified, k)

    # Substitute the solution for k into the solutions for x
    x1 = solutions[0].subs(k, k_solution[0])
    x2 = solutions[1].subs(k, k_solution[0])

    # Calculate the distances from A and B to the origin
    d1 = sqrt(x1**2 + (k*x1**2 - 2*k*x1 + l)**2)
    d2 = sqrt(x2**2 + (k*x2**2 - 2*k*x2 + l)**2)

    # Square the distances and sum them up
    sum_squares = (d1**2 + d2**2).subs({k: k_solution[0], l: 4})

    return sum_squares

result = distance_sum_squared()
print(result)
```
