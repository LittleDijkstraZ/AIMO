Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, we need to solve the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. This equation is equivalent to $|x-2y| = |2x-y| = 20$.

2. We can solve this equation by considering two cases:
   a. $x - 2y = 2x - y$, which gives $y = x$.
   b. $x - 2y = -(2x - y)$, which gives $x = 2y$.

3. Substituting $y = x$ into the equation $|x-2y| = 20$, we get $|x-2x| = |-x| = 20$, so $x = \pm 20$.

4. Substituting $x = 2y$ into the equation $|x-2y| = 20$, we get $|2y-y| = |y| = 20$, so $y = \pm 20$.

5. Therefore, the solutions for $(x, y)$ are $(\pm 20, \pm 20)$.

6. Now, we substitute these solutions into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to find the minimum value.

7. For $(x, y) = (20, 20)$, we have $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(20^2) + 5(20^2) - 8(20)(20) = 2000$.

8. For $(x, y) = (-20, -20)$, we have $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(-20^2) + 5(-20^2) - 8(-20)(-20) = 2000$.

9. For $(x, y) = (20, -20)$ or $(-20, 20)$, we have $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(20^2) + 5(-20^2) - 8(20)(-20) = 2000$.

10. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 2000.

Now, let's write the entire script to solve this problem using sympy:

```python

    solutions = solve(equation, (x, y))

    # Substitute the solutions into the expression 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy

    values = [expression.subs({x: sol[0], y: sol[1]}) for sol in solutions]

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"If $x + 2y= 4$ and $xy = -8$, what is the value of $x^2 + 4y^2$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
We see that $(x + 2y)^2 = (x^2 + 4y^2) + 4xy = 4^2 = 16$. We want to find $x^2 + 4y^2$ and are given $xy = -8$. So, $x^2 + 4y^2 + 4xy = x^2 + 4y^2 + 4(-8) = 16$. It follows that $x^2 + 4y^2 = \boxed{48}$. The answer is $\boxed{48}$

**Problem**
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


This problem is a bit tricky to solve directly, so let's first simplify the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite it as $5(x^2+y^2)-8xy$. Now, let's use the identity $x^2+y^2 = \frac{1}{2}((x+y)^2+(x-y)^2)$ to rewrite the expression further:
\[5(x^2+y^2)-8xy = \frac{5}{2}((x+y)^2+(x-y)^2)-8xy.\]
Now, let's substitute $u = x+y$ and $v = x-y$. Then, we have $x = \frac{u+v}{2}$ and $y = \frac{u-v}{2}$. Substituting these into the expression, we get:
\[\frac{5}{2}(u^2+v^2)-4uv = \frac{5}{2}(u^2+v^2)-2(2uv) = \frac{5}{2}(u^2+v^2)-2(uv).\]
Now, let's analyze the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. Substituting $x = \frac{u+v}{2}$ and $y = \frac{u-v}{2}$, we get:
\[| \frac{v-u}{2} + 2(\frac{u+v}{2}) | + | \frac{u-v}{2} - 2(\frac{u+v}{2}) | = 40.\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[|u+3v| + |-u-v| = 40.\]
This simplifies to:
\[|u+3v| + |u+v| = 40.\]
Now, let's use the triangle inequality: $|a+b| \leq |a| + |b|$ to get:
\[|u+3v| + |u+v| \geq |(u+3v) + (u+v)| = |2u+4v| = 2|u+2v|.\]
Therefore, we have:
\[2|u+2v| \leq 40,\]
which implies:
\[|u+2v| \leq 20.\]
Now, let's substitute back $u = x+y$ and $v = x-y$:
\[|x+3y + x-y| \leq 20,\]
which simplifies to:
\[|2x+2y| \leq 20,\]
or:
\[|x+y| \leq 10.\]
Now, let's substitute back $x = \frac{u+v}{2}$ and $y = \frac{u-v}{2}$:
\[|\frac{u+v}{2} + \frac{u-v}{2}| \leq 10,\]
which simplifies to:
\[|u| \leq 10.\]
Similarly, we can show that:
\[|v| \leq 10.\]
Now, let's substitute back $u = x+y$ and $v = x-y$:
\[|x+y| \leq 10 \quad \text{and} \quad |x-y| \leq 10.\]
This is a rectangle in the $xy$-plane with vertices at $(5,5)$, $(-5,5)$, $(-5,-5)$, and $(5,-5)$. The minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ in this rectangle can be found by evaluating the expression at the vertices:
\[5(5)^2+5(5)^2-8(5)(5) = 250-200 = 50,\]
\[5(-5)^2+5(-5)^2-8(-5)(-5) = 250-200 = 50,\]
\[5(-5)^2+5(-5)^2-8(-5)(-5) = 250-200 = 50,\]
\[5(5)^2+5(-5)^2-8(5)(-5) = 250-200 = 50.\]
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $50$. The answer is: $50$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"What is the minimum value of the expression $x^2+y^2+2x-4y+8$ for real $x$ and $y$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Rearranging the expression, we have  \[x^2+2x+y^2-4y+8\]Completing the square in $x$, we need to add and subtract $(2/2)^2=1$. Completing the square in $y$, we need to add and subtract $(4/2)^2=4$. Thus, we have \[(x^2+2x+1)-1+(y^2-4y+4)-4+8 \Rightarrow (x+1)^2+(y-2)^2+3\]Since the minimum value of $(x+1)^2$ and $(y-2)^2$ is $0$ (perfect squares can never be negative), the minimum value of the entire expression is $\boxed{3}$, and is achieved when $x=-1$ and $y=2$. The answer is $\boxed{3}$

**Problem**
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


This problem is a bit tricky, and it requires some algebraic manipulation and the use of the triangle inequality. The triangle inequality states that for any real numbers $a$, $b$, and $c$, $|a+b| \leq |a| + |b|$. Applying this inequality to the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we have:

\[|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |x-2y| + |2x-y| \geq |x-2y + 2x-y| = |3x-3y| = 3|x-y| = 40.\]

So, we have $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$. Now, let's look at the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite it as $5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x-y)^2 + 2xy] - 8xy$.

Substituting $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$ into the equation, we get:

\[5\left[\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 + 2xy\right] - 8xy = 5\left[\frac{1600}{9} + 2xy\right] - 8xy = \frac{8000}{9} + 10xy - 8xy = \frac{8000}{9} + 2xy.\]

Now, we want to minimize this expression. By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have:

\[(1+4)(x^2+y^2) \geq (x+2y)^2 \Rightarrow 5(x^2+y^2) \geq (x+2y)^2.\]

And:

\[(4+1)(y^2+x^2) \geq (2x+y)^2 \Rightarrow 5(y^2+x^2) \geq (2x+y)^2.\]

Adding these two inequalities, we get:

\[10(x^2+y^2) \geq (x+2y)^2 + (2x+y)^2.\]

Expanding the right side, we have:

\[10(x^2+y^2) \geq x^2 + 4xy + 4y^2 + 4x^2 + 4xy + y^2 = 5x^2 + 9y^2 + 8xy.\]

Rearranging terms, we get:

\[5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy \geq 0.\]

So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $0$. However, this minimum value is achieved when $x=y=0$, which does not satisfy the condition $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$. Therefore, we must have made a mistake in our reasoning.

Let's go back and check our work. We noticed that our use of the triangle inequality was incorrect. The correct inequality is:

\[|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |x-2y| + |2x-y| \geq |x-2y - (2x-y)| = |-x-y| = |x+y| = 40.\]

So, we have $|x+y| = 40$. Now, let's look at the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ again. We can rewrite it as $5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x+y)^2 - 2xy] - 8xy$.

Substituting $|x+y| = 40$ into the equation, we get:

\[5\left[(40)^2 - 2xy\right] - 8xy = 5(1600 - 2xy) - 8xy = 8000 - 10xy - 8xy = 8000 - 18xy.\]

Now, we want to minimize this expression. By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have:

\[(1+1)(x^2+y^2) \geq (x+y)^2 \Rightarrow 2(x^2+y^2) \geq (x+y)^2.\]

And:

\[(1+1)(y^2+x^2) \geq (y+x)^2 \Rightarrow 2(y^2+x^2) \geq (y+x)^2.\]

Adding these two inequalities, we get:

\[4(x^2+y^2) \geq (x+y)^2.\]

Rearranging terms, we get:

\[2(x^2+y^2) \geq (x+y)^2/2 \Rightarrow 2(x^2+y^2) \geq 800.\]

So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is achieved when $x^2+y^2$ is minimized. The minimum value of $x^2+y^2$ is achieved when $x=y=0$, which does satisfy the condition $|x+y| = 40$. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $8000 - 18xy$ when $x=y=0$. This gives a minimum value of $8000$. However, this minimum value is achieved when $x=y=0$, which does not satisfy the condition $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$. Therefore, we must have made another mistake in our reasoning.

Let's go back and check our work again. We noticed that our use of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality was incorrect. The correct inequality is:

\[(1+1)(x^2+y^2) \geq (x+y)^2/2 \Rightarrow 2(x^2+y^2) \geq (x+y)^2/2.\]

Rearranging terms, we get:

\[4(x^2+y^2) \geq (x+y)^2.\]

And:

\[(1+1)(y^2+x^2) \geq (y+x)^2 \Rightarrow 2(y^2+x^2) \geq (y+x)^2.\]

Adding these two inequalities, we get:

\[6(x^2+y^2) \geq (x+y)^2 + (y+x)^2 = 2(x^2+y^2+2xy).\]

Rearranging terms, we get:

\[4(x^2+y^2) \geq 4xy \Rightarrow xy \geq 0.\]

So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is achieved when $xy$ is maximized. The maximum value of $xy$ is achieved when $x=y=20$, which does satisfy the condition $|x+y| = 40$. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $8000 - 18xy$ when $x=y=20$. This gives a minimum value of $8000 - 18(20)(20) = 8000 - 7200 = 800$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $800$. The answer is: $800$

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


This problem is a bit tricky, and it requires a bit of mathematical insight to solve it directly. However, we can simplify it by using a geometric interpretation.

Consider the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. This equation represents the sum of the distances from the point $(x, y)$ to the lines $x = 2y$ and $y = 2x$ in the $xy$-plane. The set of all points equidistant from these two lines forms a hyperbola. Therefore, the minimum value of the quadratic form $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ occurs at the center of this hyperbola.

The center of the hyperbola is the intersection of the lines $x = 2y$ and $y = 2x$, which gives us $x = 4x$, so $x = 0$ and $y = 0$.

Now we can substitute $x = 0$ and $y = 0$ into the quadratic form to find the minimum value:

$5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(0)^2 + 5(0)^2 - 8(0)(0) = 0$.

So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0.
The answer is: $0$

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


This problem is a bit complex and requires some mathematical insight to solve it. However, we can use Python's symbolic computation library, Sympy, to help us solve it.

First, let's rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2$. Now, we know that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. By the triangle inequality, we know that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |(x-2y) - (y-2x)| = |x-2y-y+2x| = |x-3y+2x| = |3x-3y| = 3|x-y|$. Therefore, we have $3|x-y| = 40$, so $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$.

Now, let's analyze the expression $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2$. We can rewrite it as $(x-2y)^2 + (2x-y)^2 = (x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2) + (4x^2 - 4xy + y^2) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$.

By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have $(1^2 + 2^2)(x^2 + y^2) \geq (x + 2y)^2$, so $5(x^2 + y^2) \geq (x + 2y)^2$. Similarly, we have $5(x^2 + y^2) \geq (2x + y)^2$. Adding these two inequalities, we get $10(x^2 + y^2) \geq (x + 2y)^2 + (2x + y)^2 = (x-2y)^2 + (2x-y)^2 = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$. Therefore, $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy \geq 0$.

On the other hand, by the triangle inequality, we have $|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |(x-2y) + (y-2x)| = |-x+y| = |y-x|$. Therefore, we have $3|x-y| \geq |y-x|$, so $|x-y| \leq \frac{40}{3}$.

By the reverse triangle inequality, we have $|x-2y| + |y-2x| \leq |(x-2y) + (y-2x)| = |-x+y| = |y-x|$. Therefore, we have $3|x-y| \leq |y-x|$, so $|x-y| \geq \frac{40}{3}$.

Therefore, we have $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$. Now, let's substitute this into the expression $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2$. We get $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2 = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = 5\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 - 8\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 = 0$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"What is the minimum value of the expression $2x^2+3y^2+8x-24y+62$ for real $x$ and $y$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Rearranging the expression, we have  \[2x^2+8x+3y^2-24y+62\]We first complete the square in $x$. Factoring a 2 from the first two terms of the expression, we get  \[2(x^2+4x)+3y^2-24y+62\]In order for the expression inside the parenthesis to be a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(4/2)^2=4$ inside the parenthesis. Doing this, we have \[2(x^2+4x+4-4)+3y^2-24y+62 \Rightarrow 2(x+2)^2+3y^2-24y+54\]Now we complete the square in $y$. Factoring a 3 from the $y$ terms in the expression, we get \[2(x+2)^2+3(y^2-8y)+54\]In order for the expression inside the second parenthesis to be a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(8/2)^2=16$ inside the parenthesis. Doing this, we have \[2(x+2)^2+3(y^2-8y+16-16)+54 \Rightarrow 2(x+2)^2+3(y-4)^2+6\]Since the minimum value of $2(x+2)^2$ and $3(y-4)^2$ is $0$ (perfect squares can never be negative), the minimum value of the entire expression is $\boxed{6}$, and is achieved when $x=-2$ and $y=4$. The answer is $\boxed{6}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
**Problem**
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


To solve this problem, we can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states that for any real numbers $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$ and $b_1, b_2, ..., b_n$, we have
\[(a_1^2 + a_2^2 + ... + a_n^2)(b_1^2 + b_2^2 + ... + b_n^2) \geq (a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 + ... + a_nb_n)^2.\]

In this case, we can let $a_1 = x - 2y$, $a_2 = y - 2x$, $b_1 = 1$, and $b_2 = 1$. Then we have
\[(a_1^2 + a_2^2)(b_1^2 + b_2^2) \geq (a_1b_1 + a_2b_2)^2.\]

Substituting the values of $a_1$, $a_2$, $b_1$, and $b_2$, we get
\[((x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2)(1^2 + 1^2) \geq ((x - 2y)(1) + (y - 2x)(1))^2.\]

Simplifying, we get
\[((x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2)(2) \geq (x - 2y + y - 2x)^2.\]

Simplifying further, we get
\[((x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2)(2) \geq (-x + y)^2.\]

Expanding, we get
\[2((x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2) \geq (x - y)^2.\]

Expanding again, we get
\[2((x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2) + (y^2 - 4xy + 4x^2)) \geq (x^2 - 2xy + y^2).\]

Simplifying, we get
\[2(5x^2 - 8xy + 5y^2) \geq (x^2 - 2xy + y^2).\]

Expanding, we get
\[10x^2 - 16xy + 10y^2 \geq x^2 - 2xy + y^2.\]

Rearranging, we get
\[9x^2 - 14xy + 9y^2 \geq 0.\]

Now, we can use the given condition $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$. Since the absolute value of a real number is always nonnegative, we can square both sides of the equation to get
\[(x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2 = 40^2.\]

Expanding, we get
\[(x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2) + (y^2 - 4xy + 4x^2) = 1600.\]

Simplifying, we get
\[5x^2 - 8xy + 5y^2 = 1600.\]

Substituting this into the inequality we derived earlier, we get
\[10x^2 - 16xy + 10y^2 \geq 1600.\]

Dividing both sides by 2, we get
\[5x^2 - 8xy + 5y^2 \geq 800.\]

Now, we can substitute this back into the expression we want to minimize:
\[5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy \geq 5x^2 - 8xy + 5y^2 \geq 800.\]

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is 800.
The answer is: $800$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"What is the minimum value of the expression $x^2+y^2+2x-4y+8$ for real $x$ and $y$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Rearranging the expression, we have  \[x^2+2x+y^2-4y+8\]Completing the square in $x$, we need to add and subtract $(2/2)^2=1$. Completing the square in $y$, we need to add and subtract $(4/2)^2=4$. Thus, we have \[(x^2+2x+1)-1+(y^2-4y+4)-4+8 \Rightarrow (x+1)^2+(y-2)^2+3\]Since the minimum value of $(x+1)^2$ and $(y-2)^2$ is $0$ (perfect squares can never be negative), the minimum value of the entire expression is $\boxed{3}$, and is achieved when $x=-1$ and $y=2$. The answer is $\boxed{3}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



To solve this problem, we can use the method of completing the square. First, let's rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $(x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2) + (y^2 - 4xy + 4x^2) = (x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2$.

Now, we know that $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$. By the triangle inequality, we have $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| \geq |(x - 2y) - (y - 2x)| = |x - 2y - y + 2x| = |x - 3y + 2x| = |3x - 3y| = 3|x - y| = 40$. So, $|x - y| = \frac{40}{3}$.

Since $(x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2 = (x - y)^2 + (y - x)^2 = 2(x - y)^2$, we want to minimize $(x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2$. By the triangle inequality, we know that $(x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2 \geq 0$, and equality holds when $x = 2y$ or $y = 2x$. 

If $x = 2y$, then $|x - y| = |2y - y| = |y| = \frac{40}{3}$, so $y = \pm \frac{40}{3}$. If $y = 2x$, then $|x - y| = |x - 2x| = |-x| = \frac{40}{3}$, so $x = \pm \frac{40}{3}$.

Without loss of generality, let's assume $x = 2y$. Then, $|x - y| = |2y - y| = |y| = \frac{40}{3}$, so $y = \frac{40}{3}$. Substituting $y = \frac{40}{3}$ into $x = 2y$, we get $x = \frac{80}{3}$.

Now, we can substitute $x = \frac{80}{3}$ and $y = \frac{40}{3}$ into $(x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2$:
\[ \left(\frac{80}{3} - 2 \cdot \frac{40}{3}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{40}{3} - 2 \cdot \frac{80}{3}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{80}{3} - \frac{80}{3}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{40}{3} - \frac{160}{3}\right)^2 = 0^2 + \left(-\frac{120}{3}\right)^2 = 0 + 40^2 = 1600. \]

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $1600$. The answer is: $1600$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"If $x + 2y= 4$ and $xy = -8$, what is the value of $x^2 + 4y^2$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
We see that $(x + 2y)^2 = (x^2 + 4y^2) + 4xy = 4^2 = 16$. We want to find $x^2 + 4y^2$ and are given $xy = -8$. So, $x^2 + 4y^2 + 4xy = x^2 + 4y^2 + 4(-8) = 16$. It follows that $x^2 + 4y^2 = \boxed{48}$. The answer is $\boxed{48}$
