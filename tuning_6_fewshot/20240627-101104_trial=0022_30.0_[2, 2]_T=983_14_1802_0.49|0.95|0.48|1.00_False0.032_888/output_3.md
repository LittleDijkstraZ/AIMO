**Problem:** 
"How many square units are in the area of the triangle whose vertices are the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the curve $y = (x-3)^2 (x+2)$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we need to find where this curve intersects the $x$ and $y$ axes.  If $y=0$, then $(x-3)^2(x+2)=0$, which has solutions of $x=3$ and $x=-2$.  If $x=0$, then $y=(-3)^2(2)=18$.  So, the curve has two $x$-intercepts and one $y$-intercept.  The length of the base along the $x$-axis is $3-(-2)=5$.  The height from this base is equal to the $y$-intercept, 18.  The area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 5\cdot 18=\boxed{45}$. The answer is $\boxed{45}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


This problem is a bit complex and requires a deep understanding of absolute value and inequalities. However, we can simplify it by realizing that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to the following system of equations:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From equations 3 and 4, we get that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. From equations 1 and 2, we get that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we find that the points are $(\pm 8, \pm 2)$ and $(\pm 2, \pm 8)$. These points form a square with side length 10, so the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

This problem is a bit complex, and it might be more efficient to solve it using mathematical reasoning rather than programming. However, if you still want to solve it using Python, you can use the `sympy` library to simplify the expression and find the area of the polygon.

```python

    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # The given equation simplifies to (|x| - 8)^2 + (|y| - 8)^2 = 0 or (|x + y| - 10)^2 + (|x - y| - 10)^2 = 0
    # The first equation implies that |x| = 8 and |y| = 8, which forms a square with side length 16.
    # The second equation implies that |x + y| = 10 and |x - y| = 10, which forms a square with side length 20.
    # The area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of these two squares.

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


This problem is a bit too complex to be solved directly with Python. However, we can observe that the given equation is equivalent to the intersection of four conditions:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

The solutions to these conditions are:
1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which gives us two lines: $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.
2. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which gives us two lines: $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.
3. $\vert x \vert = 8$, which gives us two lines: $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.
4. $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us two lines: $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

So, the answer is $\boxed{256}$.

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either term must be zero. This gives us four cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For each case, we can solve for the values of $x$ and $y$ that satisfy the equation. The solutions will be the vertices of the polygon. Then we can calculate the area of the polygon.

```python

    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # Combine all vertices
    vertices = vertices_1 + vertices_2

    # Calculate the area of the polygon
    area = abs(sum([vertices[i][0]*vertices[i+1][1] - vertices[i+1][0]*vertices[i][1] for i in range(len(vertices) - 1)])) / 2

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is equal to zero if and only if at least one of the factors is zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. 

The first factor being zero implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of a square with side length 20.

The second factor being zero implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of a square with side length 16.

The points that satisfy the original equation are the union of the points that satisfy each of these two conditions. Therefore, the points that satisfy the equation form the union of two squares. The side length of the larger square is 20, so its area is $20^2 = 400$. The side length of the smaller square is 16, so its area is $16^2 = 256$. The area of the convex polygon formed by the points that satisfy the equation is the sum of the areas of these two squares, which is $400 + 256 = 656$.

    side_length_large_square = 20
    side_length_small_square = 16
    area_large_square = side_length_large_square ** 2
    area_small_square = side_length_small_square ** 2
