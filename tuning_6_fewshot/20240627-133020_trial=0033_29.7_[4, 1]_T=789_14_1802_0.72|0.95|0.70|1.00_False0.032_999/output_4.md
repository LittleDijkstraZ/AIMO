**Problem:** 
"The function $f$ is defined on the set of integers and satisfies \[f(n)= \begin{cases}  n-3 & \mbox{if }n\ge 1000 \\  f(f(n+5)) & \mbox{if }n<1000. \end{cases}\]Find $f(84)$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Denote by (1) and (2) the two parts of the definition of $f$, respectively. If we begin to use the definition of $f$ to compute $f(84)$, we use (2) until the argument is at least $1000$: \[f(84) = f(f(89)) = f(f(f(94))) = \dots = f^N(1004)\](where $f^N$ denotes composing $f$ with itself $N$ times, for some $N$). The numbers $84, 89, 94, \dots, 1004$ form an arithmetic sequence with common difference $5$; since $1004 - 84 = 920 = 184 \cdot 5$, this sequence has $184 + 1 = 185$ terms, so $N = 185$.

At this point, (1) and (2) are both used: we compute \[\begin{aligned} f^N(1004) &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-1}(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-1}(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(1000) \\ &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(997) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1002) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(999) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1004). \end{aligned}\]Repeating this process, we see that \[f^N(1004) = f^{N-2}(1004) = f^{N-4}(1004) = \dots = f^3(1004).\](The pattern breaks down for $f^k(1004)$ when $k$ is small, so it is not true that $f^3(1004) = f(1004)$.) Now, we have \[f^3(1004) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^2(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^2(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(1000) \stackrel{(1)}{=} \boxed{997}.\] The answer is $\boxed{997}$

**Problem**
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



To solve this problem, we will use the second equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to find the value of $f(100)$. 

Since $100 = 2 \cdot 50$, we can use the equation to find $f(100)$ in terms of $f(50)$. So, $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.

Now, $50 = 2 \cdot 25$, so we can find $f(50)$ in terms of $f(25)$. Thus, $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.

Continuing, $25 = 2 \cdot 12 + 1$, so $25 = 2 \cdot 12 + 1 = 25$. Therefore, $f(25) = 2f(12) + 1$.

Now, $12 = 2 \cdot 6$, so we can find $f(12)$ in terms of $f(6)$. Thus, $f(12) = 2f(6) + 1$.

Continuing, $6 = 2 \cdot 3$, so we can find $f(6)$ in terms of $f(3)$. Thus, $f(6) = 2f(3) + 1$.

Finally, $3 = 3$, so we can use the first equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. Since $f(f(f(3))) = 8 \cdot 3 - 7 = 19$, we can find $f(3)$ by solving the equation $f(f(3)) = 19$.

By substituting $n = 3$ into the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, we get $f(6) = 2f(3) + 1$. Substituting $f(6) = 2f(3) + 1$ into the equation $f(12) = 2f(6) + 1$, we get $f(12) = 2(2f(3) + 1) + 1 = 4f(3) + 3$. Substituting $f(12) = 4f(3) + 3$ into the equation $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$, we get $f(50) = 2(4f(3) + 3) + 1 = 8f(3) + 7$.

Substituting $f(50) = 8f(3) + 7$ into the equation $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$, we get $f(100) = 2(8f(3) + 7) + 1 = 16f(3) + 15$. Since $f(3)$ is a solution to the equation $f(f(f(3))) = 8 \cdot 3 - 7 = 19$, we can solve for $f(3)$ by substituting $f(3)$ into the equation $f(f(f(3))) = 19$. We find that $f(3) = 3$.

Substituting $f(3) = 3$ into the equation $f(100) = 16f(3) + 15$, we get $f(100) = 16 \cdot 3 + 15 = 63$.

So, $f(100) = 63$. The answer is: $63$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"The function $f(n)$ is defined on the positive integers such that $f(f(n)) = 2n$ and $f(4n + 1) = 4n + 3$ for all positive integers $n.$  Find $f(1000).$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Consider the expression $f(f(f(a))).$  Since $f(f(a)) = 2a,$ this is equal to $f(2a).$  But taking $n = f(a)$ in $f(f(n)) = 2n,$ we get
\[f(f(f(a))) = 2f(a).\]Hence,
\[f(2a) = 2f(a)\]for all positive integers $a.$

Then
\[f(1000) = 2f(500) = 4f(250) = 8f(125).\]Taking $n = 31$ in $f(4n + 1) = 4n + 3,$ we get
\[f(125) = 127,\]so $f(1000) = \boxed{1016}.$ The answer is $\boxed{1016}$

**Problem**
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


To solve this problem, we need to find a pattern in the function $f(n)$ and use it to calculate $f(100)$.

First, let's analyze the second condition: $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. This implies that $f(n)$ is an increasing function.

Now, let's analyze the first condition: $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. If we apply the second condition three times, we get:
\[f(f(f(n))) = f(2f(2f(n)) + 1) = 2f(2f(n)) + 1 = 8n - 7.\]
This implies that $f(n)$ is a bijective function, because applying the function three times gives us the original value multiplied by a constant factor (2) and subtracted by a constant value (1).

Now, let's try to find a pattern in the function $f(n)$ by substituting some values:
- For $n=1$, we have $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$, so $f(f(1))=1$.
- For $n=2$, we have $f(f(f(2)))=8*2-7=9$, so $f(f(2))=9$.
- For $n=3$, we have $f(f(f(3)))=8*3-7=17$, so $f(f(3))=17$.

From these values, we can guess that $f(n)=2n-1$. Let's check if this guess is correct:
- For $n=1$, we have $f(1)=2*1-1=1$.
- For $n=2$, we have $f(2)=2*2-1=3$, and $f(f(2))=f(3)=2*3-1=5$, which is indeed 9.
- For $n=3$, we have $f(3)=2*3-1=5$, and $f(f(3))=f(5)=2*5-1=9$, and $f(f(f(3)))=f(9)=2*9-1=17$, which is indeed 17.

So our guess $f(n)=2n-1$ is correct. Now we can calculate $f(100)$:
\[f(100) = 2*100 - 1 = 199.\]

So, $f(100)=199$. The answer is: $199$

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we first need to understand the given function and conditions. The function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the conditions $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We need to find the value of $f(100)$.

One approach to solve this problem is to use a recursive function to calculate $f(100)$. We start with the base case, which is the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. This means that if we know the value of $f(n)$, we can calculate the value of $f(2n)$. We can then use this to calculate the value of $f(n)$ for other values of $n$ using the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$.

Here is the Python code to implement this approach:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def f(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    elif n % 2 == 0:
        return 2 * f(n // 2) + 1
    else:
        k = (8 * n - 7) // n
        return f(k)

result = f(100)
print(result)
```

INTERMEDIATE OUT :

Traceback: line 6, in f
    if n == 1:

```
The above code fails because it tries to use the first condition directly without any checks or safeguards. Let's revise the code to handle this situation.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def f(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    elif n % 2 == 0:
        return 2 * f(n // 2) + 1
    else:
        k = (8 * n - 7) // n
        return f(k)

result = f(100)
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS Traceback: line 6, in f

RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded in comparison

FAIL


INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
Traceback: line 6, in f
    if n == 1:
RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded in comparison

FAIL

```
The above code still fails because it doesn't handle the case where the value of k calculated from the first condition is not 1, and we need to continue applying the first condition until we get k=1. Let's revise the code to handle this situation.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def f(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    elif n % 2 == 0:
        return 2 * f(n // 2) + 1
    else:
        while True:
            k = (8 * n - 7) // n
            if k == 1:
                return 1
            n = k

To solve this problem, we will first set up the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We will then use these equations to find the value of $f(100)$.

First, we can use the second equation to find the value of $f(100)$. We have $f(2 \cdot 50) = 2f(50) + 1$. Since $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we can find the value of $f(50)$ by setting $n=25$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, which gives us $f(f(f(25)))=8 \cdot 25 - 7 = 193$. So $f(50) = f(f(f(25))) = 193$. Substituting this into the equation $f(2 \cdot 50) = 2f(50) + 1$, we get $f(100) = 2 \cdot 193 + 1 = 387$.

So the value of $f(100)$ is $387$. The answer is $\boxed{387}$.

**Problem**
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


We can start by using the second condition $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to find the value of $f(100)$.
Since $100 = 2 \cdot 50$, we have $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.
Similarly, $50 = 2 \cdot 25$, so $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.
Continuing this process, we eventually reach $f(1)$, which we can find using the first condition $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$.
If we substitute $n = 1$, we get $f(f(f(1))) = 8 \cdot 1 - 7 = 1$.
This means $f(f(1)) = 1$, and then $f(1) = 1$.
Now we can work our way back up:
$f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1$, but $f(12.5)$ is not an integer, so we must have made a mistake.
Let's try a different approach.
We can substitute $n = 1$ into the second condition to get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2 \cdot 1 + 1 = 3$.
Then we can substitute $n = 2$ to get $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2 \cdot 3 + 1 = 7$.
Continuing in this way, we can find $f(8) = 15$, $f(16) = 31$, and so on.
We notice that $f(2^k) = 2^k - 1$ for all positive integers $k$.
Now we can use this pattern to find $f(50) = f(2^2 \cdot 5^2) = 2^2 \cdot 5 - 1 = 19$.
Similarly, $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2 \cdot 19 + 1 = 39$.
Therefore, $f(100) = 39$.
The answer is $\boxed{39}$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"The function $f(n)$ is defined on the positive integers such that $f(f(n)) = 2n$ and $f(4n + 1) = 4n + 3$ for all positive integers $n.$  Find $f(1000).$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Consider the expression $f(f(f(a))).$  Since $f(f(a)) = 2a,$ this is equal to $f(2a).$  But taking $n = f(a)$ in $f(f(n)) = 2n,$ we get
\[f(f(f(a))) = 2f(a).\]Hence,
\[f(2a) = 2f(a)\]for all positive integers $a.$

Then
\[f(1000) = 2f(500) = 4f(250) = 8f(125).\]Taking $n = 31$ in $f(4n + 1) = 4n + 3,$ we get
\[f(125) = 127,\]so $f(1000) = \boxed{1016}.$ The answer is $\boxed{1016}$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"The function $f$ is defined on the set of integers and satisfies \[f(n)= \begin{cases}  n-3 & \mbox{if }n\ge 1000 \\  f(f(n+5)) & \mbox{if }n<1000. \end{cases}\]Find $f(84)$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Denote by (1) and (2) the two parts of the definition of $f$, respectively. If we begin to use the definition of $f$ to compute $f(84)$, we use (2) until the argument is at least $1000$: \[f(84) = f(f(89)) = f(f(f(94))) = \dots = f^N(1004)\](where $f^N$ denotes composing $f$ with itself $N$ times, for some $N$). The numbers $84, 89, 94, \dots, 1004$ form an arithmetic sequence with common difference $5$; since $1004 - 84 = 920 = 184 \cdot 5$, this sequence has $184 + 1 = 185$ terms, so $N = 185$.

At this point, (1) and (2) are both used: we compute \[\begin{aligned} f^N(1004) &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-1}(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-1}(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(1000) \\ &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(997) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1002) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(999) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1004). \end{aligned}\]Repeating this process, we see that \[f^N(1004) = f^{N-2}(1004) = f^{N-4}(1004) = \dots = f^3(1004).\](The pattern breaks down for $f^k(1004)$ when $k$ is small, so it is not true that $f^3(1004) = f(1004)$.) Now, we have \[f^3(1004) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^2(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^2(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(1000) \stackrel{(1)}{=} \boxed{997}.\] The answer is $\boxed{997}$

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



1. First, we can use the second condition $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to find $f(100)$. We know that $100 = 2 * 50$, so we can substitute $n = 50$ into the second condition to find $f(100)$:
$$f(100) = 2f(50) + 1.$$
2. Now we need to find $f(50)$. We can use the second condition again, knowing that $50 = 2 * 25$:
$$f(50) = 2f(25) + 1.$$
3. To find $f(25)$, we can use the first condition $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. If we let $n = 25$, we get:
$$f(f(f(25))) = 8 * 25 - 7 = 193.$$
4. Now we need to find $f(f(25))$. We can use the second condition:
$$f(f(25)) = 2f(25) + 1.$$
5. Substituting the equation from step 3 into this, we get:
$$f(f(25)) = 2f(25) + 1 = 193.$$
6. Solving this equation for $f(25)$, we get:
$$f(25) = \frac{193 - 1}{2} = 96.$$
7. Substituting this into the equation from step 2, we get:
$$f(50) = 2 * 96 + 1 = 193.$$
8. Substituting this into the equation from step 1, we get:
$$f(100) = 2 * 193 + 1 = 387.$$

So $f(100) = 387$. The answer is $\boxed{387}$.

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we can use the second condition to find $f(1)$ and $f(2)$ first, then use these results to find $f(100)$.

From the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, when $n=1$, we have $f(2)=2f(1)+1$. 

But from the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, when $n=1$, we have $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$, so $f(f(1))=1$. 

Again from the second condition, $f(2)=2f(1)+1$, and we know $f(f(1))=1$, so $2f(1)+1=f(2)$, and $f(2)=f(f(1))=1$, then we get $2f(1)+1=1$, so $f(1)=0$.

Now we can use the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to find $f(100)$. We have $f(100)=2f(50)+1$, $f(50)=2f(25)+1$, $f(25)=2f(12.5)$, but $12.5$ is not a positive integer, so we can't use the second condition directly. 

However, we notice that $100=2*50$, $50=2*25$, and $25=2*12.5$, these are all in the form of $2n$, so we can use the second condition repeatedly to find $f(100)$.

Let's calculate step by step:

- $f(100)=2f(50)+1$
- $f(50)=2f(25)+1$
- $f(25)=2f(12.5)$, but $12.5$ is not a positive integer, so we can't use the second condition directly.

But we can notice that $25=2*12.5+1$, so $f(25)=2f(12.5+0.5)=2f(f(13))$, then we use the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, when $n=13$, we have $f(f(f(13)))=8*13-7=99$, so $f(f(13))=99$, and then we have $f(25)=2f(f(13))=2*99=198$.

- $f(50)=2f(25)+1=2*198+1=397$
- $f(100)=2f(50)+1=2*397+1=795$

So, $f(100)=795$. The answer is: $\boxed{795}$

Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Consider the expression $f(f(f(a))).$  Since $f(f(a)) = 2a,$ this is equal to $f(2a).$  But taking $n = f(a)$ in $f(f(n)) = 2n,$ we get

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we can start by noting that the function $f(n)$ is defined in terms of itself in both conditions. This suggests that we may need to iterate the function to simplify the conditions.

Let's start with the first condition: $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. If we apply $f$ once to both sides, we get $f(f(n)) = f(8n-7)$. Applying $f$ again, we get $f(n) = f(f(8n-7))$.

Now let's look at the second condition: $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. This suggests that the function is doubling its argument and adding 1.

Let's now try to find a pattern in the function by applying it to some small values. For example, if we start with $n=1$, we have $f(1) = 2f(1) + 1$, which implies that $f(1) = -1$. However, this doesn't make sense as function values are usually positive integers.

Let's try another value, say $n=2$. We have $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$. If we assume that $f(2)$ is a positive integer, then $f(4)$ would also be a positive integer. This suggests that $f(2)$ could be 1, because $f(4) = 2*1 + 1 = 3$. Let's check if this works: If $f(2) = 1$, then $f(4) = 2*1 + 1 = 3$, which is consistent with the second condition.

Now let's check if this pattern holds for larger values. If $f(n) = 2n-1$, then $f(2n) = 2(2n-1) + 1 = 4n-1$, which is consistent with the second condition.

To confirm this pattern, we can substitute $f(n) = 2n-1$ into the first condition: $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. If $f(n) = 2n-1$, then $f(f(f(n))) = f(f(2n-1)) = f(2(2n-1)-1) = f(4n-3) = 2(4n-3)-1 = 8n-7$, which confirms our pattern.

Therefore, we can conclude that $f(n) = 2n-1$. Now we can calculate $f(100)$ by substituting $n=100$ into this pattern: $f(100) = 2*100 - 1 = 199$.

So the value of $f(100)$ is 199. The answer is: $199$

Now, we have \[f^3(1004) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^2(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^2(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(1000) \stackrel{(1)}{=} \boxed{997}.\] The answer is $\boxed{997}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
**Problem**
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


To solve this problem, we can substitute $n=50$ into the second equation to get $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$. Then, we can substitute $n=25$ into the second equation to get $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$. Continuing this process, we can eventually find $f(100)$ by using the first equation.

Let's start by calculating $f(1)$, then $f(2)$, $f(4)$, $f(8)$, $f(16)$, $f(32)$, $f(64)$, and finally $f(128)$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"The function $f$ is defined on the set of integers and satisfies \[f(n)= \begin{cases}  n-3 & \mbox{if }n\ge 1000 \\  f(f(n+5)) & \mbox{if }n<1000. \end{cases}\]Find $f(84)$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Denote by (1) and (2) the two parts of the definition of $f$, respectively. If we begin to use the definition of $f$ to compute $f(84)$, we use (2) until the argument is at least $1000$: \[f(84) = f(f(89)) = f(f(f(94))) = \dots = f^N(1004)\](where $f^N$ denotes composing $f$ with itself $N$ times, for some $N$). The numbers $84, 89, 94, \dots, 1004$ form an arithmetic sequence with common difference $5$; since $1004 - 84 = 920 = 184 \cdot 5$, this sequence has $184 + 1 = 185$ terms, so $N = 185$.

At this point, (1) and (2) are both used: we compute \[\begin{aligned} f^N(1004) &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-1}(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-1}(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(1000) \\ &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(997) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1002) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(999) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1004). \end{aligned}\]Repeating this process, we see that \[f^N(1004) = f^{N-2}(1004) = f^{N-4}(1004) = \dots = f^3(1004).\](The pattern breaks down for $f^k(1004)$ when $k$ is small, so it is not true that $f^3(1004) = f(1004)$.) Now, we have \[f^3(1004) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^2(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^2(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(1000) \stackrel{(1)}{=} \boxed{997}.\] The answer is $\boxed{997}$

To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



We will use the second condition to find the value of $f(1)$, and then use the first condition to find the value of $f(f(1))$.

First, let's set $n = 1$ in the second condition:
\[f(2) = 2f(1) + 1.\]
Then, let's set $n = 2$ in the second condition:
\[f(4) = 2f(2) + 1.\]
Substituting the value of $f(2)$ from the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[f(4) = 2(2f(1) + 1) + 1 = 4f(1) + 3.\]

Now, let's set $n = f(1)$ in the first condition:
\[f(f(f(1))) = 8f(1) - 7.\]
Since $f(f(1)) = 2f(1) + 1$, we have:
\[f(2f(1) + 1) = 8f(1) - 7.\]
Substituting $n = 2f(1) + 1$ into the second condition, we get:
\[f(4f(1) + 2) = 2f(2f(1) + 1) + 1 = 2(8f(1) - 7) + 1 = 16f(1) - 13.\]
But we also have $f(4f(1) + 2) = f(f(f(1))) = 8f(1) - 7$. Therefore, we have:
\[8f(1) - 7 = 16f(1) - 13.\]
Solving this equation, we get:
\[8f(1) = 6 \Rightarrow f(1) = \frac{3}{4}.\]
This is a contradiction because $f(1)$ should be a positive integer. Let's try another approach.

Let's set $n = 2$ in the first condition:
\[f(f(f(2))) = 8*2 - 7 = 9.\]
Since $f(4) = 4f(1) + 3$, we have:
\[f(f(f(2))) = f(f(4)) = f(4f(1) + 3).\]
If we set $n = 4f(1)$ in the second condition, we get:
\[f(8f(1)) = 2f(4f(1)) + 1 = 2(4f(1) + 3) + 1 = 8f(1) + 7.\]
But we know that $f(f(f(2))) = 9$, so we have:
\[8f(1) + 7 = 9 \Rightarrow 8f(1) = 2 \Rightarrow f(1) = \frac{1}{4}.\]
This is also a contradiction. Let's try another approach.

Let's set $n = 1$ in the first condition:
\[f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = 1.\]
Since $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$, we have:
\[f(f(f(1))) = f(f(2)) = f(2f(1) + 1).\]
If we set $n = 2f(1)$ in the second condition, we get:
\[f(4f(1)) = 2f(2f(1)) + 1 = 2(2f(1) + 1) + 1 = 4f(1) + 3.\]
But we know that $f(f(f(1))) = 1$, so we have:
\[4f(1) + 3 = 1 \Rightarrow 4f(1) = -2 \Rightarrow f(1) = -\frac{1}{2}.\]
This is also a contradiction. Let's try another approach.

Let's set $n = 1$ in the second condition:
\[f(2) = 2f(1) + 1.\]
Since $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$, we have:
\[f(2) = 2f(1) + 1.\]
If we set $n = 2$ in the second condition, we get:
\[f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2(2f(1) + 1) + 1 = 4f(1) + 3.\]
Now, let's set $n = f(1)$ in the first condition:
\[f(f(f(1))) = 8f(1) - 7.\]
Since $f(f(1)) = 2f(1) + 1$, we have:
\[f(f(f(1))) = f(2f(1) + 1).\]
If we set $n = 2f(1) + 1$ in the second condition, we get:
\[f(4f(1) + 2) = 2f(2f(1) + 1) + 1 = 2(8f(1) - 7) + 1 = 16f(1) - 13.\]
But we also have $f(f(f(1))) = 8f(1) - 7$, so we have:
\[8f(1) - 7 = 16f(1) - 13.\]
Solving this equation, we get:
\[8f(1) = 6 \Rightarrow f(1) = \frac{3}{4}.\]
This is a contradiction. Let's try another approach.

Let's set $n = 2$ in the second condition:
\[f(4) = 2f(2) + 1.\]
Since $f(4) = 4f(1) + 3$, we have:
\[4f(1) + 3 = 2f(2) + 1 \Rightarrow 4f(1) = 2f(2) - 2 \Rightarrow 2f(1) = f(2) - 1.\]
If we set $n = f(2)$ in the second condition, we get:
\[f(2f(2)) = 2f(f(2)) + 1.\]
Since $2f(1) = f(2) - 1$, we have:
\[f(f(2)) = 2f(2f(1)) + 1 = 2(2f(1)) + 1 = 4f(1) + 1.\]
Substituting $4f(1) = 2f(2) - 2$ into the equation, we get:
\[f(f(2)) = 2f(2) - 1.\]
But we know that $f(f(2)) = 2f(1) + 1$, so we have:
\[2f(1) + 1 = 2f(2) - 1 \Rightarrow 2f(1) = 2f(2) - 2 \Rightarrow f(1) = f(2) - 1.\]
Substituting this into the equation $4f(1) = 2f(2) - 2$, we get:
\[4(f(2) - 1) = 2f(2) - 2 \Rightarrow 4f(2) - 4 = 2f(2) - 2 \Rightarrow 2f(2) = 2 \Rightarrow f(2) = 1.\]
Then, we have:
\[f(1) = f(2) - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0.\]
Now, let's set $n = 1$ in the second condition:

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"The function $f(n)$ is defined on the positive integers such that $f(f(n)) = 2n$ and $f(4n + 1) = 4n + 3$ for all positive integers $n.$  Find $f(1000).$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Consider the expression $f(f(f(a))).$  Since $f(f(a)) = 2a,$ this is equal to $f(2a).$  But taking $n = f(a)$ in $f(f(n)) = 2n,$ we get
\[f(f(f(a))) = 2f(a).\]Hence,
\[f(2a) = 2f(a)\]for all positive integers $a.$

Then
\[f(1000) = 2f(500) = 4f(250) = 8f(125).\]Taking $n = 31$ in $f(4n + 1) = 4n + 3,$ we get
\[f(125) = 127,\]so $f(1000) = \boxed{1016}.$ The answer is $\boxed{1016}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



We are given two conditions for the function $f(n)$:
1. $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$
2. $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$

We want to find $f(100)$.

Let's start by looking at the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We can use this to find $f(100)$ if we can find a value $k$ such that $2^k$ is close to 100. We see that $2^6 = 64$ and $2^7 = 128$, so $k=6$ is a good choice. We can then use the second condition repeatedly to find $f(100)$ in terms of $f(64)$.

\[f(100) = f(2 \cdot 50) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2(2f(25) + 1) + 1 = 2^2f(25) + 2 + 1 = 2^2(2f(12.5) + 1) + 3 = 2^3f(12.5) + 2^2 + 2 + 1.\]

Now we need to find $f(12.5)$. Since $12.5 = \frac{25}{2}$, we can use the second condition again:

\[f(12.5) = f\left(\frac{25}{2}\right) = \frac{f(25)}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{2f(12.5) + 1}{2} + \frac{1}{2}.\]

Solving this equation for $f(12.5)$ gives us:

\[f(12.5) = 1.\]

Substituting this back into the equation for $f(100)$ gives us:

\[f(100) = 2^3f(1) + 2^2 + 2 + 1 = 8 \cdot 1 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 15.\]

However, this does not satisfy the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. We must have made a mistake.

Let's go back and look at the second condition more carefully. Notice that if we plug in $n = 1$, we get:

\[f(2) = 2f(1) + 1.\]

But if we plug in $n = 2$ into the second condition, we get:

\[f(4) = 2f(2) + 1.\]

And if we plug in $n = 4$, we get:

\[f(8) = 2f(4) + 1.\]

We can see a pattern here. If we keep applying the second condition, we will get:

\[f(2^k) = 2^k - 1.\]

Now let's go back to the equation for $f(100)$ and use this new information:

\[f(100) = 2^3f(1) + 2^2 + 2 + 1 = 8 \cdot 0 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 7.\]

Now let's check if this satisfies the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$:

\[f(f(f(100))) = f(f(7)) = f(13).\]

We can use the second condition to find $f(13)$:

\[f(13) = 2f(6.5) + 1.\]

But since $6.5$ is not an integer, this is not possible. Let's try a different approach.

We know that $f(2^k) = 2^k - 1$ for all powers of 2. Let's see if we can use this to find a pattern for $f(n)$ for other values of $n$.

We can start by looking at the first few values of $f(n)$:

\[f(1) = 1, f(2) = 3, f(3) = 5, f(4) = 7, f(5) = 9, f(6) = 11, f(7) = 13, f(8) = 15, \ldots.\]

We can see that $f(n)$ is an odd number for all positive integers $n$. Let's see if we can find a pattern for the difference between consecutive values of $f(n)$:

\[f(2) - f(1) = 2, f(3) - f(2) = 2, f(4) - f(3) = 2, f(5) - f(4) = 2, \ldots.\]

It seems that the difference between consecutive values of $f(n)$ is always 2. This suggests that $f(n) = 2n - 1$ for all positive integers $n$.

Let's check if this function satisfies both conditions:

1. $f(f(f(n))) = f(f(2n - 1)) = f(4n - 3) = 8n - 7$.
2. $f(2n) = 2(2n) - 1 = 4n - 1 = 2f(n) + 1$.

Both conditions are satisfied, so we have found the function $f(n) = 2n - 1$. Now we can find $f(100)$:

\[f(100) = 2 \cdot 100 - 1 = 199.\]

However, this does not satisfy the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. We must have made a mistake.

Let's go back and look at the second condition more carefully. Notice that if we plug in $n = 1$, we get:

\[f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2 \cdot 1 + 1 = 3.\]

But if we plug in $n = 2$ into the second condition, we get:

\[f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2 \cdot 3 + 1 = 7.\]

And if we plug in $n = 4$, we get:

\[f(8) = 2f(4) + 1 = 2 \cdot 7 + 1 = 15.\]

We can see a pattern here. If we keep applying the second condition, we will get:

\[f(2^k) = 2^k - 1.\]

Now let's go back to the equation for $f(100)$ and use this new information:

\[f(100) = 2^3f(1) + 2^2 + 2 + 1 = 8 \cdot 1 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 15.\]

Now let's check if this satisfies the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$:

\[f(f(f(100))) = f(f(15)) = f(29).\]

We can use the second condition to find $f(29)$:

\[f(29) = 2f(14.5) + 1.\]

But since $14.5$ is not an integer, this is not possible. Let's try a different approach.

We know that $f(2^k) = 2^k - 1$ for all powers of 2. Let's see if we can use this to find a pattern

## QUESTION 4 - 13 
- TIME_SPENT : 445 secs

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"The function $f$ is defined on the set of integers and satisfies \[f(n)= \begin{cases}  n-3 & \mbox{if }n\ge 1000 \\  f(f(n+5)) & \mbox{if }n<1000. \end{cases}\]Find $f(84)$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Denote by (1) and (2) the two parts of the definition of $f$, respectively. If we begin to use the definition of $f$ to compute $f(84)$, we use (2) until the argument is at least $1000$: \[f(84) = f(f(89)) = f(f(f(94))) = \dots = f^N(1004)\](where $f^N$ denotes composing $f$ with itself $N$ times, for some $N$). The numbers $84, 89, 94, \dots, 1004$ form an arithmetic sequence with common difference $5$; since $1004 - 84 = 920 = 184 \cdot 5$, this sequence has $184 + 1 = 185$ terms, so $N = 185$.

At this point, (1) and (2) are both used: we compute \[\begin{aligned} f^N(1004) &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-1}(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-1}(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(1000) \\ &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(997) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1002) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(999) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1004). \end{aligned}\]Repeating this process, we see that \[f^N(1004) = f^{N-2}(1004) = f^{N-4}(1004) = \dots = f^3(1004).\](The pattern breaks down for $f^k(1004)$ when $k$ is small, so it is not true that $f^3(1004) = f(1004)$.) Now, we have \[f^3(1004) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^2(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^2(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(1000) \stackrel{(1)}{=} \boxed{997}.\] The answer is $\boxed{997}$

First, we define the function $f$ as a symbol.

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

def find_f_of_100():
    n, f100 = symbols('n f100')

    f_of_1 = solve(equation2, f100)[0]

    f_of_100 = 100
    while f_of_100 > 1:
        f_of_100 = solution[0].subs(n, f_of_100)
    
    return f_of_100

result = find_f_of_100()
print(result)

INTERMEDIATE OUT :

The above code is not working as expected because we are trying to solve an equation with a symbol that has already been assigned a value (100) in the previous step. Let's try another approach.

We know that $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. Let's find $f(f(f(1)))$ using this equation. We know that $f(1) = x$, where $x$ is some integer. So we have:

$$f(f(f(1))) = f(f(x)) = f(y) = z,$$

where $y$ and $z$ are some integers. We can substitute $n = 1$ into the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$ to find $z$:

$$z = f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = 1.$$

So we have $f(f(x)) = 1$. Now we can substitute $n = x$ into the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to find $f(x)$:

$$f(x) = 2f(x/2) + 1.$$

Substituting $f(x) = x$ (since $f(1) = x$), we get:

$$x = 2f(x/2) + 1.$$

Solving this equation for $x$, we get $x = 3$. So $f(1) = 3$.

Now we can find $f(100)$ by repeatedly applying the equation $f(f(n)) = n$ until we reach $f(1)$:

$$f(100) = f(f(f(100))) = f(f(3)) = f(1) = 3.$$

So $f(100) = 3$. The value of $f(100)$ is 3. The answer is: $\boxed{3}$
