**Problem:** 
"Find the number of 10-tuples $(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{10})$ of real numbers such that
\[(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2 = \frac{1}{11}.\]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,
\begin{align*}
&[(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + \dots + 1^2 + 1^2)][(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2] \\
&\ge [(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + (x_2 - x_3) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10}]^2 = 1.
\end{align*}From the given condition, we have equality, so by the equality condition for Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[\frac{1 - x_1}{1} = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{1} = \frac{x_2 - x_3}{1} = \dots = \frac{x_9 - x_{10}}{1} = \frac{x_{10}}{1}.\]Let
\[d = 1 - x_1 = x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_3 = \dots = x_9 - x_{10} = x_{10}.\]Then
\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so
\[(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_{10}) = \left( \frac{10}{11}, \frac{9}{11}, \frac{8}{11}, \dots, \frac{1}{11} \right).\]In particular, there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


First, we need to understand the given equation. The equation is of the form $A \cdot B = 0$, which means that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the points that satisfy the equation are either those that make $A = 0$ or $B = 0$.

Let's consider each term separately:

1. $A = (\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. This is a pair of lines: $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.
2. $B = (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This is a pair of lines: $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.
3. $C = (\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x \vert = 8$. This is a pair of lines: $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.
4. $D = (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert y \vert = 8$. This is a pair of lines: $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

The intersection points of these lines form a rectangle with side lengths of 16 and 20. The area of this rectangle is $16 \times 20 = 320$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 320. The answer is: $320$

To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step.

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we first need to understand that the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. 

This means that the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equation are those that satisfy any of the conditions $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$. These conditions describe the sides of a square with side length 16 (for the conditions $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$), and two squares with side length 20 (for the conditions $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$).

The area of the square with side length 16 is $16^2 = 256$, and the area of each square with side length 20 is $20^2 = 400$. Therefore, the total area of the polygon is $256 + 2 \cdot 400 = 1056$.

However, this result is incorrect. The mistake in the above reasoning is that the conditions $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ do not describe squares but rather diamonds. The correct interpretation of the conditions is as follows:

- $\vert x + y \vert = 10$: This is a line segment with slope $-1$ and $1$ passing through the point $(0, 10)$ and $(0, -10)$, respectively.
- $\vert x - y \vert = 10$: This is a line segment with slope $1$ and $-1$ passing through the point $(10, 0)$ and $(-10, 0)$, respectively.
- $\vert x \vert = 8$: This is a pair of vertical lines at $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.
- $\vert y \vert = 8$: This is a pair of horizontal lines at $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

The intersection points of these lines are the vertices of the square with side length 16. Therefore, the correct area of the polygon is indeed $16^2 = 256$.

However, this result is still incorrect. The mistake in the above reasoning is that we have not considered the full implications of the conditions. The conditions $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ actually describe squares with side length 20, not diamonds. The correct interpretation of the conditions is as follows:

- $\vert x + y \vert = 10$: This is a square with side length 20 and vertices at $(0, 10)$, $(10, 0)$, $(0, -10)$, and $(-10, 0)$.
- $\vert x - y \vert = 10$: This is another square with side length 20 and vertices at $(10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, and $(-10, 0)$.

The intersection of these two squares is the square with side length 16. Therefore, the correct area of the polygon is indeed $256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so

**Solution:** 


The given equation is a product of two terms, each of which is a square. Therefore, the equation is equal to zero if and only if each term is equal to zero. This gives us two systems of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first system, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are given by:

- For $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, we have $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
- For $\vert x \vert = 8$, we have $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.

Similarly, for the second system, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are given by:

- For $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, we have $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
- For $\vert y \vert = 8$, we have $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

Plotting these lines on a coordinate plane, we find that they enclose a square with side length 16. Therefore, the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is $\boxed{256}$.

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we first need to understand the given equation and the conditions that make it equal to zero. The equation is:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$

This equation will be equal to zero if either of the two factors is zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first case, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two squares with side length 10.

For the second case, either $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two squares with side length 8.

The intersection of these squares forms a larger square with side length 10 and a smaller square with side length 8. The area of the convex polygon is the difference between the areas of these two squares.

The area of a square with side length $a$ is $a^2$. Therefore, the area of the larger square is $10^2 = 100$ and the area of the smaller square is $8^2 = 64$. The area of the convex polygon is $100 - 64 = 36$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 36.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    # Calculate the area of the larger square
    area_larger_square = 10**2

    # Calculate the area of the smaller square

    # Calculate the area of the convex polygon
    area_polygon = area_larger_square - area_smaller_square

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


This problem is asking for the area of a polygon formed by the points that satisfy the given equation. The equation is a product of two terms, each of which is a squared expression. The product is zero if and only if at least one of the terms is zero. Therefore, we need to find the points that make each term zero and analyze the geometry of the resulting regions.

1. For the first term, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which is the equation of a line in the plane. Similarly, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ when $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which is also the equation of a line in the plane. The intersection of these two lines is a square with side length 20.

2. For the second term, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ when $\vert x \vert = 8$, which is the equation of two vertical lines at $x = 8$ and $x = -8$. Similarly, $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ when $\vert y \vert = 8$, which is the equation of two horizontal lines at $y = 8$ and $y = -8$. The intersection of these four lines is a square with side length 16.

The convex polygon formed by the intersection of the regions defined by the two terms is a smaller square inside the larger square. The side length of the smaller square is the distance between the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$, which is 16. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of the smaller square, which is $16^2 = 256$.
