**Problem:** 
"How many square units are in the area of the triangle whose vertices are the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the curve $y = (x-3)^2 (x+2)$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we need to find where this curve intersects the $x$ and $y$ axes.  If $y=0$, then $(x-3)^2(x+2)=0$, which has solutions of $x=3$ and $x=-2$.  If $x=0$, then $y=(-3)^2(2)=18$.  So, the curve has two $x$-intercepts and one $y$-intercept.  The length of the base along the $x$-axis is $3-(-2)=5$.  The height from this base is equal to the $y$-intercept, 18.  The area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 5\cdot 18=\boxed{45}$. The answer is $\boxed{45}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

The first term is zero when $|x+y| = 10$ and $|x-y| = 10$. These are the equations of two lines in the plane, so they form a rectangle.

The second term is zero when $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. These are also the equations of two lines in the plane, so they form a square.

The intersection of the two shapes is the convex polygon we are looking for. The rectangle has side lengths of 20 units (from $-10$ to $10$ on each axis), and the square has side lengths of 16 units (from $-8$ to $8$ on each axis).

The area of the rectangle is $20 \times 20 = 400$ square units, and the area of the square is $16 \times 16 = 256$ square units.

The intersection of the two shapes is the convex polygon we are looking for. The area of this polygon is the area of the rectangle minus the area of the square, which is $400 - 256 = 144$ square units.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 144 square units.

    # Calculate the areas of the rectangle and square
    rectangle_area = 20 * 20
    square_area = 16 * 16

    # Calculate the area of the polygon
    polygon_area = rectangle_area - square_area

    return polygon_area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

The area of the convex polygon is 144 square units. The answer is $\boxed{144}$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.
2. The first term is zero when either $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x-y| - 10 = 0$. This implies $|x+y| = 10$ or $|x-y| = 10$.
3. The second term is zero when either $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$. This implies $|x| = 8$ or $|y| = 8$.
4. Solving these equations, we get the points that satisfy the equation are $(8,0), (0,8), (-8,0), (0,-8), (0,0), (8,8), (-8,-8), (8,-8), (-8,8)$.
5. These points form a square with side length 16.
6. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256.

```python

from sympy import symbols, solve, Abs

def area_of_polygon():
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # The equation is a product of two terms equal to zero
    # Either the first term is zero or the second term is zero
    # The first term is zero when either |x+y| - 10 = 0 or |x-y| - 10 = 0
    # This implies |x+y| = 10 or |x-y| = 10
    # The second term is zero when either |x| - 8 = 0 or |y| - 8 = 0
    # This implies |x| = 8 or |y| = 8
    # Solving these equations, we get the points that satisfy the equation
    # These points form a square with side length 16
    # The area of the square is 16^2 = 256

    # Solve for x and y
    solutions = solve([Abs(x + y) - 10, Abs(x - y) - 10, Abs(x) - 8, Abs(y) - 8], (x, y))

    # The area of the square is side^2

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. This means that the points that satisfy the equation are either on the curve defined by the first expression being zero or on the curve defined by the second expression being zero.

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, which is zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two squares with side length 20 centered at the origin. The intersection of these squares is a square with side length 10 centered at the origin.

The second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$, which is zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two squares with side length 16 centered at the origin. The intersection of these squares is a square with side length 8 centered at the origin.

The convex polygon enclosed by the points satisfying the equation is the intersection of these two squares, which is a square with side length 8 centered at the origin. The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 64.

## QUESTION 3 - 6

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Find the number of 10-tuples $(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{10})$ of real numbers such that
\[(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2 = \frac{1}{11}.\]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,
\begin{align*}
&[(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + \dots + 1^2 + 1^2)][(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2] \\
&\ge [(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + (x_2 - x_3) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10}]^2 = 1.
\end{align*}From the given condition, we have equality, so by the equality condition for Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[\frac{1 - x_1}{1} = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{1} = \frac{x_2 - x_3}{1} = \dots = \frac{x_9 - x_{10}}{1} = \frac{x_{10}}{1}.\]Let
\[d = 1 - x_1 = x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_3 = \dots = x_9 - x_{10} = x_{10}.\]Then
\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so
\[(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_{10}) = \left( \frac{10}{11}, \frac{9}{11}, \frac{8}{11}, \dots, \frac{1}{11} \right).\]In particular, there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Solution:**


The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

The first term is zero when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two circles with radius 10 centered at $(0, 0)$ and $(0, 0)$ respectively.

The second term is zero when $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two circles with radius 8 centered at $(0, 0)$ and $(0, 0)$ respectively.

The intersection of these four circles forms a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256.
