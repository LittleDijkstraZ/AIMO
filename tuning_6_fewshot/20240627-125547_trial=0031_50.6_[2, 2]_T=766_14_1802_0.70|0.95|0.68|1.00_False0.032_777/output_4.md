**Example**

**Problem:** 
"The function $f$ is defined on the set of integers and satisfies \[f(n)= \begin{cases}  n-3 & \mbox{if }n\ge 1000 \\  f(f(n+5)) & \mbox{if }n<1000. \end{cases}\]Find $f(84)$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Denote by (1) and (2) the two parts of the definition of $f$, respectively. If we begin to use the definition of $f$ to compute $f(84)$, we use (2) until the argument is at least $1000$: \[f(84) = f(f(89)) = f(f(f(94))) = \dots = f^N(1004)\](where $f^N$ denotes composing $f$ with itself $N$ times, for some $N$). The numbers $84, 89, 94, \dots, 1004$ form an arithmetic sequence with common difference $5$; since $1004 - 84 = 920 = 184 \cdot 5$, this sequence has $184 + 1 = 185$ terms, so $N = 185$.

At this point, (1) and (2) are both used: we compute \[\begin{aligned} f^N(1004) &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-1}(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-1}(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(1000) \\ &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(997) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1002) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(999) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1004). \end{aligned}\]Repeating this process, we see that \[f^N(1004) = f^{N-2}(1004) = f^{N-4}(1004) = \dots = f^3(1004).\](The pattern breaks down for $f^k(1004)$ when $k$ is small, so it is not true that $f^3(1004) = f(1004)$.) Now, we have \[f^3(1004) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^2(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^2(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(1000) \stackrel{(1)}{=} \boxed{997}.\] The answer is $\boxed{997}$

**Problem**
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



First, we need to find the value of $f(100)$ given the conditions $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.

We can start by calculating $f(f(f(100)))$ using the first condition. This gives us $8*100 - 7 = 793$.

Now we know that $f(f(f(100))) = 793$, so we can set up the equation $f(f(f(100))) = 8*100 - 7 = 793$.

From this, we can find that $f(f(100)) = f(793)$.

Next, we need to find the value of $f(793)$ using the second condition. We know that $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, so we can set up the equation $f(793) = 2f(396.5) + 1$.

But $396.5$ is not a valid input for a function defined on the set of natural numbers, so we must have made a mistake. Let's go back and try a different approach.

We can start by setting $n = 100$ in the second condition and find the value of $f(200)$.

We have $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$.

Now we can substitute $f(200)$ into the first condition: $f(f(f(100))) = f(f(200)) = 8*100 - 7 = 793$.

We know that $f(f(200)) = 793$, so we can set up the equation $f(f(200)) = f(793)$.

Now we can substitute $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$ into this equation: $f(793) = 2f(100) + 1$.

Now we can substitute this into the equation $f(f(f(100))) = 793$: $f(2f(100) + 1) = 793$.

Let's denote $f(100)$ as $x$. Then we have $f(2x + 1) = 793$.

We can guess and check values of $x$ to find the value of $f(100)$ that satisfies this equation.

After trying different values, we find that when $x = 99$, $f(2x + 1) = f(199) = 793$.

So we have $f(100) = 99$.

Therefore, the value of $f(100)$ is $99$.

The answer is: $99$

**Solution:** 



To solve this problem, we will use the second equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to find the value of $f(100)$. 

Since $100 = 2 \cdot 50$, we can use the equation to find $f(100)$ in terms of $f(50)$. So, $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.

Now, $50 = 2 \cdot 25$, so we can find $f(50)$ in terms of $f(25)$. Thus, $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.

Continuing, $25 = 2 \cdot 12 + 1$, so $25 = 2 \cdot 12 + 1 = 25$. Therefore, $f(25) = 2f(12) + 1$.

Now, $12 = 2 \cdot 6$, so we can find $f(12)$ in terms of $f(6)$. Thus, $f(12) = 2f(6) + 1$.

Continuing, $6 = 2 \cdot 3$, so we can find $f(6)$ in terms of $f(3)$. Thus, $f(6) = 2f(3) + 1$.

Finally, $3 = 3$, so we can use the first equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. Since $f(f(f(3))) = 8 \cdot 3 - 7 = 19$, we can find $f(3)$ by solving the equation $f(f(3)) = 19$.

By substituting $n = 3$ into the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, we get $f(6) = 2f(3) + 1$. Substituting $f(6) = 2f(3) + 1$ into the equation $f(12) = 2f(6) + 1$, we get $f(12) = 2(2f(3) + 1) + 1 = 4f(3) + 3$. Substituting $f(12) = 4f(3) + 3$ into the equation $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$, we get $f(50) = 2(4f(3) + 3) + 1 = 8f(3) + 7$.

Substituting $f(50) = 8f(3) + 7$ into the equation $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$, we get $f(100) = 2(8f(3) + 7) + 1 = 16f(3) + 15$. Since $f(3)$ is a solution to the equation $f(f(f(3))) = 8 \cdot 3 - 7 = 19$, we can solve for $f(3)$ by substituting $f(3)$ into the equation $f(f(f(3))) = 19$. We find that $f(3) = 3$.

Substituting $f(3) = 3$ into the equation $f(100) = 16f(3) + 15$, we get $f(100) = 16 \cdot 3 + 15 = 63$.

So, $f(100) = 63$. The answer is: $63$

## QUESTION 4 - 2

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $
f(n) =
\begin{cases}
n^2+1 & \text{if }n\text{ is odd} \\
\dfrac{n}{2} & \text{if }n\text{ is even}
\end{cases}.
$

For how many integers $n$ from 1 to 100, inclusive, does $f ( f (\dotsb f (n) \dotsb )) = 1$ for some number of applications of $f$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we note that if $n$ is a positive integer, then $f(n)$ is also a positive integer.  We claim that $f ( f (\dotsb f (n) \dotsb )) = 1$ for some number of applications of $f$ only for $n = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32,$ and $64.$  (In other words, $n$ must be a power of 2.)

Note that $f(1) = 2,$ so $f(f(1)) = f(2) = 1.$  If $n > 1$ is a power of 2, it is easy to see that repeated applications of $f$ on $n$ eventually reach 1.

Suppose $n$ is an odd positive integer, where $n > 1.$  Write $n = 2k + 1,$ where $k$ is a positive integer.  Since $n$ is odd,
\[f(n) = n^2 + 1 = (2k + 1)^2 + 1 = 4k^2 + 4k + 2 = 2(2k^2 + 2k + 1).\]Since $2k^2 + 2k$ is always even, $2k^2 + 2k + 1$ is always odd (and greater than 1), so $f(n)$ can never be a power of 2 when $n$ is odd and greater than 1.

Now, suppose $n$ is even.  For example, if $n = 2^3 \cdot 11,$ then
\[f(2^3 \cdot 11) = f(2^2 \cdot 11) = f(2 \cdot 11) = f(11),\]which we know is not a power of 2.

More generally, suppose $n = 2^e \cdot m,$ where $e$ is nonnegative and $m$ is odd.  Then
\[f(2^e \cdot m) = f(2^{e - 1} \cdot m) = f(2^{e - 2} \cdot m) = \dots = f(m).\]If $m = 1,$ then $n$ is a power of 2, and the sequence eventually reaches 1.  Otherwise, $f(m)$ is not a power of 2.  We also know that $f(m)$ is odd and greater than 1, $f(f(m))$ is not a power of 2 either, and so on.  Thus, the sequence can never reach 1.

Therefore, $n$ must be one of the $\boxed{7}$ values 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, or 64. The answer is $\boxed{7}$

We made a mistake in our approach. The function $f(n)$ is not directly solvable from the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. However, we can notice that $f(n)$ is an increasing function, and it maps from the set of positive integers to itself. Also, from the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can infer that $f(n)$ is an odd function when $n$ is even.

Let's try a different approach. We can start by calculating the first few values of $f(n)$ using the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. 

```python

def calculate_f_100():
    # Initialize the function f(n)

    # Now we can calculate f(100) using the equation f(f(f(n)))=8n-7
    f_100 = 8*100 - 7
    while f_100 not in f:
        f_100 = f[f_100]

    return f_100

We made another mistake. The function $f(n)$ is not defined for all positive integers $n$ using the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. This equation only defines $f(n)$ for even $n$, but we need $f(n)$ for odd $n$ as well. 

Let's try one more time. This time, we will define a recursive function to calculate $f(n)$ using the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $
f(n) =
\begin{cases}
n^2+1 & \text{if }n\text{ is odd} \\
\dfrac{n}{2} & \text{if }n\text{ is even}
\end{cases}.
$

For how many integers $n$ from 1 to 100, inclusive, does $f ( f (\dotsb f (n) \dotsb )) = 1$ for some number of applications of $f$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we note that if $n$ is a positive integer, then $f(n)$ is also a positive integer.  We claim that $f ( f (\dotsb f (n) \dotsb )) = 1$ for some number of applications of $f$ only for $n = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32,$ and $64.$  (In other words, $n$ must be a power of 2.)

Note that $f(1) = 2,$ so $f(f(1)) = f(2) = 1.$  If $n > 1$ is a power of 2, it is easy to see that repeated applications of $f$ on $n$ eventually reach 1.

Suppose $n$ is an odd positive integer, where $n > 1.$  Write $n = 2k + 1,$ where $k$ is a positive integer.  Since $n$ is odd,
\[f(n) = n^2 + 1 = (2k + 1)^2 + 1 = 4k^2 + 4k + 2 = 2(2k^2 + 2k + 1).\]Since $2k^2 + 2k$ is always even, $2k^2 + 2k + 1$ is always odd (and greater than 1), so $f(n)$ can never be a power of 2 when $n$ is odd and greater than 1.

Now, suppose $n$ is even.  For example, if $n = 2^3 \cdot 11,$ then
\[f(2^3 \cdot 11) = f(2^2 \cdot 11) = f(2 \cdot 11) = f(11),\]which we know is not a power of 2.

More generally, suppose $n = 2^e \cdot m,$ where $e$ is nonnegative and $m$ is odd.  Then
\[f(2^e \cdot m) = f(2^{e - 1} \cdot m) = f(2^{e - 2} \cdot m) = \dots = f(m).\]If $m = 1,$ then $n$ is a power of 2, and the sequence eventually reaches 1.  Otherwise, $f(m)$ is not a power of 2.  We also know that $f(m)$ is odd and greater than 1, $f(f(m))$ is not a power of 2 either, and so on.  Thus, the sequence can never reach 1.

Therefore, $n$ must be one of the $\boxed{7}$ values 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, or 64. The answer is $\boxed{7}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
**Problem**
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


To solve this problem, we need to find the value of $f(100)$ using the given conditions.

We can start by substituting $n=1$ into the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to get $f(2)=2f(1)+1$.

Then we substitute $n=f(1)$ into the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to get $f(f(f(f(1))))=8f(1)-7$.

Since $f(f(f(f(1)))) = f(f(2)) = f(2f(1)+1)$, we can equate this to $8f(1)-7$ to get $f(2f(1)+1) = 8f(1)-7$.

Now, substituting $n=2$ into the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we get $f(4)=2f(2)+1$.

Substituting $f(2)=2f(1)+1$ into this equation, we get $f(4)=2(2f(1)+1)+1=4f(1)+3$.

Comparing this with $f(2f(1)+1) = 8f(1)-7$, we have $4f(1)+3 = 8f(1)-7$.

Solving this equation for $f(1)$, we get $f(1)=5$.

Now we can find $f(100)$ by repeatedly applying the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.

We have $f(100) = f(2 \cdot 50) = 2f(50) + 1$.

Similarly, $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$ and $f(25) = 2f(12.5)$.

But $12.5$ is not an integer, so we must have made a mistake in our calculations.

Let's go back and check our work.

We found that $f(1)=5$.

Substituting $n=1$ into the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we get $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$.

So $f(f(5))=1$.

Substituting $n=5$ into the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we get $f(10)=2f(5)+1=2*5+1=11$.

But $f(f(5))=1$ means $f(11)=1$.

Substituting $n=11$ into the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we get $f(22)=2f(11)+1=2*1+1=3$.

Substituting $n=22$ into the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we get $f(44)=2f(22)+1=2*3+1=7$.

Substituting $n=44$ into the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we get $f(88)=2f(44)+1=2*7+1=15$.

And so on.

By continuing this process, we find that $f(100)=191$.

Therefore, the value of $f(100)$ is $191$.

The answer is: $191$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $
f(n) =
\begin{cases}
n^2+1 & \text{if }n\text{ is odd} \\
\dfrac{n}{2} & \text{if }n\text{ is even}
\end{cases}.
$

For how many integers $n$ from 1 to 100, inclusive, does $f ( f (\dotsb f (n) \dotsb )) = 1$ for some number of applications of $f$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we note that if $n$ is a positive integer, then $f(n)$ is also a positive integer.  We claim that $f ( f (\dotsb f (n) \dotsb )) = 1$ for some number of applications of $f$ only for $n = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32,$ and $64.$  (In other words, $n$ must be a power of 2.)

Note that $f(1) = 2,$ so $f(f(1)) = f(2) = 1.$  If $n > 1$ is a power of 2, it is easy to see that repeated applications of $f$ on $n$ eventually reach 1.

Suppose $n$ is an odd positive integer, where $n > 1.$  Write $n = 2k + 1,$ where $k$ is a positive integer.  Since $n$ is odd,
\[f(n) = n^2 + 1 = (2k + 1)^2 + 1 = 4k^2 + 4k + 2 = 2(2k^2 + 2k + 1).\]Since $2k^2 + 2k$ is always even, $2k^2 + 2k + 1$ is always odd (and greater than 1), so $f(n)$ can never be a power of 2 when $n$ is odd and greater than 1.

Now, suppose $n$ is even.  For example, if $n = 2^3 \cdot 11,$ then
\[f(2^3 \cdot 11) = f(2^2 \cdot 11) = f(2 \cdot 11) = f(11),\]which we know is not a power of 2.

More generally, suppose $n = 2^e \cdot m,$ where $e$ is nonnegative and $m$ is odd.  Then
\[f(2^e \cdot m) = f(2^{e - 1} \cdot m) = f(2^{e - 2} \cdot m) = \dots = f(m).\]If $m = 1,$ then $n$ is a power of 2, and the sequence eventually reaches 1.  Otherwise, $f(m)$ is not a power of 2.  We also know that $f(m)$ is odd and greater than 1, $f(f(m))$ is not a power of 2 either, and so on.  Thus, the sequence can never reach 1.

Therefore, $n$ must be one of the $\boxed{7}$ values 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, or 64. The answer is $\boxed{7}$

**Problem**
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


To find the value of $f(100)$, we can use the second equation provided in the problem. Since we know that $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, we can find $f(100)$ by first finding $f(50)$ and then using the equation to find $f(100)$.

We can start by finding $f(50)$ using the second equation. If we let $n = 25$, then $2n = 50$. So we have:
\[f(50) = 2f(25) + 1.\]
We don't know the value of $f(25)$ yet, but we can find it using the same equation. If we let $n = 12.5$, then $2n = 25$. But $n$ must be a positive integer, so this approach doesn't work.

However, we can use the first equation provided in the problem to find $f(25)$. If we let $n = 12$, then $f(f(f(12))) = 8*12 - 7 = 88$. From the first equation, we can say that $f(f(12)) = 25$, and therefore $f(25) = 12$.

Now we can substitute this value into the equation for $f(50)$:
\[f(50) = 2*12 + 1 = 25.\]

Finally, we can use the second equation to find $f(100)$:
\[f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2*25 + 1 = 51.\]

So $f(100) = 51$. The answer is: $51$.

Now, suppose $n$ is even.  For example, if $n = 2^3 \cdot 11,$ then
\[f(2^3 \cdot 11) = f(2^2 \cdot 11) = f(2 \cdot 11) = f(11),\]which we know is not a power of 2.

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we will first try to find the value of $f(1)$.
From the second equation, we have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.
Substituting this into the first equation, we get $f(f(f(1))) = f(f(2)) = f(2f(1) + 1)$.
We know that $f(f(f(1))) = 8 \cdot 1 - 7 = -1$, so $f(2f(1) + 1) = -1$.
Since $2f(1) + 1$ must be positive, we have $2f(1) + 1 = 1$, which gives $f(1) = 0$.
Now we can find $f(100)$ using the second equation:
$f(2 \cdot 100) = 2f(100) + 1$.
So $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$.
But from the first equation, we know that $f(f(f(100))) = 8 \cdot 100 - 7 = 793$.
And $f(f(f(100))) = f(f(200)) = f(2f(100) + 1)$.
We know that $2f(100) + 1$ must be positive, so $2f(100) + 1 = 793$, which gives $2f(100) = 792$ and $f(100) = 396$.
Therefore, $f(100) = 396$.
The answer is $\boxed{396}$.

Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Consider the expression $f(f(f(a))).$  Since $f(f(a)) = 2a,$ this is equal to $f(2a).$  But taking $n = f(a)$ in $f(f(n)) = 2n,$ we get
\[f(f(f(a))) = 2f(a).\]Hence,
\[f(2a) = 2f(a)\]for all positive integers $a.$

Then
\[f(1000) = 2f(500) = 4f(250) = 8f(125).\]Taking $n = 31$ in $f(4n + 1) = 4n + 3,$ we get
\[f(125) = 127,\]so $f(1000) = \boxed{1016}.$ The answer is $\boxed{1016}$

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


To solve this problem, we need to find the value of $f(100)$ using the given conditions. 

Let's first find the value of $f(1)$. We know that $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$, so $f(f(1))=1$ and $f(1)=1$.

Now let's find the value of $f(2)$. We know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, so $f(2)=2f(1)+1=2*1+1=3$.

Then let's find the value of $f(3)$. We know that $f(f(f(3)))=8*3-7=17$, but we also know that $f(f(3))=f(2*1.5)=2f(1.5)+1=2f(3/2)+1$. Since $f(f(f(1)))=1$, we have $f(f(1))=1$ and $f(1)=1$. Therefore, $f(3/2)=1$. So $2f(3/2)+1=2*1+1=3$. But we know that $f(2)=3$, so $f(3)=3$.

Continuing this way, we can find that $f(4)=5$, $f(5)=7$, and so on.

We can see that $f(n)=2n-1$ for all positive integers $n$. So $f(100)=2*100-1=199$.

The value of $f(100)$ is $199$.
The answer is: $199$.

**Problem:** 
"The function $f$ is defined on the set of integers and satisfies \[f(n)= \begin{cases}  n-3 & \mbox{if }n\ge 1000 \\  f(f(n+5)) & \mbox{if }n<1000. \end{cases}\]Find $f(84)$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Denote by (1) and (2) the two parts of the definition of $f$, respectively. If we begin to use the definition of $f$ to compute $f(84)$, we use (2) until the argument is at least $1000$: \[f(84) = f(f(89)) = f(f(f(94))) = \dots = f^N(1004)\](where $f^N$ denotes composing $f$ with itself $N$ times, for some $N$). The numbers $84, 89, 94, \dots, 1004$ form an arithmetic sequence with common difference $5$; since $1004 - 84 = 920 = 184 \cdot 5$, this sequence has $184 + 1 = 185$ terms, so $N = 185$.

At this point, (1) and (2) are both used: we compute \[\begin{aligned} f^N(1004) &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-1}(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-1}(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(1000) \\ &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(997) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1002) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(999) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1004). \end{aligned}\]Repeating this process, we see that \[f^N(1004) = f^{N-2}(1004) = f^{N-4}(1004) = \dots = f^3(1004).\](The pattern breaks down for $f^k(1004)$ when $k$ is small, so it is not true that $f^3(1004) = f(1004)$.) Now, we have \[f^3(1004) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^2(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^2(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(1000) \stackrel{(1)}{=} \boxed{997}.\] The answer is $\boxed{997}$

**Solution:** 


We are given that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We want to find $f(100)$.

We can start by setting $n=50$ in the second equation to get $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$. We then substitute $n=25$ into the second equation to get $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$. Continuing in this way, we can keep substituting smaller values of $n$ until we can use the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$.

Let's start with $n=25$:
\[f(50) = 2f(25) + 1.\]
Then $n=12.5$, but $n$ must be an integer, so we cannot proceed in this way.

Instead, let's try to use the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. If we set $n=100$, we get
\[f(f(f(100))) = 8 \cdot 100 - 7 = 793.\]
Then, if we set $n=f(100)$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=793$, we get
\[f(f(f(f(100)))) = 793.\]
But we know that $f(f(f(100))) = 793$, so we have
\[f(793) = 793.\]

Now let's try to find $f(50)$ using the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. If we set $n=25$, we get
\[f(50) = 2f(25) + 1.\]
But we don't know $f(25)$ yet. So let's try to find $f(25)$ using the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. If we set $n=12.5$, but $n$ must be an integer, so we cannot proceed in this way.

Instead, let's try to use the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. If we set $n=25$, we get
\[f(f(f(25))) = 8 \cdot 25 - 7 = 193.\]
Then, if we set $n=f(25)$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=193$, we get
\[f(f(f(f(25)))) = 193.\]
But we know that $f(f(f(25))) = 193$, so we have
\[f(193) = 193.\]

Now we can substitute $f(193) = 193$ into the equation $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$ to get
\[f(50) = 2 \cdot 193 + 1 = 387.\]

Finally, let's substitute $f(50) = 387$ into the equation $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$ to get
\[f(100) = 2 \cdot 387 + 1 = 775.\]

But we know that $f(f(f(100))) = 793$, and we know that $f(193) = 193$. So let's try to find $f(775)$ using the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. If we set $n=775$, we get
\[f(f(f(775))) = 8 \cdot 775 - 7 = 6203.\]
Then, if we set $n=f(775)$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=6203$, we get
\[f(f(f(f(775)))) = 6203.\]
But we know that $f(f(f(775))) = 6203$, so we have
\[f(6203) = 6203.\]

Now we have $f(6203) = 6203$ and $f(775) = 6203$, but we know that $f(193) = 193$, so we can substitute $f(193) = 193$ into the equation $f(775) = 6203$ to get
\[193 = 6203,\]
which is not possible.

So we must have made a mistake somewhere. Let's go back and check our work.

We found that $f(100) = 775$. Then we substituted $f(100) = 775$ into the equation $f(f(f(100))) = 793$, but we should have substituted $f(100) = 775$ into the equation $f(2 \cdot 100) = 2f(100) + 1$, which gives us
\[f(200) = 2 \cdot 775 + 1 = 1551.\]

Now let's substitute $f(200) = 1551$ into the equation $f(f(f(200))) = 793$. If we set $n=200$, we get
\[f(f(f(200))) = 793.\]
Then, if we set $n=f(200)$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=793$, we get
\[f(f(f(f(200)))) = 793.\]
But we know that $f(f(f(200))) = 793$, so we have
\[f(793) = 793.\]

Now we can substitute $f(793) = 793$ into the equation $f(200) = 1551$ to get
\[793 = 1551,\]
which is not possible.

So we must have made another mistake. Let's go back and check our work again.

We found that $f(100) = 775$. Then we substituted $f(100) = 775$ into the equation $f(2 \cdot 100) = 2f(100) + 1$, but we should have substituted $f(100) = 775$ into the equation $f(f(100)) = 793$, which gives us
\[f(775) = 793.\]

Now let's substitute $f(775) = 793$ into the equation $f(2 \cdot 100) = 2f(100) + 1$. If we set $n=100$, we get
\[f(200) = 2f(100) + 1.\]
But we know that $f(100) = 775$, so we have
\[f(200) = 2 \cdot 775 + 1 = 1551.\]

Finally, let's substitute $f(200) = 1551$ into the equation $f(f(f(200))) = 793$. If we

**Problem:** 
"Let $
f(n) =
\begin{cases}
n^2+1 & \text{if }n\text{ is odd} \\
\dfrac{n}{2} & \text{if }n\text{ is even}
\end{cases}.
$

For how many integers $n$ from 1 to 100, inclusive, does $f ( f (\dotsb f (n) \dotsb )) = 1$ for some number of applications of $f$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we note that if $n$ is a positive integer, then $f(n)$ is also a positive integer.  We claim that $f ( f (\dotsb f (n) \dotsb )) = 1$ for some number of applications of $f$ only for $n = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32,$ and $64.$  (In other words, $n$ must be a power of 2.)

Note that $f(1) = 2,$ so $f(f(1)) = f(2) = 1.$  If $n > 1$ is a power of 2, it is easy to see that repeated applications of $f$ on $n$ eventually reach 1.

Suppose $n$ is an odd positive integer, where $n > 1.$  Write $n = 2k + 1,$ where $k$ is a positive integer.  Since $n$ is odd,
\[f(n) = n^2 + 1 = (2k + 1)^2 + 1 = 4k^2 + 4k + 2 = 2(2k^2 + 2k + 1).\]Since $2k^2 + 2k$ is always even, $2k^2 + 2k + 1$ is always odd (and greater than 1), so $f(n)$ can never be a power of 2 when $n$ is odd and greater than 1.

Now, suppose $n$ is even.  For example, if $n = 2^3 \cdot 11,$ then
\[f(2^3 \cdot 11) = f(2^2 \cdot 11) = f(2 \cdot 11) = f(11),\]which we know is not a power of 2.

More generally, suppose $n = 2^e \cdot m,$ where $e$ is nonnegative and $m$ is odd.  Then
\[f(2^e \cdot m) = f(2^{e - 1} \cdot m) = f(2^{e - 2} \cdot m) = \dots = f(m).\]If $m = 1,$ then $n$ is a power of 2, and the sequence eventually reaches 1.  Otherwise, $f(m)$ is not a power of 2.  We also know that $f(m)$ is odd and greater than 1, $f(f(m))$ is not a power of 2 either, and so on.  Thus, the sequence can never reach 1.

Therefore, $n$ must be one of the $\boxed{7}$ values 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, or 64. The answer is $\boxed{7}$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $
f(n) =
\begin{cases}
n^2+1 & \text{if }n\text{ is odd} \\
\dfrac{n}{2} & \text{if }n\text{ is even}
\end{cases}.
$

For how many integers $n$ from 1 to 100, inclusive, does $f ( f (\dotsb f (n) \dotsb )) = 1$ for some number of applications of $f$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we note that if $n$ is a positive integer, then $f(n)$ is also a positive integer.  We claim that $f ( f (\dotsb f (n) \dotsb )) = 1$ for some number of applications of $f$ only for $n = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32,$ and $64.$  (In other words, $n$ must be a power of 2.)

Note that $f(1) = 2,$ so $f(f(1)) = f(2) = 1.$  If $n > 1$ is a power of 2, it is easy to see that repeated applications of $f$ on $n$ eventually reach 1.

Suppose $n$ is an odd positive integer, where $n > 1.$  Write $n = 2k + 1,$ where $k$ is a positive integer.  Since $n$ is odd,
\[f(n) = n^2 + 1 = (2k + 1)^2 + 1 = 4k^2 + 4k + 2 = 2(2k^2 + 2k + 1).\]Since $2k^2 + 2k$ is always even, $2k^2 + 2k + 1$ is always odd (and greater than 1), so $f(n)$ can never be a power of 2 when $n$ is odd and greater than 1.

Now, suppose $n$ is even.  For example, if $n = 2^3 \cdot 11,$ then
\[f(2^3 \cdot 11) = f(2^2 \cdot 11) = f(2 \cdot 11) = f(11),\]which we know is not a power of 2.

More generally, suppose $n = 2^e \cdot m,$ where $e$ is nonnegative and $m$ is odd.  Then
\[f(2^e \cdot m) = f(2^{e - 1} \cdot m) = f(2^{e - 2} \cdot m) = \dots = f(m).\]If $m = 1,$ then $n$ is a power of 2, and the sequence eventually reaches 1.  Otherwise, $f(m)$ is not a power of 2.  We also know that $f(m)$ is odd and greater than 1, $f(f(m))$ is not a power of 2 either, and so on.  Thus, the sequence can never reach 1.

Therefore, $n$ must be one of the $\boxed{7}$ values 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, or 64. The answer is $\boxed{7}$

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


To find $f(100)$, we need to first find a general formula for $f(n)$.

From the second condition, we have $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. Let's plug $n = f(n)$ into this equation to get $f(2f(n)) = 2f(f(n)) + 1$.

From the first condition, we know that $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. Let's set $f(n) = f(f(n))$ to get $f(f(f(n))) = f(f(n)) = 8n - 7$.

Therefore, we have $f(f(n)) = 8n - 7$.

Now, let's substitute $f(n)$ into the equation $f(2f(n)) = 2f(f(n)) + 1$ to get $f(2(8n - 7)) = 2(8n - 7) + 1$. Simplifying this gives $f(16n - 14) = 16n - 14$.

Since $f(16n - 14) = 16n - 14$, we can conclude that $f(n) = 2n - 1$.

Now we can find $f(100)$ by substituting $n = 100$ into the equation $f(n) = 2n - 1$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def find_f_of_100():
    n = 100

Suppose $n$ is an odd positive integer, where $n > 1.$  Write $n = 2k + 1,$ where $k$ is a positive integer.  Since $n$ is odd,
\[f(n) = n^2 + 1 = (2k + 1)^2 + 1 = 4k^2 + 4k + 2 = 2(2k^2 + 2k + 1).\]Since $2k^2 + 2k$ is always even, $2k^2 + 2k + 1$ is always odd (and greater than 1), so $f(n)$ can never be a power of 2 when $n$ is odd and greater than 1.

Now, suppose $n$ is even.  For example, if $n = 2^3 \cdot 11,$ then

**Problem:** 
"The function $f$ is defined on the set of integers and satisfies \[f(n)= \begin{cases}  n-3 & \mbox{if }n\ge 1000 \\  f(f(n+5)) & \mbox{if }n<1000. \end{cases}\]Find $f(84)$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Denote by (1) and (2) the two parts of the definition of $f$, respectively. If we begin to use the definition of $f$ to compute $f(84)$, we use (2) until the argument is at least $1000$: \[f(84) = f(f(89)) = f(f(f(94))) = \dots = f^N(1004)\](where $f^N$ denotes composing $f$ with itself $N$ times, for some $N$). The numbers $84, 89, 94, \dots, 1004$ form an arithmetic sequence with common difference $5$; since $1004 - 84 = 920 = 184 \cdot 5$, this sequence has $184 + 1 = 185$ terms, so $N = 185$.

At this point, (1) and (2) are both used: we compute \[\begin{aligned} f^N(1004) &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-1}(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-1}(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(1000) \\ &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(997) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1002) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(999) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1004). \end{aligned}\]Repeating this process, we see that \[f^N(1004) = f^{N-2}(1004) = f^{N-4}(1004) = \dots = f^3(1004).\](The pattern breaks down for $f^k(1004)$ when $k$ is small, so it is not true that $f^3(1004) = f(1004)$.) Now, we have \[f^3(1004) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^2(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^2(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(1000) \stackrel{(1)}{=} \boxed{997}.\] The answer is $\boxed{997}$

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we can use the second condition to find $f(1)$ and then use the first condition to find $f(f(1))$ and $f(f(f(1)))$. This will allow us to find a pattern and then use it to find $f(100)$.

First, let's find $f(1)$ using the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Setting $n=1$, we get $f(2)=2f(1)+1$. Since $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$, we have $f(2)=1$. Then using the second condition again, we get $f(4)=2f(2)+1=3$. Continuing this process, we find $f(8)=7$, $f(16)=15$, and so on.

We notice that $f(2^k)=2^k-1$ for all positive integers $k$. Now let's find $f(100)$. We can write $100$ as $2^2*5^2$. Using the second condition, we have $f(100)=2f(50)+1$. Again using the second condition, we get $f(50)=2f(25)+1$. Continuing this process, we find $f(25)=2f(12.5)+1$, but $12.5$ is not a positive integer, so we stop here.

However, we can use the first condition to help us. We know that $f(f(f(1)))=1$, so $f(f(1))$ is the value $n$ such that $f(n)=1$. From the second condition, we have $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, so setting $n=f(1)$, we get $f(2f(1))=2f(f(1))+1=3$. Since $f(2f(1))=f(2)$, we have $f(2)=3$. Then using the second condition again, we get $f(4)=7$. Continuing this process, we find $f(8)=15$, $f(16)=31$, and so on.

We notice that $f(2^k)=2^k-1$ for all positive integers $k$. Therefore, we can find $f(50)$ by finding the value of $k$ such that $2^k=50$. The smallest such $k$ is $6$, so $f(50)=2^6-1=63$. Then we can find $f(100)$ by finding the value of $f(50)$. We have $f(100)=2f(50)+1=2*63+1=127$.

So the value of $f(100)$ is $127$. The answer is: $127$

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we note that if $n$ is a positive integer, then $f(n)$ is also a positive integer.  We claim that $f ( f (\dotsb f (n) \dotsb )) = 1$ for some number of applications of $f$ only for $n = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32,$ and $64.$  (In other words, $n$ must be a power of 2.)

Note that $f(1) = 2,$ so $f(f(1)) = f(2) = 1.$  If $n > 1$ is a power of 2, it is easy to see that repeated applications of $f$ on $n$ eventually reach 1.

Suppose $n$ is an odd positive integer, where $n > 1.$  Write $n = 2k + 1,$ where $k$ is a positive integer.  Since $n$ is odd,
\[f(n) = n^2 + 1 = (2k + 1)^2 + 1 = 4k^2 + 4k + 2 = 2(2k^2 + 2k + 1).\]Since $2k^2 + 2k$ is always even, $2k^2 + 2k + 1$ is always odd (and greater than 1), so $f(n)$ can never be a power of 2 when $n$ is odd and greater than 1.

Now, suppose $n$ is even.  For example, if $n = 2^3 \cdot 11,$ then
\[f(2^3 \cdot 11) = f(2^2 \cdot 11) = f(2 \cdot 11) = f(11),\]which we know is not a power of 2.

More generally, suppose $n = 2^e \cdot m,$ where $e$ is nonnegative and $m$ is odd.  Then
\[f(2^e \cdot m) = f(2^{e - 1} \cdot m) = f(2^{e - 2} \cdot m) = \dots = f(m).\]If $m = 1,$ then $n$ is a power of 2, and the sequence eventually reaches 1.  Otherwise, $f(m)$ is not a power of 2.  We also know that $f(m)$ is odd and greater than 1, $f(f(m))$ is not a power of 2 either, and so on.  Thus, the sequence can never reach 1.

Therefore, $n$ must be one of the $\boxed{7}$ values 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, or 64. The answer is $\boxed{7}$

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


First, let's denote $f(100)$ as $x$. From the second condition, we know that $f(2 \cdot 100) = 2f(100) + 1$, which simplifies to $f(200) = 2x + 1$.

Now, let's substitute $n = 100$ into the first condition, we get $f(f(f(100))) = 8 \cdot 100 - 7$, which simplifies to $f(f(x)) = 793$.

Next, let's substitute $n = x$ into the second condition, we get $f(2x) = 2f(x) + 1$, which simplifies to $f(200) = 2f(x) + 1$.

Now we have two equations: $f(200) = 2x + 1$ and $f(200) = 2f(x) + 1$. Since both equal to $f(200)$, we can set them equal to each other: $2x + 1 = 2f(x) + 1$.

Simplify this equation, we get $2x = 2f(x)$, which simplifies to $x = f(x)$.

Now we substitute $x = f(x)$ into the equation $f(f(x)) = 793$, we get $f(x) = 793$.

Finally, substitute $x = 100$ into the equation $x = f(x)$, we get $100 = f(100)$, which means $f(100) = 100$.

So the value of $f(100)$ is 100. The answer is: $100$

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



First, let's denote $f(1)$ as $a$, $f(2)$ as $b$, and $f(3)$ as $c$. We can then express $f(f(f(n)))$ and $f(2n)$ in terms of $a$, $b$, and $c$.

From the given conditions, we have:
1. $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, so $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$, $f(f(f(2)))=8*2-7=9$, and $f(f(f(3)))=8*3-7=19$. Therefore, $a=1$, $b=9$, and $c=19$.
2. $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.

Now, we can express $f(4)$, $f(5)$, and $f(6)$ in terms of $a$, $b$, and $c$:
- $f(4)=f(2*2)=2f(2)+1=2b+1=2*9+1=19$, so $f(4)=c$.
- $f(5)=f(2*2+1)=2f(2+1)+1=2(f(2)+f(1))+1=2(b+a)+1=2(9+1)+1=21$.
- $f(6)=f(2*3)=2f(3)+1=2c+1=2*19+1=39$.

Continuing this process, we can express $f(7)$, $f(8)$, and $f(9)$ in terms of $a$, $b$, and $c$:
- $f(7)=f(2*3+1)=2f(3+1)+1=2(f(3)+f(1))+1=2(c+a)+1=2(19+1)+1=41$.
- $f(8)=f(2*4)=2f(4)+1=2c+1=2*19+1=39$, so $f(8)=f(6)$.
- $f(9)=f(2*4+1)=2f(4+1)+1=2(f(4)+f(1))+1=2(c+a)+1=2(19+1)+1=41$.

From this, we can see a pattern: $f(2n+1)=2n+1$ and $f(2n)=2n+1$ for all positive integers $n$. Therefore, $f(100)=2*100+1=201$. The answer is: $201$
