Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The equation $| |x-1| -2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$.
This is because the expression $| |x-1| -2 |$ is a piecewise function with 4 pieces, each of which represents a range of values for $x$.
For each piece, the equation $| |x-1| -2 | = 2$ has 2 solutions.
Therefore, for the equation $| |x-1| -2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ to have 4 distinct solutions, we must have $\frac{m}{100} = 2$.
Solving for $m$, we find $m = 200$.
So, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions, and that is $m = 200$.
The answer is: $1$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. This means that the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be equal to 2. 

So, we have $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, then $m = 200$.

Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions, and that is $m = 200$.

However, this doesn't seem to be the answer we are looking for. Let's re-examine the problem.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. This means that the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be equal to 2. 

So, we have $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, then $m = 200$.

However, we also need to consider the case where the absolute value inside is equal to 0. That is, $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 0$. Solving this equation gives us $x = 3$ or $x = -1$. 

When $x = 3$, we have $\vert \vert 3-1 \vert -2 \vert = \vert 2-2 \vert = 0$, and when $x = -1$, we have $\vert \vert -1-1 \vert -2 \vert = \vert -2-2 \vert = 4$. 

So, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100} = 0$ or $\frac{m}{100} = 4$. 

If $\frac{m}{100} = 0$, then $m = 0$, but $m$ must be a positive integer, so this case is not valid.

If $\frac{m}{100} = 4$, then $m = 400$.

Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions, and that is $m = 400$.

So the answer is $\boxed{400}$.

So, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100} = 0$ or $\frac{m}{100} = 4$.

## QUESTION 2 - 2

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"For certain ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ of real numbers, the system of equations
\[\begin{aligned} ax+by&=1 \\ x^2 + y^2 &= 50  \end{aligned}\]has at least one solution, and each solution is an ordered pair $(x,y)\,$ of integers. How many such ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ are there?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The graph of $ax+by=1$ is a line, while the graph of $x^2+y^2=50$ is a circle centered at the origin. Therefore, $(a, b)$ satisfies the conditions if and only if the line and circle intersect at least once, and they intersect only at lattice points (points with integer coordinates).

Knowing this, it makes sense to look for lattice points on the circle whose equation is $x^2+y^2=50$. Testing cases, we find that there are twelve lattice points on the circle: $(\pm 1, \pm 7)$, $(\pm 7, \pm 1)$, and $(\pm 5, \pm 5)$ (where the two $\pm$ signs in each pair are independent of each other).

There are $\tbinom{12}{2} = 66$ pairs of these points, and each pair determines a line. However, the graph of $ax+by=1$ can never pass through the origin $(0, 0)$, since if $x=y=0$, then $ax+by=0 \neq 1$. Therefore, the six pairs which consist of diametrically opposed points are invalid, since the line through them passes through the origin. This corrects our count to $66 - 6 = 60$.

In addition, for each of the twelve points, there is a line tangent to the circle at that point, so that the only solution to the system is that one point. This brings the final total to $60 + 12 = \boxed{72}$. The answer is $\boxed{72}$

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly four distinct solutions.

Let's break down the steps to solve this problem:

1. First, we need to understand the structure of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. This equation is a combination of absolute values, which makes it a bit tricky to solve directly. However, we can use the property of absolute values that $\vert a \vert = k$ has two solutions if $k > 0$, and no solution if $k < 0$. 

2. We can rewrite the equation as two separate equations: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.

3. For each of these equations, we can further break them down into four separate equations by considering the absolute value: $(x-1) -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, $(x-1) -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$, $-(x-1) -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, and $-(x-1) -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.

4. Solve each of these equations to find the value of $x$.

5. Count the number of distinct solutions for each $m$.

6. The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has exactly four distinct solutions is the desired answer.

Let's implement this in Python:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solve

def count_m():
    x, m = symbols('x m')
    count = 0

    for m in range(1, 101):  # m is a positive integer from 1 to 100
        # Solve the four equations for each m
        solutions = []
        solutions.extend(solve((x - 1) - 2 - m / 100, x))
        solutions.extend(solve((x - 1) - 2 + m / 100, x))
        solutions.extend(solve(-(x - 1) - 2 - m / 100, x))
        solutions.extend(solve(-(x - 1) - 2 + m / 100, x))

        # Count the number of distinct solutions
        solutions = set(solutions)  # Remove duplicates
        if len(solutions) == 4:
            count += 1

    return count

result = count_m()
print(result)
```
