Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. For the product of two numbers to be zero, either one of the numbers must be zero. Thus, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The first equation implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us four equations: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These equations represent the lines $y = 10 - x$, $y = -10 - x$, $y = x - 10$, and $y = -(x - 10)$, respectively. These lines form a square with side length 10.

The second equation implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us four equations: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These equations represent the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$, respectively. These lines form a square with side length 16.

The area of the first square is $10^2 = 100$ and the area of the second square is $16^2 = 256$. However, the intersection of these two sets of lines forms a smaller square, which is the solution to the original problem. The side length of this square is the smaller of the two side lengths, which is 10. So the area of the convex polygon is $10^2 = 100$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_ 2= (-16,2).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that
\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as
\[\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1.\]Find $h + k + a + b.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


This problem is asking for the area of the polygon formed by the intersection of the solutions to the two equations $|x + y| - 10 = 0$, $|x - y| - 10 = 0$, $|x| - 8 = 0$, and $|y| - 8 = 0$.

The solutions to $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ are the points where $x + y = \pm 10$. Similarly, the solutions to $|x - y| - 10 = 0$ are the points where $x - y = \pm 10$. The solutions to $|x| - 8 = 0$ are the points where $x = \pm 8$, and the solutions to $|y| - 8 = 0$ are the points where $y = \pm 8$.

The intersections of these lines form a square with side length 16. Therefore, the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. So the answer is $\boxed{256}$.

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. 

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$ and the second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. 

If the first expression is zero, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon as $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0)$.

If the second expression is zero, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon as $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$.

So, the polygon is a square with side length 10 units. The area of the square is side length squared, which is $10^2 = 100$ square units. The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation given is a product of two terms equals to zero, which means either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. So we can break this down into two separate cases and solve each one.

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.

Case 2: $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.

Case 3: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.

Case 4: $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

Now let's solve each case and find the points that satisfy the conditions:

For case 1 and 2, we have a system of linear equations which represent lines in the plane. The intersection points of these lines are the vertices of the polygon.

For case 3 and 4, we have vertical and horizontal lines at $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$, respectively. These lines will bound the polygon.

Finally, we can calculate the area of the polygon using standard geometry formulas. The polygon is a square with side length of 16 units (since the distance between the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$ or $y = 8$ and $y = -8$ is 16 units). The area of the square is therefore $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_ 2= (-16,2).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that
\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as
\[\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1.\]Find $h + k + a + b.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$
