**Problem:** 
"How many distinct solutions are there to the equation $|x-7| = |x+1|$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
If $|x-7| = |x+1|$, then either $x-7 = x+1$ or $x-7 = -(x+1)$.  Simplifying $x-7=x+1$ gives $0=8$, which has no solutions, so no values of $x$ satisfy $x-7 = x+1$.  If $x-7 = -(x+1)$, then $x-7 = -x-1$, so $2x = 6$, which gives $x=3$.  So, there is $\boxed{1}$ solution.

Challenge: See if you can find a quick solution to this problem by simply thinking about the graphs of $y=|x-7|$ and $y=|x+1|$. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


The first step to solve this problem is to understand the structure of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. 

This equation has four distinct solutions when the right-hand side $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $2$. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a graph that is a 'V' shape with the 'valleys' at $x=3$ and $x=-1$. When $\frac{m}{100}=2$, there are four distinct solutions to the equation. 

Therefore, we need to find the value of $m$ such that $\frac{m}{100}=2$. 

Multiplying both sides by $100$ gives $m=200$.

So the only positive integer value of $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is $200$.

The answer is: $200$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many integers are solutions to the equation $$(x-2)^{(25-x^2)}=1?$$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
We need some basic facts from number theory: $a^0 = 1$ for any $a,$ $1^b = 1$ for any $b,$ and $(-1)^c = 1$ if $c$ is an even integer. Unless the base is a complex number (which is excluded since we are looking for integer solutions), there are no other ways to get an RHS of $1.$ Thus, either the exponent is zero $($giving the equation $25 - x^2 = 0),$ the base is $1$ $($giving $x -2 = 1),$ or the base is $-1$ and the exponent is even $($giving the simultaneous equations $x - 2 = -1$ and $25 - x^2 = 2n$ for some integer $n).$ Solving the first equation gives $x = \pm 5,$ and solving the second gives $x = 3.$ The third equation implies that $x = 1,$ in which case $25 - x^2 = 24$ is indeed even, so $x = 1$ is a valid solution. In all, there are $\boxed{4}$ integer solutions. The answer is $\boxed{4}$

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we first need to understand the structure of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. This equation has a piecewise form which makes it difficult to solve directly. However, we can convert it into a simpler form by considering the number of changes in the slope of the piecewise function.

The function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ changes its slope four times at $x=1-2=-1$, $x=1$, $x=1+2=3$, and $x=3+2=5$. Thus, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to the difference between consecutive change points. The difference between consecutive change points is $3-(-1)=4$ and $5-3=2$. Therefore, $\frac{m}{100}$ should be either $2$ or $4$. Solving the equations $m/100=2$ and $m/100=4$ gives $m=200$ and $m=400$. However, $m=400$ is not a valid solution because it would make the left hand side of the equation equal to zero, and the equation would only have two solutions instead of four. Therefore, the only valid solution is $m=200$.
The answer is: $1$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"For certain ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ of real numbers, the system of equations
\[\begin{aligned} ax+by&=1 \\ x^2 + y^2 &= 50  \end{aligned}\]has at least one solution, and each solution is an ordered pair $(x,y)\,$ of integers. How many such ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ are there?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The graph of $ax+by=1$ is a line, while the graph of $x^2+y^2=50$ is a circle centered at the origin. Therefore, $(a, b)$ satisfies the conditions if and only if the line and circle intersect at least once, and they intersect only at lattice points (points with integer coordinates).

Knowing this, it makes sense to look for lattice points on the circle whose equation is $x^2+y^2=50$. Testing cases, we find that there are twelve lattice points on the circle: $(\pm 1, \pm 7)$, $(\pm 7, \pm 1)$, and $(\pm 5, \pm 5)$ (where the two $\pm$ signs in each pair are independent of each other).

There are $\tbinom{12}{2} = 66$ pairs of these points, and each pair determines a line. However, the graph of $ax+by=1$ can never pass through the origin $(0, 0)$, since if $x=y=0$, then $ax+by=0 \neq 1$. Therefore, the six pairs which consist of diametrically opposed points are invalid, since the line through them passes through the origin. This corrects our count to $66 - 6 = 60$.

In addition, for each of the twelve points, there is a line tangent to the circle at that point, so that the only solution to the system is that one point. This brings the final total to $60 + 12 = \boxed{72}$. The answer is $\boxed{72}$

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we need to understand the structure of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ and how it can have 4 distinct solutions.

The expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a double absolute value function. We can visualize its graph as a "V" shape with two "valleys" located at $x=1-2=-1$ and $x=1+2=3$. The depth of each valley is 2, so the function takes all values between $0$ and $4$ inclusive.

The right-hand side of the equation $\frac{m}{100}$ can take all values between $0$ and $\frac{100}{100}=1$ inclusive.

For the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, the right-hand side must be equal to one of the depths of the valleys, i.e., $\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal to either $0$, $1$, or $2$. However, $\frac{m}{100}$ cannot be $0$, so it must be $1$ or $2$.

If $\frac{m}{100}=1$, then $m=100$. If $\frac{m}{100}=2$, then $m=200$. So there are only two possible values for $m$.

To confirm this, we can substitute $m=100$ and $m=200$ into the equation and check if it has 4 distinct solutions.

When $m=100$, the equation becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=1$. This equation has 4 distinct solutions: $x=0$, $x=1$, $x=3$, and $x=4$.

When $m=200$, the equation becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=2$. This equation also has 4 distinct solutions: $x=-1$, $x=1$, $x=3$, and $x=5$.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 2. The answer is: $2$.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We start with the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.
2. The expression on the left hand side (LHS) is equal to a positive number $\frac{m}{100}$. 
3. This means that $\frac{m}{100}$ must be greater than 0, so $m$ must be a positive integer.
4. The LHS has 4 distinct solutions, which means the absolute value inside has 2 distinct solutions, and the outer absolute value also has 2 distinct solutions.
5. For the inner absolute value, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
6. The first equation gives $x = 1 + 2 + \frac{m}{100} = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x = 1 + 2 - \frac{m}{100} = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
7. The second equation gives $x = 1 + 2 + \frac{m}{100} = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x = 1 + 2 - \frac{m}{100} = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
8. We can see that the solutions for the inner absolute value are $3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
9. For the outer absolute value, we have $\vert x-3 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$ or $\vert x-3 \vert = 4 - \frac{m}{100}$.
10. The first equation gives $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
11. The second equation gives $x = 7 - \frac{m}{100}$ or $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.
12. We can see that the solutions for the outer absolute value are $3 + \frac{m}{100}$, $3 - \frac{m}{100}$, $7 - \frac{m}{100}$, and $-1 + \frac{m}{100}$.
13. We need to find the value of $m$ such that the four solutions are distinct.
14. This happens when $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which gives $0 < m < 200$.
15. Since $m$ is an integer, the possible values of $m$ are 1 to 199.
16. To find the number of such values, we can subtract the smallest possible value from the largest possible value and add 1.
17. This gives $199 - 1 + 1 = 199$.
18. Therefore, there are 199 possible values of $m$ that make the equation have 4 distinct solutions.

So the answer is: $199$.
The answer is: $199$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"For certain ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ of real numbers, the system of equations
\[\begin{aligned} ax+by&=1 \\ x^2 + y^2 &= 50  \end{aligned}\]has at least one solution, and each solution is an ordered pair $(x,y)\,$ of integers. How many such ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ are there?"

In addition, for each of the twelve points, there is a line tangent to the circle at that point, so that the only solution to the system is that one point. This brings the final total to $60 + 12 = \boxed{72}$. The answer is $\boxed{72}$

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $3$. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ oscillates between $1$ and $3$. Therefore, we want to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $1<\frac{m}{100}<3$. Multiplying all sides of the inequalities by $100$, we have $100<m<300$. The number of positive integers $m$ in this range is $300-100-1=199$.

The equation $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions for $x$ if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $2$.

To solve this problem, we need to understand how the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ works. The equation has four distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $1$. Therefore, we can set $\frac{m}{100}$ to $1$ and solve for $m$.

The value of $m$ that makes the equation have four distinct solutions is $100$. However, we need to check if this value of $m$ indeed gives us four distinct solutions. If we substitute $m=100$ into the equation, we get $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=1$. This equation has four distinct solutions: $x=0$, $x=3$, $x=-1$, and $x=5$. Therefore, the value of $m$ that makes the equation have four distinct solutions is $100$. The answer is $\boxed{100}$.
