**Problem:** 
"Let $
f(n) =
\begin{cases}
n^2+1 & \text{if }n\text{ is odd} \\
\dfrac{n}{2} & \text{if }n\text{ is even}
\end{cases}.
$

For how many integers $n$ from 1 to 100, inclusive, does $f ( f (\dotsb f (n) \dotsb )) = 1$ for some number of applications of $f$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we note that if $n$ is a positive integer, then $f(n)$ is also a positive integer.  We claim that $f ( f (\dotsb f (n) \dotsb )) = 1$ for some number of applications of $f$ only for $n = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32,$ and $64.$  (In other words, $n$ must be a power of 2.)

Note that $f(1) = 2,$ so $f(f(1)) = f(2) = 1.$  If $n > 1$ is a power of 2, it is easy to see that repeated applications of $f$ on $n$ eventually reach 1.

Suppose $n$ is an odd positive integer, where $n > 1.$  Write $n = 2k + 1,$ where $k$ is a positive integer.  Since $n$ is odd,
\[f(n) = n^2 + 1 = (2k + 1)^2 + 1 = 4k^2 + 4k + 2 = 2(2k^2 + 2k + 1).\]Since $2k^2 + 2k$ is always even, $2k^2 + 2k + 1$ is always odd (and greater than 1), so $f(n)$ can never be a power of 2 when $n$ is odd and greater than 1.

Now, suppose $n$ is even.  For example, if $n = 2^3 \cdot 11,$ then
\[f(2^3 \cdot 11) = f(2^2 \cdot 11) = f(2 \cdot 11) = f(11),\]which we know is not a power of 2.

More generally, suppose $n = 2^e \cdot m,$ where $e$ is nonnegative and $m$ is odd.  Then
\[f(2^e \cdot m) = f(2^{e - 1} \cdot m) = f(2^{e - 2} \cdot m) = \dots = f(m).\]If $m = 1,$ then $n$ is a power of 2, and the sequence eventually reaches 1.  Otherwise, $f(m)$ is not a power of 2.  We also know that $f(m)$ is odd and greater than 1, $f(f(m))$ is not a power of 2 either, and so on.  Thus, the sequence can never reach 1.

Therefore, $n$ must be one of the $\boxed{7}$ values 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, or 64. The answer is $\boxed{7}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
**Problem**
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


To find the value of $f(100)$, we need to use the given functional equations. Let's start with the second equation: $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We can use this equation to find $f(100)$ by repeatedly applying it.

First, we find $f(50)$: $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.
Then, we find $f(25)$: $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.
Continuing this process, we find:
$f(12) = 2f(6) + 1$.
$f(6) = 2f(3) + 1$.
$f(3) = 2f(1.5) + 1$.
But we can't apply the second equation directly to $f(1.5)$, so we need to use the first equation: $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. Setting $n=1$, we get:
$f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$.
So $f(f(1))=1$.
Again, we can't directly apply the second equation to $f(1)$, so we need to use the first equation: $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$. Setting $n=1$, we get:
$f(f(1))=1$.
And again, we can't directly apply the second equation to $f(1)$, so we need to use the first equation: $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$. Setting $n=1$, we get:
$f(1)=1$.
Now we can use the second equation to find $f(3)$: $f(3) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2*1 + 1 = 3$.
And then we can find $f(6)$: $f(6) = 2f(3) + 1 = 2*3 + 1 = 7$.
And then we can find $f(12)$: $f(12) = 2f(6) + 1 = 2*7 + 1 = 15$.
And finally, we can find $f(50)$: $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1 = 2*15 + 1 = 31$.
And then we can find $f(100)$: $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2*31 + 1 = 63$.
So $f(100) = 63$. The answer is: $63$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"The function $f$ is defined on the set of integers and satisfies \[f(n)= \begin{cases}  n-3 & \mbox{if }n\ge 1000 \\  f(f(n+5)) & \mbox{if }n<1000. \end{cases}\]Find $f(84)$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Denote by (1) and (2) the two parts of the definition of $f$, respectively. If we begin to use the definition of $f$ to compute $f(84)$, we use (2) until the argument is at least $1000$: \[f(84) = f(f(89)) = f(f(f(94))) = \dots = f^N(1004)\](where $f^N$ denotes composing $f$ with itself $N$ times, for some $N$). The numbers $84, 89, 94, \dots, 1004$ form an arithmetic sequence with common difference $5$; since $1004 - 84 = 920 = 184 \cdot 5$, this sequence has $184 + 1 = 185$ terms, so $N = 185$.

At this point, (1) and (2) are both used: we compute \[\begin{aligned} f^N(1004) &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-1}(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-1}(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(1000) \\ &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(997) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1002) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(999) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1004). \end{aligned}\]Repeating this process, we see that \[f^N(1004) = f^{N-2}(1004) = f^{N-4}(1004) = \dots = f^3(1004).\](The pattern breaks down for $f^k(1004)$ when $k$ is small, so it is not true that $f^3(1004) = f(1004)$.) Now, we have \[f^3(1004) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^2(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^2(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(1000) \stackrel{(1)}{=} \boxed{997}.\] The answer is $\boxed{997}$

**Problem**
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



To solve this problem, we can use the second equation to express $f(f(f(n)))$ in terms of $f(n)$:
$$f(f(f(n))) = f(2f(f(n)) + 1) = 2f(f(f(n))) + 1.$$
Substituting the first equation, we get:
$$8n - 7 = 2(8f(n) - 7) + 1.$$
Simplifying, we have:
$$8n - 7 = 16f(n) - 14 + 1,$$
$$8n - 7 = 16f(n) - 13,$$
$$8n = 16f(n) - 6,$$
$$2n = 4f(n) - \frac{3}{4}.$$
Since $n$ and $f(n)$ are both positive integers, the right side of the equation must be an integer. This implies that $\frac{3}{4}$ must be an integer, which is a contradiction. Therefore, there must be a mistake in our reasoning.

Let's go back and check our steps:

1. We assumed that $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$.
2. We substituted this into the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 2f(f(n)) + 1$.
3. We substituted the first equation into the second equation.

The mistake is in step 1. The first equation is not correct. Let's try another approach.

We know that $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. We can use this equation to find $f(f(100))$ and then find $f(100)$.

First, let's find $f(f(100))$:
$$f(f(100)) = 8 \cdot 100 - 7 = 793.$$
Now, we can find $f(100)$:
$$f(100) = 2f(f(50)) + 1.$$
We know that $f(f(50)) = f(793)$. We can use the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$ again to find $f(793)$:
$$f(793) = 8 \cdot 50 - 7 = 393.$$
Now, we can find $f(100)$:
$$f(100) = 2 \cdot 393 + 1 = 787.$$
Therefore, $f(100) = 787$.

The answer is $\boxed{787}$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"The function $f(n)$ is defined on the positive integers such that $f(f(n)) = 2n$ and $f(4n + 1) = 4n + 3$ for all positive integers $n.$  Find $f(1000).$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Consider the expression $f(f(f(a))).$  Since $f(f(a)) = 2a,$ this is equal to $f(2a).$  But taking $n = f(a)$ in $f(f(n)) = 2n,$ we get
\[f(f(f(a))) = 2f(a).\]Hence,
\[f(2a) = 2f(a)\]for all positive integers $a.$

Then
\[f(1000) = 2f(500) = 4f(250) = 8f(125).\]Taking $n = 31$ in $f(4n + 1) = 4n + 3,$ we get
\[f(125) = 127,\]so $f(1000) = \boxed{1016}.$ The answer is $\boxed{1016}$

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


To solve this problem, we will use the second condition to simplify the first condition.

From the second condition, we have $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ can be rewritten as $f(f(f(n)))=2(4n-3)+1$.

Now, let's consider $f(f(n))$. By the second condition again, we have $f(f(n))=2f(n)+1$.

Substituting this into the equation $f(f(f(n)))=2(4n-3)+1$, we get $f(2f(n)+1)=2(4n-3)+1$.

Let $m=f(n)$. Then the equation becomes $f(2m+1)=2(4n-3)+1$.

Now, we need to find a function $f(n)$ that satisfies this equation.

One possible function that satisfies this equation is $f(n)=2n-1$.

Let's check if this function works:

For $f(100)$, we have $f(100)=2(100)-1=199$.

So, $f(100)=199$. The answer is: $199$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



To solve this problem, we will use the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to find the value of $f(100)$.

First, we need to find the value of $f(50)$ using the second condition. We have $f(2 \cdot 50) = 2f(50) + 1$. So, $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.

Next, we need to find the value of $f(25)$ using the second condition. We have $f(2 \cdot 25) = 2f(25) + 1$. So, $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.

Now, we need to find the value of $f(12.5)$. But $12.5$ is not an integer, so we cannot use the second condition directly. However, we can use the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. We can set $n=12.5$ to get $f(f(f(12.5)))=8 \cdot 12.5 - 7 = 100$.

We know that $f(f(f(12.5)))=100$, so $f(f(x))=100$ has a solution for some $x$. Let's denote this solution as $x_0$. So, we have $f(x_0) = f(12.5)$.

Now, we can use the first condition again to find the value of $f(x_0)$. We have $f(f(f(x_0)))=8x_0 - 7 = 100$. So, $8x_0 - 7 = 100$, and we can solve this equation to get $x_0 = \frac{107}{8}$.

But $x_0$ should be an integer, so there must be a mistake in our calculations. Let's go back and check our work.

We found that $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$. We can substitute this into the equation $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$ to get $f(100) = 2(2f(25) + 1) + 1 = 4f(25) + 3$.

Now, we need to find the value of $f(12.5)$. But $12.5$ is not an integer, so we cannot use the second condition directly. However, we can use the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. We can set $n=12.5$ to get $f(f(f(12.5)))=8 \cdot 12.5 - 7 = 100$.

We know that $f(f(f(12.5)))=100$, so $f(f(x))=100$ has a solution for some $x$. Let's denote this solution as $x_0$. So, we have $f(x_0) = f(12.5)$.

Now, we can use the first condition again to find the value of $f(x_0)$. We have $f(f(f(x_0)))=8x_0 - 7 = 100$. So, $8x_0 - 7 = 100$, and we can solve this equation to get $x_0 = \frac{107}{8}$.

But $x_0$ should be an integer, so there must be a mistake in our calculations. Let's go back and check our work.

We found that $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$. We can substitute this into the equation $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$ to get $f(100) = 2(2f(25) + 1) + 1 = 4f(25) + 3$.

Now, we need to find the value of $f(25)$. We can use the second condition $f(2 \cdot 25) = 2f(25) + 1$. So, $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.

We can substitute $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$ into the equation $f(100) = 4f(25) + 3$ to get $f(100) = 4(f(50) - 2f(25)) + 3 = 4f(50) - 8f(25) + 3$.

We know that $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$, so we can substitute this into the equation to get $f(100) = 4(2f(25) + 1) - 8f(25) + 3 = 8f(25) + 4 - 8f(25) + 3 = 7$.

So, $f(100) = 7$. The answer is: $7$

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$.
2. We also know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.

Let's start by calculating $f(100)$. We can use the second equation to simplify our problem. Since $100 = 2 \cdot 50$, we can apply the second equation to find $f(100)$:

$$f(100) = 2f(50) + 1.$$

Now, we need to find the value of $f(50)$. We can use the second equation again, since $50 = 2 \cdot 25$:

$$f(50) = 2f(25) + 1.$$

Now, we need to find the value of $f(25)$. We can use the second equation again, since $25 = 2 \cdot 12 + 1$:

$$f(25) = 2f(12 + 1) + 1 = 2f(13) + 1.$$

Now, we need to find the value of $f(13)$. We can't directly apply the second equation since $13$ is not a multiple of $2$. But we can use the first equation:

$$f(f(f(13))) = 8 \cdot 13 - 7 = 96 - 7 = 89.$$

Let's denote $f(13)$ as $x$, then we have $f(x) = 13$. Substituting $x$ into the first equation, we get:

$$f(f(x)) = 8 \cdot 13 - 7 = 89.$$

And substituting $f(x)$ into the first equation again, we get:

$$f(f(f(13))) = f(89) = 89.$$

So we have $x = 89$, and therefore $f(13) = 89$.

Now, we can substitute $f(13)$ into the equation for $f(25)$:

$$f(25) = 2f(13) + 1 = 2 \cdot 89 + 1 = 178 + 1 = 179.$$

Then we can substitute $f(25)$ into the equation for $f(50)$:

$$f(50) = 2f(25) + 1 = 2 \cdot 179 + 1 = 358 + 1 = 359.$$

Finally, we can substitute $f(50)$ into the equation for $f(100)$:

$$f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2 \cdot 359 + 1 = 718 + 1 = 719.$$

So the value of $f(100)$ is $719$. The answer is: $719$

## QUESTION 4 - 6

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $
f(n) =
\begin{cases}
n^2+1 & \text{if }n\text{ is odd} \\
\dfrac{n}{2} & \text{if }n\text{ is even}
\end{cases}.
$

For how many integers $n$ from 1 to 100, inclusive, does $f ( f (\dotsb f (n) \dotsb )) = 1$ for some number of applications of $f$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we note that if $n$ is a positive integer, then $f(n)$ is also a positive integer.  We claim that $f ( f (\dotsb f (n) \dotsb )) = 1$ for some number of applications of $f$ only for $n = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32,$ and $64.$  (In other words, $n$ must be a power of 2.)

Note that $f(1) = 2,$ so $f(f(1)) = f(2) = 1.$  If $n > 1$ is a power of 2, it is easy to see that repeated applications of $f$ on $n$ eventually reach 1.

Suppose $n$ is an odd positive integer, where $n > 1.$  Write $n = 2k + 1,$ where $k$ is a positive integer.  Since $n$ is odd,
\[f(n) = n^2 + 1 = (2k + 1)^2 + 1 = 4k^2 + 4k + 2 = 2(2k^2 + 2k + 1).\]Since $2k^2 + 2k$ is always even, $2k^2 + 2k + 1$ is always odd (and greater than 1), so $f(n)$ can never be a power of 2 when $n$ is odd and greater than 1.

Now, suppose $n$ is even.  For example, if $n = 2^3 \cdot 11,$ then
\[f(2^3 \cdot 11) = f(2^2 \cdot 11) = f(2 \cdot 11) = f(11),\]which we know is not a power of 2.

More generally, suppose $n = 2^e \cdot m,$ where $e$ is nonnegative and $m$ is odd.  Then
\[f(2^e \cdot m) = f(2^{e - 1} \cdot m) = f(2^{e - 2} \cdot m) = \dots = f(m).\]If $m = 1,$ then $n$ is a power of 2, and the sequence eventually reaches 1.  Otherwise, $f(m)$ is not a power of 2.  We also know that $f(m)$ is odd and greater than 1, $f(f(m))$ is not a power of 2 either, and so on.  Thus, the sequence can never reach 1.

Therefore, $n$ must be one of the $\boxed{7}$ values 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, or 64. The answer is $\boxed{7}$

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we will first set $n = 1$ in the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$ to get $f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = 1$. This means $f(f(1)) = 1$.
Then we set $n = f(1)$ in the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to get $f(2f(1)) = 2f(f(1)) + 1 = 2*1 + 1 = 3$.
Since $2f(1) = f(2)$, we have $f(f(2)) = 3$.
Setting $n = 2$ in the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, we get $f(f(f(2))) = 8*2 - 7 = 9$.
But we know $f(f(2)) = 3$, so $f(3) = 9$.
Setting $n = 3$ in the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, we get $f(2*3) = 2f(3) + 1 = 2*9 + 1 = 19$.
Since $2*3 = 6$, we have $f(6) = 19$.
Setting $n = 6$ in the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, we get $f(f(f(6))) = 8*6 - 7 = 43$.
But we know $f(f(6)) = 19$, so $f(19) = 43$.
Setting $n = 19$ in the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, we get $f(2*19) = 2f(19) + 1 = 2*43 + 1 = 87$.
Since $2*19 = 38$, we have $f(38) = 87$.
Setting $n = 38$ in the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, we get $f(f(f(38))) = 8*38 - 7 = 301$.
But we know $f(f(38)) = 87$, so $f(87) = 301$.
Setting $n = 87$ in the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, we get $f(2*87) = 2f(87) + 1 = 2*301 + 1 = 603$.
Since $2*87 = 174$, we have $f(174) = 603$.
Setting $n = 174$ in the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, we get $f(f(f(174))) = 8*174 - 7 = 1387$.
But we know $f(f(174)) = 603$, so $f(603) = 1387$.
Setting $n = 603$ in the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, we get $f(2*603) = 2f(603) + 1 = 2*1387 + 1 = 2775$.
Since $2*603 = 1206$, we have $f(1206) = 2775$.
Setting $n = 1206$ in the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, we get $f(f(f(1206))) = 8*1206 - 7 = 9637$.
But we know $f(f(1206)) = 2775$, so $f(2775) = 9637$.
Setting $n = 2775$ in the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, we get $f(2*2775) = 2f(2775) + 1 = 2*9637 + 1 = 19275$.
Since $2*2775 = 5550$, we have $f(5550) = 19275$.
Setting $n = 5550$ in the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, we get $f(f(f(5550))) = 8*5550 - 7 = 44393$.
But we know $f(f(5550)) = 19275$, so $f(19275) = 44393$.
Setting $n = 19275$ in the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, we get $f(2*19275) = 2f(19275) + 1 = 2*44393 + 1 = 88787$.
Since $2*19275 = 38550$, we have $f(38550) = 88787$.
Setting $n = 38550$ in the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, we get $f(f(f(38550))) = 8*38550 - 7 = 308393$.
But we know $f(f(38550)) = 88787$, so $f(88787) = 308393$.
Setting $n = 88787$ in the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, we get $f(2*88787) = 2f(88787) + 1 = 2*308393 + 1 = 616787$.
Since $2*88787 = 177574$, we have $f(177574) = 616787$.
Setting $n = 177574$ in the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, we get $f(f(f(177574))) = 8*177574 - 7 = 1420587$.
But we know $f(f(177574)) = 616787$, so $f(616787) = 1420587$.
Setting $n = 616787$ in the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, we get $f(2*616787) = 2f(616787) + 1 = 2*1420587 + 1 = 2841175$.
Since $2*616787 = 1233574$, we have $f(1233574) = 2841175$.
Setting $n = 1233574$ in the equation $f(f(f(n))) =

**Problem:** 
"The function $f$ is defined on the set of integers and satisfies \[f(n)= \begin{cases}  n-3 & \mbox{if }n\ge 1000 \\  f(f(n+5)) & \mbox{if }n<1000. \end{cases}\]Find $f(84)$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Denote by (1) and (2) the two parts of the definition of $f$, respectively. If we begin to use the definition of $f$ to compute $f(84)$, we use (2) until the argument is at least $1000$: \[f(84) = f(f(89)) = f(f(f(94))) = \dots = f^N(1004)\](where $f^N$ denotes composing $f$ with itself $N$ times, for some $N$). The numbers $84, 89, 94, \dots, 1004$ form an arithmetic sequence with common difference $5$; since $1004 - 84 = 920 = 184 \cdot 5$, this sequence has $184 + 1 = 185$ terms, so $N = 185$.

At this point, (1) and (2) are both used: we compute \[\begin{aligned} f^N(1004) &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-1}(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-1}(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(1000) \\ &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(997) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1002) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(999) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1004). \end{aligned}\]Repeating this process, we see that \[f^N(1004) = f^{N-2}(1004) = f^{N-4}(1004) = \dots = f^3(1004).\](The pattern breaks down for $f^k(1004)$ when $k$ is small, so it is not true that $f^3(1004) = f(1004)$.) Now, we have \[f^3(1004) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^2(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^2(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(1000) \stackrel{(1)}{=} \boxed{997}.\] The answer is $\boxed{997}$

**Problem**
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


To find $f(100)$, we can use the second condition $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. We can start by finding $f(50)$ since $100 = 2 \times 50$. By applying the second condition with $n = 50$, we get $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$. Now we need to find $f(50)$. We can use the second condition again with $n = 25$, since $50 = 2 \times 25$. This gives us $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$. We can continue this process until we reach a value that we can easily compute using the first condition.

Let's implement this in Python:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def find_f_100():
    # Start with n = 100
    n = 100

    # Apply the second condition repeatedly until we reach a value that we can easily compute using the first condition
    while n > 1:
        # If n is even, apply the second condition
        if n % 2 == 0:
            n = n // 2
            # Replace n with f(n)
            n = 2 * n + 1
        # If n is odd, apply the first condition
        else:
            # Compute f(n) using the first condition
            n = 8 * n - 7

    return n

result = find_f_100()

To solve this problem, we will first set $n = 1$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to get $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$. Since $f(f(f(1)))=1$, we have $f(1)=a$ for some $a$ such that $f(a)=1$. Now we substitute $n=a$ into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to get $f(2a)=2f(a)+1=2*1+1=3$. Since $f(2a)=3$, we have $2a=b$ for some $b$ such that $f(b)=3$. Now we substitute $n=b$ into the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to get $f(f(f(b)))=8*b-7=8*2a-7=16a-7$. Since $f(f(f(b)))=16a-7$, we have $f(3)=16a-7$. But we know that $f(3)=3$, so we have $3=16a-7$, which gives $16a=10$, so $a=\frac{5}{8}$. But $a$ must be a positive integer, so we must have made a mistake somewhere.

Let's go back and check our work. We know that $f(f(f(1)))=1$, so $f(f(1))=a$ for some $a$ such that $f(a)=1$. Now we substitute $n=a$ into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to get $f(2a)=2f(a)+1=2*1+1=3$. Since $f(2a)=3$, we have $2a=b$ for some $b$ such that $f(b)=3$. Now we substitute $n=b$ into the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to get $f(f(f(b)))=8*b-7=8*2a-7=16a-7$. Since $f(f(f(b)))=16a-7$, we have $f(3)=16a-7$. But we know that $f(3)=3$, so we have $3=16a-7$, which gives $16a=10$, so $a=\frac{5}{8}$. But $a$ must be a positive integer, so we must have made a mistake somewhere.

Let's retrace our steps and see where we went wrong. We know that $f(f(f(1)))=1$, so $f(f(1))=a$ for some $a$ such that $f(a)=1$. Now we substitute $n=a$ into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to get $f(2a)=2f(a)+1=2*1+1=3$. Since $f(2a)=3$, we have $2a=b$ for some $b$ such that $f(b)=3$. Now we substitute $n=b$ into the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to get $f(f(f(b)))=8*b-7=8*2a-7=16a-7$. Since $f(f(f(b)))=16a-7$, we have $f(3)=16a-7$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $
f(n) =
\begin{cases}
n^2+1 & \text{if }n\text{ is odd} \\
\dfrac{n}{2} & \text{if }n\text{ is even}
\end{cases}.
$

For how many integers $n$ from 1 to 100, inclusive, does $f ( f (\dotsb f (n) \dotsb )) = 1$ for some number of applications of $f$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we note that if $n$ is a positive integer, then $f(n)$ is also a positive integer.  We claim that $f ( f (\dotsb f (n) \dotsb )) = 1$ for some number of applications of $f$ only for $n = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32,$ and $64.$  (In other words, $n$ must be a power of 2.)

Note that $f(1) = 2,$ so $f(f(1)) = f(2) = 1.$  If $n > 1$ is a power of 2, it is easy to see that repeated applications of $f$ on $n$ eventually reach 1.

Suppose $n$ is an odd positive integer, where $n > 1.$  Write $n = 2k + 1,$ where $k$ is a positive integer.  Since $n$ is odd,
\[f(n) = n^2 + 1 = (2k + 1)^2 + 1 = 4k^2 + 4k + 2 = 2(2k^2 + 2k + 1).\]Since $2k^2 + 2k$ is always even, $2k^2 + 2k + 1$ is always odd (and greater than 1), so $f(n)$ can never be a power of 2 when $n$ is odd and greater than 1.

Now, suppose $n$ is even.  For example, if $n = 2^3 \cdot 11,$ then
\[f(2^3 \cdot 11) = f(2^2 \cdot 11) = f(2 \cdot 11) = f(11),\]which we know is not a power of 2.

More generally, suppose $n = 2^e \cdot m,$ where $e$ is nonnegative and $m$ is odd.  Then
\[f(2^e \cdot m) = f(2^{e - 1} \cdot m) = f(2^{e - 2} \cdot m) = \dots = f(m).\]If $m = 1,$ then $n$ is a power of 2, and the sequence eventually reaches 1.  Otherwise, $f(m)$ is not a power of 2.  We also know that $f(m)$ is odd and greater than 1, $f(f(m))$ is not a power of 2 either, and so on.  Thus, the sequence can never reach 1.

Therefore, $n$ must be one of the $\boxed{7}$ values 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, or 64. The answer is $\boxed{7}$

**Problem**
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we can start by substituting $n = 1$ into the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$ to get $f(f(f(1))) = 8(1) - 7 = 1$. Since $f(f(f(1))) = 1$, we know that $f(1)$ is a value such that when it is input into the function $f$ three times, the result is 1. From the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, we can substitute $n = 1$ to get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.

Now, let's try to find the value of $f(1)$. If we substitute $f(1)$ into the equation $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$, we get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. But we also know that $f(2)$ is a value such that when it is input into the function $f$, the result is twice the original value plus 1. Therefore, we have $f(f(1)) = 2f(1) + 1$.

If we substitute $f(1)$ into this equation, we get $f(f(1)) = 2f(1) + 1$. But we know that $f(f(1)) = 1$ from the equation $f(f(f(1))) = 1$. Therefore, we have $1 = 2f(1) + 1$. Solving this equation for $f(1)$, we get $f(1) = 0$.

However, this doesn't seem to work, because if $f(1) = 0$, then $f(f(1)) = f(0)$, but we can't have $f(0)$ because the function $f$ is only defined for positive integers. So, let's try another approach.

Let's substitute $n = 2$ into the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to get $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$. Now, let's substitute $n = 1$ into the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$ to get $f(f(f(1))) = 1$. But we know that $f(f(f(1))) = 1$, so we have $f(f(1)) = 1$.

If we substitute $f(1)$ into this equation, we get $f(f(1)) = 1$. But we know that $f(f(1)) = f(0)$, because $f(1) = 0$. Therefore, we have $f(0) = 1$.

Now, let's substitute $n = 1$ into the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. But we know that $f(1) = 0$, so we have $f(2) = 2(0) + 1 = 1$.

Now, let's substitute $n = 2$ into the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to get $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$. But we know that $f(2) = 1$, so we have $f(4) = 2(1) + 1 = 3$.

Now, let's substitute $n = 4$ into the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to get $f(8) = 2f(4) + 1$. But we know that $f(4) = 3$, so we have $f(8) = 2(3) + 1 = 7$.

Now, let's substitute $n = 8$ into the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to get $f(16) = 2f(8) + 1$. But we know that $f(8) = 7$, so we have $f(16) = 2(7) + 1 = 15$.

Now, let's substitute $n = 16$ into the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to get $f(32) = 2f(16) + 1$. But we know that $f(16) = 15$, so we have $f(32) = 2(15) + 1 = 31$.

Now, let's substitute $n = 32$ into the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to get $f(64) = 2f(32) + 1$. But we know that $f(32) = 31$, so we have $f(64) = 2(31) + 1 = 63$.

Now, let's substitute $n = 64$ into the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to get $f(128) = 2f(64) + 1$. But we know that $f(64) = 63$, so we have $f(128) = 2(63) + 1 = 127$.

Now, let's substitute $n = 128$ into the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to get $f(256) = 2f(128) + 1$. But we know that $f(128) = 127$, so we have $f(256) = 2(127) + 1 = 255$.

Now, let's substitute $n = 256$ into the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to get $f(512) = 2f(256) + 1$. But we know that $f(256) = 255$, so we have $f(512) = 2(255) + 1 = 511$.

Now, let's substitute $n = 512$ into the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to get $f(1024) = 2f(512) + 1$. But we know that $f(512) = 511$, so we have $f(1024) = 2(511) + 1 = 1023$.

Now, let's substitute $n = 1024$ into the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to get $f(2048) = 2f(1024) + 1$. But we know that $f(1024) = 1023$, so we have $f(2048) = 2(1023) + 1 = 2047$.

Now, let's substitute $n = 2048$ into the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to get $f(4096) = 2f(2048) + 1$. But we know that $f(2048) = 2047$, so we have $f(4096) = 2(2047) + 1 = 4095$.

**Problem:** 
"The function $f$ is defined on the set of integers and satisfies \[f(n)= \begin{cases}  n-3 & \mbox{if }n\ge 1000 \\  f(f(n+5)) & \mbox{if }n<1000. \end{cases}\]Find $f(84)$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Denote by (1) and (2) the two parts of the definition of $f$, respectively. If we begin to use the definition of $f$ to compute $f(84)$, we use (2) until the argument is at least $1000$: \[f(84) = f(f(89)) = f(f(f(94))) = \dots = f^N(1004)\](where $f^N$ denotes composing $f$ with itself $N$ times, for some $N$). The numbers $84, 89, 94, \dots, 1004$ form an arithmetic sequence with common difference $5$; since $1004 - 84 = 920 = 184 \cdot 5$, this sequence has $184 + 1 = 185$ terms, so $N = 185$.

At this point, (1) and (2) are both used: we compute \[\begin{aligned} f^N(1004) &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-1}(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-1}(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(1000) \\ &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(997) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1002) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(999) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1004). \end{aligned}\]Repeating this process, we see that \[f^N(1004) = f^{N-2}(1004) = f^{N-4}(1004) = \dots = f^3(1004).\](The pattern breaks down for $f^k(1004)$ when $k$ is small, so it is not true that $f^3(1004) = f(1004)$.) Now, we have \[f^3(1004) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^2(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^2(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(1000) \stackrel{(1)}{=} \boxed{997}.\] The answer is $\boxed{997}$

To solve this problem, we will first try to find the value of $f(1)$. By setting $n = 1$ in the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, we get $f(f(f(1))) = 1$. Since $f(f(f(1))) = f(f(1))$ and $f(f(1)) = f(1)$, we have $f(1) = 1$.

Next, we will use the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to find the value of $f(2)$. By setting $n = 1$, we get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2*1 + 1 = 3$.

Now, we can use the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$ to find the value of $f(3)$. By setting $n = 1$, we get $f(f(f(1))) = 1$. Since $f(f(f(1))) = f(f(1))$ and $f(f(1)) = f(1)$, we have $f(3) = 1$.

Continuing this process, we find that $f(4) = 5$, $f(5) = 7$, $f(6) = 9$, $f(7) = 11$, $f(8) = 13$, $f(9) = 15$, $f(10) = 17$, and so on. We notice that $f(n) = 2n - 1$ for all positive integers $n$.

Now, we can calculate $f(100)$ by substituting $n = 100$ into the equation $f(n) = 2n - 1$. We get $f(100) = 2*100 - 1 = 199$.

So, the value of $f(100)$ is $199$. The answer is $\boxed{199}$.

## QUESTION 4 - 12

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"The function $f$ is defined on the set of integers and satisfies \[f(n)= \begin{cases}  n-3 & \mbox{if }n\ge 1000 \\  f(f(n+5)) & \mbox{if }n<1000. \end{cases}\]Find $f(84)$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Denote by (1) and (2) the two parts of the definition of $f$, respectively. If we begin to use the definition of $f$ to compute $f(84)$, we use (2) until the argument is at least $1000$: \[f(84) = f(f(89)) = f(f(f(94))) = \dots = f^N(1004)\](where $f^N$ denotes composing $f$ with itself $N$ times, for some $N$). The numbers $84, 89, 94, \dots, 1004$ form an arithmetic sequence with common difference $5$; since $1004 - 84 = 920 = 184 \cdot 5$, this sequence has $184 + 1 = 185$ terms, so $N = 185$.

At this point, (1) and (2) are both used: we compute \[\begin{aligned} f^N(1004) &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-1}(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-1}(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(1000) \\ &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(997) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1002) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(999) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1004). \end{aligned}\]Repeating this process, we see that \[f^N(1004) = f^{N-2}(1004) = f^{N-4}(1004) = \dots = f^3(1004).\](The pattern breaks down for $f^k(1004)$ when $k$ is small, so it is not true that $f^3(1004) = f(1004)$.) Now, we have \[f^3(1004) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^2(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^2(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(1000) \stackrel{(1)}{=} \boxed{997}.\] The answer is $\boxed{997}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



To find $f(100)$, we can start by substituting $n = 50$ into the second equation to get $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$. Then we can substitute $n = 25$ into the second equation to get $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$. Continuing this process, we can eventually express $f(100)$ in terms of $f(1)$, and then use the first equation to find the value of $f(1)$.

Let's start by calculating $f(1)$:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

def calculate_f_of_1():
    f_1 = symbols('f_1')
    eq = Eq(f(f(f(1))), 8*1 - 7)
    solution = solve(eq, f_1)
    return solution[0]

f_1 = calculate_f_of_1()
print(f_1)
```

Oops, we made a mistake. We should have used the second equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to find $f(1)$. When $n = 1$, we get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. Since $f(2)$ is the smallest value we need to calculate, let's solve for $f(1)$:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def calculate_f_of_1():
    f_1 = symbols('f_1')
    eq = Eq(f(2), 2*f_1 + 1)
    solution = solve(eq.subs(f(2), 1), f_1)
    return solution[0]

f_1 = calculate_f_of_1()
print(f_1)
```

    eq = Eq(f(2), 2*f_1 + 1)

    return solution[0]

f_1 = calculate_f_of_1()

## QUESTION 4 - 13 
- TIME_SPENT : 577 secs

13_
**Example**

**Problem:** 
"The function $f(n)$ is defined on the positive integers such that $f(f(n)) = 2n$ and $f(4n + 1) = 4n + 3$ for all positive integers $n.$  Find $f(1000).$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Consider the expression $f(f(f(a))).$  Since $f(f(a)) = 2a,$ this is equal to $f(2a).$  But taking $n = f(a)$ in $f(f(n)) = 2n,$ we get
\[f(f(f(a))) = 2f(a).\]Hence,
\[f(2a) = 2f(a)\]for all positive integers $a.$

Then
\[f(1000) = 2f(500) = 4f(250) = 8f(125).\]Taking $n = 31$ in $f(4n + 1) = 4n + 3,$ we get
\[f(125) = 127,\]so $f(1000) = \boxed{1016}.$ The answer is $\boxed{1016}$
