**Problem:** 
"How many solutions does the equation \[\frac{(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)\dotsm(x-100)}{(x-1^2)(x-2^2)(x-3^2)\dotsm(x-100^2)} = 0\]have for $x$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Any solution to this equation must make the numerator of the left-hand side zero, while keeping the denominator non-zero. The numerator is zero when $x$ is one of the numbers $1, 2, 3, \dots, 100.$ However, for any value in this list that is a perfect square, the denominator will also be zero, so that value of $x$ will not be a root. Therefore, we want to find the number of integers in the list $1, 2, \dots, 100$ which are not perfect squares. The perfect squares in the list are $1^2, 2^2, \dots, 10^2,$ so there are $10$ perfect squares, and \[100 - 10 = \boxed{90}\]integers which are not perfect squares. The answer is $\boxed{90}$

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $2$. Therefore, $m=200$.
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def find_m():
    """For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"""
    m = 200
    return m

result = find_m()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 200

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
200
```
The value of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $200$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $1$. The answer is $\boxed{1}$.

The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $100$. However, this is not the correct answer.

After reviewing the problem and the solution, we realize that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have $4$ distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100} = 1$. This is because the equation inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, will change its sign at $x = 3$ and $x = -1$. Setting $\frac{m}{100} = 1$, we get $m = 100$.

Therefore, the correct answer is $1$. The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $1$. The value of $m$ is $100$. The answer is $\boxed{1}$.

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


This problem is a bit complex and requires a deep understanding of absolute value equations and their solutions. However, we can use Python to solve it numerically.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to 1. Therefore, $m=100$.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 1.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def count_m():
    """For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"""
    # The equation has 4 distinct solutions when m/100 = 1
    # Therefore, m = 100
    m = 100

    # Count the number of positive integers m
    count = 1

    return count

result = count_m()
print(result)
