"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. This means that the points that satisfy the equation are either the points that satisfy the equation of the first term being zero or the points that satisfy the equation of the second term being zero.

The first term is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This equation is satisfied when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points are of the form $(x, y)$ where $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$. Solving these equations gives the vertices of a square with side length 10.

The second term is $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This equation is satisfied when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that the points are of the form $(x, y)$ where $-8 \leq x \leq 8$ and $-8 \leq y \leq 8$. This is a square with side length 16.

The convex polygon is the intersection of these two squares. It is a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units. The answer is: $100$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Find the number of 10-tuples $(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{10})$ of real numbers such that
\[(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2 = \frac{1}{11}.\]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,
\begin{align*}
&[(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + \dots + 1^2 + 1^2)][(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2] \\
&\ge [(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + (x_2 - x_3) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10}]^2 = 1.
\end{align*}From the given condition, we have equality, so by the equality condition for Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[\frac{1 - x_1}{1} = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{1} = \frac{x_2 - x_3}{1} = \dots = \frac{x_9 - x_{10}}{1} = \frac{x_{10}}{1}.\]Let
\[d = 1 - x_1 = x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_3 = \dots = x_9 - x_{10} = x_{10}.\]Then
\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so
\[(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_{10}) = \left( \frac{10}{11}, \frac{9}{11}, \frac{8}{11}, \dots, \frac{1}{11} \right).\]In particular, there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we can use the property that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, we can set each factor equal to zero and solve for the possible values of $x$ and $y$.

The factors are:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

Setting each factor equal to zero and solving for $x$ and $y$:
1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10 \Rightarrow x + y = 10 \text{ or } x + y = -10$
2. $\vert x - y \vert = 10 \Rightarrow x - y = 10 \text{ or } x - y = -10$
3. $\vert x \vert = 8 \Rightarrow x = 8 \text{ or } x = -8$
4. $\vert y \vert = 8 \Rightarrow y = 8 \text{ or } y = -8$

From these equations, we can find the intersection points of the lines formed by the solutions. After solving these equations, we find the following intersection points:
1. $(8, 2)$, $(8, -10)$, $(-8, 10)$, $(-8, -2)$
2. $(2, 8)$, $(-10, 8)$, $(10, -8)$, $(-2, -8)$

Plotting these points on a graph, we find that they form a square with side length $16$. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if at least one of the factors is zero. This means that the points that satisfy the equation are the union of the points that satisfy $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and the points that satisfy $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points lie on the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, or $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle with side lengths $20$ and $10\sqrt{2}$.

The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that the points lie on the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, or $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length $16$.

The intersection of the two sets of points is the set of points that satisfy both equations. This is the set of points that lie on the rectangle and also on the square. The intersection is the square with side length $16$.

The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so one or both of the expressions must be zero. Let's look at the two expressions:

1. $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$. This equation is only possible when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two squares in the coordinate plane, centered at the origin with side length 20.

2. $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. This equation is only possible when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which are the equations of two squares in the coordinate plane, centered at the origin with side length 16.

The intersection of the two squares is a square with side length 8 (the smaller one), which is our convex polygon.

To find the area of the polygon, we simply square the side length: $8^2 = 64$. So the area of the polygon is 64 square units.

The answer is: $64$

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. This means that the points that satisfy the equation are either the points that satisfy the equation of the first term being zero or the points that satisfy the equation of the second term being zero.

The first term is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This equation is satisfied when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points are of the form $(x, y)$ where $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$. Solving these equations gives the vertices of a square with side length 10.

The second term is $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This equation is satisfied when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that the points are of the form $(x, y)$ where $-8 \leq x \leq 8$ and $-8 \leq y \leq 8$. This is a square with side length 16.

The convex polygon is the intersection of these two squares. It is a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units. The answer is: $100$

\[d = 1 - x_1 = x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_3 = \dots = x_9 - x_{10} = x_{10}.\]Then
\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so
\[(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_{10}) = \left( \frac{10}{11}, \frac{9}{11}, \frac{8}{11}, \dots, \frac{1}{11} \right).\]In particular, there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we can first observe that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$, and solving these equations gives the vertices of the square $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, and $(-5,-5)$.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$, and solving these equations gives the vertices of the square $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

Therefore, the points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying the original equation enclose a convex polygon which is the union of two squares: one with side length $10$ (the square formed by the vertices $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, and $(-5,-5)$), and the other with side length $16$ (the square formed by the vertices $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$).

The area of a square with side length $s$ is $s^2$, so the area of the larger square is $16^2 = 256$ and the area of the smaller square is $10^2 = 100$. The area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares, which is $256 + 100 = 356$.

The answer is: $356$

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



We are given the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of them is zero. Therefore, we can break down the equation into two separate cases:

1. $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$
2. $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$

For the first case, we have $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This forms a square with side length 20, so the area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.

For the second case, we have $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This forms a square with side length 16, so the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

The points satisfying the given equation are the union of the points satisfying the two separate cases. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon formed by these points is the sum of the areas of the two squares, which is $400 + 256 = 656$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 656.
The answer is: $656$

**Problem:** 
"How many square units are in the area of the triangle whose vertices are the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the curve $y = (x-3)^2 (x+2)$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we need to find where this curve intersects the $x$ and $y$ axes.  If $y=0$, then $(x-3)^2(x+2)=0$, which has solutions of $x=3$ and $x=-2$.  If $x=0$, then $y=(-3)^2(2)=18$.  So, the curve has two $x$-intercepts and one $y$-intercept.  The length of the base along the $x$-axis is $3-(-2)=5$.  The height from this base is equal to the $y$-intercept, 18.  The area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 5\cdot 18=\boxed{45}$. The answer is $\boxed{45}$

    # For the second factor to be zero, |x| = 8 and |y| = 8.
    # These conditions define a square with side length 16.
    # The intersection of the two squares is the convex polygon we're interested in.
    # The side length of the polygon is the minimum of the side lengths of the two squares,
    # which is 16.
    side_length = 16
    # The area of the polygon is the square of its side length.
    area = side_length**2
    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
