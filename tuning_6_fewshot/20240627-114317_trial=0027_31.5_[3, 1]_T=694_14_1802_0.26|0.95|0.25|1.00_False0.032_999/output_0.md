**Problem:** 
"Let $\mathcal{P}$ be the parabola in the plane determined by the equation $y = x^2.$  Suppose a circle $\mathcal{C}$ intersects $\mathcal{P}$ at four distinct points.  If three of these points are $(-28,784),$ $(-2,4),$ and $(13,169),$ find the sum of the distances from the focus of $\mathcal{P}$ to all four of the intersection points."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Let the four intersection points be $(a,a^2),$ $(b,b^2),$ $(c,c^2),$ and $(d,d^2).$  Let the equation of the circle be
\[(x - k)^2 + (y - h)^2 = r^2.\]Substituting $y = x^2,$ we get
\[(x - k)^2 + (x^2 - h)^2 = r^2.\]Expanding this equation, we get a fourth degree polynomial whose roots are $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ and $d.$  Furthermore, the coefficient of $x^3$ is 0, so by Vieta's formulas, $a + b + c + d = 0.$

We are given that three intersection points are $(-28,784),$ $(-2,4),$ and $(13,196),$ so the fourth root is $-((-28) + (-2) + 13) = 17.$

The distance from the focus to a point on the parabola is equal to the distance from the point to the directrix, which is $y = -\frac{1}{4}.$  Thus, the sum of the distances is
\[784 + \frac{1}{4} + 4 + \frac{1}{4} + 169 + \frac{1}{4} + 17^2 + \frac{1}{4} = \boxed{1247}.\] The answer is $\boxed{1247}$

The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is a complicated expression. However, we can simplify it by using the condition that the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6. The condition is $\sqrt{(B - A)^2} = 6$, which simplifies to $B - A = 3$. From this, we can deduce that $k = 1$ and $l = 4$. Substituting these values into the expression for the sum of squares of distances, we get:

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, we need to find the intersection points of the parabola and the line $y = 4$. This means we set $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$ and solve for $x$.

2. We know that the points $A$ and $B$ are distance 6 apart, so we can use the distance formula to set up an equation. The distance between two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is $\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$. Here, $y_1 = y_2 = 4$, so the equation simplifies to $\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2} = 6$, or $(x_2 - x_1) = 6$.

3. Now, we need to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. So, we need to find $(x_1^2 + y_1^2) + (x_2^2 + y_2^2)$. Since $y_1 = y_2 = 4$, this simplifies to $x_1^2 + 16 + x_2^2 + 16 = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32$.

4. Now, we need to substitute the solutions of the intersection points into the equation from step 3.

5. To solve this problem, we can use sympy. The steps are as follows:

   a. Define the variables $k$, $l$, $x_1$, and $x_2$.
   
   b. Set up the equation for the intersection points and solve for $x_1$ and $x_2$.
   
   c. Substitute the solutions of $x_1$ and $x_2$ into the equation from step 3.
   
   d. Simplify the expression and evaluate it numerically.

Here is the entire script:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve, sqrt

def calculate_distance_sum():
    k, l, x1, x2 = symbols('k l x1 x2')

    # Set up the equation for the intersection points
    equation = Eq(k*x1**2 - 2*k*x1 + l, 4)
    equation_2 = Eq(k*x2**2 - 2*k*x2 + l, 4)

    # Solve for x1 and x2
    solutions = solve((equation, equation_2), (x1, x2))

    # Substitute the solutions into the equation from step 3
    distance_sum = (solutions[0][0]**2 + 16) + (solutions[1][0]**2 + 16)

    # Simplify the expression and evaluate it numerically
    distance_sum = distance_sum.subs({k: 1, l: 1})
    distance_sum = distance_sum.evalf()

    return distance_sum

result = calculate_distance_sum()
print(result)

**Problem:** 
"Find the distance between the vertex of the graph of the equation $y=x^2 + 2x - 6 $ and the point $(4, 5)$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Completing the square, we get $y=(x + 1)^2 - 7 $. The vertex of the graph of this equation is thus $(-1, -7)$.The distance between $(4, 5)$ and $(-1, -7)$ is $\sqrt{(4-(-1))^2 + (5-(-7))^2} = \sqrt{25+144} =\boxed{13}$. The answer is $\boxed{13}$
