**Problem:** 
"How many solutions does the equation \[\frac{(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)\dotsm(x-100)}{(x-1^2)(x-2^2)(x-3^2)\dotsm(x-100^2)} = 0\]have for $x$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Any solution to this equation must make the numerator of the left-hand side zero, while keeping the denominator non-zero. The numerator is zero when $x$ is one of the numbers $1, 2, 3, \dots, 100.$ However, for any value in this list that is a perfect square, the denominator will also be zero, so that value of $x$ will not be a root. Therefore, we want to find the number of integers in the list $1, 2, \dots, 100$ which are not perfect squares. The perfect squares in the list are $1^2, 2^2, \dots, 10^2,$ so there are $10$ perfect squares, and \[100 - 10 = \boxed{90}\]integers which are not perfect squares. The answer is $\boxed{90}$

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $2$. This is because the expression on the left side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, can take on any value from $0$ to $3$ and only takes on the values $1$ and $2$ for $4$ distinct solutions. Therefore, we have $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which implies $100 < m < 200$. The number of positive integers $m$ in this range is $100$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $100$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"For certain ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ of real numbers, the system of equations
\[\begin{aligned} ax+by&=1 \\ x^2 + y^2 &= 50  \end{aligned}\]has at least one solution, and each solution is an ordered pair $(x,y)\,$ of integers. How many such ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ are there?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The graph of $ax+by=1$ is a line, while the graph of $x^2+y^2=50$ is a circle centered at the origin. Therefore, $(a, b)$ satisfies the conditions if and only if the line and circle intersect at least once, and they intersect only at lattice points (points with integer coordinates).

Knowing this, it makes sense to look for lattice points on the circle whose equation is $x^2+y^2=50$. Testing cases, we find that there are twelve lattice points on the circle: $(\pm 1, \pm 7)$, $(\pm 7, \pm 1)$, and $(\pm 5, \pm 5)$ (where the two $\pm$ signs in each pair are independent of each other).

There are $\tbinom{12}{2} = 66$ pairs of these points, and each pair determines a line. However, the graph of $ax+by=1$ can never pass through the origin $(0, 0)$, since if $x=y=0$, then $ax+by=0 \neq 1$. Therefore, the six pairs which consist of diametrically opposed points are invalid, since the line through them passes through the origin. This corrects our count to $66 - 6 = 60$.

In addition, for each of the twelve points, there is a line tangent to the circle at that point, so that the only solution to the system is that one point. This brings the final total to $60 + 12 = \boxed{72}$. The answer is $\boxed{72}$

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


This problem is a challenging problem in mathematics, especially for those who are not familiar with absolute value functions and their properties. However, with a little bit of understanding and some programming skills, we can solve it.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 1 and 2. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ oscillates between 1 and 2 as $x$ varies over the real numbers.

So we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Multiplying all sides of the inequalities by 100 gives $100 < m < 200$. The number of positive integers in this range is $200 - 100 - 1 = 99$.

So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 99.

Here is a Python code to calculate the answer:
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def number_of_solutions():
    lower_bound = 100
    upper_bound = 200
    number_of_solutions = upper_bound - lower_bound - 1
    return number_of_solutions

result = number_of_solutions()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 99

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
99
```
The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is $99$. The answer is $\boxed{99}$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, we need to understand that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. This means that the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be equal to 2. This is because the absolute value function makes the expression inside it non-negative, so the only way for the equation to have 4 distinct solutions is when the right side of the equation is 2.

2. Therefore, we have $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, which simplifies to $m = 200$.

3. So, the value of $m$ that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions is 200.

However, this is not the final answer, as we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy this condition. Since we have only one value of $m$, which is 200, and it is a positive integer, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition is 1.

So, the answer is $1$.
The answer is: $1$

Assistant:

 The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be solved by considering the cases for the absolute value inside the absolute value. This gives us four cases:

1. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 > 0$, then the equation becomes $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$.
2. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0$, then the equation becomes $-( \vert x-1 \vert -2) = \frac{m}{100}$.
3. If $x-1 > 0$, then the equation becomes $x-1 -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.
4. If $x-1 < 0$, then the equation becomes $-(x-1) -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ or $-(x-1) -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.

By solving these equations, we find that the value of $m$ that gives $4$ distinct solutions is $m=50$. Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ that satisfies the condition, and the answer is $1$. The value of $m$ is $50$. The answer is: $1$

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $2$. This is because the expression on the left side of the equation is always between $1$ and $3$, and it is equal to $\frac{m}{100}$ exactly when it takes on these values. Therefore, we have $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which implies $100 < m < 200$. The number of positive integers $m$ in this range is $100$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $100$. The answer is: $100$
