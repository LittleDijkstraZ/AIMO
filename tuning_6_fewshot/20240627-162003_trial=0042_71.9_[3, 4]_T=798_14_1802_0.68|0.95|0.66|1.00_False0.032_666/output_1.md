**Problem:** 
"If $x + 2y= 4$ and $xy = -8$, what is the value of $x^2 + 4y^2$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
We see that $(x + 2y)^2 = (x^2 + 4y^2) + 4xy = 4^2 = 16$. We want to find $x^2 + 4y^2$ and are given $xy = -8$. So, $x^2 + 4y^2 + 4xy = x^2 + 4y^2 + 4(-8) = 16$. It follows that $x^2 + 4y^2 = \boxed{48}$. The answer is $\boxed{48}$

**Problem:** 
"Find the minimum value of $2x^2 + 2y^2 + 5z^2 - 2xy - 4yz - 4x - 2z + 15$ over all real numbers $x,$ $y,$ $z.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
We can write the given expression as
\begin{align*}
&(x^2 - 4x + 4) + (x^2 - 2xy + y^2) + (y^2 - 4yz + 4z^2) + (z^2 - 2z + 1) + 10 \\
&= (x - 2)^2 + (x - y)^2 + (y - 2z)^2 + (z - 1)^2 + 10
\end{align*}The minimum value is then $\boxed{10},$ which occurs when $x = 2,$ $y = 2,$ and $z = 1.$ The answer is $\boxed{10}$

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we can use the method of completing the square. First, let's rewrite the given expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $(x^2-4xy+4y^2)+(y^2-4xy+4x^2) = (x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2$.

The condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ implies that $x-2y$ and $y-2x$ have the same absolute value, but opposite signs. Therefore, either $x-2y = y-2x$ or $x-2y = -(y-2x)$.

If $x-2y = y-2x$, then $x = y$. Substituting $x = y$ into the condition, we get $|x-2x| + |x-2x| = |-x| + |-x| = 2|x| = 40$, so $|x| = 20$, and $x = \pm 20$.

If $x-2y = -(y-2x)$, then $x-2y = -y+2x$, or $y = 3x$. Substituting $y = 3x$ into the condition, we get $|x-6x| + |3x-2x| = |-5x| + |x| = 6|x| = 40$, so $|x| = \frac{40}{6} = \frac{20}{3}$, which is not possible since $x$ must be a real number.

Therefore, the only possible solution is $x = y$. Substituting $x = y$ into the expression $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2$, we get $(x-2x)^2 + (x-2x)^2 = 0$.

So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $0$. However, this is not a positive integer. The mistake is that we misunderstood the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. The correct interpretation of the condition is that the sum of the absolute values of the differences of $x$ and $2y$, and $y$ and $2x$, is 40. The correct condition is $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, which implies that either $x-2y$ and $y-2x$ are both positive, or both negative.

If $x-2y > 0$ and $y-2x > 0$, then $x > 2y$ and $y > 2x$, which is impossible. If $x-2y < 0$ and $y-2x < 0$, then $x < 2y$ and $y < 2x$. Let $x = 2y - a$ and $y = 2x - b$, where $a$ and $b$ are positive real numbers. Substituting these into the condition, we get $(2y - y) + (2x - x) = a + b = 40$, so $a = b = 20$.

Substituting $x = 2y - 20$ and $y = 2x - 20$ into the expression $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2$, we get $(2y - 20 - 2y)^2 + (2x - 20 - 2x)^2 = 400$.

So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $400$. Therefore, the minimum value of the given expression is $400$. The answer is: $400$
