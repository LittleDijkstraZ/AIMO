**Problem:** 
"How many integers are solutions to the equation $$(x-2)^{(25-x^2)}=1?$$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
We need some basic facts from number theory: $a^0 = 1$ for any $a,$ $1^b = 1$ for any $b,$ and $(-1)^c = 1$ if $c$ is an even integer. Unless the base is a complex number (which is excluded since we are looking for integer solutions), there are no other ways to get an RHS of $1.$ Thus, either the exponent is zero $($giving the equation $25 - x^2 = 0),$ the base is $1$ $($giving $x -2 = 1),$ or the base is $-1$ and the exponent is even $($giving the simultaneous equations $x - 2 = -1$ and $25 - x^2 = 2n$ for some integer $n).$ Solving the first equation gives $x = \pm 5,$ and solving the second gives $x = 3.$ The third equation implies that $x = 1,$ in which case $25 - x^2 = 24$ is indeed even, so $x = 1$ is a valid solution. In all, there are $\boxed{4}$ integer solutions. The answer is $\boxed{4}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



To solve the problem, we need to find the value of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. We can start by considering the possible values of $\frac{m}{100}$.

If $\frac{m}{100} = 0$, the equation simplifies to $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = 0$, which implies $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$. This gives us two solutions: $x = 3$ and $x = -1$.

If $\frac{m}{100} = 1$, the equation becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = 1$. This gives us four solutions: $x = 0$, $x = 2$, $x = 4$, and $x = -2$.

If $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, the equation becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = 2$, which simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = 4$. This gives us two solutions: $x = 5$ and $x = -3$.

If $\frac{m}{100} > 2$, the equation becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert > 2$, which is not possible as the left-hand side is always less than or equal to $2$.

Therefore, the only value of $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $m = 100$. So the answer is $\boxed{100}$.
The value of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $100$.
The answer is: $100$

## QUESTION 2 - 1

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"For certain ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ of real numbers, the system of equations
\[\begin{aligned} ax+by&=1 \\ x^2 + y^2 &= 50  \end{aligned}\]has at least one solution, and each solution is an ordered pair $(x,y)\,$ of integers. How many such ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ are there?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The graph of $ax+by=1$ is a line, while the graph of $x^2+y^2=50$ is a circle centered at the origin. Therefore, $(a, b)$ satisfies the conditions if and only if the line and circle intersect at least once, and they intersect only at lattice points (points with integer coordinates).

Knowing this, it makes sense to look for lattice points on the circle whose equation is $x^2+y^2=50$. Testing cases, we find that there are twelve lattice points on the circle: $(\pm 1, \pm 7)$, $(\pm 7, \pm 1)$, and $(\pm 5, \pm 5)$ (where the two $\pm$ signs in each pair are independent of each other).

There are $\tbinom{12}{2} = 66$ pairs of these points, and each pair determines a line. However, the graph of $ax+by=1$ can never pass through the origin $(0, 0)$, since if $x=y=0$, then $ax+by=0 \neq 1$. Therefore, the six pairs which consist of diametrically opposed points are invalid, since the line through them passes through the origin. This corrects our count to $66 - 6 = 60$.

In addition, for each of the twelve points, there is a line tangent to the circle at that point, so that the only solution to the system is that one point. This brings the final total to $60 + 12 = \boxed{72}$. The answer is $\boxed{72}$

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we need to find the value of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. 

We can start by simplifying the equation. First, let's set $\frac{m}{100}=a$. Then the equation becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=a$. 

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=a$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $a$ is a positive number. 

Now, we need to solve the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=a$ for $x$. 

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=a$ has four distinct solutions if and only if $a$ is a positive number. 

So we need to find the positive values of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. 

To do this, we can start by finding the values of $m$ for which $\frac{m}{100}$ is positive. This means $m$ must be a positive integer. 

Next, we need to find the values of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. This means we need to find the values of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=a$ (where $a=\frac{m}{100}$) has 4 distinct solutions. 

To do this, we can graph the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=a$ and count the number of distinct solutions for different values of $a$. 

The graph of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=a$ consists of four line segments, each of which is a solution to the equation. The number of distinct solutions is equal to the number of line segments that intersect the $x$-axis. 

By counting the number of distinct solutions for different values of $a$, we find that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=a$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $a=1$. 

Therefore, the only positive integer value of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is $m=100$. 

So the value of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is $100$. The answer is: 100

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly 4 distinct solutions.

2. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ involves absolute values, which makes it difficult to directly solve. However, we can consider the number of times the right-hand side $\frac{m}{100}$ "hits" the graph of the left-hand side $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$.

3. The graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a "V" shape with the "bottom" of the "V" at $x=1$. The slope of the two sides of the "V" is -1 and 1.

4. The right-hand side $\frac{m}{100}$ is a horizontal line that we move up and down to see how many times it intersects the graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$.

5. We need exactly 4 distinct solutions, which means the line $\frac{m}{100}$ should be moved up and down exactly 4 times to hit the graph.

6. This means the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ should be equal to the differences between the heights of the "bottom" of the "V" and the points where the sides of the "V" change their slope.

7. These differences are 1, 2, and 3 (from the point where the slope changes from -1 to 1, to the top of the "V", and back to the point where the slope changes from 1 to -1).

8. To have exactly 4 distinct solutions, $\frac{m}{100}$ should be equal to one of these differences.

9. Therefore, the possible values of $m$ are $1*100$, $2*100$, and $3*100$, which are 100, 200, and 300.

10. Thus, there are 3 possible values of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly 4 distinct solutions.

11. The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy this condition, so we are looking for the number of positive integers in the set {100, 200, 300}.

12. There are 3 positive integers in this set.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly 4 distinct solutions is 3.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

    # The possible values of m are 100, 200, and 300
    m_values = [100, 200, 300]
    
    # Count the number of positive integers in the list
    count = len(m_values)
    
    return count

result = count_positive_integers()

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many distinct solutions are there to the equation $|x-7| = |x+1|$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
If $|x-7| = |x+1|$, then either $x-7 = x+1$ or $x-7 = -(x+1)$.  Simplifying $x-7=x+1$ gives $0=8$, which has no solutions, so no values of $x$ satisfy $x-7 = x+1$.  If $x-7 = -(x+1)$, then $x-7 = -x-1$, so $2x = 6$, which gives $x=3$.  So, there is $\boxed{1}$ solution.

Challenge: See if you can find a quick solution to this problem by simply thinking about the graphs of $y=|x-7|$ and $y=|x+1|$. The answer is $\boxed{1}$
