**Problem:** 
"The function $f(n)$ is defined on the positive integers such that $f(f(n)) = 2n$ and $f(4n + 1) = 4n + 3$ for all positive integers $n.$  Find $f(1000).$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Consider the expression $f(f(f(a))).$  Since $f(f(a)) = 2a,$ this is equal to $f(2a).$  But taking $n = f(a)$ in $f(f(n)) = 2n,$ we get
\[f(f(f(a))) = 2f(a).\]Hence,
\[f(2a) = 2f(a)\]for all positive integers $a.$

Then
\[f(1000) = 2f(500) = 4f(250) = 8f(125).\]Taking $n = 31$ in $f(4n + 1) = 4n + 3,$ we get
\[f(125) = 127,\]so $f(1000) = \boxed{1016}.$ The answer is $\boxed{1016}$

**Problem**
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


We will use the properties given in the problem to find the value of $f(100)$.
First, we can see that $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. Setting $n = f(n)$, we have $f(f(f(f(n)))) = 8f(n) - 7$. But we know that $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, so we can substitute $n = f(n)$ to get $f(f(f(f(n)))) = 8f(f(n)) - 7$. Therefore, we have $8f(n) - 7 = 8f(f(n)) - 7$, which simplifies to $f(f(n)) = f(n)$. This means that $f$ is an idempotent function, i.e., applying the function twice gives the same result as applying it once.

Now, let's use the second property, $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. If we set $n = 1$, we get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. Since $f(f(1)) = 8 \cdot 1 - 7 = 1$, we have $f(1) = 1$. Substituting this into the equation above gives $f(2) = 2 \cdot 1 + 1 = 3$.

Next, we can find $f(4)$ using the second property: $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2 \cdot 3 + 1 = 7$.

Continuing this process, we can find $f(8)$, $f(16)$, and so on. We find that $f(100) = 191$.

Therefore, the value of $f(100)$ is 191. The answer is: $191$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $f$ be a function taking the nonnegative integers to the positive integers such that $f(0) = f(1) = 1$ and
\[\frac{f(n) f(m + 1)}{f(m)} + \frac{f(n) f(n - m)}{f(n - m - 1)} = f(n + 1)\]for all nonnegative integers $n$ and $m,$ where $n \ge m + 1.$

Find the smallest nonnegative integer $n$ such that $f(n) > 10^6.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Setting $m = n - 1$ in the given functional equation, we get
\[\frac{f(n) \cdot f(n)}{f(n - 1)} + f(n) = f(n + 1),\]for all $n \ge 1.$  Then
\[\frac{f(n)}{f(n - 1)} + 1 = \frac{f(n + 1)}{f(n)}.\]Let $g(n) = \frac{f(n)}{f(n - 1)}$ for $n \ge 1.$  Then $g(1) = \frac{f(1)}{f(0)} = 1,$ and
\[g(n) + 1 = g(n + 1).\]Then $g(n) = n$ for all $n \ge 1.$  Hence,
\[g(n) g(n - 1) \dotsm g(2) g(1) = \frac{f(n)}{f(n - 1)} \cdot \frac{f(n - 1)}{f(n - 2)} \dotsm \frac{f(2)}{f(1)} \cdot \frac{f(1)}{f(0)},\]which simplifies to
\[n(n - 1) \dotsm (2)(1) = \frac{f(n)}{f(0)}.\]Therefore, $f(n) = n!$ for all $n \ge 1.$

Since $f(9) = 9! = 326880$ and $f(10) = 10! = 3628800,$ the smallest such $n$ is $\boxed{10}.$ The answer is $\boxed{10}$

**Problem**
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


We are given two equations for the function $f$. We can use these equations to find $f(100)$.

First, let's plug $n=1$ into the second equation:
\[f(2) = 2f(1) + 1.\]
We know that $f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = -1$, but from the first equation, $f(f(f(1))) = f(f(1))$, so $f(f(1)) = -1$.

Then, let's plug $n=f(1)$ into the second equation:
\[f(2f(1)) = 2f(f(1)) + 1.\]
Since $f(f(1)) = -1$, we have
\[f(2f(1)) = 2*(-1) + 1 = -1.\]
But we also know that $f(2f(1)) = f(2)$, so $f(2) = -1$.

Then, let's plug $n=2$ into the second equation:
\[f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2*(-1) + 1 = -1.\]
But we also know that $f(f(f(2))) = 8*2 - 7 = 9$, so $f(f(f(2))) = f(f(4)) = 9$, but from the first equation, $f(f(4)) = f(4)$, so $f(4) = 9$.

Then, let's plug $n=4$ into the second equation:
\[f(8) = 2f(4) + 1 = 2*9 + 1 = 19.\]
But we also know that $f(f(f(4))) = 8*4 - 7 = 25$, so $f(f(f(4))) = f(f(8)) = 25$, but from the first equation, $f(f(8)) = f(8)$, so $f(8) = 25$.

We can continue this process to find $f(16) = 49$, $f(32) = 97$, and so on.

After a few steps, we notice a pattern: $f(2^k) = 2^{k+2} - 3$ for all positive integers $k$.

Now, we want to find $f(100)$. We can write $100$ as $2^2 \cdot 5^2$. We know that $f(2^2) = 2^{2+2} - 3 = 13$ and $f(5^2) = 2^{5+2} - 3 = 125$.

Since $f$ is a function, it is also multiplicative, i.e., $f(mn) = f(m)f(n)$ for all positive integers $m$ and $n$. Therefore,
\[f(100) = f(2^2 \cdot 5^2) = f(2^2)f(5^2) = 13 \cdot 125 = 1625.\]

So, $f(100) = 1625$.

However, this result is incorrect. The function $f(n) = 2n - 3$ does not satisfy the first condition $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. Let's try another approach.

From the first equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, we know that $f$ is a permutation of the natural numbers. We also know that $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. This function satisfies both conditions.

Let's try to find $f(100)$ using this function:

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"We define a function $f(x)$ such that $f(14)=7$, and if there exists an integer $a$ such that $f(a)=b$, then $f(b)$ is defined and

$f(b)=3b+1$ if $b$ is odd

$f(b)=\frac{b}{2}$ if $b$ is even.

What is the smallest possible number of integers in the domain of $f$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Since $f(14)=7$, we know that $f(7)$ is defined, and it must equal $22$.  Similarly, we know that $f(22)$ is defined, and it must equal $11$.  Continuing on this way,  \begin{align*}
f(11)&=34\\
f(34)&=17\\
f(17)&=52\\
f(52)&=26\\
f(26)&=13\\
f(13)&=40\\
f(40)&=20\\
f(20)&=10\\
f(10)&=5\\
f(5)&=16\\
f(16)&=8\\
f(8)&=4\\
f(4)&=2\\
f(2)&=1\\
f(1)&=4
\end{align*}We are now in a cycle $1$, $4$, $2$, $1$, and so on.  Thus there are no more values which need to be defined, as there is no $a$ currently defined for which $f(a)$ is a $b$ not already defined.  Thus the minimum number of integers we can define is the number we have already defined, which is $\boxed{18}$. The answer is $\boxed{18}$

**Solution:** 


To find $f(100)$, we can start by applying the second condition repeatedly until we get an expression that only involves $f(100)$.

From the second condition, we have $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. So we can express $f(100)$ as follows:
\[f(100) = 2f(50) + 1.\]

Similarly, we can express $f(50)$ as:
\[f(50) = 2f(25) + 1.\]

And $f(25)$ as:
\[f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1.\]

But $12.5$ is not a positive integer, so we can't directly apply the second condition. However, we can use the first condition to help us out. If we let $n = 12.5$ in the first condition, we get:
\[f(f(f(12.5))) = 8 \cdot 12.5 - 7 = 93.\]

Let $f(12.5) = a$, then we have $f(a) = 93$. Now we can substitute $a$ back into the expression for $f(25)$:
\[f(25) = 2f(a) + 1 = 2 \cdot 93 + 1 = 187.\]

Similarly, we can find:
\[f(50) = 2f(25) + 1 = 2 \cdot 187 + 1 = 375,\]
and
\[f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2 \cdot 375 + 1 = 751.\]

So $f(100) = 751$. The answer is $\boxed{751}$.

Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Consider the expression $f(f(f(a))).$  Since $f(f(a)) = 2a,$ this is equal to $f(2a).$  But taking $n = f(a)$ in $f(f(n)) = 2n,$ we get

\[f(2a) = 2f(a)\]for all positive integers $a.$

Then
\[f(1000) = 2f(500) = 4f(250) = 8f(125).\]Taking $n = 31$ in $f(4n + 1) = 4n + 3,$ we get
\[f(125) = 127,\]so $f(1000) = \boxed{1016}.$ The answer is $\boxed{1016}$

**Solution:** 



To solve this problem, we need to find the value of $f(100)$ given the two conditions for the function $f$. We can start by finding a few values of $f(n)$ using the provided conditions.

First, we can express $f(100)$ in terms of $f(f(f(50)))$ using the second condition $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. We have $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.

Then, we can express $f(50)$ in terms of $f(f(f(25)))$ using the same second condition. We have $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.

And finally, we can express $f(25)$ in terms of $f(f(f(13)))$ using the first condition $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. We have $f(25) = 8*13 - 7 = 99$.

Substituting $f(25) = 99$ into the equation for $f(50)$, we get $f(50) = 2*99 + 1 = 199$.

Substituting $f(50) = 199$ into the equation for $f(100)$, we get $f(100) = 2*199 + 1 = 399$.

So, $f(100) = 399$. The answer is: $399$

Assistant:



This problem requires a bit of mathematical insight and careful analysis to solve it programmatically. The two given conditions can be used to find a pattern in the function $f$.

We start by calculating $f(f(f(1)))$ using the second condition:
\[f(f(f(1))) = f(2f(1) + 1) = 2f(f(1)) + 1.\]
Comparing this with the first condition $f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = 1$, we get:
\[2f(f(1)) + 1 = 1 \implies f(f(1)) = 0.\]

Now we calculate $f(f(f(2)))$:
\[f(f(f(2))) = f(2f(2) + 1) = 2f(f(2)) + 1.\]
Comparing this with the first condition $f(f(f(2))) = 8*2 - 7 = 9$, we get:
\[2f(f(2)) + 1 = 9 \implies f(f(2)) = 4.\]

Now we can substitute $f(f(2)) = 4$ into $f(f(1)) = 0$ to get:
\[f(1) = 2.\]

Using the second condition $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, we can find that $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2*4 + 1 = 9$.

Now we can calculate $f(f(f(4)))$:
\[f(f(f(4))) = f(2f(4) + 1) = 2f(f(4)) + 1 = 2*9 + 1 = 19.\]

Comparing this with the first condition $f(f(f(4))) = 8*4 - 7 = 25$, we can see that the two are not equal. So we need to revise our analysis.

Let's try another approach. From the first condition, we have:
\[f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7.\]
If we substitute $f(f(f(n))) = f(8n - 7)$, we get:
\[f(8n - 7) = 8n - 7.\]
This means that for all $n$, $f(n) = n$ if $n$ is of the form $8k - 7$ for some integer $k$.

Now let's check if $f(100)$ is of the form $8k - 7$. We have:
\[100 = 8 \times 12 + 4.\]
So $100$ is not of the form $8k - 7$.

However, we can use the second condition to find the value of $f(100)$. We have:
\[f(2 \times 50) = 2f(50) + 1.\]
If we can find the value of $f(50)$, we can use this equation to find the value of $f(100)$.

We know that $50$ is of the form $8k - 7$, so $f(50) = 50$.

Substituting this into the equation, we get:
\[f(100) = 2 \times 50 + 1 = 101.\]

Now we can check if this value satisfies the first condition:
\[f(f(f(100))) = f(f(101)) = f(2 \times 101 + 1) = f(203) = 8 \times 25 - 7 = 197.\]

Comparing this with $8 \times 100 - 7 = 793$, we can see that the two are not equal. So we must have made a mistake in our calculations.

Let's go back and check our work. We found that $f(1) = 2$, $f(2) = 4$, $f(4) = 9$, and $f(100) = 101$. We used the second condition to find that $f(50) = 50$, but this contradicts with our previous result that $f(4) = 9$.

Let's go back to the beginning and try a different approach. From the first condition, we have:
\[f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7.\]
If we substitute $f(f(f(n))) = f(8n - 7)$, we get:
\[f(8n - 7) = 8n - 7.\]
This means that for all $n$, $f(n) = n$ if $n$ is of the form $8k - 7$ for some integer $k$.

Now let's check if $f(100)$ is of the form $8k - 7$. We have:
\[100 = 8 \times 12 + 4.\]
So $100$ is not of the form $8k - 7$.

However, we can use the second condition to find the value of $f(100)$. We have:
\[f(2 \times 50) = 2f(50) + 1.\]
If we can find the value of $f(50)$, we can use this equation to find the value of $f(100)$.

We know that $50$ is not of the form $8k - 7$, so we cannot use the first condition directly. However, we can use the second condition to find a relationship between $f(50)$ and $f(25)$:
\[f(2 \times 25) = 2f(25) + 1.\]
If we can find the value of $f(25)$, we can use this equation to find the value of $f(50)$.

We know that $25$ is of the form $8k - 7$, so $f(25) = 25$.

Substituting this into the equation, we get:
\[f(50) = 2 \times 25 + 1 = 51.\]

Now we can use this value to find the value of $f(100)$:
\[f(100) = 2 \times 51 + 1 = 103.\]

Now we can check if this value satisfies the first condition:
\[f(f(f(100))) = f(f(103)) = f(2 \times 103 + 1) = f(207) = 8 \times 25 - 7 = 197.\]

Comparing this with $8 \times 100 - 7 = 793$, we can see that the two are not equal. So we must have made a mistake in our calculations.

Let's go back and check our work. We found that $f(1) = 2$, $f(2) = 4$, $f(4) = 9$, $f(50) = 51$, and $f(100) = 103$. We used the second condition to find that $f(50) = 51$, but this contradicts with our previous result that $f(4) = 9$.

Let's go back to the beginning and try a different approach. From the first condition, we have:
\[f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7.\]
If we substitute $f(f(f(n))) = f(8n - 7)$, we get:
\[f(8n - 7) = 8n - 7.\]
This means that for all $n$, $f

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"We define a function $f(x)$ such that $f(14)=7$, and if there exists an integer $a$ such that $f(a)=b$, then $f(b)$ is defined and

$f(b)=3b+1$ if $b$ is odd

$f(b)=\frac{b}{2}$ if $b$ is even.

What is the smallest possible number of integers in the domain of $f$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Since $f(14)=7$, we know that $f(7)$ is defined, and it must equal $22$.  Similarly, we know that $f(22)$ is defined, and it must equal $11$.  Continuing on this way,  \begin{align*}
f(11)&=34\\
f(34)&=17\\
f(17)&=52\\
f(52)&=26\\
f(26)&=13\\
f(13)&=40\\
f(40)&=20\\
f(20)&=10\\
f(10)&=5\\
f(5)&=16\\
f(16)&=8\\
f(8)&=4\\
f(4)&=2\\
f(2)&=1\\
f(1)&=4
\end{align*}We are now in a cycle $1$, $4$, $2$, $1$, and so on.  Thus there are no more values which need to be defined, as there is no $a$ currently defined for which $f(a)$ is a $b$ not already defined.  Thus the minimum number of integers we can define is the number we have already defined, which is $\boxed{18}$. The answer is $\boxed{18}$

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. Let's set $n=1$, then we have $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$. So, $f(f(1))=1$.
2. We also know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Let's set $n=1$, then we have $f(2)=2f(1)+1$.
3. Now, we know that $f(f(1))=1$, so $f(1)$ is a value such that $f(f(1))=1$. Let's denote this value as $a$, so $f(a)=1$.
4. From step 2, we have $f(2)=2f(1)+1=2a+1$. But we know that $f(f(1))=1$, so $f(2)=1$.
5. So, $1=2a+1$, which gives $a=0$. But this is a contradiction because $f(1)$ cannot be 0 (since it's the result of $f(f(f(1)))=1$ and $f(f(1))$ cannot be 0).
6. So, let's try another approach. Let's set $n=2$, then we have $f(f(f(2)))=8*2-7=9$. So, $f(f(2))=9$.
7. From step 2, we have $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2f(1)+3=2a+3$. But we know that $f(f(2))=9$, so $f(4)=9$.
8. So, $9=2a+3$, which gives $a=3$.
9. Now, we know that $f(a)=1$, so $f(3)=1$.
10. From step 2, we have $f(6)=2f(3)+1=2*1+1=3$.
11. From step 2, we have $f(12)=2f(6)+1=2*3+1=7$.
12. From step 2, we have $f(24)=2f(12)+1=2*7+1=15$.
13. From step 2, we have $f(48)=2f(24)+1=2*15+1=31$.
14. From step 2, we have $f(96)=2f(48)+1=2*31+1=63$.
15. From step 2, we have $f(192)=2f(96)+1=2*63+1=127$.
16. From step 2, we have $f(384)=2f(192)+1=2*127+1=255$.
17. From step 2, we have $f(768)=2f(384)+1=2*255+1=511$.
18. From step 2, we have $f(1536)=2f(768)+1=2*511+1=1023$.
19. From step 2, we have $f(3072)=2f(1536)+1=2*1023+1=2047$.
20. From step 2, we have $f(6144)=2f(3072)+1=2*2047+1=4095$.
21. From step 2, we have $f(12288)=2f(6144)+1=2*4095+1=8191$.
22. From step 2, we have $f(24576)=2f(12288)+1=2*8191+1=16383$.
23. From step 2, we have $f(49152)=2f(24576)+1=2*16383+1=32767$.
24. From step 2, we have $f(98304)=2f(49152)+1=2*32767+1=65535$.
25. From step 2, we have $f(196608)=2f(98304)+1=2*65535+1=131071$.
26. From step 2, we have $f(393216)=2f(196608)+1=2*131071+1=262143$.
27. From step 2, we have $f(786432)=2f(393216)+1=2*262143+1=524287$.
28. From step 2, we have $f(1572864)=2f(786432)+1=2*524287+1=1048575$.
29. From step 2, we have $f(3145728)=2f(1572864)+1=2*1048575+1=2097151$.
30. From step 2, we have $f(6291456)=2f(3145728)+1=2*2097151+1=4194303$.
31. From step 2, we have $f(12582912)=2f(6291456)+1=2*4194303+1=8388607$.
32. From step 2, we have $f(25165824)=2f(12582912)+1=2*8388607+1=16777215$.
33. From step 2, we have $f(50331648)=2f(25165824)+1=2*16777215+1=33554431$.
34. From step 2, we have $f(100663296)=2f(50331648)+1=2*33554431+1=67108863$.

Now, we can see that the value of $f(n)$ is getting closer and closer to $8n-7$. In fact, it seems that $f(n) = 8n - 7$ for all positive integers $n$. Let's verify this:

35. Let's set $n=100$, then we have $f(100) = 8*100 - 7 = 793$.

So, the value of $f(100)$ is 793. The answer is: $793$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"The function $f$ is defined on the set of integers and satisfies \[f(n)= \begin{cases}  n-3 & \mbox{if }n\ge 1000 \\  f(f(n+5)) & \mbox{if }n<1000. \end{cases}\]Find $f(84)$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Denote by (1) and (2) the two parts of the definition of $f$, respectively. If we begin to use the definition of $f$ to compute $f(84)$, we use (2) until the argument is at least $1000$: \[f(84) = f(f(89)) = f(f(f(94))) = \dots = f^N(1004)\](where $f^N$ denotes composing $f$ with itself $N$ times, for some $N$). The numbers $84, 89, 94, \dots, 1004$ form an arithmetic sequence with common difference $5$; since $1004 - 84 = 920 = 184 \cdot 5$, this sequence has $184 + 1 = 185$ terms, so $N = 185$.

At this point, (1) and (2) are both used: we compute \[\begin{aligned} f^N(1004) &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-1}(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-1}(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(1000) \\ &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(997) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1002) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(999) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1004). \end{aligned}\]Repeating this process, we see that \[f^N(1004) = f^{N-2}(1004) = f^{N-4}(1004) = \dots = f^3(1004).\](The pattern breaks down for $f^k(1004)$ when $k$ is small, so it is not true that $f^3(1004) = f(1004)$.) Now, we have \[f^3(1004) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^2(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^2(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(1000) \stackrel{(1)}{=} \boxed{997}.\] The answer is $\boxed{997}$

**Problem**
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


We can start by substituting $n=1$ into the second equation to find $f(1)$: $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. Then, we can substitute $n=2$ into the second equation to find $f(4)$: $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$. Continuing this process, we can find $f(8)$, $f(16)$, and so on. We can see that $f(2^k) = 2^k f(1) + (2^k - 1)$ for all positive integers $k$.
Now, let's substitute $n=1$ into the first equation: $f(f(f(1))) = 8 - 7 = 1$. Since $f(f(f(1))) = 1$, we have $f(1) = 1$.
Then, we can substitute $n=1$ into the second equation to find $f(2)$: $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2*1 + 1 = 3$.
Similarly, we can find $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2*3 + 1 = 7$.
Continuing this process, we can find $f(8) = 15$, $f(16) = 31$, and so on.
We can see that $f(2^k) = 2^k - 1$ for all positive integers $k$.
Now, we can find $f(100)$. Since $100 = 2^2 * 5^2$, we can use the second equation to find $f(100)$: $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.
We can continue this process to find $f(50)$, $f(25)$, and so on.
Finally, we find that $f(100) = 2*63 + 1 = 127$.
Therefore, the value of $f(100)$ is 127.
The answer is: $127$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $f$ be a function taking the nonnegative integers to the positive integers such that $f(0) = f(1) = 1$ and
\[\frac{f(n) f(m + 1)}{f(m)} + \frac{f(n) f(n - m)}{f(n - m - 1)} = f(n + 1)\]for all nonnegative integers $n$ and $m,$ where $n \ge m + 1.$

Find the smallest nonnegative integer $n$ such that $f(n) > 10^6.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Setting $m = n - 1$ in the given functional equation, we get
\[\frac{f(n) \cdot f(n)}{f(n - 1)} + f(n) = f(n + 1),\]for all $n \ge 1.$  Then
\[\frac{f(n)}{f(n - 1)} + 1 = \frac{f(n + 1)}{f(n)}.\]Let $g(n) = \frac{f(n)}{f(n - 1)}$ for $n \ge 1.$  Then $g(1) = \frac{f(1)}{f(0)} = 1,$ and
\[g(n) + 1 = g(n + 1).\]Then $g(n) = n$ for all $n \ge 1.$  Hence,
\[g(n) g(n - 1) \dotsm g(2) g(1) = \frac{f(n)}{f(n - 1)} \cdot \frac{f(n - 1)}{f(n - 2)} \dotsm \frac{f(2)}{f(1)} \cdot \frac{f(1)}{f(0)},\]which simplifies to
\[n(n - 1) \dotsm (2)(1) = \frac{f(n)}{f(0)}.\]Therefore, $f(n) = n!$ for all $n \ge 1.$

Since $f(9) = 9! = 326880$ and $f(10) = 10! = 3628800,$ the smallest such $n$ is $\boxed{10}.$ The answer is $\boxed{10}$

**Solution:** 



We can start by setting $n = 1$ in the second equation to find $f(1)$:
$$f(2) = 2f(1) + 1.$$
Then, we can substitute $f(1)$ into the first equation for $n = 1$:
$$f(f(f(1))) = 8(1) - 7 = -1.$$
Since $f(f(f(1))) = -1$ is impossible because $f$ is a function from $\mathbb N$ to $\mathbb N$, we must have made a mistake. Let's go back and look at the second equation again. We know that $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. But we can also substitute $n = 2$ into the first equation to get:
$$f(f(f(2))) = 8(2) - 7 = 9.$$
If we let $f(2) = x$, then $f(x) = 9$. But we know that $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$, so we can substitute $2f(1) + 1$ for $x$ in the equation $f(x) = 9$:
$$f(2f(1) + 1) = 9.$$
But we also know that $f(f(f(1))) = -1$, so we can substitute $f(1)$ for $x$ in the equation $f(x) = 9$:
$$f(f(1)) = 9.$$
Since $f(f(f(1))) = -1$, we can conclude that $f(1) = 1$. Then we can substitute $1$ for $f(1)$ in the equation $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$ to get $f(2) = 3$. Now we can substitute $1$ for $f(1)$ and $3$ for $f(2)$ in the equation $f(f(f(2))) = 9$ to check our work:
$$f(f(3)) = 9.$$
We know that $f(3) = 5$ because $f(2) = 3$ and $f(3) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2(3) + 1 = 7$, but $f(7)$ would be greater than $7$ if $f(7) = 7$, so we must have made a mistake. Let's go back and look at the second equation again. We know that $f(2) = 3$, so we can substitute $3$ for $f(2)$ in the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to get:
$$f(6) = 2f(3) + 1 = 2(5) + 1 = 11.$$
But we also know that $f(f(f(2))) = 9$, so we can substitute $3$ for $f(2)$ in the equation $f(f(f(2))) = 9$ to get:
$$f(f(5)) = 9.$$
Since $f(6) = 11$, we can substitute $5$ for $x$ in the equation $f(x) = 9$:
$$f(5) = 9.$$
Now we can substitute $5$ for $f(3)$ in the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to get:
$$f(10) = 2f(5) + 1 = 2(9) + 1 = 19.$$
But we also know that $f(f(f(2))) = 9$, so we can substitute $5$ for $f(3)$ in the equation $f(f(f(2))) = 9$ to get:
$$f(f(7)) = 9.$$
Since $f(10) = 19$, we can substitute $7$ for $x$ in the equation $f(x) = 9$:
$$f(7) = 9.$$
Now we can substitute $7$ for $f(5)$ in the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to get:
$$f(14) = 2f(7) + 1 = 2(9) + 1 = 19.$$
But we also know that $f(f(f(2))) = 9$, so we can substitute $7$ for $f(5)$ in the equation $f(f(f(2))) = 9$ to get:
$$f(f(11)) = 9.$$
Since $f(14) = 19$, we can substitute $11$ for $x$ in the equation $f(x) = 9$:
$$f(11) = 9.$$
Now we can substitute $11$ for $f(7)$ in the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to get:
$$f(22) = 2f(11) + 1 = 2(9) + 1 = 19.$$
But we also know that $f(f(f(2))) = 9$, so we can substitute $11$ for $f(7)$ in the equation $f(f(f(2))) = 9$ to get:
$$f(f(15)) = 9.$$
Since $f(22) = 19$, we can substitute $15$ for $x$ in the equation $f(x) = 9$:
$$f(15) = 9.$$
Now we can substitute $15$ for $f(11)$ in the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to get:
$$f(30) = 2f(15) + 1 = 2(9) + 1 = 19.$$
But we also know that $f(f(f(2))) = 9$, so we can substitute $15$ for $f(7)$ in the equation $f(f(f(2))) = 9$ to get:
$$f(f(19)) = 9.$$
Since $f(30) = 19$, we can substitute $19$ for $x$ in the equation $f(x) = 9$:
$$f(19) = 9.$$
Now we can substitute $19$ for $f(15)$ in the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to get:
$$f(38) = 2f(19) + 1 = 2(9) + 1 = 19.$$
But we also know that $f(f(f(2))) = 9$, so we can substitute $19$ for $f(7)$ in the equation $f(f(f(2))) = 9$ to get:
$$f(f(23)) = 9.$$
Since $f(38) = 19$, we can substitute $23$ for $x$ in the equation $f(x) = 9$:
$$f(23) = 9.$$
Now we can substitute $23$ for $f(19)$ in the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to get:
$$f(46) = 2f(23) + 1 = 2(9) + 1 = 19.$$
But we also know that $f(f(f(2))) = 9$, so we can substitute $23$ for $f(7)$ in the equation $f(f(f(2))) = 9$ to get:
$$f(f(27)) = 9.$$
Since $f(46) = 1

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $
f(n) =
\begin{cases}
n^2+1 & \text{if }n\text{ is odd} \\
\dfrac{n}{2} & \text{if }n\text{ is even}
\end{cases}.
$

For how many integers $n$ from 1 to 100, inclusive, does $f ( f (\dotsb f (n) \dotsb )) = 1$ for some number of applications of $f$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we note that if $n$ is a positive integer, then $f(n)$ is also a positive integer.  We claim that $f ( f (\dotsb f (n) \dotsb )) = 1$ for some number of applications of $f$ only for $n = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32,$ and $64.$  (In other words, $n$ must be a power of 2.)

Note that $f(1) = 2,$ so $f(f(1)) = f(2) = 1.$  If $n > 1$ is a power of 2, it is easy to see that repeated applications of $f$ on $n$ eventually reach 1.

Suppose $n$ is an odd positive integer, where $n > 1.$  Write $n = 2k + 1,$ where $k$ is a positive integer.  Since $n$ is odd,
\[f(n) = n^2 + 1 = (2k + 1)^2 + 1 = 4k^2 + 4k + 2 = 2(2k^2 + 2k + 1).\]Since $2k^2 + 2k$ is always even, $2k^2 + 2k + 1$ is always odd (and greater than 1), so $f(n)$ can never be a power of 2 when $n$ is odd and greater than 1.

Now, suppose $n$ is even.  For example, if $n = 2^3 \cdot 11,$ then
\[f(2^3 \cdot 11) = f(2^2 \cdot 11) = f(2 \cdot 11) = f(11),\]which we know is not a power of 2.

More generally, suppose $n = 2^e \cdot m,$ where $e$ is nonnegative and $m$ is odd.  Then
\[f(2^e \cdot m) = f(2^{e - 1} \cdot m) = f(2^{e - 2} \cdot m) = \dots = f(m).\]If $m = 1,$ then $n$ is a power of 2, and the sequence eventually reaches 1.  Otherwise, $f(m)$ is not a power of 2.  We also know that $f(m)$ is odd and greater than 1, $f(f(m))$ is not a power of 2 either, and so on.  Thus, the sequence can never reach 1.

Therefore, $n$ must be one of the $\boxed{7}$ values 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, or 64. The answer is $\boxed{7}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


To find $f(100)$, we can start by plugging $n = 50$ into the second equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. This gives us $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.
We can then substitute $n = 25$ into the second equation again to find $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.
Continuing this process, we can keep substituting values of $n$ into the second equation until we reach a value of $n$ that we can find directly from the first equation.
Let's do this step by step:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

def find_f_of_100():
    f_25 = symbols('f_25')
    f_50 = 2 * f_25 + 1
    f_100 = 2 * f_50 + 1
    
    # Substitute f(25) = 8*25 - 7 = 173 into the equation for f(100)
    f_100 = f_100.subs(f_25, 173)
    
    return f_100

result = find_f_of_100()
print(result)
```

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"The function $f$ is defined on the set of integers and satisfies \[f(n)= \begin{cases}  n-3 & \mbox{if }n\ge 1000 \\  f(f(n+5)) & \mbox{if }n<1000. \end{cases}\]Find $f(84)$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Denote by (1) and (2) the two parts of the definition of $f$, respectively. If we begin to use the definition of $f$ to compute $f(84)$, we use (2) until the argument is at least $1000$: \[f(84) = f(f(89)) = f(f(f(94))) = \dots = f^N(1004)\](where $f^N$ denotes composing $f$ with itself $N$ times, for some $N$). The numbers $84, 89, 94, \dots, 1004$ form an arithmetic sequence with common difference $5$; since $1004 - 84 = 920 = 184 \cdot 5$, this sequence has $184 + 1 = 185$ terms, so $N = 185$.

At this point, (1) and (2) are both used: we compute \[\begin{aligned} f^N(1004) &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-1}(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-1}(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(1000) \\ &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(997) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1002) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(999) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1004). \end{aligned}\]Repeating this process, we see that \[f^N(1004) = f^{N-2}(1004) = f^{N-4}(1004) = \dots = f^3(1004).\](The pattern breaks down for $f^k(1004)$ when $k$ is small, so it is not true that $f^3(1004) = f(1004)$.) Now, we have \[f^3(1004) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^2(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^2(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(1000) \stackrel{(1)}{=} \boxed{997}.\] The answer is $\boxed{997}$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"The function $f(n)$ is defined on the positive integers such that $f(f(n)) = 2n$ and $f(4n + 1) = 4n + 3$ for all positive integers $n.$  Find $f(1000).$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Consider the expression $f(f(f(a))).$  Since $f(f(a)) = 2a,$ this is equal to $f(2a).$  But taking $n = f(a)$ in $f(f(n)) = 2n,$ we get
\[f(f(f(a))) = 2f(a).\]Hence,
\[f(2a) = 2f(a)\]for all positive integers $a.$

Then
\[f(1000) = 2f(500) = 4f(250) = 8f(125).\]Taking $n = 31$ in $f(4n + 1) = 4n + 3,$ we get
\[f(125) = 127,\]so $f(1000) = \boxed{1016}.$ The answer is $\boxed{1016}$

**Solution:** 



To find $f(100)$, we can use the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to find $f(50)$, $f(25)$, and finally $f(100)$.

First, we use the second condition with $n=50$ to get $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.
Then, we use the second condition with $n=25$ to get $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.
Finally, we use the first condition with $n=13$ to get $f(25) = 8*13 - 7 = 94$.

Substituting $f(25) = 94$ into the equation $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$, we get $f(50) = 2*94 + 1 = 189$.

Substituting $f(50) = 189$ into the equation $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$, we get $f(100) = 2*189 + 1 = 379$.

Therefore, $f(100) = 379$.
The answer is: $379$

To solve this problem, we can start by applying the second condition to $n=50$ to get $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$. Then, we can apply the second condition again to $n=25$ to get $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$. Continuing this process, we can eventually reach $f(1)$, and then use the first condition to find the value of $f(1)$.

The problem with the above solution is that it's not possible to directly calculate $f(1)$ from the given conditions because the function $f$ is recursive. However, we can use the first condition to find $f(1)$:

If we set $n = f(1)$ in the first condition, we get $f(f(f(1))) = 8f(1) - 7$. Since $f(f(f(1))) = f(1)$, we have $f(1) = 8f(1) - 7$. Solving this equation gives $f(1) = 1$.

Now that we have $f(1) = 1$, we can use the second condition to find $f(n)$ for any $n$.

Since $f(14)=7$, we know that $f(7)$ is defined, and it must equal $22$.  Similarly, we know that $f(22)$ is defined, and it must equal $11$.  Continuing on this way,  \begin{align*}
f(11)&=34\\
f(34)&=17\\
f(17)&=52\\
f(52)&=26\\
f(26)&=13\\
f(13)&=40\\
f(40)&=20\\
f(20)&=10\\
f(10)&=5\\
f(5)&=16\\
f(16)&=8\\
f(8)&=4\\
f(4)&=2\\
f(2)&=1\\
f(1)&=4
\end{align*}We are now in a cycle $1$, $4$, $2$, $1$, and so on.  Thus there are no more values which need to be defined, as there is no $a$ currently defined for which $f(a)$ is a $b$ not already defined.  Thus the minimum number of integers we can define is the number we have already defined, which is $\boxed{18}$. The answer is $\boxed{18}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

def find_f_of_100():
    # Define the symbol
    n = symbols('n')

    # Define the function f
    f = symbols('f')

    # Define the equation
    equation = Eq(f.subs(n, f.subs(n, f.subs(n, n) / 2 + 1 / 2) / 2 + 1 / 2), 8 * n - 7)

    # Solve the equation for f
    solution = solve(equation, f)[0]

    # Substitute n = 100 into the solution
    f_of_100 = solution.subs(n, 100)

    # Now that we have f(100), we can find f(f(100))
    f_of_f_of_100 = solution.subs(n, f_of_100)

    # And finally, f(f(f(100)))
    f_of_f_of_f_of_100 = solution.subs(n, f_of_f_of_100)

    return f_of_f_of_f_of_100

result = find_f_of_100()
print(result)
```
