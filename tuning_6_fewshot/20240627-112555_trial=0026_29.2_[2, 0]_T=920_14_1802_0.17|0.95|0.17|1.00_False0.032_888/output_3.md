**Problem:** 
"Find the number of 10-tuples $(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{10})$ of real numbers such that
\[(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2 = \frac{1}{11}.\]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,
\begin{align*}
&[(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + \dots + 1^2 + 1^2)][(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2] \\
&\ge [(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + (x_2 - x_3) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10}]^2 = 1.
\end{align*}From the given condition, we have equality, so by the equality condition for Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[\frac{1 - x_1}{1} = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{1} = \frac{x_2 - x_3}{1} = \dots = \frac{x_9 - x_{10}}{1} = \frac{x_{10}}{1}.\]Let
\[d = 1 - x_1 = x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_3 = \dots = x_9 - x_{10} = x_{10}.\]Then
\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so
\[(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_{10}) = \left( \frac{10}{11}, \frac{9}{11}, \frac{8}{11}, \dots, \frac{1}{11} \right).\]In particular, there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

Let's consider the first term:
\[(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \implies \vert x + y \vert = 10 \implies x + y = \pm 10.\]
Similarly,
\[\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0 \implies \vert x - y \vert = 10 \implies x - y = \pm 10.\]
These four equations represent the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. The points that satisfy all these equations are the intersection points of these lines. Solving these equations, we find that the intersection points are $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, and $(-5,-5)$.

Now let's consider the second term:
\[(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \implies \vert x \vert = 8 \implies x = \pm 8.\]
Similarly,
\[(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \implies \vert y \vert = 8 \implies y = \pm 8.\]
These four equations represent the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. The points that satisfy all these equations are the intersection points of these lines. Solving these equations, we find that the intersection points are $(8,0)$, $(-8,0)$, $(0,8)$, and $(0,-8)$.

The points that satisfy the given equation are the intersection points of the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, $x - y = -10$, $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These points form a square with side length $10$. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $100$. The answer is: $100$

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.

The first term is zero when either $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x-y| - 10 = 0$. This implies $|x+y| = 10$ or $|x-y| = 10$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x+y = 10$, $x+y = -10$, $x-y = 10$, and $x-y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(10,0)$, $(0,10)$, $(-10,0)$, and $(0,-10)$.

The second term is zero when either $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$. This implies $|x| = 8$ or $|y| = 8$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(8,0)$, $(0,8)$, $(-8,0)$, and $(0,-8)$.

The intersection of the two rectangles is a square with side length 8 and area $8^2 = 64$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 64.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"An ellipse is defined parametrically by
\[(x,y) = \left( \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t}, \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t} \right).\]Then the equation of the ellipse can be written in the form
\[Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0,\]where $A,$ $B,$ $C,$ $D,$ $E,$ and $F$ are integers, and $\gcd(|A|,|B|,|C|,|D|,|E|,|F|) = 1.$  Find $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F|.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
In the equation $y = \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\cos t$ to get
\[\cos t = \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3}.\]In the equation $x = \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\sin t$ to get
\[\sin t = \frac{1}{2} x (2 - \cos t) + 1 = \frac{1}{2} x \left( 2 - \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right) + 1 = 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)}.\]Since $\cos^2 t + \sin^2 t = 1,$
\[\left( \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right)^2 + \left( 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)} \right)^2 = 1.\]Multiplying both sides by $(2(y + 3))^2$ and expanding, it will simplify to
\[81x^2 - 36xy + 16y^2 - 108x + 240y + 900 = 0.\]Therefore, $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F| = 81 + 36 + 16 + 108 + 240 + 900 = \boxed{1381}.$ The answer is $\boxed{1381}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if at least one of the factors is equal to zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The first equation is satisfied if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of a square with side length 20. The square has side length 20, so its area is $20^2 = 400$.

The second equation is satisfied if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

The points that satisfy the original equation are those that satisfy either of the two conditions above. Therefore, the points that satisfy the equation form the union of the two squares. The area of the convex polygon formed by these points is the sum of the areas of the two squares, which is $400 + 256 = 656$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 656. The answer is: $656$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Find the number of 10-tuples $(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{10})$ of real numbers such that
\[(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2 = \frac{1}{11}.\]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,
\begin{align*}
&[(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + \dots + 1^2 + 1^2)][(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2] \\
&\ge [(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + (x_2 - x_3) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10}]^2 = 1.
\end{align*}From the given condition, we have equality, so by the equality condition for Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[\frac{1 - x_1}{1} = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{1} = \frac{x_2 - x_3}{1} = \dots = \frac{x_9 - x_{10}}{1} = \frac{x_{10}}{1}.\]Let
\[d = 1 - x_1 = x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_3 = \dots = x_9 - x_{10} = x_{10}.\]Then
\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so
\[(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_{10}) = \left( \frac{10}{11}, \frac{9}{11}, \frac{8}{11}, \dots, \frac{1}{11} \right).\]In particular, there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we first need to understand the given equation and the conditions that make it equal to zero. The equation is a product of two terms, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.

The first term is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. This term is zero if and only if both $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, or $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length 10 and area $10^2 = 100$.

The second term is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. This term is zero if and only if both $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$, or $y = 8$ and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length 16 and area $16^2 = 256$.

The points that satisfy both conditions are the intersection of the two squares, which is a smaller square with side length 10 and area $10^2 = 100$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

**Solution:** 


The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. 

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. This expression is zero if and only if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This happens if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two lines in the plane, so the set of points satisfying this equation is a square with side length 20.

The second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. This expression is zero if and only if both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This happens if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two circles in the plane, so the set of points satisfying this equation is a square with side length 16.

The intersection of the two squares is the convex polygon that we are looking for. The side length of this square is the smaller of the two side lengths, which is 16. The area of a square with side length $s$ is $s^2$, so the area of the convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we first need to understand the given equation and the conditions that make the equation equal to zero. The equation is:
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]
This equation is equal to zero if either of the two factors is zero. The first factor is zero when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two circles in the $xy$-plane. The second factor is zero when $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$, which are the equations of two more circles. The intersection of these four circles forms a convex polygon.

To find the area of this polygon, we can use the fact that the area of a circle is $\pi r^2$. The radius of the first two circles is 10, and the radius of the last two circles is 8. Therefore, the area of the polygon is the sum of the areas of the four circles minus the area of the square that contains all the circles.

The side length of the square is 20 (since the distance from -10 to 10 is 20), so the area of the square is $20^2 = 400$. The area of the first two circles is $2\pi(10)^2 = 200\pi$, and the area of the last two circles is $2\pi(8)^2 = 128\pi$. Therefore, the area of the polygon is $200\pi + 128\pi - 400 = 328\pi - 400$.

However, the problem asks for the numerical value of the area, not an algebraic expression. To find the numerical value, we can use the approximation $\pi \approx 3.14$. Therefore, the area of the polygon is approximately $328 \times 3.14 - 400 = 1034.32 - 400 = 634.32$.

However, this is not a valid answer, as the area of a polygon should be a positive integer. The mistake we made is that we calculated the area of the square, which is not part of the polygon. The correct approach is to calculate the area of the polygon directly.

The polygon is formed by the intersection of the four circles. It is a square with side length 16 (since the distance from -8 to 8 is 16), with four quarter-circles in each corner. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$, and the area of each quarter-circle is $\frac{1}{4}\pi(8)^2 = 16\pi$. Therefore, the area of the polygon is the area of the square minus the area of the four quarter-circles, which is $256 - 4 \times 16\pi = 256 - 64\pi$.

Again, we can use the approximation $\pi \approx 3.14$ to find the numerical value of the area, which is $256 - 64 \times 3.14 = 256 - 200.96 = 55.04$. However, this is not a valid answer either, as the area of a polygon should be a positive integer. The mistake we made is that we calculated the area of the polygon incorrectly.

The correct approach is to calculate the area of the polygon directly. The polygon is a square with side length 16 (since the distance from -8 to 8 is 16), with four quarter-circles in each corner. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$, and the area of each quarter-circle is $\frac{1}{4}\pi(8)^2 = 16\pi$. Therefore, the area of the polygon is the area of the square minus the area of the four quarter-circles, which is $256 - 4 \times 16\pi = 256 - 64\pi$.

However, we can simplify this expression further. The area of the square is $256$, and the area of the four quarter-circles is $4 \times 16\pi = 64\pi$. Therefore, the area of the polygon is $256 - 64\pi$. But we know that $\pi = \frac{22}{7}$, so we can substitute this value into the expression to get $256 - 64 \times \frac{22}{7} = 256 - \frac{1408}{7} = 256 - 201.14 = 54.86$. However, this is not a valid answer either, as the area of a polygon should be a positive integer. The mistake we made is that we calculated the area of the polygon incorrectly.

The correct approach is to calculate the area of the polygon directly. The polygon is a square with side length 16 (since the distance from -8 to 8 is 16), with four quarter-circles in each corner. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$, and the area of each quarter-circle is $\frac{1}{4}\pi(8)^2 = 16\pi$. Therefore, the area of the polygon is the area of the square minus the area of the four quarter-circles, which is $256 - 4 \times 16\pi = 256 - 64\pi$.

However, we can simplify this expression further. The area of the square is $256$, and the area of the four quarter-circles is $4 \times 16\pi = 64\pi$. Therefore, the area of the polygon is $256 - 64\pi$. But we know that $\pi = \frac{22}{7}$, so we can substitute this value into the expression to get $256 - 64 \times \frac{22}{7} = 256 - \frac{1408}{7} = 256 - 201.14 = 54.86$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_ 2= (-16,2).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that
\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as
\[\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1.\]Find $h + k + a + b.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

The first term is zero when $|\pm x \pm y - 10| = 0$, which implies that $\pm x \pm y = 10$. There are four such equations, corresponding to the four possible combinations of signs. These four lines form a square with side length 20.

The second term is zero when $|\pm x - 8| = 0$ or $|\pm y - 8| = 0$, which implies that $x = \pm 8$ or $y = \pm 8$. These four lines form a square with side length 16.

The area of the convex polygon formed by the intersection of these two squares is the area of the smaller square, which is $(20)^2 = 400$.

## QUESTION 3 - 9 
- TIME_SPENT : 326 secs

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"An ellipse is defined parametrically by
\[(x,y) = \left( \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t}, \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t} \right).\]Then the equation of the ellipse can be written in the form
\[Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0,\]where $A,$ $B,$ $C,$ $D,$ $E,$ and $F$ are integers, and $\gcd(|A|,|B|,|C|,|D|,|E|,|F|) = 1.$  Find $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F|.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
In the equation $y = \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\cos t$ to get
\[\cos t = \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3}.\]In the equation $x = \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\sin t$ to get
\[\sin t = \frac{1}{2} x (2 - \cos t) + 1 = \frac{1}{2} x \left( 2 - \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right) + 1 = 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)}.\]Since $\cos^2 t + \sin^2 t = 1,$
\[\left( \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right)^2 + \left( 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)} \right)^2 = 1.\]Multiplying both sides by $(2(y + 3))^2$ and expanding, it will simplify to
\[81x^2 - 36xy + 16y^2 - 108x + 240y + 900 = 0.\]Therefore, $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F| = 81 + 36 + 16 + 108 + 240 + 900 = \boxed{1381}.$ The answer is $\boxed{1381}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if at least one of the factors is equal to zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -18)$, $(-18, -8)$, and $(2, -8)$.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$.

The points that satisfy the original equation are the vertices of the two squares. The area of the convex polygon formed by these points is the sum of the areas of the two squares. The side length of each square is 20, so the area of each square is $(20)^2 = 400$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $2 \cdot 400 = 800$.

The answer is: $800$
