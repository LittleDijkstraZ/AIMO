**Problem:** 
"Let $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_ 2= (-16,2).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that
\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as
\[\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1.\]Find $h + k + a + b.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. 

The first expression is zero when either $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x-y| - 10 = 0$. This implies that either $|x+y| = 10$ or $|x-y| = 10$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x+y = 10$, $x+y = -10$, $x-y = 10$, and $x-y = -10$.

The second expression is zero when either $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$. This implies that either $|x| = 8$ or $|y| = 8$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The expression $A = ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ equals to zero if and only if at least one of the factors equals to zero.

2. The factor $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$ equals to zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This is equivalent to the system of equations $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$. Solving these systems gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, and $(-5,-5)$.

3. The factor $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ equals to zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This is equivalent to the system of equations $x = 8$ and $y = 8$ or $x = -8$ and $y = -8$. Solving these systems gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(8,8)$, $(-8,8)$, $(-8,-8)$, and $(8,-8)$.

4. The vertices of the polygon are the points $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, $(-5,-5)$, $(8,8)$, $(-8,8)$, $(-8,-8)$, and $(8,-8)$.

5. To find the area of the polygon, we can use the Shoelace formula. The Shoelace formula states that if the polygon vertices are $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$, ..., $(x_n, y_n)$, then the area of the polygon is given by $\frac{1}{2} |(x_1y_2 + x_2y_3 + ... + x_ny_1) - (y_1x_2 + y_2x_3 + ... + y_nx_1)|$.

6. Applying the Shoelace formula to the vertices of the polygon, we get the area as $\frac{1}{2} |(5*5 + 5*-5 + -5*5 + -5*-5 + 8*8 + -8*8 + -8*-8 + 8*-8) - (5*5 + -5*5 + 5*-5 + -5*-5 + 8*8 + -8*8 + -8*-8 + 8*-8)| = 0$.

7. However, this result is incorrect because the Shoelace formula gives the area of a polygon with the given vertices, not the area of the convex polygon enclosed by those vertices. The Shoelace formula gives the area of a polygon with vertices in the order listed, and the vertices we have are not in a specific order.

8. To find the correct area of the convex polygon, we can simply note that the points $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, $(-5,-5)$, $(8,8)$, $(-8,8)$, $(-8,-8)$, and $(8,-8)$ form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 100.

The answer is: $100$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Find the number of 10-tuples $(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{10})$ of real numbers such that
\[(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2 = \frac{1}{11}.\]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,
\begin{align*}
&[(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + \dots + 1^2 + 1^2)][(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2] \\
&\ge [(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + (x_2 - x_3) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10}]^2 = 1.
\end{align*}From the given condition, we have equality, so by the equality condition for Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[\frac{1 - x_1}{1} = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{1} = \frac{x_2 - x_3}{1} = \dots = \frac{x_9 - x_{10}}{1} = \frac{x_{10}}{1}.\]Let
\[d = 1 - x_1 = x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_3 = \dots = x_9 - x_{10} = x_{10}.\]Then
\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so
\[(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_{10}) = \left( \frac{10}{11}, \frac{9}{11}, \frac{8}{11}, \dots, \frac{1}{11} \right).\]In particular, there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

```
The sympy-based approach to solve the problem is not feasible due to the complexity of the equation and the limitations of the sympy library in solving piecewise functions. However, we can solve this problem using a different approach.

The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if either of the two factors is zero. 

The factor $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These conditions define a square with side length 20 centered at the origin.

The factor $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These conditions define a square with side length 16 centered at the origin.

The intersection of these two squares is a square with side length 8 centered at the origin. The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 64. The answer is $\boxed{64}$.

**Solution:** 


The first step to solve this problem is to understand the given equation. The equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, which means that either of the terms must be zero. 

The terms $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ can only be zero if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

Similarly, the terms $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2$ can only be zero if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersection of these lines forms a rectangle with side lengths of 20 and 16. The area of this rectangle is $20 \times 16 = 320$. So, the area of the convex polygon is 320.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    # Calculate the side lengths of the rectangle

    return area

The area of the convex polygon is 320. The answer is: $320$

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if at least one of the factors is zero. This happens if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$. These conditions describe four lines in the plane: the lines $x + y = \pm 10$, $x - y = \pm 10$, and $x = \pm 8$, $y = \pm 8$. The intersection of these lines form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Find the number of 10-tuples $(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{10})$ of real numbers such that
\[(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2 = \frac{1}{11}.\]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,
\begin{align*}
&[(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + \dots + 1^2 + 1^2)][(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2] \\
&\ge [(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + (x_2 - x_3) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10}]^2 = 1.
\end{align*}From the given condition, we have equality, so by the equality condition for Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[\frac{1 - x_1}{1} = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{1} = \frac{x_2 - x_3}{1} = \dots = \frac{x_9 - x_{10}}{1} = \frac{x_{10}}{1}.\]Let
\[d = 1 - x_1 = x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_3 = \dots = x_9 - x_{10} = x_{10}.\]Then
\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so
\[(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_{10}) = \left( \frac{10}{11}, \frac{9}{11}, \frac{8}{11}, \dots, \frac{1}{11} \right).\]In particular, there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The given equation is a product of two terms, which equals to zero. This means that either the first term equals to zero or the second term equals to zero. 

Let's consider the two cases separately:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$: This equation is only satisfied when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This represents a square with side length 20, centered at the origin.

2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$: This equation is only satisfied when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This represents a square with side length 16, centered at the origin.

The intersection of these two squares is a smaller square with side length 16 and centered at the origin. The area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points satisfying the given equation is the area of the larger square minus the area of the smaller square.

    side_length_small_square = 16

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


The problem asks for the area of the convex polygon formed by the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

The equation equals to zero if either of the two factors equals to zero. This gives us two sets of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first set of equations, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$. And $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x \vert = \vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. The solutions to this set of equations are the points on the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$, as well as the points $(8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, $(8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$.

For the second set of equations, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = \pm 10$. And $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x \vert = \vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. The solutions to this set of equations are the points on the lines $x - y = 10$, $x - y = -10$, $x + y = 10$, and $x + y = -10$, as well as the points $(8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, $(8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$.

The points that satisfy either set of equations form a square with side length $20$. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.

So the area of the convex polygon is $400$. The answer is: $400$

\end{align*}From the given condition, we have equality, so by the equality condition for Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[\frac{1 - x_1}{1} = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{1} = \frac{x_2 - x_3}{1} = \dots = \frac{x_9 - x_{10}}{1} = \frac{x_{10}}{1}.\]Let
\[d = 1 - x_1 = x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_3 = \dots = x_9 - x_{10} = x_{10}.\]Then
\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so
\[(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_{10}) = \left( \frac{10}{11}, \frac{9}{11}, \frac{8}{11}, \dots, \frac{1}{11} \right).\]In particular, there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we first need to understand the given equation and the conditions that make it equal to zero. The equation is of the form $(A)(B) = 0$, which means that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. So, we have two cases to consider:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first case, we have $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these equations are the points on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$.

For the second case, we have $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are the points on the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$.

The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 10 (from the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$) and vertices at $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, -2)$, and $(-8, 2)$. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is $\boxed{100}$.

## QUESTION 3 - 12

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"An ellipse is defined parametrically by
\[(x,y) = \left( \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t}, \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t} \right).\]Then the equation of the ellipse can be written in the form
\[Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0,\]where $A,$ $B,$ $C,$ $D,$ $E,$ and $F$ are integers, and $\gcd(|A|,|B|,|C|,|D|,|E|,|F|) = 1.$  Find $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F|.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
In the equation $y = \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\cos t$ to get
\[\cos t = \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3}.\]In the equation $x = \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\sin t$ to get
\[\sin t = \frac{1}{2} x (2 - \cos t) + 1 = \frac{1}{2} x \left( 2 - \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right) + 1 = 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)}.\]Since $\cos^2 t + \sin^2 t = 1,$
\[\left( \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right)^2 + \left( 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)} \right)^2 = 1.\]Multiplying both sides by $(2(y + 3))^2$ and expanding, it will simplify to
\[81x^2 - 36xy + 16y^2 - 108x + 240y + 900 = 0.\]Therefore, $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F| = 81 + 36 + 16 + 108 + 240 + 900 = \boxed{1381}.$ The answer is $\boxed{1381}$

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we first need to understand the given equation and the constraints it imposes on the points $(x, y)$. The equation is of the form $f(x, y) \cdot g(x, y) = 0$, which means that either $f(x, y) = 0$ or $g(x, y) = 0$. 

The function $f(x, y)$ is a product of two terms, each of which is of the form $(\vert a \cdot x + b \cdot y \vert - k)^2$. This term is zero when $\vert a \cdot x + b \cdot y \vert = k$, which means that $a \cdot x + b \cdot y = \pm k$ or $a \cdot x + b \cdot y = 0$. 

Similarly, the function $g(x, y)$ is a product of two terms, each of which is of the form $(\vert c \cdot x \vert - d)^2$. This term is zero when $\vert c \cdot x \vert = d$, which means that $c \cdot x = \pm d$ or $c \cdot x = 0$. 

The solutions to these equations are a set of lines and points in the plane. The points where the lines intersect are the vertices of the polygon, and the lines themselves are the sides of the polygon. 

To find the area of the polygon, we can simply count the number of lattice points (points with integer coordinates) inside the polygon and use Pick's theorem. Pick's theorem states that the area of a polygon with vertices on a grid is $A = i + \frac{b}{2} - 1$, where $i$ is the number of interior lattice points and $b$ is the number of boundary lattice points (vertices of the polygon).

First, we need to find the vertices of the polygon. We can do this by solving the equations $f(x, y) = 0$ and $g(x, y) = 0$. The vertices will be the points where these lines intersect.

Next, we can count the number of interior lattice points and boundary lattice points. We can do this by simply iterating through all the lattice points in a bounding box around the polygon and checking if they are inside the polygon.

Finally, we can apply Pick's theorem to find the area of the polygon.

Here is a Python script that solves the problem:

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many square units are in the area of the triangle whose vertices are the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the curve $y = (x-3)^2 (x+2)$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we need to find where this curve intersects the $x$ and $y$ axes.  If $y=0$, then $(x-3)^2(x+2)=0$, which has solutions of $x=3$ and $x=-2$.  If $x=0$, then $y=(-3)^2(2)=18$.  So, the curve has two $x$-intercepts and one $y$-intercept.  The length of the base along the $x$-axis is $3-(-2)=5$.  The height from this base is equal to the $y$-intercept, 18.  The area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 5\cdot 18=\boxed{45}$. The answer is $\boxed{45}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


The problem involves finding the area of a polygon that is enclosed by the points that satisfy a specific condition. The condition is given by the equation:

$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$

This equation is equal to zero if either of the two factors is equal to zero. Let's analyze each factor separately:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10 \Rightarrow x + y = \pm 10$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x - y \vert = 10 \Rightarrow x - y = \pm 10$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8 \Rightarrow x = \pm 8$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert y \vert = 8 \Rightarrow y = \pm 8$.

From these conditions, we can deduce the following:

1. The points that satisfy $x + y = \pm 10$ form two lines with slopes $-1$ and $1$.
2. The points that satisfy $x - y = \pm 10$ form two lines with slopes $1$ and $-1$.
3. The points that satisfy $x = \pm 8$ form two vertical lines.
4. The points that satisfy $y = \pm 8$ form two horizontal lines.

The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length $16$. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$
