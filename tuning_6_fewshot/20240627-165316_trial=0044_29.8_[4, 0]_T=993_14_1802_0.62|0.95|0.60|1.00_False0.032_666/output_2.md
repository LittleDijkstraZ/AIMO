**Problem:** 
"For certain ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ of real numbers, the system of equations
\[\begin{aligned} ax+by&=1 \\ x^2 + y^2 &= 50  \end{aligned}\]has at least one solution, and each solution is an ordered pair $(x,y)\,$ of integers. How many such ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ are there?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The graph of $ax+by=1$ is a line, while the graph of $x^2+y^2=50$ is a circle centered at the origin. Therefore, $(a, b)$ satisfies the conditions if and only if the line and circle intersect at least once, and they intersect only at lattice points (points with integer coordinates).

Knowing this, it makes sense to look for lattice points on the circle whose equation is $x^2+y^2=50$. Testing cases, we find that there are twelve lattice points on the circle: $(\pm 1, \pm 7)$, $(\pm 7, \pm 1)$, and $(\pm 5, \pm 5)$ (where the two $\pm$ signs in each pair are independent of each other).

There are $\tbinom{12}{2} = 66$ pairs of these points, and each pair determines a line. However, the graph of $ax+by=1$ can never pass through the origin $(0, 0)$, since if $x=y=0$, then $ax+by=0 \neq 1$. Therefore, the six pairs which consist of diametrically opposed points are invalid, since the line through them passes through the origin. This corrects our count to $66 - 6 = 60$.

In addition, for each of the twelve points, there is a line tangent to the circle at that point, so that the only solution to the system is that one point. This brings the final total to $60 + 12 = \boxed{72}$. The answer is $\boxed{72}$

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


We know that the equation $| |x-1| -2 |=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. 

The expression $|x-1| -2$ can take on three values: $\frac{m}{100}$, $0$, and $-\frac{m}{100}$. 

If $| |x-1| -2 |=\frac{m}{100}$, then $|x-1| -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ or $|x-1| -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$. 

If $| |x-1| -2 | = 0$, then $|x-1| -2 = 0$, which gives $|x-1| = 2$, and $x-1 = 2$ or $x-1 = -2$.

If $| |x-1| -2 | = -\frac{m}{100}$, then there is no solution because the absolute value of a number cannot be negative.

So we have the following cases:

1. If $|x-1| -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, then $|x-1| = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, and $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 = -2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
2. If $|x-1| -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$, then $|x-1| = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, and $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 = -2 + \frac{m}{100}$.

We need to find the values of $m$ for which these four equations have 4 distinct solutions. 

After solving these equations, we find that $m = 100$ is the only value that gives 4 distinct solutions. 

So the number of positive integers $m$ is 1. The answer is: $\boxed{1}$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let \[f(x) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
-x + 3 & \text{if } x \le 0, \\
2x - 5 & \text{if } x > 0.
\end{array}
\right.\]How many solutions does the equation $f(f(x)) = 4$ have?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
To solve the equation $f(f(x)) = 4,$ we first find the values $x$ such that $f(x) = 4.$

Either $f(x) = -x + 3$ (for $x \le 0$) or $f(x) = 2x - 5$ (for $x > 0$). If $-x + 3 = 4,$ then $x = -1.$ Note that this value satisfies $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = 4,$ then $x = 9/2.$ Note that this value satisfies $x > 0.$ Therefore, the solutions to $f(x) = 4$ are $x = -1$ and $x = 9/2.$

Next, we solve for the values $x$ such that $f(x) = -1.$ If $-x + 3 = -1,$ then $x = 4.$ This value does not satisfy $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = -1,$ then $x = 2.$ This value satisfies $x > 0.$

Finally, we solve for the values $x$ such that $f(x) = 9/2.$ If $-x + 3 = 9/2,$ then $x = -3/2.$ This value satisfies $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = 9/2,$ then $x = 19/4.$ This value satisfies $x > 0.$

Therefore, the equation $f(f(x)) = 4$ has the solutions $x = 2,$ $-3/2,$ and $19/4,$ for a total of $\boxed{3}$ solutions. The answer is $\boxed{3}$

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"

**Solution:** 



To solve the problem, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

This equation involves absolute values, which can make it a bit tricky to solve. However, we can simplify the problem by considering the cases for the number of solutions separately.

First, let's rewrite the equation as $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. The right-hand side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, is a positive number. The number of solutions of the equation will depend on the value of $\frac{m}{100}$.

If $\frac{m}{100} < 2$, then the equation has no solutions, because the absolute value of a number is always non-negative, and the left-hand side of the equation will always be greater than or equal to $2$.

If $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, then the equation has two solutions, because the absolute value of a number is equal to a positive number if and only if the number is equal to that number or its negation. So, $\vert x - 1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100} = 4$ and $\vert x - 1 \vert = -2 + \frac{m}{100} = 0$. The latter equation has no solution, but the former equation has two solutions.

If $\frac{m}{100} > 2$, then the equation has four distinct solutions. This is because the absolute value of a number is equal to a positive number if and only if the number is equal to that number or its negation. So, $\vert x - 1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, $\vert x - 1 \vert = -2 + \frac{m}{100}$, $\vert x - 1 \vert = -(2 + \frac{m}{100})$, and $\vert x - 1 \vert = -(-2 + \frac{m}{100})$. The first and third equations have two solutions each, and the second and fourth equations have no solutions. So, the total number of solutions is four.

Therefore, for the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ to have $4$ distinct solutions, we need $\frac{m}{100} > 2$. This means $m > 200$. The smallest integer greater than $200$ is $201$. So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $1$.

The answer is: $1$

**Problem:** 
"How many solutions does the equation \[\frac{(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)\dotsm(x-100)}{(x-1^2)(x-2^2)(x-3^2)\dotsm(x-100^2)} = 0\]have for $x$?"

The numerator is zero when $x$ is one of the numbers $1, 2, 3, \dots, 100.$ However, for any value in this list that is a perfect square, the denominator will also be zero, so that value of $x$ will not be a root. Therefore, we want to find the number of integers in the list $1, 2, \dots, 100$ which are not perfect squares. The perfect squares in the list are $1^2, 2^2, \dots, 10^2,$ so there are $10$ perfect squares, and \[100 - 10 = \boxed{90}\]integers which are not perfect squares. The answer is $\boxed{90}$

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"

Assistant:

 The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

The equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ is a piecewise function with four cases to consider:
1. $|x - 1| - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$
2. $-(|x - 1| - 2) = \frac{m}{100}$
3. $-(|x - 1| - 2) = -\frac{m}{100}$
4. $|x - 1| - 2 = -\frac{m}{100}$

Each of these cases gives a range of $m$ values for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions. We need to find the number of these ranges of $m$ that are positive integers.

After analyzing the cases and solving the equations, we find that the only cases that give 4 distinct solutions are the first and the third cases. The first case gives $1 \le m \le 200$ and the third case gives $201 \le m \le 400$.

So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is the number of integers in the interval $[1, 400]$. This is $400 - 1 + 1 = 400$.

However, we are asked to find the number of positive integers $m$, so we only consider the interval $[1, 400]$. The number of positive integers in this interval is $400$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 400.
