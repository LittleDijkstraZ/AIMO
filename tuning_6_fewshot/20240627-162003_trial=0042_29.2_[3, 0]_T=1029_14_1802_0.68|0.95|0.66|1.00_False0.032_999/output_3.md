**Problem:** 
"Find the number of 10-tuples $(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{10})$ of real numbers such that
\[(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2 = \frac{1}{11}.\]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,
\begin{align*}
&[(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + \dots + 1^2 + 1^2)][(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2] \\
&\ge [(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + (x_2 - x_3) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10}]^2 = 1.
\end{align*}From the given condition, we have equality, so by the equality condition for Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[\frac{1 - x_1}{1} = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{1} = \frac{x_2 - x_3}{1} = \dots = \frac{x_9 - x_{10}}{1} = \frac{x_{10}}{1}.\]Let
\[d = 1 - x_1 = x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_3 = \dots = x_9 - x_{10} = x_{10}.\]Then
\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so
\[(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_{10}) = \left( \frac{10}{11}, \frac{9}{11}, \frac{8}{11}, \dots, \frac{1}{11} \right).\]In particular, there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we can break it down into several steps:

1. First, we need to understand the equation and the conditions that make it equal to zero. The equation is a product of two terms, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.
2. Next, we solve each term separately. For the first term, $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x - y| - 10 = 0$. For the second term, $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$.
3. Solving these equations, we find the points that satisfy these conditions.
4. Finally, we plot these points on a coordinate plane and determine the shape of the enclosed region.

Let's now solve each step in detail.

**Step 1: Understand the equation and the conditions that make it equal to zero**

The equation is given by $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. This equation is equal to zero if either the first term $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or the second term $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

**Step 2: Solve each term separately**

For the first term, $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x - y| - 10 = 0$. This implies $|x + y| = 10$ or $|x - y| = 10$. The absolute value equations can be split into two separate equations: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, or $x - y = -10$.

For the second term, $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$. This implies $|x| = 8$ or $|y| = 8$. The absolute value equations can be split into two separate equations: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, or $y = -8$.

**Step 3: Plot the points on a coordinate plane and determine the shape of the enclosed region**

The points that satisfy the conditions from step 2 form a square with side length 20 and another square with side length 16. The intersection of these two squares is another square with side length 8. The enclosed region is the outer square minus the inner square.

The area of the outer square is $20^2 = 400$, and the area of the inner square is $8^2 = 64$. So the area of the enclosed region is $400 - 64 = 336$.

The answer is: $336$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"An ellipse is defined parametrically by
\[(x,y) = \left( \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t}, \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t} \right).\]Then the equation of the ellipse can be written in the form
\[Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0,\]where $A,$ $B,$ $C,$ $D,$ $E,$ and $F$ are integers, and $\gcd(|A|,|B|,|C|,|D|,|E|,|F|) = 1.$  Find $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F|.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
In the equation $y = \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\cos t$ to get
\[\cos t = \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3}.\]In the equation $x = \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\sin t$ to get
\[\sin t = \frac{1}{2} x (2 - \cos t) + 1 = \frac{1}{2} x \left( 2 - \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right) + 1 = 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)}.\]Since $\cos^2 t + \sin^2 t = 1,$
\[\left( \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right)^2 + \left( 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)} \right)^2 = 1.\]Multiplying both sides by $(2(y + 3))^2$ and expanding, it will simplify to
\[81x^2 - 36xy + 16y^2 - 108x + 240y + 900 = 0.\]Therefore, $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F| = 81 + 36 + 16 + 108 + 240 + 900 = \boxed{1381}.$ The answer is $\boxed{1381}$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_ 2= (-16,2).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that
\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as
\[\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1.\]Find $h + k + a + b.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. 

The first expression is zero when either $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x-y| - 10 = 0$. This implies that either $|x+y| = 10$ or $|x-y| = 10$. The absolute value equations $|x+y| = 10$ and $|x-y| = 10$ represent lines in the coordinate plane. The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 20. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.

The second expression is zero when either $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$. This implies that either $|x| = 8$ or $|y| = 8$. The absolute value equations $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$ represent lines in the coordinate plane. The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

Since the two squares overlap, the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points that satisfy the equation is the sum of the areas of the two squares minus the area of the overlapping region. The overlapping region is also a square, but with side length 8 (the intersection of the two squares with side lengths 20 and 16). The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$.

So the area of the convex polygon is $(400 + 256 - 64) = 592$.

def area_of_polygon():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    # Area of the first square
    area_square1 = 20**2

    # Area of the second square
    area_square2 = 16**2

    # Area of the overlapping square
    area_overlap = 8**2

    # Area of the convex polygon
    area_polygon = area_square1 + area_square2 - area_overlap

    return area_polygon

\[\left( \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right)^2 + \left( 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)} \right)^2 = 1.\]Multiplying both sides by $(2(y + 3))^2$ and expanding, it will simplify to

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is true if and only if at least one of the factors is zero.
The factor $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ is true if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$, which gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.
The factor $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ is true if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$, giving us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.
The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

**Solution:** 


The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These two equations are only satisfied when $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four systems of equations, we find that the vertices of the polygon are $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$.
The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These two equations are only satisfied when $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So the vertices of the polygon are also $(8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(8, -8)$.
The polygon formed by these vertices is a square with side length $16$. Therefore, the area of the polygon is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is $\boxed{256}$.
