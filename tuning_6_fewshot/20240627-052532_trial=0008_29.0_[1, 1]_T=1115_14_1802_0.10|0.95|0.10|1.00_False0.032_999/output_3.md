Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, and it equals to zero if and only if both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, and $(-10, 0)$.

The second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$, and it equals to zero if and only if both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The polygon is a square with side length 10, so its area is $10^2 = 100$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 100.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_ 2= (-16,2).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that
\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as
\[\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1.\]Find $h + k + a + b.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. We will consider each case separately.

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
This equation is satisfied if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the square as $(5, 5)$, $(5, -5)$, $(-5, -5)$, and $(-5, 5)$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
This equation is satisfied if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So, we get the vertices of the square as $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$.

The convex polygon formed by the union of these two squares is a $8 \times 10$ rectangle. The area of this rectangle is $8 \times 10 = 80$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $80$. The answer is: $80$

**Solution:** 



The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. 

The first expression is zero when either $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x-y| - 10 = 0$. These equations simplify to $|x+y| = 10$ and $|x-y| = 10$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x+y = 10$, $x+y = -10$, $x-y = 10$, and $x-y = -10$.

The second expression is zero when either $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$. These equations simplify to $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersection points of these lines are the vertices of the polygon. By plotting these lines, we find that the polygon is a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.

The first term is zero when either $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x-y| - 10 = 0$. This implies $|x+y| = 10$ or $|x-y| = 10$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x+y = 10$, $x+y = -10$, $x-y = 10$, and $x-y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(10,0)$, $(0,10)$, $(-10,0)$, and $(0,-10)$.

The second term is zero when either $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$. This implies $|x| = 8$ or $|y| = 8$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(8,0)$, $(0,8)$, $(-8,0)$, and $(0,-8)$.

The intersection of the two rectangles is a square with side length 8 and area $8^2 = 64$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 64.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Find the number of 10-tuples $(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{10})$ of real numbers such that
\[(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2 = \frac{1}{11}.\]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,
\begin{align*}
&[(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + \dots + 1^2 + 1^2)][(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2] \\
&\ge [(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + (x_2 - x_3) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10}]^2 = 1.
\end{align*}From the given condition, we have equality, so by the equality condition for Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[\frac{1 - x_1}{1} = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{1} = \frac{x_2 - x_3}{1} = \dots = \frac{x_9 - x_{10}}{1} = \frac{x_{10}}{1}.\]Let
\[d = 1 - x_1 = x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_3 = \dots = x_9 - x_{10} = x_{10}.\]Then
\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so
\[(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_{10}) = \left( \frac{10}{11}, \frac{9}{11}, \frac{8}{11}, \dots, \frac{1}{11} \right).\]In particular, there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Solution:** 


The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. 

Let's consider the first expression: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This expression is zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$. These lines intersect at the point $(5, 5)$.

Similarly, for the second expression: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, this expression is zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$. These lines intersect at the point $(8, 8)$.

The points that satisfy either of these conditions form a square with vertices at $(5, 5)$, $(5, -5)$, $(-5, -5)$, and $(-5, 5)$. The side length of this square is $10$, so its area is $10^2 = 100$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $100$. The answer is: $100$

**Solution:** 


The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

Let's consider the first term:
\[(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \implies \vert x + y \vert = 10 \implies x + y = \pm 10.\]
Similarly, for the second term:
\[(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \implies \vert x - y \vert = 10 \implies x - y = \pm 10.\]
These four equations represent the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. The intersection points of these lines are $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, and $(0, -10)$.

Now let's consider the second factor:
\[(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \implies \vert x \vert = 8 \implies x = \pm 8.\]
Similarly, for the second term:
\[(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \implies \vert y \vert = 8 \implies y = \pm 8.\]
These four equations represent the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. The intersection points of these lines are $(8, 0)$, $(-8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, and $(0, -8)$.

The intersection of the regions defined by the first and second factors gives us a square with side length $10$ centered at the origin. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So the area of the convex polygon is $100$. The answer is: $100$
