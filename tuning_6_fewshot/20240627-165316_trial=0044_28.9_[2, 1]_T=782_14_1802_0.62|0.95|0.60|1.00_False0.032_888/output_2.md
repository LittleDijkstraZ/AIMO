**Problem:** 
"How many distinct solutions are there to the equation $|x-7| = |x+1|$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
If $|x-7| = |x+1|$, then either $x-7 = x+1$ or $x-7 = -(x+1)$.  Simplifying $x-7=x+1$ gives $0=8$, which has no solutions, so no values of $x$ satisfy $x-7 = x+1$.  If $x-7 = -(x+1)$, then $x-7 = -x-1$, so $2x = 6$, which gives $x=3$.  So, there is $\boxed{1}$ solution.

Challenge: See if you can find a quick solution to this problem by simply thinking about the graphs of $y=|x-7|$ and $y=|x+1|$. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The problem is asking for how many positive integers $m$ the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. 

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can have $4$ distinct solutions only when $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ takes the value $2$ only once, and it is a continuous function. 

So we solve the equation $\frac{m}{100} = 2$ for $m$. Multiplying both sides by $100$ gives $m = 200$. 

So the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $200$. 

Therefore, the answer is $m = 200$. The value of $m$ is $200$.
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def value_of_m():

    return m

result = value_of_m()

The value of $m$ is $200$. The answer is: $\boxed{200}$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let \[f(x) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
-x + 3 & \text{if } x \le 0, \\
2x - 5 & \text{if } x > 0.
\end{array}
\right.\]How many solutions does the equation $f(f(x)) = 4$ have?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
To solve the equation $f(f(x)) = 4,$ we first find the values $x$ such that $f(x) = 4.$

Either $f(x) = -x + 3$ (for $x \le 0$) or $f(x) = 2x - 5$ (for $x > 0$). If $-x + 3 = 4,$ then $x = -1.$ Note that this value satisfies $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = 4,$ then $x = 9/2.$ Note that this value satisfies $x > 0.$ Therefore, the solutions to $f(x) = 4$ are $x = -1$ and $x = 9/2.$

Next, we solve for the values $x$ such that $f(x) = -1.$ If $-x + 3 = -1,$ then $x = 4.$ This value does not satisfy $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = -1,$ then $x = 2.$ This value satisfies $x > 0.$

Finally, we solve for the values $x$ such that $f(x) = 9/2.$ If $-x + 3 = 9/2,$ then $x = -3/2.$ This value satisfies $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = 9/2,$ then $x = 19/4.$ This value satisfies $x > 0.$

Therefore, the equation $f(f(x)) = 4$ has the solutions $x = 2,$ $-3/2,$ and $19/4,$ for a total of $\boxed{3}$ solutions. The answer is $\boxed{3}$

**Solution:**


The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. 

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be solved by considering the cases for the absolute value inside the outer absolute value:

- If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, then $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, and this gives us two cases:
  - If $x-1 \ge 0$, then $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.
  - If $x-1 < 0$, then $-(x-1) = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

- If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$, then $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, and this gives us two cases:
  - If $x-1 \ge 0$, then $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
  - If $x-1 < 0$, then $-(x-1) = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

For the equation to have $4$ distinct solutions, we need to find the values of $m$ for which the four solutions are distinct. This means that the expressions $3 + \frac{m}{100}$, $-1 + \frac{m}{100}$, $3 - \frac{m}{100}$, and $-1 - \frac{m}{100}$ are all distinct.

This is equivalent to the system of inequalities:

\[3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 + \frac{m}{100},\]
\[3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq 3 - \frac{m}{100},\]
\[3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 - \frac{m}{100},\]
\[-1 + \frac{m}{100} \neq 3 - \frac{m}{100},\]
\[-1 + \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 - \frac{m}{100},\]
\[3 - \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 - \frac{m}{100}.\]

Solving this system of inequalities, we find that $m$ must be in the range $100 < m < 300$. The positive integers in this range are exactly the integers from $101$ to $299$, inclusive. There are $199$ such integers. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $199$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def count_positive_integers():

**Solution:** 



To solve the problem, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. 

First, we can rewrite the equation as $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. We know that the left side of the equation is always nonnegative, so the right side must also be nonnegative, which implies $m \ge 0$. However, since $m$ is a positive integer, we must have $m > 0$. So the smallest possible value for $m$ is $1$.

Now, let's consider the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. The right side $\frac{m}{100}$ is a positive number, so the left side $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ must be equal to a positive number. This means that $\vert x-1 \vert -2$ must be equal to a positive number. So $\vert x-1 \vert$ must be greater than $2$, which implies $x-1 > 2$ or $x-1 < -2$. This gives us $x > 3$ or $x < -1$.

Now, let's consider the case $x > 3$. In this case, $\vert x-1 \vert = x-1$, so the equation becomes $x-1 -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, or $x-3 = \frac{m}{100}$. This gives us $x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$. Since $x > 3$, we must have $\frac{m}{100} + 3 > 3$, or $\frac{m}{100} > 0$. This implies $m > 0$. So for $x > 3$, we must have $m > 0$.

Similarly, for $x < -1$, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = 1-x$, so the equation becomes $1-x -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, or $x+1 = \frac{m}{100}$. This gives us $x = \frac{m}{100} - 1$. Since $x < -1$, we must have $\frac{m}{100} - 1 < -1$, or $\frac{m}{100} < 0$. This implies $m < 0$. But we know that $m$ is a positive integer, so this case is not possible.

So the only case we need to consider is $x > 3$. In this case, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} + 3$ is greater than $3$ and less than $5$. This gives us $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, or $0 < m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ in this range are $1, 2, \ldots, 199$. However, we must also have $m$ such that $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

To find the values of $m$ for which this is true, we can plot the graph of $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ and the lines $y = \frac{m}{100}$ for $m = 1, 2, \ldots, 199$. The graph of $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ consists of three line segments: a line segment from $(-\infty, -1)$ with slope $1$, a line segment from $(-1, 3)$ with slope $-1$, and a line segment from $(3, \infty)$ with slope $1$. The lines $y = \frac{m}{100}$ for $m = 1, 2, \ldots, 199$ are horizontal lines.

By observing the graph, we can see that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions for $m = 1, 2, \ldots, 199$ except for $m = 200$. This is because when $m = 200$, the line $y = \frac{200}{100} = 2$ is outside the range of the graph of $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $199$. The answer is: $199$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"For certain ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ of real numbers, the system of equations
\[\begin{aligned} ax+by&=1 \\ x^2 + y^2 &= 50  \end{aligned}\]has at least one solution, and each solution is an ordered pair $(x,y)\,$ of integers. How many such ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ are there?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The graph of $ax+by=1$ is a line, while the graph of $x^2+y^2=50$ is a circle centered at the origin. Therefore, $(a, b)$ satisfies the conditions if and only if the line and circle intersect at least once, and they intersect only at lattice points (points with integer coordinates).

Knowing this, it makes sense to look for lattice points on the circle whose equation is $x^2+y^2=50$. Testing cases, we find that there are twelve lattice points on the circle: $(\pm 1, \pm 7)$, $(\pm 7, \pm 1)$, and $(\pm 5, \pm 5)$ (where the two $\pm$ signs in each pair are independent of each other).

There are $\tbinom{12}{2} = 66$ pairs of these points, and each pair determines a line. However, the graph of $ax+by=1$ can never pass through the origin $(0, 0)$, since if $x=y=0$, then $ax+by=0 \neq 1$. Therefore, the six pairs which consist of diametrically opposed points are invalid, since the line through them passes through the origin. This corrects our count to $66 - 6 = 60$.

In addition, for each of the twelve points, there is a line tangent to the circle at that point, so that the only solution to the system is that one point. This brings the final total to $60 + 12 = \boxed{72}$. The answer is $\boxed{72}$

There are $\tbinom{12}{2} = 66$ pairs of these points, and each pair determines a line. However, the graph of $ax+by=1$ can never pass through the origin $(0, 0)$, since if $x=y=0$, then $ax+by=0 \neq 1$. Therefore, the six pairs which consist of diametrically opposed points are invalid, since the line through them passes through the origin. This corrects our count to $66 - 6 = 60$.

In addition, for each of the twelve points, there is a line tangent to the circle at that point, so that the only solution to the system is that one point. This brings the final total to $60 + 12 = \boxed{72}$. The answer is $\boxed{72}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



To solve this problem, we need to find the value of $m$ for which the equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions.

Let's break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. We start by simplifying the equation. The equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ can be rewritten as $|x - 1| - 2 = \pm \frac{m}{100}$.
2. This gives us two equations: $|x - 1| - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $|x - 1| - 2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.
3. We can rewrite these equations as $|x - 1| = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $|x - 1| = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, respectively.
4. These equations can be further simplified to $x - 1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x - 1 = -2 - \frac{m}{100}$, and $x - 1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ or $x - 1 = -2 + \frac{m}{100}$.
5. Solving these equations for $x$, we get $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$, $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$, $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, and $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.
6. These are the four solutions to the original equation. For the solutions to be distinct, the values of $\frac{m}{100}$ must not be equal to each other.
7. This gives us the inequality $|\frac{m}{100}| \geq 3$, which simplifies to $\frac{m}{100} \geq 3$ or $\frac{m}{100} \leq -3$.
8. Solving these inequalities for $m$, we get $m \geq 300$ or $m \leq -300$.
9. However, $m$ must be positive, so we only consider $m \geq 300$.
10. The smallest integer value of $m$ that satisfies this inequality is $300$.
11. To find the largest integer value of $m$ that works, we set the right-hand side of the equation $|x - 1| = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ equal to zero and solve for $m$. This gives us $2 - \frac{m}{100} = 0$, or $m = 200$.
12. Therefore, the largest integer value of $m$ that works is $200$.
13. The integers $m$ that satisfy the inequality $300 \leq m \leq 200$ are the integers from $300$ to $200$, inclusive.
14. The number of these integers is $300 - 200 + 1 = 101$.

So, there are 101 positive integers $m$ for which the equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions.

The answer is: $\boxed{101}$.

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"

Assistant:

 The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

First, let's analyze the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. The right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be positive because the absolute value of any real number is non-negative, and the left side of the equation is also non-negative. Therefore, $m$ must be a positive integer.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be solved by considering the cases for the inner absolute value:
1. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 > 0$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \vert x-1 \vert -2$. So the equation becomes $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$.
2. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = -( \vert x-1 \vert -2) = 2 - \vert x-1 \vert$. So the equation becomes $2 - \vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$.

For each of these two cases, we can solve the resulting equations and count the number of distinct solutions.

After solving these equations and counting the number of distinct solutions, we find that only for $m=200$ does the equation have $4$ distinct solutions.

So the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $1$. The answer is: $1$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let \[f(x) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
-x + 3 & \text{if } x \le 0, \\
2x - 5 & \text{if } x > 0.
\end{array}
\right.\]How many solutions does the equation $f(f(x)) = 4$ have?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
To solve the equation $f(f(x)) = 4,$ we first find the values $x$ such that $f(x) = 4.$

Either $f(x) = -x + 3$ (for $x \le 0$) or $f(x) = 2x - 5$ (for $x > 0$). If $-x + 3 = 4,$ then $x = -1.$ Note that this value satisfies $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = 4,$ then $x = 9/2.$ Note that this value satisfies $x > 0.$ Therefore, the solutions to $f(x) = 4$ are $x = -1$ and $x = 9/2.$

Next, we solve for the values $x$ such that $f(x) = -1.$ If $-x + 3 = -1,$ then $x = 4.$ This value does not satisfy $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = -1,$ then $x = 2.$ This value satisfies $x > 0.$

Finally, we solve for the values $x$ such that $f(x) = 9/2.$ If $-x + 3 = 9/2,$ then $x = -3/2.$ This value satisfies $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = 9/2,$ then $x = 19/4.$ This value satisfies $x > 0.$

Therefore, the equation $f(f(x)) = 4$ has the solutions $x = 2,$ $-3/2,$ and $19/4,$ for a total of $\boxed{3}$ solutions. The answer is $\boxed{3}$

**Solution:** 


The problem is asking for the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly four distinct solutions. 

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is equivalent to a piecewise function with four cases. We can solve each case separately and count the number of distinct solutions for each case.

1. For $0 < m < 200$, the equation becomes $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$. 
2. For $200 \leq m < 400$, the equation becomes $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
3. For $400 \leq m < 600$, the equation becomes $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\left(2 - \frac{m}{100}\right)$.
4. For $m \geq 600$, the equation becomes $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.

We can solve each case separately and count the number of distinct solutions for each case.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"For certain ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ of real numbers, the system of equations
\[\begin{aligned} ax+by&=1 \\ x^2 + y^2 &= 50  \end{aligned}\]has at least one solution, and each solution is an ordered pair $(x,y)\,$ of integers. How many such ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ are there?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The graph of $ax+by=1$ is a line, while the graph of $x^2+y^2=50$ is a circle centered at the origin. Therefore, $(a, b)$ satisfies the conditions if and only if the line and circle intersect at least once, and they intersect only at lattice points (points with integer coordinates).

Knowing this, it makes sense to look for lattice points on the circle whose equation is $x^2+y^2=50$. Testing cases, we find that there are twelve lattice points on the circle: $(\pm 1, \pm 7)$, $(\pm 7, \pm 1)$, and $(\pm 5, \pm 5)$ (where the two $\pm$ signs in each pair are independent of each other).

There are $\tbinom{12}{2} = 66$ pairs of these points, and each pair determines a line. However, the graph of $ax+by=1$ can never pass through the origin $(0, 0)$, since if $x=y=0$, then $ax+by=0 \neq 1$. Therefore, the six pairs which consist of diametrically opposed points are invalid, since the line through them passes through the origin. This corrects our count to $66 - 6 = 60$.

In addition, for each of the twelve points, there is a line tangent to the circle at that point, so that the only solution to the system is that one point. This brings the final total to $60 + 12 = \boxed{72}$. The answer is $\boxed{72}$

The output is empty because the script didn't provide the correct solution. The error comes from the `solve` function which doesn't work with absolute value equations. We need to solve the equation manually for each value of $m$.

Let's solve the equation manually for each value of $m$:
\[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\]

1. If $\frac{m}{100} < 1$, then the equation becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=0$, which simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$. This gives us two solutions: $x = 3$ and $x = -1$.
2. If $\frac{m}{100} = 1$, then the equation becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=1$, which gives us four solutions: $x = 0, 2, 4, -2$.
3. If $\frac{m}{100} > 1$, then the equation becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, which gives us two solutions: $x = 1 + 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = 1 - 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.

From the above analysis, we can see that the equation has 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100} = 1$. Therefore, there is only 1 positive integer $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions.

So the correct answer is 1.
The answer is $\boxed{1}$.
