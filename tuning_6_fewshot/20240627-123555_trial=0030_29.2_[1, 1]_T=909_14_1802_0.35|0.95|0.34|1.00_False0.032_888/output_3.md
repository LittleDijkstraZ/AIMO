**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Find the number of 10-tuples $(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{10})$ of real numbers such that
\[(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2 = \frac{1}{11}.\]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,
\begin{align*}
&[(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + \dots + 1^2 + 1^2)][(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2] \\
&\ge [(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + (x_2 - x_3) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10}]^2 = 1.
\end{align*}From the given condition, we have equality, so by the equality condition for Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[\frac{1 - x_1}{1} = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{1} = \frac{x_2 - x_3}{1} = \dots = \frac{x_9 - x_{10}}{1} = \frac{x_{10}}{1}.\]Let
\[d = 1 - x_1 = x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_3 = \dots = x_9 - x_{10} = x_{10}.\]Then
\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so
\[(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_{10}) = \left( \frac{10}{11}, \frac{9}{11}, \frac{8}{11}, \dots, \frac{1}{11} \right).\]In particular, there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


The equation given is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. Let's consider each case separately.

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these equations are all the points in a square with side length 20.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are all the points in a square with side length 16.

The intersection of the solutions to these two cases is the convex polygon we are looking for. This is the intersection of two squares, which is another square. The side length of this square is the smaller of the two side lengths, which is 16. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

The first term is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. This term is zero only when both $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ must lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$. These lines intersect at $(5,5)$ and form a cross shape.

The second term is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. This term is zero only when both $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ must lie on the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$, which form a square with side length 16.

The convex polygon formed by the intersection of these two shapes is a square with side length 10 (since the cross shape is contained within the square with side length 16). The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 100.

Here is a Python code to calculate the area:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    side_length = 10
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 100

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
100
```
The area of the convex polygon is $100$. The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The equation is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
2. The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So, we have two cases:
   a. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
   b. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
3. Solving these absolute value equations, we get the points that satisfy the conditions:
   a. For $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, the points are on a square with side length 10, centered at the origin.
   b. For $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, the points are on a square with side length 10, centered at the origin, but rotated 45 degrees.
   c. For $\vert x \vert = 8$, the points are on a line segment parallel to the y-axis, 8 units away from the y-axis.
   d. For $\vert y \vert = 8$, the points are on a line segment parallel to the x-axis, 8 units away from the x-axis.
4. The intersection of these points forms a square with side length 16 (the maximum distance from the origin to a point satisfying both conditions).
5. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The equation is equal to zero if either of the two factors is zero.
2. Each of the factors is a product of two terms, each of which is a squared absolute value minus a constant.
3. For each factor, if either of the terms is zero, the whole factor is zero.
4. The term $\vert x + y \vert - 10$ is zero when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
5. Similarly, $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$ implies $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
6. $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ implies $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
7. $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$ implies $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.
8. These equations represent the lines forming the boundary of the polygon.
9. To find the area of the polygon, we can find the intersection points of these lines and then use the Shoelace formula or other methods to find the area of the polygon.

Now, let's solve the problem using Python and sympy:

```python

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve, Abs

def calculate_area():
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # Solve the equations
    solutions_1 = solve([Abs(x + y) - 10, Abs(x - y) - 10], (x, y))
    solutions_2 = solve([Abs(x + y) - 10, Abs(x - y) + 10], (x, y))
    solutions_3 = solve([Abs(x + y) + 10, Abs(x - y) - 10], (x, y))
    solutions_4 = solve([Abs(x + y) + 10, Abs(x - y) + 10], (x, y))
    solutions_5 = solve([Abs(x) - 8, Abs(y) - 8], (x, y))
    solutions_6 = solve([Abs(x) - 8, Abs(y) + 8], (x, y))
    solutions_7 = solve([Abs(x) + 8, Abs(y) - 8], (x, y))
    solutions_8 = solve([Abs(x) + 8, Abs(y) + 8], (x, y))

    # Combine all solutions
    solutions = solutions_1 + solutions_2 + solutions_3 + solutions_4 + solutions_5 + solutions_6 + solutions_7 + solutions_8

The area of the polygon is 0. However, this is not correct. The area of the polygon should be a positive integer. Let's reevaluate the problem.

The area of the polygon is actually the area of a square with side length 16. To see this, consider the equations $x + y = 10$, $x - y = 10$, $x = 8$, and $y = 8$. Solving these equations, we find that the vertices of the square are $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$. The side length of the square is the distance between $(8, 2)$ and $(8, -2)$, which is 4 units in the y-direction. But since the absolute value is taken in the equation, the side length is actually 8 units in both the x and y directions. Therefore, the area of the square is $8^2 = 64$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 64. The answer is: $64$.

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

The first term is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. This term is zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, -2)$, and $(-8, 2)$.

The second term is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. This term is zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$.

The vertices of the convex polygon are the intersection of the vertices of the two squares, which is a square with side length 16. The area of a square is the side length squared, so the area of the convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$
