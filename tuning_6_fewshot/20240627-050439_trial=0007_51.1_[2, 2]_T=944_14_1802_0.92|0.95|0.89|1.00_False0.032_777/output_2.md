**Problem:** 
"How many solutions does the equation \[\frac{(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)\dotsm(x-100)}{(x-1^2)(x-2^2)(x-3^2)\dotsm(x-100^2)} = 0\]have for $x$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Any solution to this equation must make the numerator of the left-hand side zero, while keeping the denominator non-zero. The numerator is zero when $x$ is one of the numbers $1, 2, 3, \dots, 100.$ However, for any value in this list that is a perfect square, the denominator will also be zero, so that value of $x$ will not be a root. Therefore, we want to find the number of integers in the list $1, 2, \dots, 100$ which are not perfect squares. The perfect squares in the list are $1^2, 2^2, \dots, 10^2,$ so there are $10$ perfect squares, and \[100 - 10 = \boxed{90}\]integers which are not perfect squares. The answer is $\boxed{90}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



The sympy-based approach for this problem involves a careful reading of the problem and recognizing that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can have at most 4 solutions. This is because the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, is a "V" shape that intersects the x-axis at $x=1 \pm 2$, which results in two segments. Each segment is then shifted by $\frac{m}{100}$ away from the x-axis in either the positive or negative direction, resulting in a total of 4 intersections with the x-axis.

The solutions to the equation will be the values of $m$ for which these 4 intersections occur. To find the values of $m$, we can set up the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ and solve for $m$ when the equation has exactly 4 solutions. 

After solving the equation and finding the values of $m$, we need to count the number of these values that are positive integers.

The entire script for this problem is as follows:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solveset, S

def count_positive_integers():
    x, m = symbols('x m')
    equation = Eq(abs(abs(x - 1) - 2), m/100)
    solutions = solveset(equation, m, domain=S.Integers)
    count = len([m_value for m_value in solutions if m_value > 0])
    return count

result = count_positive_integers()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS ['']

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
['']
```
The output is an empty list, which indicates that there is a mistake in the script. Let's go back and fix the mistake.

After examining the problem and the solution, we realize that we have misunderstood the problem and the script. The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has exactly 4 distinct solutions. However, the script is trying to find all integer solutions for $m$, not just the positive ones.

We must modify the script to only consider the positive values of $m$. The modified script is as follows:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solveset, S

def count_positive_integers():
    x, m = symbols('x m')
    equation = Eq(abs(abs(x - 1) - 2), m/100)
    solutions = solveset(equation, m, domain=S.Integers)
    positive_solutions = [m_value for m_value in solutions if m_value > 0]
    return len(positive_solutions)

result = count_positive_integers()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS ['']

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
['']
```
The output is still empty. This is because the `solveset` function is not capable of solving the equation directly. We need to solve the equation manually and count the positive integer solutions.

After careful examination of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, we can see that it can have at most 4 solutions. The solutions to the equation will be the values of $m$ for which these 4 intersections occur. To find the values of $m$, we can set up the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ and solve for $m$ when the equation has exactly 4 solutions.

After solving the equation and finding the values of $m$, we need to count the number of these values that are positive integers.

However, this problem is too complex to be solved by a simple script, and it requires a more analytical approach. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have exactly 4 solutions when the range of $\frac{m}{100}$ covers the "V" shape of the graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ twice. This can only happen when $\frac{m}{100}$ is between 1 and 2. Therefore, the possible values of $m$ are those integers in the range $100 \leq m \leq 200$.

So, there are exactly 101 positive integers $m$ in this range.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly 4 solutions is 101.

The answer is $\boxed{101}$.

**Solution:** 



The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions. 

This equation can be rewritten as $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=0.01m$. The function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a graph that is a series of V's. The function equals 0 when $x$ is in the range $[1-2, 1+2]$, or $[-1, 3]$. So, $f(x)$ equals 0.01m in the range $[0.01m+1-2, 0.01m+1+2]$ or $[0.01m-1, 0.01m+3]$. This means we want to find how many integer values of $m$ make the length of the interval $[0.01m-1, 0.01m+3]$ equal to 4. This length is $4 = 0.01m+3 - (0.01m-1) = 4$, so the length of the interval is always 4 regardless of the value of $m$.

Therefore, for any positive integer $m$, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly four distinct solutions. The number of such $m$ is 1.

Therefore, the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions is 1.
The answer is $\boxed{1}$.

**Solution:** 


The Python code below solves the problem. The steps to solve the problem are as follows:
1. The given equation has four distinct solutions if and only if the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ is $1$.
2. This can be seen by observing that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions for $x$ if and only if $\frac{m}{100}=1$.
3. This is because the expression on the left-hand side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, is always between $0$ and $2$, and it equals $1$ exactly when the equation has four distinct solutions.
4. Therefore, we need to find the value of $m$ that makes $\frac{m}{100}=1$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def find_m():
    m = 100
    return m

m = find_m()

The value of $m$ that makes the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have four distinct solutions is $100$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is $1$. The answer is: 1. For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?" The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is 1. The answer is $\boxed{1}$.

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. We know that the expression on the left-hand side will be zero when $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 \pm \frac{m}{100}$. This implies that $x = 1 \pm (2 \pm \frac{m}{100})$, giving us four solutions: $x = 1 \pm (2 + \frac{m}{100})$ and $x = 1 \pm (2 - \frac{m}{100})$. 

To have four distinct solutions, we need $2 + \frac{m}{100} > 2 - \frac{m}{100} > 0$. This simplifies to $\frac{m}{100} > 0$ and $2 - \frac{m}{100} > 0$. The first inequality is always true, and the second inequality gives $m < 200$. So the possible values of $m$ are the positive integers from 1 to 199. 

To count the number of these integers, we can use the python `range` function and find the length of the resulting list:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def count_m():
    m_values = range(1, 200)
    return len(m_values)

result = count_m()
print(result)
```

```
The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 199. However, this result contradicts the condition that $2 - \frac{m}{100} > 0$, which would imply $m < 200$. 

After revisiting the solution, we realized that we only considered the range of $m$ for which $2 + \frac{m}{100} > 2 - \frac{m}{100} > 0$. However, for the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, we need $2 + \frac{m}{100} > 0$ and $2 - \frac{m}{100} > 0$, which gives $m < 200$. 

So, the correct range of $m$ values is from 1 to 199. Let's count the number of these integers again:

```python

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We are given the equation $| |x-1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$.
2. We need to find for how many positive integers $m$ does the equation have 4 distinct solutions.
3. The equation $| |x-1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ will have 4 distinct solutions if the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ is less than 2 and greater than 0.
4. This means $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which simplifies to $0 < m < 200$.
5. We are looking for positive integers $m$ that satisfy this condition.
6. The number of positive integers $m$ in the range $(0, 200)$ is the integer part of $200$ minus the integer part of $1$ (since $0$ is not a positive integer), plus 1.
7. So the number of positive integers $m$ is $200 - 1 + 1 = 200$.

Now let's write the python code to calculate the number of positive integers $m$:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def count_positive_integers():
    # number of positive integers m in the range (0, 200)
    count = 200 - 1 + 1
    return count

result = count_positive_integers()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 200

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
200
```
The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $| |x-1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is $\boxed{200}$.
The answer is: 200

## QUESTION 2 - 12 
- TIME_SPENT : 411 secs

12_
**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many solutions does the equation \[\frac{(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)\dotsm(x-100)}{(x-1^2)(x-2^2)(x-3^2)\dotsm(x-100^2)} = 0\]have for $x$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Any solution to this equation must make the numerator of the left-hand side zero, while keeping the denominator non-zero. The numerator is zero when $x$ is one of the numbers $1, 2, 3, \dots, 100.$ However, for any value in this list that is a perfect square, the denominator will also be zero, so that value of $x$ will not be a root. Therefore, we want to find the number of integers in the list $1, 2, \dots, 100$ which are not perfect squares. The perfect squares in the list are $1^2, 2^2, \dots, 10^2,$ so there are $10$ perfect squares, and \[100 - 10 = \boxed{90}\]integers which are not perfect squares. The answer is $\boxed{90}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


First, we know that the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. The number of solutions will depend on the value of $\frac{m}{100}$. 

We can think of $| |x - 1| - 2|$ as a piecewise function:
$$| |x - 1| - 2| = \begin{cases} |x - 1| - 2, & \text{if } |x - 1| \geq 2 \\ -( |x - 1| - 2), & \text{if } |x - 1| < 2 \end{cases}.$$
The graph of $| |x - 1| - 2|$ is a "V" shape with the "bottom" of the "V" at $x = 1 \pm 2$, i.e., at $x = -1$ and $x = 3$. The value of the function is $2 - |x - 1|$ for $x \leq 1$ and $|x - 1| - 2$ for $x \geq 1$.

So, the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ will have 4 distinct solutions if $\frac{m}{100} = 2 - \frac{1}{2} = 1.5$ or $\frac{m}{100} = \frac{1}{2}$. Therefore, $m = 150$ or $m = 100$.
However, if $m = 150$, the equation becomes $| |x - 1| - 2| = 1.5$. This will have 3 distinct solutions (the "V" is too wide to cross the x-axis four times), so we discard $m = 150$. Therefore, the only value of $m$ that works is $m = 100$. The answer is: $1$
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def count_solutions():
    """For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"""
    # Check the possible values of m
    for m in range(1, 101):
        # Calculate the value of the right side of the equation
        right_side = m / 100
        # For the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, the right side must equal 1.5 or 0.5
        if right_side == 1.5 or right_side == 0.5:
            return 1

    return 0

result = count_solutions()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 1

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
1
```
The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 1. The value of $m$ that satisfies this condition is $m = 100$. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{1}$.
The answer is $\boxed{1}$.
