**Problem:** 
"Let $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_ 2= (-16,2).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that
\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as
\[\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1.\]Find $h + k + a + b.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

**Solution:** 



This problem can be solved by examining the conditions given in the equation. The equation is of the form $(A)(B) = 0$, which implies that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, we need to find the points that satisfy each of the following conditions:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For condition 1, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
For condition 2, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
For condition 3, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$, which implies $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
For condition 4, we have $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

The intersection of these conditions gives us the vertices of the polygon:

- Intersection of $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ gives us the vertex $(10, 0)$.
- Intersection of $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$ gives us the vertex $(0, 10)$.
- Intersection of $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$ gives us the vertex $(-10, -0)$.
- Intersection of $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$ gives us the vertex $(0, -10)$.
- Intersection of $x = 8$ and $y = 8$ gives us the vertex $(8, 8)$.
- Intersection of $x = 8$ and $y = -8$ gives us the vertex $(8, -8)$.
- Intersection of $x = -8$ and $y = 8$ gives us the vertex $(-8, 8)$.
- Intersection of $x = -8$ and $y = -8$ gives us the vertex $(-8, -8)$.

These vertices form a square with side length 20. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 400. The answer is: $400$

draw(left--right);
label("$x$", (x/2, -0.1), S);

[/asy]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Let $w$ be the width of each of the identical rectangles. Since $PQ=3w$, $RS=2x$ and $PQ=RS$ (because $PQRS$ is a rectangle), then $2x = 3w$, or $$w=\frac{2}{3}x.$$ Therefore, the area of each of the five identical rectangles is $$x\left(\frac{2}{3}x\right)=\frac{2}{3}x^2.$$ Since the area of $PQRS$ is 4000 and it is made up of five of these identical smaller rectangles, then $$5\left(\frac{2}{3}x^2\right)=4000$$ or $$\frac{10}{3}x^2 = 4000$$ or $x^2 = 1200$ or $x \approx 34.6$ which, when rounded off to the nearest integer, is $\boxed{35}.$ The answer is $\boxed{35}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


The problem asks for the area of a convex polygon formed by the points that satisfy the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. 

The equation is equal to zero if either of the two factors is zero. Therefore, we have two sets of equations to solve:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first set of equations, we have:
- $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ implies $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
- $\vert x \vert = 8$ implies $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
- $\vert y \vert = 8$ implies $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

Similarly, for the second set of equations, we have:
- $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ implies $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
- $\vert x \vert = 8$ implies $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
- $\vert y \vert = 8$ implies $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

By solving these equations, we find the vertices of the polygon:
- For the first set of equations, we have the vertices $(8, 2)$, $(8, -10)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -10)$.
- For the second set of equations, we have the vertices $(2, 8)$, $(-10, 8)$, $(2, -8)$, and $(-10, -8)$.

The polygon is a square with side length 16. Therefore, the area of the polygon is $16^2 = 256$.

The answer is: $256$

```
The error in the code is due to the fact that the `solveset` function does not support solving equations with absolute value expressions. To solve this problem, we can first observe that the given equation is a product of two terms, and for the product to be zero, either one of the terms must be zero. Therefore, we can solve the two equations separately:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

The second equation implies that both $|x|$ and $|y|$ must be equal to 8, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. The first equation implies that both $|x + y|$ and $|x - y|$ must be equal to 10. By considering all possible combinations of the signs of $x$ and $y$, we can find that the only solutions that satisfy both equations are $(8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, $(8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$. These are the vertices of the square polygon.

Therefore, the area of the polygon is the number of vertices, which is 4.
The answer is: $4$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many square units are in the area of the triangle whose vertices are the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the curve $y = (x-3)^2 (x+2)$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we need to find where this curve intersects the $x$ and $y$ axes.  If $y=0$, then $(x-3)^2(x+2)=0$, which has solutions of $x=3$ and $x=-2$.  If $x=0$, then $y=(-3)^2(2)=18$.  So, the curve has two $x$-intercepts and one $y$-intercept.  The length of the base along the $x$-axis is $3-(-2)=5$.  The height from this base is equal to the $y$-intercept, 18.  The area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 5\cdot 18=\boxed{45}$. The answer is $\boxed{45}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, and this equals zero if and only if both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only way this can happen is if $x = y = 5$ or $x = -y = -5$.

The second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$, and this equals zero if and only if both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The only way this can happen is if $x = 8$ or $x = -8$, and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

So the points that satisfy the equation are $(5, 5)$, $(5, -5)$, $(8, 8)$, and $(-8, 8)$. These points form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 100.

Here is a Python function that calculates the area of the square:

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Find the number of 10-tuples $(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{10})$ of real numbers such that
\[(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2 = \frac{1}{11}.\]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,
\begin{align*}
&[(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + \dots + 1^2 + 1^2)][(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2] \\
&\ge [(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + (x_2 - x_3) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10}]^2 = 1.
\end{align*}From the given condition, we have equality, so by the equality condition for Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[\frac{1 - x_1}{1} = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{1} = \frac{x_2 - x_3}{1} = \dots = \frac{x_9 - x_{10}}{1} = \frac{x_{10}}{1}.\]Let
\[d = 1 - x_1 = x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_3 = \dots = x_9 - x_{10} = x_{10}.\]Then
\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so
\[(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_{10}) = \left( \frac{10}{11}, \frac{9}{11}, \frac{8}{11}, \dots, \frac{1}{11} \right).\]In particular, there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if at least one of the factors is zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The points satisfying either of these conditions form a square with side length $20$. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.
The answer is: $400$

The solutions to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ are the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.
The solutions to $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ are the lines $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.
The solutions to $\vert x \vert = 8$ are the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.
The solutions to $\vert y \vert = 8$ are the lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.
The intersection points of these lines form a square with side length 16.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, and this equals to zero if and only if both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these two equations are all points on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, or $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$.

The second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$, and this equals to zero if and only if both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these two equations are all points on the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$, or $y = 8$ and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length $16$.

The area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of these two squares. The area of a square with side length $a$ is $a^2$, so the area of the first square is $(10\sqrt{2})^2 = 200$, and the area of the second square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $200 + 256 = 456$.

So the area of the convex polygon is $456$. The answer is: $456$

## QUESTION 3 - 8

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_ 2= (-16,2).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that
\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as
\[\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1.\]Find $h + k + a + b.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**
