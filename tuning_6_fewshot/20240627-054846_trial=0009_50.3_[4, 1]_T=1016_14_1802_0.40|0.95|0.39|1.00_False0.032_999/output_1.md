**Problem**
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


This problem is a bit tricky to solve directly, so we will first simplify the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ by completing the square.

The expression can be rewritten as $5(x^2 - \frac{8}{5}xy + y^2) = 5[(x - \frac{4}{5}y)^2 - \frac{16}{25}y^2 + y^2] = 5[(x - \frac{4}{5}y)^2 + \frac{9}{25}y^2]$.

Now, let's denote $u = x - \frac{4}{5}y$ and $v = y$. Then the expression becomes $5(u^2 + \frac{9}{25}v^2)$, which is clearly minimized when $u = v = 0$, giving a minimum value of 0.

However, this minimum is achieved when $x = \frac{4}{5}y$ and $y = 0$, which does not satisfy the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. So we need to find another way to minimize the expression under the given condition.

Notice that the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$, which implies $|x-2y| = 20$. This means $x-2y = 20$ or $x-2y = -20$.

If $x-2y = 20$, then $x = 2y + 20$. Substituting this into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get
\[5(2y+20)^2 + 5y^2 - 8(2y+20)y = 20y^2 + 200y + 2000 + 5y^2 - 16y^2 - 160y = -y^2 + 40y + 2000.\]
Taking the derivative with respect to $y$ and setting it to zero, we get $-2y + 40 = 0$, so $y = 20$. Substituting this back into $x = 2y + 20$, we get $x = 60$.

Substituting $x = 60$ and $y = 20$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get
\[5(60)^2 + 5(20)^2 - 8(60)(20) = 18000 + 2000 - 9600 = 18400.\]

If $x-2y = -20$, then $x = 2y - 20$. Substituting this into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get
\[5(2y-20)^2 + 5y^2 - 8(2y-20)y = 20y^2 - 200y + 2000 + 5y^2 - 16y^2 + 160y = -y^2 - 40y + 2000.\]
Taking the derivative with respect to $y$ and setting it to zero, we get $-2y - 40 = 0$, so $y = -20$. Substituting this back into $x = 2y - 20$, we get $x = -60$.

Substituting $x = -60$ and $y = -20$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get
\[5(-60)^2 + 5(-20)^2 - 8(-60)(-20) = 18000 + 2000 - 9600 = 18400.\]

So in both cases, the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ attains the value 18400. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 18400.
The answer is: $18400$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"If $x + 2y= 4$ and $xy = -8$, what is the value of $x^2 + 4y^2$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
We see that $(x + 2y)^2 = (x^2 + 4y^2) + 4xy = 4^2 = 16$. We want to find $x^2 + 4y^2$ and are given $xy = -8$. So, $x^2 + 4y^2 + 4xy = x^2 + 4y^2 + 4(-8) = 16$. It follows that $x^2 + 4y^2 = \boxed{48}$. The answer is $\boxed{48}$

**Problem**
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


This problem requires a bit of algebraic manipulation and optimization techniques. Here's a step-by-step solution:

First, let's rewrite the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$. We can simplify this further using the property $|a| = |-a|$ to get $|x-2y| - |x-2y| = 40$, which simplifies to $0 = 40$. This is a contradiction, so we must have made a mistake in our simplification.

Let's go back to the original equation and consider the two cases separately:

1. If $x - 2y \geq 0$ and $y - 2x \geq 0$, then $|x - 2y| = x - 2y$ and $|y - 2x| = y - 2x$. The equation becomes $(x - 2y) + (2y - x) = 40$, which simplifies to $0 = 40$, a contradiction.

2. If $x - 2y < 0$ and $y - 2x < 0$, then $|x - 2y| = 2y - x$ and $|y - 2x| = 2x - y$. The equation becomes $(2y - x) + (2x - y) = 40$, which simplifies to $y = 20$. Substituting $y = 20$ into the equation $x - 2y < 0$ gives $x < 40$.

Now, let's consider the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$. We can rewrite it as $5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy$. We know that $(x - 2y)^2 \geq 0$, which expands to $x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2 \geq 0$. Rearranging gives $x^2 + y^2 \geq 4xy$. Substituting this into the expression $5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy$ gives $5(4xy) - 8xy = 20xy - 8xy = 12xy$.

Since $x < 40$ and $y = 20$, we have $xy < 40 \cdot 20 = 800$. Therefore, $12xy < 12 \cdot 800 = 9600$.

So, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is $-9600$. However, this doesn't make sense as the value of a quadratic expression should be non-negative. We must have made a mistake in our analysis.

Let's go back and re-examine our steps. We made a mistake in our simplification of the absolute value equation. The correct simplification should be $|x-2y| + |-2y+x| = 40$. Now, let's consider the two cases again:

1. If $x - 2y \geq 0$ and $-2y + x \geq 0$, then $|x - 2y| = x - 2y$ and $|-2y + x| = -2y + x$. The equation becomes $(x - 2y) + (-2y + x) = 40$, which simplifies to $2(x - 2y) = 40$, and further simplifies to $x - 2y = 20$.

2. If $x - 2y < 0$ and $-2y + x < 0$, then $|x - 2y| = 2y - x$ and $|-2y + x| = x - 2y$. The equation becomes $(2y - x) + (x - 2y) = 40$, which simplifies to $0 = 40$, a contradiction.

So, the only valid case is $x - 2y = 20$. Solving for $y$ gives $y = \frac{x - 20}{2}$. Substituting this into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ gives:

$$5x^2 + 5\left(\frac{x - 20}{2}\right)^2 - 8x\left(\frac{x - 20}{2}\right) = 5x^2 + 5\left(\frac{x^2 - 40x + 400}{4}\right) - 4x(x - 20) = 5x^2 + \frac{5x^2 - 100x + 1000}{4} - 4x^2 + 80x = \frac{15x^2 + 200x - 1000}{4}.$$

Now, let's find the minimum value of this expression. To do this, we can take the derivative with respect to $x$ and set it equal to zero:

$$\frac{30x + 200}{4} = 0 \implies 30x + 200 = 0 \implies 30x = -200 \implies x = -\frac{200}{30} = -\frac{20}{3}.$$

Substituting $x = -\frac{20}{3}$ into the equation $x - 2y = 20$ gives $-\frac{20}{3} - 2y = 20$, which simplifies to $-2y = 20 + \frac{20}{3} = \frac{80}{3}$. Therefore, $y = -\frac{40}{3}$.

Substituting $x = -\frac{20}{3}$ and $y = -\frac{40}{3}$ into the expression $\frac{15x^2 + 200x - 1000}{4}$ gives:

$$\frac{15\left(-\frac{20}{3}\right)^2 + 200\left(-\frac{20}{3}\right) - 1000}{4} = \frac{15 \cdot \frac{400}{9} - \frac{4000}{3} - 1000}{4} = \frac{\frac{6000}{9} - \frac{4000}{3} - 1000}{4} = \frac{- \frac{2000}{3} - 1000}{4} = \frac{- \frac{2000 + 3000}{3}}{4} = \frac{-5000}{12} = -\frac{2500}{6}.$$

So, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is $-\frac{2500}{6}$. However, this doesn't make sense as the value of a quadratic expression should be non-negative. We must have made a mistake in our analysis.

Let's go back and re-examine our steps. We made a mistake in our substitution of $y = \frac{x - 20}{2}$. The correct substitution should be $y = \frac{20 - x}{2}$. Let's consider the two cases again:

1. If $x - 2y \geq 0$ and $-2y + x \geq 0$, then $|x - 2y| = x - 2y$ and $|-2y + x| = -2y + x$. The equation becomes $(x - 2y) + (-2y + x) = 40$, which simplifies to $2(x - 2y) = 40$, and further simplifies to $x - 2y = 20$.

2. If $x - 2y < 0$ and $-2y + x

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Rearranging the expression, we have  \[x^2+2x+y^2-4y+8\]Completing the square in $x$, we need to add and subtract $(2/2)^2=1$. Completing the square in $y$, we need to add and subtract $(4/2)^2=4$.

**Problem:** 
"What is the minimum value of the expression $2x^2+3y^2+8x-24y+62$ for real $x$ and $y$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Rearranging the expression, we have  \[2x^2+8x+3y^2-24y+62\]We first complete the square in $x$. Factoring a 2 from the first two terms of the expression, we get  \[2(x^2+4x)+3y^2-24y+62\]In order for the expression inside the parenthesis to be a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(4/2)^2=4$ inside the parenthesis. Doing this, we have \[2(x^2+4x+4-4)+3y^2-24y+62 \Rightarrow 2(x+2)^2+3y^2-24y+54\]Now we complete the square in $y$. Factoring a 3 from the $y$ terms in the expression, we get \[2(x+2)^2+3(y^2-8y)+54\]In order for the expression inside the second parenthesis to be a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(8/2)^2=16$ inside the parenthesis. Doing this, we have \[2(x+2)^2+3(y^2-8y+16-16)+54 \Rightarrow 2(x+2)^2+3(y-4)^2+6\]Since the minimum value of $2(x+2)^2$ and $3(y-4)^2$ is $0$ (perfect squares can never be negative), the minimum value of the entire expression is $\boxed{6}$, and is achieved when $x=-2$ and $y=4$. The answer is $\boxed{6}$

**Solution:** 



To solve this problem, we can use the AM-GM inequality (Arithmetic Mean - Geometric Mean inequality), which states that the arithmetic mean of a set of non-negative numbers is always greater than or equal to the geometric mean. 

We can rewrite the given expression as follows:
\[5x^2+5y^2-8xy = \frac{1}{2}((5x^2-8xy+5y^2) + (5x^2-8xy+5y^2))\]
\[= \frac{1}{2}((5x^2-8xy+5y^2) + (5x^2-8xy+5y^2))\]
\[= \frac{1}{2}(5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy + 5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy)\]
\[= \frac{1}{2}(10(x^2+y^2) - 16xy)\]
\[= 5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy\]

Now, we can apply the AM-GM inequality to the terms $x^2$ and $y^2$:
\[x^2 + y^2 \geq 2\sqrt{x^2y^2} = 2|xy|\]

So, we have:
\[5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy \geq 5(2|xy|) - 8xy = 10|xy| - 8xy\]

Now, we need to minimize the expression $10|xy| - 8xy$ subject to the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.

By the triangle inequality, we have:
\[|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |(x-2y) - (y-2x)| = |x-2y-y+2x| = |3x-3y| = 3|x-y|\]

So, we have:
\[3|x-y| = 40 \Rightarrow |x-y| = \frac{40}{3}\]

Now, let's consider the expression $10|xy| - 8xy$. We can rewrite it as:
\[10|xy| - 8xy = 2|xy|(5 - 4) = 2|xy|\]

To minimize $2|xy|$, we need to minimize $|xy|$. By the AM-GM inequality, we have:
\[|xy| \geq \sqrt{(x^2)(y^2)} = \sqrt{x^2y^2} = |xy|\]

So, we have:
\[|xy| \geq \left(\frac{x+y}{2}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{x+y}{2}\right)^2\]

By the triangle inequality, we have:
\[|x+y| \geq |x| - |y|\]

So, we have:
\[|xy| \geq \left(\frac{|x| - |y|}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{(|x|^2 - 2|x||y| + |y|^2)}{4} = \frac{|x|^2 - 2|x||y| + |y|^2}{4}\]

Now, we can apply the AM-GM inequality to the terms $|x|^2$ and $|y|^2$:
\[|x|^2 + |y|^2 \geq 2\sqrt{|x|^2|y|^2} = 2|xy|\]

So, we have:
\[|xy| \geq \frac{2|xy|}{4} = \frac{|xy|}{2}\]

Therefore, we have:
\[|xy| \geq \frac{1}{2}|xy|\]

So, we have:
\[|xy| \geq \frac{1}{2}|xy|\]

Now, we can substitute this back into the expression $2|xy|$:
\[2|xy| \geq 2\left(\frac{1}{2}|xy|\right) = |xy|\]

So, we have:
\[2|xy| \geq |xy|\]

Therefore, the minimum value of $2|xy| - 8xy$ is achieved when $|xy| = \frac{40}{3}$, and the minimum value is:
\[2\left(\frac{40}{3}\right) - 8\left(\frac{40}{3}\right) = \frac{80}{3} - \frac{320}{3} = -\frac{240}{3} = -80\]

However, this is not possible since we are looking for a minimum value of a non-negative expression. Therefore, we must have made a mistake in our calculations. Let's go back and check our work.

Upon revisiting our calculations, we realize that we made a mistake in our application of the AM-GM inequality. When we applied the AM-GM inequality to the terms $x^2$ and $y^2$, we should have applied it to the terms $|x^2|$ and $|y^2|$, not $x^2$ and $y^2$. 

So, let's correct our work:

We have:
\[|x^2 + y^2| \geq 2\sqrt{|x^2||y^2|} = 2|xy|\]

So, we have:
\[5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy \geq 5(2|xy|) - 8xy = 10|xy| - 8xy\]

Now, we need to minimize the expression $10|xy| - 8xy$ subject to the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.

By the triangle inequality, we have:
\[|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |(x-2y) - (y-2x)| = |x-2y-y+2x| = |3x-3y| = 3|x-y|\]

So, we have:
\[3|x-y| = 40 \Rightarrow |x-y| = \frac{40}{3}\]

Now, let's consider the expression $10|xy| - 8xy$. We can rewrite it as:
\[10|xy| - 8xy = 2|xy|(5 - 4) = 2|xy|\]

To minimize $2|xy|$, we need to minimize $|xy|$. By the AM-GM inequality, we have:
\[|xy| \geq \sqrt{|x^2||y^2|} = \sqrt{|x^2y^2|} = |xy|\]

So, we have:
\[|xy| \geq \left(\frac{|x| + |y|}{2}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{|x| + |y|}{2}\right)^2\]

By the triangle inequality, we have:
\[|x+y| \geq |x| - |y|\]

So, we have:
\[|xy| \geq \left(\frac{|x| - |y|}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{(|x|^2 - 2|x||y| + |y|^2)}{4} = \frac{|x|^2 - 2|x||y| + |y|^2}{4}\]

Now, we can apply the AM-GM inequality to the terms $|x|^2$ and $|y|^2$:
\[|x|^2 + |y|^2 \geq 2\sqrt{|x|^2|y|^2} = 2|xy|\]

So, we have:
\[|xy| \geq \frac{2|xy|}{4} = \frac{|xy|}{2}\]

Therefore, we have:
\[|xy| \geq \
