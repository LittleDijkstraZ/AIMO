**Problem:** 
"How many square units are in the area of the triangle whose vertices are the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the curve $y = (x-3)^2 (x+2)$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we need to find where this curve intersects the $x$ and $y$ axes.  If $y=0$, then $(x-3)^2(x+2)=0$, which has solutions of $x=3$ and $x=-2$.  If $x=0$, then $y=(-3)^2(2)=18$.  So, the curve has two $x$-intercepts and one $y$-intercept.  The length of the base along the $x$-axis is $3-(-2)=5$.  The height from this base is equal to the $y$-intercept, 18.  The area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 5\cdot 18=\boxed{45}$. The answer is $\boxed{45}$

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


This problem is a bit tricky due to the absolute value expressions and the fact that we are dealing with a polygon rather than a simple geometric shape. However, we can solve it by considering the properties of absolute value and the given equation.

The equation is of the form $(A \cdot B) = 0$, which implies that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. So we can break down the problem into two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first case, we have $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The absolute value equations can be split into two separate cases:

Case 1.1: $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$. Solving these two equations simultaneously gives $x = 10$ and $y = 0$.

Case 1.2: $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$. Solving these two equations simultaneously gives $x = -10$ and $y = 0$.

For the second case, we have $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The absolute value equations can be split into four separate cases:

Case 2.1: $x = 8$ and $y = 8$.

Case 2.2: $x = 8$ and $y = -8$.

Case 2.3: $x = -8$ and $y = 8$.

Case 2.4: $x = -8$ and $y = -8$.

So the polygon is a square with side length 20 (from case 1.1 to case 1.2 or from case 2.1 to case 2.4). The area of the square is $20^2 = 400$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 400. The answer is $\boxed{400}$.

## QUESTION 3 - 2

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"An ellipse is defined parametrically by
\[(x,y) = \left( \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t}, \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t} \right).\]Then the equation of the ellipse can be written in the form
\[Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0,\]where $A,$ $B,$ $C,$ $D,$ $E,$ and $F$ are integers, and $\gcd(|A|,|B|,|C|,|D|,|E|,|F|) = 1.$  Find $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F|.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
In the equation $y = \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\cos t$ to get
\[\cos t = \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3}.\]In the equation $x = \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\sin t$ to get
\[\sin t = \frac{1}{2} x (2 - \cos t) + 1 = \frac{1}{2} x \left( 2 - \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right) + 1 = 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)}.\]Since $\cos^2 t + \sin^2 t = 1,$
\[\left( \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right)^2 + \left( 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)} \right)^2 = 1.\]Multiplying both sides by $(2(y + 3))^2$ and expanding, it will simplify to
\[81x^2 - 36xy + 16y^2 - 108x + 240y + 900 = 0.\]Therefore, $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F| = 81 + 36 + 16 + 108 + 240 + 900 = \boxed{1381}.$ The answer is $\boxed{1381}$

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we need to find the area of the polygon enclosed by the points that satisfy the given equation. The equation is a product of two expressions, each of which equals to zero. Therefore, the points that satisfy the equation are the points that make either of the expressions equal to zero.

Let's break down the problem into steps:

1. Find the points that satisfy $|x + y| - 10 = 0$.
2. Find the points that satisfy $|x - y| - 10 = 0$.
3. Find the points that satisfy $|x| - 8 = 0$.
4. Find the points that satisfy $|y| - 8 = 0$.
5. The convex polygon is the union of the points found in steps 1 to 4.
6. Calculate the area of the convex polygon.

Now, let's implement these steps using Sympy:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Abs, solveset, S
from sympy.geometry import Polygon

def calculate_area():
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # Step 1: Find the points that satisfy |x + y| - 10 = 0
    equation1 = Abs(x + y) - 10
    solutions1 = solveset(equation1, (x, y), domain=S.Reals)

    # Step 2: Find the points that satisfy |x - y| - 10 = 0
    equation2 = Abs(x - y) - 10
    solutions2 = solveset(equation2, (x, y), domain=S.Reals)

    # Step 3: Find the points that satisfy |x| - 8 = 0
    equation3 = Abs(x) - 8
    solutions3 = solveset(equation3, x, domain=S.Reals)
    solutions3 = [(x_val, y) for x_val in solutions3 for y in solveset(Abs(y) - 8, y, domain=S.Reals)]

    # Step 4: Find the points that satisfy |y| - 8 = 0
    equation4 = Abs(y) - 8
    solutions4 = solveset(equation4, y, domain=S.Reals)
    solutions4 = [(x, y_val) for y_val in solutions4 for x in solveset(Abs(x) - 8, x, domain=S.Reals)]

    # Step 5: The convex polygon is the union of the points found in steps 1 to 4
    polygon_points = solutions1.union(solutions2).union(solutions3).union(solutions4)

    # Step 6: Calculate the area of the convex polygon
    polygon = Polygon(*polygon_points)
    area = polygon.area

    return area

result = calculate_area()
print(result)
```

I made a mistake in my code, the `solveset` function doesn't work like that. Let's try another way to solve this problem.

The equation can be simplified as follows:
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]
This equation is equivalent to the system of equations:
\[\begin{cases} (\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \\ (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \\ (\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \\ (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \end{cases}.\]
Solving each equation separately, we find the solutions:
\[\begin{cases} x + y = \pm 10 \\ x - y = \pm 10 \\ x = \pm 8 \\ y = \pm 8 \end{cases}.\]
These equations represent four lines in the plane: $x + y = \pm 10$, $x - y = \pm 10$, $x = \pm 8$, and $y = \pm 8$. The polygon enclosed by these lines is a square with side length 16. Therefore, the area of the polygon is $16^2 = 256$.

The answer is $\boxed{256}$.

It seems that the script is not working correctly. The error might be caused by the incorrect implementation of the equations. Let's try to solve the equations step by step.

For the equation $|x + y| = 10$, we have 4 cases:
1. $x + y = 10$
2. $x + y = -10$
3. $-x - y = 10$
4. $-x - y = -10$

Solving each case:

- For case 1: $x + y = 10$ and $x = 8$, we can substitute $x = 8$ into the equation to get $y = 2$. So the vertex is $(8, 2)$.
- For case 2: $x + y = -10$ and $x = 8$, we can substitute $x = 8$ into the equation to get $y = -18$. So the vertex is $(8, -18)$.
- For case 3: $-x - y = 10$ and $x = 8$, we can substitute $x = 8$ into the equation to get $-8 - y = 10$, so $y = -18$. So the vertex is $(8, -18)$.
- For case 4: $-x - y = -10$ and $x = 8$, we can substitute $x = 8$ into the equation to get $-8 - y = -10$, so $y = 2$. So the vertex is $(8, 2)$.

So the vertices of the polygon formed by $|x + y| = 10$ are $(8, 2)$ and $(8, -18)$.

Similarly, for the equation $|x - y| = 10$, we have 4 cases:
1. $x - y = 10$ and $y = 8$, we can substitute $y = 8$ into the equation to get $x = 18$. So the vertex is $(18, 8)$.
2. $x - y = -10$ and $y = 8$, we can substitute $y = 8$ into the equation to get $x = -2$. So the vertex is $(-2, 8)$.
3. $-x + y = 10$ and $y = 8$, we can substitute $y = 8$ into the equation to get $-x + 8 = 10$, so $x = -2$. So the vertex is $(-2, 8)$.
4. $-x + y = -10$ and $y = 8$, we can substitute $y = 8$ into the equation to get $-x + 8 = -10$, so $x = 18$. So the vertex is $(18, 8)$.

So the vertices of the polygon formed by $|x - y| = 10$ are $(18, 8)$ and $(-2, 8)$.

Now, we can calculate the area of the polygon formed by these vertices:

- The side formed by $(8, 2)$ and $(18, 8)$ has a length of $\sqrt{(18 - 8)^2 + (8 - 2)^2} = \sqrt{100 + 36} = \sqrt{136} = 2\sqrt{34}$.
- The side formed by $(8, -18)$ and $(-2, 8)$ has a length of $\sqrt{(-2 - 8)^2 + (8 - (-18))^2} = \sqrt{100 + 484} = \sqrt{584} = 2\sqrt{146}$.
- The side formed by $(8, 2)$ and $(-2, 8)$ has a length of $\sqrt{(-2 - 8)^2 + (8 - 2)^2} = \sqrt{100 + 36} = \sqrt{136} = 2\sqrt{34}$.
- The side formed by $(18, 8)$ and $(8, -18)$

**Problem:** 
"Let $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_ 2= (-16,2).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that
\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as

Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

**Solution:** 


The problem statement involves absolute value functions, which can be challenging to work with directly. Instead, we can consider four cases based on the signs of $x$ and $y$:

1. $x \geq 0$ and $y \geq 0$: In this case, $|x| = x$ and $|y| = y$. The equation becomes:
\[((\sqrt{(x + y)^2} - 10)^2 + (\sqrt{(x - y)^2} - 10)^2)((\sqrt{x^2} - 8)^2 + (\sqrt{y^2} - 8)^2) = 0.\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[((x + y - 10)^2 + (x - y - 10)^2)((x - 8)^2 + (y - 8)^2) = 0.\]

2. $x < 0$ and $y \geq 0$: In this case, $|x| = -x$ and $|y| = y$. The equation becomes:
\[(((-x + y) - 10)^2 + ((-x - y) - 10)^2)(((-x) - 8)^2 + (y - 8)^2) = 0.\]
Simplifying, we get the same equation as in case 1.

3. $x \geq 0$ and $y < 0$: In this case, $|x| = x$ and $|y| = -y$. The equation becomes:
\[(((x - (-y)) - 10)^2 + ((x + (-y)) - 10)^2)((x - 8)^2 + ((-y) - 8)^2) = 0.\]
Simplifying, we get the same equation as in case 1.

4. $x < 0$ and $y < 0$: In this case, $|x| = -x$ and $|y| = -y$. The equation becomes:
\[(((-x - (-y)) - 10)^2 + ((-x + (-y)) - 10)^2)(((-x) - 8)^2 + ((-y) - 8)^2) = 0.\]
Simplifying, we get the same equation as in case 1.

Thus, the four cases lead to the same equation:
\[((x + y - 10)^2 + (x - y - 10)^2)((x - 8)^2 + (y - 8)^2) = 0.\]
This equation represents the union of four squares with side lengths 16 and diagonals of length 20. The area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of these squares, which is $4 \times \left(\frac{16^2}{2}\right) = 512$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 512.
The answer is: $512$

**Solution:** 



This problem involves understanding the properties of absolute value and the zero product rule. The equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. We will analyze each case and find the corresponding regions in the coordinate plane.

The first expression is zero when $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x - y| - 10 = 0$. This gives us the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. The second expression is zero when $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$, which gives us the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$.

Now we need to analyze the intersections of these lines to determine the vertices of the polygon. The polygon is formed by the intersections of these lines:

- Intersection of $x + y = 10$ and $x = 8$ gives $(8, 2)$.
- Intersection of $x + y = 10$ and $y = 8$ gives $(2, 8)$.
- Intersection of $x + y = -10$ and $x = 8$ gives $(8, -18)$.
- Intersection of $x + y = -10$ and $y = 8$ gives $(2, -18)$.
- Intersection of $x - y = 10$ and $x = 8$ gives $(8, -2)$.
- Intersection of $x - y = 10$ and $y = 8$ gives $(18, 8)$.
- Intersection of $x - y = -10$ and $x = 8$ gives $(8, 18)$.
- Intersection of $x - y = -10$ and $y = 8$ gives $(-18, 8)$.

Now we have the vertices of the polygon: $(8, 2)$, $(2, 8)$, $(8, -18)$, $(2, -18)$, $(8, -2)$, $(18, 8)$, $(8, 18)$, and $(-18, 8)$.

The polygon is an octagon with vertices at these points. To find the area of the octagon, we can divide it into 8 congruent triangles, each with a base of 16 units and a height of 8 units. The area of each triangle is $\frac{1}{2} \times 16 \times 8 = 64$, and since there are 8 such triangles, the total area of the octagon is $8 \times 64 = 512$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 512 square units.

The answer is: $512$

## QUESTION 3 - 11 
- TIME_SPENT : 625 secs

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"An ellipse is defined parametrically by
\[(x,y) = \left( \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t}, \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t} \right).\]Then the equation of the ellipse can be written in the form
\[Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0,\]where $A,$ $B,$ $C,$ $D,$ $E,$ and $F$ are integers, and $\gcd(|A|,|B|,|C|,|D|,|E|,|F|) = 1.$  Find $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F|.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
In the equation $y = \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\cos t$ to get
\[\cos t = \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3}.\]In the equation $x = \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\sin t$ to get
\[\sin t = \frac{1}{2} x (2 - \cos t) + 1 = \frac{1}{2} x \left( 2 - \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right) + 1 = 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)}.\]Since $\cos^2 t + \sin^2 t = 1,$
\[\left( \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right)^2 + \left( 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)} \right)^2 = 1.\]Multiplying both sides by $(2(y + 3))^2$ and expanding, it will simplify to
\[81x^2 - 36xy + 16y^2 - 108x + 240y + 900 = 0.\]Therefore, $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F| = 81 + 36 + 16 + 108 + 240 + 900 = \boxed{1381}.$ The answer is $\boxed{1381}$

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



This problem requires us to find the area of a polygon defined by a set of points. The equation provided is a product of two terms, one of which is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, and the other of which is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. The product equals zero if either of these terms equals zero. 

Setting each term equal to zero gives us the following conditions:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations gives us the vertices of the polygon.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these four equations gives us the vertices of the polygon.

To find the vertices of the polygon, we can use the `solve` function from sympy. The `solve` function can handle absolute value equations, so we can directly solve for the vertices.

After finding the vertices, we can use the `Polygon` function from the `matplotlib` library to plot the polygon and calculate its area.

This is only possible when $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$. Similarly, the expression $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. 

So the points that satisfy the given equation are $(\pm 10, \pm 10)$ and $(\pm 8, \pm 8)$. These points form a square with side length 20. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$. So the area of the convex polygon is 400.

The solution to this problem is an integer, not an algebraic expression. Therefore, the final answer is $\boxed{400}$.

def area_of_polygon():
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # The points that satisfy the equation
    points = [(10, 10), (10, -10), (-10, 10), (-10, -10), (8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)]

    # The side length of the square
    side_length = max(abs(p[0] - q[0]) for p in points for q in points if abs(p[0] - q[0]) == abs(p[1] - q[1]))

    # The area of the square
    area = side_length**2

    return area

result = area_of_polygon()

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_ 2= (-16,2).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that
\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as
\[\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1.\]Find $h + k + a + b.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


This problem requires a bit of mathematical insight to solve it directly. However, we can use a Python library `polygon-area` to calculate the area of the polygon. The library takes the coordinates of the polygon's vertices as input.

The equation given in the problem, $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$, defines a polygon with vertices at the intersections of the lines $|x+y|=10$, $|x-y|=10$, $|x|=8$, and $|y|=8$. 

The lines $|x+y|=10$ and $|x-y|=10$ intersect at the points $(5,5)$ and $(-5,-5)$, $(5,-5)$ and $(-5,5)$. The lines $|x|=8$ and $|y|=8$ intersect at the points $(8,0)$, $(-8,0)$, $(0,8)$, and $(0,-8)$.

Therefore, the polygon is a square with side length 10 units. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.
