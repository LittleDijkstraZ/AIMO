**Problem:** 
"An ellipse is defined parametrically by
\[(x,y) = \left( \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t}, \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t} \right).\]Then the equation of the ellipse can be written in the form
\[Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0,\]where $A,$ $B,$ $C,$ $D,$ $E,$ and $F$ are integers, and $\gcd(|A|,|B|,|C|,|D|,|E|,|F|) = 1.$  Find $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F|.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
In the equation $y = \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\cos t$ to get
\[\cos t = \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3}.\]In the equation $x = \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\sin t$ to get
\[\sin t = \frac{1}{2} x (2 - \cos t) + 1 = \frac{1}{2} x \left( 2 - \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right) + 1 = 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)}.\]Since $\cos^2 t + \sin^2 t = 1,$
\[\left( \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right)^2 + \left( 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)} \right)^2 = 1.\]Multiplying both sides by $(2(y + 3))^2$ and expanding, it will simplify to
\[81x^2 - 36xy + 16y^2 - 108x + 240y + 900 = 0.\]Therefore, $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F| = 81 + 36 + 16 + 108 + 240 + 900 = \boxed{1381}.$ The answer is $\boxed{1381}$

To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



This problem involves the absolute value function, which is not available in Sympy. However, we can use a piecewise function to handle the absolute value.

First, we need to find the intersection points of the four equations:
1. $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x| - 8 = 0$
2. $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ and $|y| - 8 = 0$
3. $|x - y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x| - 8 = 0$
4. $|x - y| - 10 = 0$ and $|y| - 8 = 0$

We can solve these four systems of equations using the piecewise function in Sympy. Then, we will find the vertices of the polygon by calculating the intersection points of the lines formed by the intersection points.

Finally, we will use the shoelace formula to calculate the area of the polygon.

```python

def calculate_area():
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # Define piecewise functions for absolute value
    abs_x = Piecewise((x, x >= 0), (-x, x < 0))
    abs_y = Piecewise((y, y >= 0), (-y, y < 0))
    abs_x_plus_y = Piecewise((x + y, x + y >= 0), -(x + y), x + y < 0)
    abs_x_minus_y = Piecewise((x - y, x - y >= 0), -(x - y), x - y < 0)

    # Solve the equations
    solutions1 = solve([abs_x - 8, abs_x_plus_y - 10], (x, y))
    solutions2 = solve([abs_x - 8, abs_y - 8], (x, y))
    solutions3 = solve([abs_x_minus_y - 10, abs_x - 8], (x, y))
    solutions4 = solve([abs_x_minus_y - 10, abs_y - 8], (x, y))

    # Collect all solutions
    solutions = solutions1 + solutions2 + solutions3 + solutions4

    # Find the vertices of the polygon
    vertices = [(sol[x], sol[y]) for sol in solutions]

Sorry, the error was caused by a misunderstanding of the problem. The area of the polygon is actually the area of the square formed by the vertices of the polygon. Since the vertices are $(8,8)$, $(-8,8)$, $(-8,-8)$, and $(8,-8)$, the side length of the square is $16$, so the area is $16^2 = 256$.

The correct answer is: $256$.

**Problem:** 
"An ellipse is defined parametrically by

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


This problem is a bit tricky to solve directly. Let's first simplify the expression a bit.

We have the equation: $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

For this equation to be zero, either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.

If the first term is zero, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Adding these two equations gives $2x = \pm 20$, so $x = \pm 10$. Subtracting the second equation from the first gives $2y = \pm 20$, so $y = \pm 10$.

If the second term is zero, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

So, the points $\left(x, y\right)$ that satisfy the equation are: $\left(10, 0\right)$, $\left(-10, 0\right)$, $\left(0, 10\right)$, $\left(0, -10\right)$, $\left(8, 0\right)$, $\left(-8, 0\right)$, $\left(0, 8\right)$, and $\left(0, -8\right)$.

These points form a square with side length 20, so the area of the square is $20^2 = 400$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 400.
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    # The side length of the square is 20
    side_length = 20

    # The area of the square is side_length^2
    area = side_length**2

    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Find the number of 10-tuples $(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{10})$ of real numbers such that
\[(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2 = \frac{1}{11}.\]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,
\begin{align*}
&[(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + \dots + 1^2 + 1^2)][(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2] \\
&\ge [(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + (x_2 - x_3) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10}]^2 = 1.
\end{align*}From the given condition, we have equality, so by the equality condition for Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[\frac{1 - x_1}{1} = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{1} = \frac{x_2 - x_3}{1} = \dots = \frac{x_9 - x_{10}}{1} = \frac{x_{10}}{1}.\]Let
\[d = 1 - x_1 = x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_3 = \dots = x_9 - x_{10} = x_{10}.\]Then
\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so
\[(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_{10}) = \left( \frac{10}{11}, \frac{9}{11}, \frac{8}{11}, \dots, \frac{1}{11} \right).\]In particular, there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.
Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(8,2)$, $(8,-2)$, $(-8,2)$, and $(-8,-2)$.
Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
The polygon is a square with side length 16.
The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of the polygon is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is $\boxed{256}$.

**Solution:** 


The problem involves finding the area of a convex polygon defined by the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equation 
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$ 

The equation equals to zero if either of the two factors equals to zero. This gives us two sets of equations to solve:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For each set, we can solve the equations $(\vert x \pm y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ separately.

The equations $(\vert x \pm y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ imply that $\vert x \pm y \vert = 10$, and the equations $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ imply that $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

Solving these equations, we find the vertices of the polygon:
- For the first set of equations, the solutions are $(8, 2)$ and $(8, -2)$.
- For the second set of equations, the solutions are $(2, 8)$ and $(-2, 8)$.

Now we can draw the polygon and calculate its area. The polygon is a square with side length 8, so its area is $8^2 = 64$.

The answer is: $\boxed{64}$

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


The problem asks for the area of the convex polygon formed by the points that satisfy the equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

The equation is equal to zero if and only if either of the factors is zero. So, we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first case, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, this is only possible if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points must lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ or their opposites $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length 10 and diagonal 10*sqrt(2). The area of this square is $\frac{10^2 \times 10^2}{2} = 500$.

For the second case, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, this is only possible if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that the points must lie on the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$ or their opposites $x = -8$ and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length 16 and diagonal 16*sqrt(2). The area of this square is $\frac{16^2 \times 16^2}{2} = 1024$.

However, the intersection of these two cases is empty (there are no points that satisfy both equations at the same time), so the convex polygon formed by the union of the points from each case is simply the combination of the two squares. The area of the convex polygon is then the sum of the areas of the two squares, which is $500 + 1024 = 1524$.

The answer is $\boxed{1524}$.

\[\sin t = \frac{1}{2} x (2 - \cos t) + 1 = \frac{1}{2} x \left( 2 - \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right) + 1 = 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)}.\]Since $\cos^2 t + \sin^2 t = 1,$
\[\left( \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right)^2 + \left( 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)} \right)^2 = 1.\]Multiplying both sides by $(2(y + 3))^2$ and expanding, it will simplify to
\[81x^2 - 36xy + 16y^2 - 108x + 240y + 900 = 0.\]Therefore, $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F| = 81 + 36 + 16 + 108 + 240 + 900 = \boxed{1381}.$ The answer is $\boxed{1381}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The given equation is equal to 0, which means that either of the two terms must be equal to 0. This breaks down into four cases:

1. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.
2. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 \neq 0$.
3. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x \vert - 8 \neq 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.
4. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 \neq 0$ and $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.

For case 1, we have $x = 8$ and $y = 8$.
For cases 2 and 3, we have $x = 8$ and $-8 \leq y \leq 8$.
For case 4, we have $8 \leq x + y \leq 18$ and $x = 8$.

Plotting these points on the coordinate plane, we see that they form a square with side length 10. Therefore, the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is $\boxed{100}$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we first need to understand the given equation:
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]

The product of two factors equals zero if and only if at least one of the factors is zero. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to two systems of equations:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For each system, we have:

1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$.
2. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

Solving these equations, we get the four vertices of the polygon: $(8,0), (8,-16), (-8,0), (-8,16)$.

To find the area of the polygon, we can use the Shoelace formula. The Shoelace formula for the area of a polygon with vertices $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), \dots, (x_n, y_n)$ is given by:

\[A = \frac{1}{2} |(x_1y_2 + x_2y_3 + \dots + x_ny_1) - (y_1x_2 + y_2x_3 + \dots + y_nx_1)|.\]

Applying the Shoelace formula to the vertices $(8,0), (8,-16), (-8,0), (-8,16)$, we get:

\[A = \frac{1}{2} |(8 \cdot -16 + 8 \cdot 0 + -8 \cdot 0 + -8 \cdot 16) - (0 \cdot 8 + -16 \cdot -8 + 0 \cdot -8 + 16 \cdot 8)| = \frac{1}{2} |-128 - 128| = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 256 = 128.\]

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 128 square units. The answer is: $128$.

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


The problem involves absolute value functions, which can make it complicated to solve directly. However, we can simplify the problem by considering the definition of absolute value. The absolute value of a number is either positive or zero. So, the product of two absolute values will be zero if and only if at least one of the absolute values is zero. This gives us several cases to consider.

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10 \Rightarrow x + y = 10 \text{ or } x + y = -10$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x - y \vert = 10 \Rightarrow x - y = 10 \text{ or } x - y = -10$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8 \Rightarrow x = 8 \text{ or } x = -8$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert y \vert = 8 \Rightarrow y = 8 \text{ or } y = -8$.

We can combine these cases to find the vertices of the polygon. For example, if $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, then $x = 10$ and $y = 0$. Similarly, we can find the other vertices by combining the cases. The vertices of the polygon are $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(2, 8)$, $(-2, 8)$, $(2, -8)$, and $(-2, -8)$.

The polygon is a square with side length 16. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: 256
