**Problem:** 
"The graph of $y=ax^2 + bx + c$ is a parabola with vertical axis of symmetry.  The vertex of this parabola is $(2,3)$ and the parabola contains the point $(4,4)$.  Find the value of $y$ when $x=6$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Because the parabola has vertex $(2,3)$, it is the graph of  \[y=a(x-2)^2+3\] for some number $a$.  In order for the graph to contain the point $(4,4)$, we must also have  \[4=a(4-2)^2+3=4a+3,\] so $a=\frac14$, and our parabola is the graph of \[y=\frac14(x-2)^2 + 3.\] Setting $x=6$ in this gives us  \[y = \frac14(6-2)^2 + 3 = 4+3=\boxed{7}.\] The answer is $\boxed{7}$

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



First, let's find the $x$-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$. Since the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$, we can set $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$ and solve for $x$. 

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solve, sqrt

def find_x_coordinates():
    x, k, l = symbols('x k l')
    equation = k*x**2 - 2*k*x + l - 4
    solutions = solve(equation, x)
    return solutions

solutions = find_x_coordinates()

```

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
[(k - sqrt(k*(k - l + 4)))/k, (k + sqrt(k*(k - l + 4)))/k]
```
Let's denote the solutions as $x_1$ and $x_2$, where $x_1 = \frac{k - \sqrt{k(k - l + 4)}}{k}$ and $x_2 = \frac{k + \sqrt{k(k - l + 4)}}{k}$. According to the problem, the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, so $|x_2 - x_1| = 6$. We can write this as $\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2} = 6$, or $\sqrt{\left(\frac{2\sqrt{k(k - l + 4)}}{k}\right)^2} = 6$. Simplifying, we get $\frac{2\sqrt{k(k - l + 4)}}{k} = 6$, or $\sqrt{k(k - l + 4)} = 3k$. Squaring both sides, we get $k(k - l + 4) = 9k^2$, or $k - l + 4 = 9k$, or $l = 8k - 4$.

Now, let's find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. For point $A$, this is $\sqrt{x_1^2 + (k*x_1^2 - 2*k*x_1 + l)^2}$. Similarly, for point $B$, this is $\sqrt{x_2^2 + (k*x_2^2 - 2*k*x_2 + l)^2}$. The sum of the squares of these distances is then $d_A^2 + d_B^2$.

**Problem:** 
"Find the distance between the vertex of the graph of the equation $y=x^2 + 2x - 6 $ and the point $(4, 5)$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Completing the square, we get $y=(x + 1)^2 - 7 $. The vertex of the graph of this equation is thus $(-1, -7)$.The distance between $(4, 5)$ and $(-1, -7)$ is $\sqrt{(4-(-1))^2 + (5-(-7))^2} = \sqrt{25+144} =\boxed{13}$. The answer is $\boxed{13}$

The simplified expression for the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is still the same as the original expression. This indicates that the expression is already in its simplest form. Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $\frac{(|\sqrt{k} - \sqrt{k - l + 4}|^2 + |\sqrt{k} + \sqrt{k - l + 4}|^2)}{k}$. However, this expression is not a numerical value. To find the numerical value, we need to substitute the values of $k$ and $l$ that satisfy the conditions of the problem.

Unfortunately, the problem does not provide enough information to uniquely determine the values of $k$ and $l$. Therefore, we cannot compute the numerical value of the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin without additional information.

However, we can provide a general expression for the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin in terms of $k$ and $l$. The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $\frac{(|\sqrt{k} - \sqrt{k - l + 4}|^2 + |\sqrt{k} + \sqrt{k - l + 4}|^2)}{k}$. This expression is a general formula that can be used to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin for any given values of $k$ and $l$ that satisfy the conditions of the problem.

In conclusion, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $\frac{(|\sqrt{k} - \sqrt{k - l + 4}|^2 + |\sqrt{k} + \sqrt{k - l + 4}|^2)}{k}$. However, without additional information, we cannot compute the numerical value of this expression. The expression itself is a general formula that can be used to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin for any given values of $k$ and $l$ that satisfy the conditions of the problem.

The answer is: $\frac{(|\sqrt{k} - \sqrt{k - l + 4}|^2 + |\sqrt{k} + \sqrt{k - l + 4}|^2)}{k}$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $\mathcal{P}$ be the parabola in the plane determined by the equation $y = x^2.$  Suppose a circle $\mathcal{C}$ intersects $\mathcal{P}$ at four distinct points.  If three of these points are $(-28,784),$ $(-2,4),$ and $(13,169),$ find the sum of the distances from the focus of $\mathcal{P}$ to all four of the intersection points."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Let the four intersection points be $(a,a^2),$ $(b,b^2),$ $(c,c^2),$ and $(d,d^2).$  Let the equation of the circle be
\[(x - k)^2 + (y - h)^2 = r^2.\]Substituting $y = x^2,$ we get
\[(x - k)^2 + (x^2 - h)^2 = r^2.\]Expanding this equation, we get a fourth degree polynomial whose roots are $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ and $d.$  Furthermore, the coefficient of $x^3$ is 0, so by Vieta's formulas, $a + b + c + d = 0.$

We are given that three intersection points are $(-28,784),$ $(-2,4),$ and $(13,196),$ so the fourth root is $-((-28) + (-2) + 13) = 17.$

The distance from the focus to a point on the parabola is equal to the distance from the point to the directrix, which is $y = -\frac{1}{4}.$  Thus, the sum of the distances is
\[784 + \frac{1}{4} + 4 + \frac{1}{4} + 169 + \frac{1}{4} + 17^2 + \frac{1}{4} = \boxed{1247}.\] The answer is $\boxed{1247}$
