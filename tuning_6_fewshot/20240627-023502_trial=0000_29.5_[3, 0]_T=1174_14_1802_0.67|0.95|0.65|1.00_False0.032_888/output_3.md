**Problem:** 
"Let $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_ 2= (-16,2).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that
\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as
\[\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1.\]Find $h + k + a + b.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

The first term is zero when $|x+y| = 10$ or $|x-y| = 10$. These are the equations of two lines passing through the origin making angles of 45 and 135 degrees with the x-axis.

The second term is zero when $|x| = 8$ or $|y| = 8$. These are the equations of two lines passing through the origin making angles of 0, 90, 180, and 270 degrees with the x-axis.

The intersection points of these lines are the vertices of the polygon. By calculating the intersection points, we find that the vertices of the polygon are $(0,0)$, $(8,0)$, $(0,8)$, $(8,8)$, $(-8,0)$, $(0,-8)$, $(-8,-8)$, and $(0, -8)$.

The polygon is a square with side length 8. The area of the square is $8^2 = 64$.
The answer is $\boxed{64}$.

The area of the convex polygon is $1096$. However, this is not the correct answer. The error in the code is in the calculation of the area of the triangles. The correct approach to calculate the area of the polygon is to use the Shoelace formula. The Shoelace formula is a method for calculating the area of a polygon given the coordinates of its vertices. The Shoelace formula states that if the vertices of a polygon are $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), \ldots, (x_n, y_n)$ in counterclockwise order, then its area is given by
\[A = \frac{1}{2} |(x_1y_2 + x_2y_3 + \cdots + x_ny_1) - (y_1x_2 + y_2x_3 + \cdots + y_nx_1)|.\]

Let's correct the code to use the Shoelace formula:

```python

```
It seems like there is a mistake in the code. The error is in the calculation of the area using the Shoelace formula. The error is due to the fact that the Shoelace formula is not applicable to the given problem. The Shoelace formula is used to calculate the area of a polygon given the coordinates of its vertices. However, in this problem, the vertices of the polygon are not given explicitly, but are instead the solutions of the equations. The Shoelace formula cannot be directly applied to the solutions of the equations.

The correct approach to solve this problem is to recognize that the given equation defines a set of points that form a 8-pointed star. The vertices of the star are the solutions of the equations. Each pair of adjacent vertices forms a right triangle with legs of length 16 (the distance between the vertices of the form (8, y) or (x, 8)) and a hypotenuse of length 20 (the distance between the vertices of the form (10, y) or (x, 10)). Therefore, each triangle is a 3-4-5 right triangle, and its area is 0.5 * 16 * 12 = 96. Since there are 8 such triangles in the star, the total area of the polygon is 8 * 96 = 768.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 768.
The answer is $\boxed{768}$.

**Solution:** 


The problem asks for the area of a polygon formed by the points that satisfy the given equation. The equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. The only way for the product of two numbers to be zero is if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square formed by the points $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(20, 0)$, and $(-20, 0)$.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square formed by the points $(8, 0)$, $(-8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, and $(0, -8)$.

Therefore, the polygon formed by the points that satisfy the given equation is the union of these two squares. The side length of each square is 20, so the area of each square is $20^2 = 400$. Since the polygon is the union of two squares, its area is $2 \times 400 = 800$.

The answer is: $800$

**Solution:** 


First, let's understand the problem. We are given an equation and we need to find the area of the region enclosed by the points that satisfy this equation. The equation is a bit complex, but we can simplify it by analyzing the conditions for the equation to be zero.

The equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So, this equation is zero if either:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, or
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first condition to be true, both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These conditions define a square with side length 10 units.

For the second condition to be true, both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These conditions define a square with side length 16 units.

The intersection of these two squares is the region we are interested in, which is a square with side length 10 units. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. So, the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units.

The answer is: $100$

**Solution:** 


The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the square as $(5, 5)$, $(5, -5)$, $(-5, 5)$, and $(-5, -5)$.

Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So the vertices of the square are $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The intersection of these two squares is a smaller square with side length 6 (the difference between 8 and 2), and its vertices are $(3, 3)$, $(3, -3)$, $(-3, 3)$, and $(-3, -3)$.

The area of the smaller square is $6^2 = 36$. The answer is: $36$

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is defined as:

$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$

This equation is equal to zero if and only if either of the two terms is equal to zero. Therefore, we have two sets of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first set of equations, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$. Similarly, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = 8$ or $x = -8$ and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. Combining these results, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

For the second set of equations, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$. Similarly, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = 8$ or $x = -8$ and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. Combining these results, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

Thus, the polygon is a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

The answer is: $256$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_ 2= (-16,2).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that
\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as
\[\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1.\]Find $h + k + a + b.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Abs, Piecewise, simplify

def area_of_polygon():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # Define the piecewise function
    f = Piecewise((Abs(x + y) - 10, Abs(x - y) - 10), (0, True)) * (Abs(x) - 8)**2 * (Abs(y) - 8)**2

    # Set up the equation
    equation = f

    # Solve the equation to get the points that satisfy it
    solutions = solve(equation, (x, y))

    # Calculate the area of the polygon formed by these points
    area = abs(sum([solutions[i][0]*solutions[i+1][1] - solutions[i+1][0]*solutions[i][1] for i in range(len(solutions))])) / 2

    # Simplify the area
    area = simplify(area)

    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

It seems there was an error in the code. Let's try to solve the problem again.

The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. The product of two factors equals zero if and only if at least one of the factors is zero. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The first equation implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which are only satisfied by the points on a square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$. The second equation implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which are only satisfied by the points on a square with side length $16$.

Therefore, the points that satisfy the given equation form a $16 \times 16$ square, and its area is $16^2 = 256$. So the area of the convex polygon is $256$.

The answer is: $256$
