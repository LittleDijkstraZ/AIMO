**Problem:** 
"Let $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_ 2= (-16,2).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that
\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as
\[\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1.\]Find $h + k + a + b.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The problem involves the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. The solutions to this equation are the points where at least one of the factors is zero.

The first factor is zero if and only if both $|x+y| = 10$ and $|x-y| = 10$. These are the equations of two squares with side length 10, centered at the origin, one with slope $+1$ and the other with slope $-1$. The intersection of these two squares is a square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$ and area $200$.

The second factor is zero if and only if both $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. These are the equations of two squares with side length 8, centered at the origin, one in the $x$ direction and the other in the $y$ direction. The intersection of these two squares is a square with side length 8 and area 64.

Therefore, the points that satisfy the given equation are those that lie in the square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$, but not in the square with side length 8 (which is inside the larger square). The area of the convex polygon enclosed by these points is the area of the larger square minus the area of the smaller square, which is $200 - 64 = 136$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 136. The answer is: $136$

The corrected script is still not giving the correct area. Let's analyze the equations:

The equations $|x+y|-10=0$, $|x-y|-10=0$, $|x|-8=0$, and $|y|-8=0$ represent four lines in the plane. The first two equations represent lines of slope $\pm1$ and passing through $(0, \pm10)$ and $(\pm10, 0)$. The last two equations represent lines of slope $0$ and passing through $(\pm8, 0)$ and $(0, \pm8)$. These lines form a square with side length $20$ and vertices at $(\pm8, 8)$, $(\pm8, -8)$, $(8, \pm8)$, and $(-8, \pm8)$.

The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $400$.

The correct answer is 400.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The given equation is satisfied if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = \pm 10$.
If $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x - y = \pm 10$.
If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$, which implies $x = \pm 8$.
If $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $y = \pm 8$.
The solutions to these equations are the vertices of the polygon:
$\{(8, 2), (8, -2), (-8, 2), (-8, -2), (2, 8), (-2, 8), (2, -8), (-2, -8)\}$.
These points form a square with side length 16.
The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.
So the area of the convex polygon is 256.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 To solve this problem, we first need to understand the given equation and the constraints it imposes on the values of $x$ and $y$.
The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is equal to zero if and only if both of its factors are equal to zero.
The factor $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
The factor $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
From the first set of conditions, we have $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$, which gives us four lines $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.
From the second set of conditions, we have $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$, which gives us four lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,
\begin{align*}
&[(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + \dots + 1^2 + 1^2)][(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2] \\

\end{align*}From the given condition, we have equality, so by the equality condition for Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[\frac{1 - x_1}{1} = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{1} = \frac{x_2 - x_3}{1} = \dots = \frac{x_9 - x_{10}}{1} = \frac{x_{10}}{1}.\]Let
\[d = 1 - x_1 = x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_3 = \dots = x_9 - x_{10} = x_{10}.\]Then
\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so
\[(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_{10}) = \left( \frac{10}{11}, \frac{9}{11}, \frac{8}{11}, \dots, \frac{1}{11} \right).\]In particular, there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, which means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. Let's analyze each term separately:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which further implies that $x + y = \pm 10$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which further implies that $x - y = \pm 10$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$, which further implies that $x = \pm 8$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert y \vert = 8$, which further implies that $y = \pm 8$.

The solutions to the first two equations form a square with side length $20$ (the sum or difference of two numbers equal to $10$), and the solutions to the last two equations form another square with side length $16$ (the absolute value of a number equal to $8$). The intersection of these two squares is a square with side length $8$ (the absolute value of a number equal to $8$ and the sum or difference of two numbers equal to $10$), which is contained within the larger square. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of the larger square minus the area of the smaller square, which is $20^2 - 8^2 = 400 - 64 = 336$. 

The answer is $\boxed{336}$.

"Let $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_ 2= (-16,2).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that
\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as
\[\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1.\]Find $h + k + a + b.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The equation $f(x, y) = 0$ if and only if either $g(x, y) = (\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $h(x, y) = (\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. $g(x, y) = 0$ if and only if $(x, y) = (0, 0)$, and $h(x, y) = 0$ if and only if $(x, y) = (5, 5)$ or $(x, y) = (-5, -5)$. Therefore, the equation $f(x, y) = 0$ if and only if $(x, y)$ is one of the four points $(0, 0)$, $(5, 5)$, $(-5, -5)$, and $(0, 0)$. These four points form a square with side length $10$, so the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $\boxed{100}$

## QUESTION 3 - 13

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Find the number of 10-tuples $(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{10})$ of real numbers such that
\[(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2 = \frac{1}{11}.\]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,
\begin{align*}
&[(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + \dots + 1^2 + 1^2)][(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2] \\
&\ge [(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + (x_2 - x_3) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10}]^2 = 1.
\end{align*}From the given condition, we have equality, so by the equality condition for Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[\frac{1 - x_1}{1} = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{1} = \frac{x_2 - x_3}{1} = \dots = \frac{x_9 - x_{10}}{1} = \frac{x_{10}}{1}.\]Let
\[d = 1 - x_1 = x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_3 = \dots = x_9 - x_{10} = x_{10}.\]Then
\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so
\[(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_{10}) = \left( \frac{10}{11}, \frac{9}{11}, \frac{8}{11}, \dots, \frac{1}{11} \right).\]In particular, there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we first note that the expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if at least one of the factors is zero. Therefore, we can set each factor equal to zero and solve for the possible values of $(x, y)$.

1. Set $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. The two cases we need to consider are $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.
2. Set $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This means $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The two cases we need to consider are $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.
3. Set $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This means $\vert x \vert = 8$. The two cases we need to consider are $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.
4. Set $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This means $\vert y \vert = 8$. The two cases we need to consider are $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

By considering all possible combinations of these cases, we can find the vertices of the polygon.

After finding the vertices, we can use the shoelace formula to compute the area of the polygon.

Finally, we can verify that the polygon is indeed convex by checking that all interior angles are less than 180 degrees.

The numerical answer is $\boxed{512}$.
