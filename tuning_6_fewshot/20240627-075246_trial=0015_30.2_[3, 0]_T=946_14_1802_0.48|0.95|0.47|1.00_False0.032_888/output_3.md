**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Find the number of 10-tuples $(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{10})$ of real numbers such that
\[(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2 = \frac{1}{11}.\]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,
\begin{align*}
&[(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + \dots + 1^2 + 1^2)][(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2] \\
&\ge [(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + (x_2 - x_3) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10}]^2 = 1.
\end{align*}From the given condition, we have equality, so by the equality condition for Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[\frac{1 - x_1}{1} = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{1} = \frac{x_2 - x_3}{1} = \dots = \frac{x_9 - x_{10}}{1} = \frac{x_{10}}{1}.\]Let
\[d = 1 - x_1 = x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_3 = \dots = x_9 - x_{10} = x_{10}.\]Then
\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so
\[(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_{10}) = \left( \frac{10}{11}, \frac{9}{11}, \frac{8}{11}, \dots, \frac{1}{11} \right).\]In particular, there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we first need to understand the conditions given in the equation. The equation is equal to zero if either of the two terms inside the product is zero. Therefore, we have three cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
3. A combination of the above two cases.

For the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$.

For the second case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that the points lie on the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$.

The intersection of these lines form a square with side length 10 (from the first case) and vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many square units are in the area of the triangle whose vertices are the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the curve $y = (x-3)^2 (x+2)$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we need to find where this curve intersects the $x$ and $y$ axes.  If $y=0$, then $(x-3)^2(x+2)=0$, which has solutions of $x=3$ and $x=-2$.  If $x=0$, then $y=(-3)^2(2)=18$.  So, the curve has two $x$-intercepts and one $y$-intercept.  The length of the base along the $x$-axis is $3-(-2)=5$.  The height from this base is equal to the $y$-intercept, 18.  The area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 5\cdot 18=\boxed{45}$. The answer is $\boxed{45}$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_ 2= (-16,2).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that
\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as
\[\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1.\]Find $h + k + a + b.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. 

The first expression is zero when either $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x-y| - 10 = 0$. This implies that $|x+y| = 10$ or $|x-y| = 10$. These are the equations of two lines in the plane, so they form a rectangle.

The second expression is zero when either $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$. This implies that $|x| = 8$ or $|y| = 8$. These are the equations of two lines in the plane, so they form a square.

The intersection of the rectangle and the square is the convex polygon we are looking for. The side length of the square is 16 (since $|x| = 8$ implies $-8 \leq x \leq 8$), and the length and width of the rectangle are 20 (since $|x+y| = 10$ implies $-10 \leq x+y \leq 10$, and $|x-y| = 10$ implies $-10 \leq x-y \leq 10$).

The area of the rectangle is length times width, so its area is $20 \times 20 = 400$. The area of the square is side length squared, so its area is $16 \times 16 = 256$.

The convex polygon is the intersection of the rectangle and the square, so its area is the area of the rectangle minus the area of the square, which is $400 - 256 = 144$.

"How many square units are in the area of the triangle whose vertices are the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the curve $y = (x-3)^2 (x+2)$?"

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we need to find where this curve intersects the $x$ and $y$ axes.  If $y=0$, then $(x-3)^2(x+2)=0$, which has solutions of $x=3$ and $x=-2$.  If $x=0$, then $y=(-3)^2(2)=18$.  So, the curve has two $x$-intercepts and one $y$-intercept.  The length of the base along the $x$-axis is $3-(-2)=5$.  The height from this base is equal to the $y$-intercept, 18.  The area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 5\cdot 18=\boxed{45}$. The answer is $\boxed{45}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


This problem involves understanding the properties of absolute value and how it interacts with equations. The equation given is a product of two terms equal to zero, which means either term must be zero. This gives us four cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For each of these cases, we can solve for $x$ and $y$:

1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10 \implies x + y = \pm 10$
2. $\vert x - y \vert = 10 \implies x - y = \pm 10$
3. $\vert x \vert = 8 \implies x = \pm 8$
4. $\vert y \vert = 8 \implies y = \pm 8$

These equations describe the lines forming the vertices of the polygon. By analyzing these lines, we can determine the vertices of the polygon:

- For $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, the lines are $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.
- For $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, the lines are $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.
- For $\vert x \vert = 8$, the lines are $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.
- For $\vert y \vert = 8$, the lines are $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

By plotting these lines, we can see that the vertices of the polygon are:

- $(8, 2)$, $(8, -10)$, $(-8, 10)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(2, 8)$, $(-10, -8)$, $(10, 8)$, $(-2, -8)$.

The polygon is an octagon. To find the area of the octagon, we can divide it into eight congruent triangles, each with base 16 and height 8. The area of each triangle is $\frac{1}{2} \times 16 \times 8 = 64$, so the total area of the octagon is $8 \times 64 = 512$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 512 square units. The answer is: 512

\[\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1.\]Find $h + k + a + b.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we first need to understand the given equation and the conditions that it imposes on the points $(x, y)$. The equation is a product of two terms, each of which is a sum of squares of absolute values. The product is zero if and only if at least one of the terms is zero. 

1. If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = \pm 10$.
2. If $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x - y = \pm 10$.
3. If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$, which implies $x = \pm 8$.
4. If $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $y = \pm 8$.

The solutions from 1 and 2 form a square with side length $20$, and the solutions from 3 and 4 also form a square with side length $16$. The intersection of these two squares is the set of points that satisfy both conditions. This intersection is a smaller square with side length $8$, which is the convex polygon we are looking for.

The area of this convex polygon is the square of the side length, which is $8^2 = 64$. So the area of the convex polygon is $64$. The answer is: $64$

Assistant:

 The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied only when both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ are zero, or both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2$ are zero. This means that the points that satisfy the equation are either on the lines $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$. These lines form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

The answer is: $256$

**Solution:** 


This problem requires a careful reading of the conditions given in the problem. The condition is equivalent to the statement that at least one of the two factors must be zero. Thus, either $|x + y| - 10 = 0$, $|x - y| - 10 = 0$, $|x| - 8 = 0$, or $|y| - 8 = 0$.

The solutions to $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ are given by $x + y = \pm 10$. The solutions to $|x - y| - 10 = 0$ are given by $x - y = \pm 10$. The solutions to $|x| - 8 = 0$ are given by $x = \pm 8$. The solutions to $|y| - 8 = 0$ are given by $y = \pm 8$.

These lines form a square with side length $16$. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is $256$.

The code above is not able to calculate the area of the polygon because it is not handling the absolute value function correctly. The absolute value function makes the equation non-linear and thus the sympy library is not able to solve it.

Let's try a different approach to solve this problem. The condition given in the problem is equivalent to the statement that at least one of the two factors must be zero. Thus, either $|x + y| - 10 = 0$, $|x - y| - 10 = 0$, $|x| - 8 = 0$, or $|y| - 8 = 0$.

The solutions to $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ are given by $x + y = \pm 10$. The solutions to $|x - y| - 10 = 0$ are given by $x - y = \pm 10$. The solutions to $|x| - 8 = 0$ are given by $x = \pm 8$. The solutions to $|y| - 8 = 0$ are given by $y = \pm 8$.

These lines form a square with side length $16$. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is $256$.

The answer is: $256$
