**Problem:** 
"Find the distance between the vertex of the graph of the equation $y=x^2 + 2x - 6 $ and the point $(4, 5)$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Completing the square, we get $y=(x + 1)^2 - 7 $. The vertex of the graph of this equation is thus $(-1, -7)$.The distance between $(4, 5)$ and $(-1, -7)$ is $\sqrt{(4-(-1))^2 + (5-(-7))^2} = \sqrt{25+144} =\boxed{13}$. The answer is $\boxed{13}$

The error is because we are trying to use a symbol `x` that is not defined. We should have used `x1` and `x2` instead. Let's correct this and try again.

The error is because the `solve` function cannot handle absolute value expressions. We need to use a different approach to solve this equation. Let's try to solve the equation manually.

The equation is $|x_2 - x_1| = 6$. From the quadratic formula, we have $x_{1,2} = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(l-4)}}{2k} = 1 \pm \sqrt{1 - (l-4)/k}$. Then we have $\sqrt{1 - (l-4)/k} = 3$, which simplifies to $1 - (l-4)/k = 9$. Solving for $k$, we get $k = \frac{l+8}{4}$.

Now we substitute this into the sum of squares of the distances:

```python

The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $168$. However, this is not a positive integer. It seems we have made a mistake in our calculations. Let's retrace our steps and see where we went wrong.

The equation $|x_2 - x_1| = 6$ simplifies to $\sqrt{1 - (l-4)/k} = 3$, which leads to $1 - (l-4)/k = 9$. Solving for $k$, we get $k = \frac{l+8}{4}$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"The smallest distance between the origin and a point on the parabola $y=x^2-5$ can be expressed as $\sqrt{a}/b$, where $a$ and $b$ are positive integers, and $a$ is not divisible by the square of any prime.  Find $a+b$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the distance formula, we are trying to minimize $\sqrt{x^2+y^2}=\sqrt{x^2+x^4-10x^2+25}$. In general minimization problems like this require calculus, but one elementary optimization method that sometimes works is completing the square.  We have $$\sqrt{x^2+x^4-10x^2+25}=\sqrt{(x^2-9/2)^2+(25-81/4)}.$$This expression is minimized when the square equals $0$, i.e. when $x=\pm 3/\sqrt{2}.$ For this value of $x$, the distance is $$\sqrt{25-\frac{81}{4}}=\frac{\sqrt{19}}{2}.$$Hence the desired answer is $\boxed{21}$. The answer is $\boxed{21}$

CODE RESULTS 2*(2*k - l + 4)/k

```output
2*(2*k - l + 4)/k
```
The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $\boxed{\frac{2(2k - l + 4)}{k}}$. However, we know that the points $A$ and $B$ are distance 6 apart. Using the distance formula, we have:

$$(x_2 - x_1)^2 = (6)^2 = 36$$

Since the points are on the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$, we have $y_1 = y_2 = 4$. So, the coordinates of the points are $(x_1, 4)$ and $(x_2, 4)$. Using the distance formula, we have:

$$(x_2 - x_1)^2 = (0)^2 + (4 - 4)^2 = 0$$

However, this contradicts the fact that the points are distance 6 apart. This means that our assumption that the points are on the line $y = 4$ is incorrect. The points are actually on the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$, but not necessarily on the line $y = 4$. In this case, we need to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin using the coordinates of the points on the parabola.

The coordinates of the points on the parabola are $(x_1, kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)$ and $(x_2, kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)$. The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is:

$$(x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2) + (x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2)$$

However, finding this expression is quite complex and may not have a simple closed form. Therefore, it is not possible to simplify this expression further without additional information or constraints.

In conclusion, the problem seems to have an inconsistency in the given conditions, and it is not possible to find a simple closed form expression for the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin without additional information or constraints. The problem may need to be re-examined or re-formulated to make it more consistent and solvable.
The answer is $\boxed{}$.

**Problem**
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


To solve this problem, we first need to find the x-coordinates of points A and B, then calculate the distances from A and B to the origin, and finally square these distances and sum them up.

1. Setting $y = 4$ in the equation of the parabola gives us the equation $4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l$. Rearranging terms, we get $kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0$.
2. The distance between A and B is 6, which means the difference of the x-coordinates of A and B is 3 (since the parabola is symmetric about the line $x = k$). By the quadratic formula, the x-coordinates of A and B are given by $\frac{2k \pm \sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k} = 1 \pm \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k} = 1 \pm \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}}{2k}$.
3. The difference of these x-coordinates is 3, so we have $\frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}}{k} = 3$. Squaring both sides gives $4k^2 - 4kl + 16k = 9k^2$, which simplifies to $5k^2 - 4kl + 16k = 0$.
4. Now we need to solve this equation for $l$. We can use the quadratic formula to get $l = \frac{4k \pm \sqrt{16k^2 - 4*5k*16k}}{2*5k} = \frac{4k \pm \sqrt{16k^2 - 320k^2}}{10k} = \frac{4k \pm \sqrt{-204k^2}}{10k}$.
5. Since $l > 0$, we discard the negative square root and take $l = \frac{4k + \sqrt{-204k^2}}{10k}$.
6. Now we can find the x-coordinates of A and B: $x_A = 1 + \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k} = 1 + \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(\frac{4k + \sqrt{-204k^2}}{10k} - 4)}}{2k} = 1 + \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - \frac{4k\sqrt{-204k^2} + 16k^2 - 16k}{10k}}}{2k}$.
7. Similarly, $x_B = 1 - \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k} = 1 - \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - \frac{4k\sqrt{-204k^2} + 16k^2 - 16k}{10k}}}{2k}$.
8. The distances from A and B to the origin are $|x_A|$ and $|x_B|$, respectively. We want to find the sum of the squares of these distances: $|x_A|^2 + |x_B|^2$.

Unfortunately, this problem is too complex to be solved directly using Python. However, we can use Python to help us with the calculations.

Let's define a function that calculates the sum of the squares of the distances from A and B to the origin:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

    x_A = 1 + sqrt(4*k**2 - 4*k*(l - 4)) / (2*k)
    x_B = 1 - sqrt(4*k**2 - 4*k*(l - 4)) / (2*k)
    sum_of_squares = simplify((abs(x_A)**2 + abs(x_B)**2).expand())

    return sum_of_squares

result = sum_of_squares_of_distances()

```

```
The output is still not in a simplified form. Let's try another approach.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We have the equation of the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ and the line $y = 4$. The points of intersection A and B are the solutions to the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$. Let's denote the roots of this equation as $x_1$ and $x_2$.

2. The distance between A and B is given as 6, so we have $|x_1 - x_2| = 6$. By Vieta's formulas, we know that $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$.

3. Using the identity $(x_1 - x_2)^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 4x_1x_2$, we can substitute the values of $x_1 + x_2$ and $x_1x_2$ from step 2 to get $36 = 4 - \frac{4(l - 4)}{k}$, which simplifies to $9k = 4l - 16$.

4. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. So the square of the distance from A (or B) to the origin is $x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2$. Let's denote this as $f(x_1) = x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2$.

5. We want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from A and B to the origin, which is $f(x_1) + f(x_2)$. By symmetry, this is equal to 2$f(\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}) = 2f(1)$, since $x_1 + x_2 = 2$.

6. Substituting $x = 1$ into the function $f(x)$, we get $f(1) = 1 + (k - 2k + l)^2 = 1 + (l - k)^2$.

7. Now we need to solve for $k$ and $l$. From step 3, we have $9k = 4l - 16$, and from step 2, we have $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$, which gives $6^2 = (x_1 - x_2)^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 4x_1x_2 = 4 - \frac{4(l - 4)}{k}$.

8. Solving these equations simultaneously, we find that $k = 4$ and $l = 10$.

9. Substituting these values into $f(1)$, we get $f(1) = 1 + (10 - 4)^2 = 1 + 36 = 37$.

10. Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from A and B to the origin is $2f(1) = 2 \cdot 37 = 74$.

The answer is: $74$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"The smallest distance between the origin and a point on the parabola $y=x^2-5$ can be expressed as $\sqrt{a}/b$, where $a$ and $b$ are positive integers, and $a$ is not divisible by the square of any prime.  Find $a+b$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the distance formula, we are trying to minimize $\sqrt{x^2+y^2}=\sqrt{x^2+x^4-10x^2+25}$. In general minimization problems like this require calculus, but one elementary optimization method that sometimes works is completing the square.  We have $$\sqrt{x^2+x^4-10x^2+25}=\sqrt{(x^2-9/2)^2+(25-81/4)}.$$This expression is minimized when the square equals $0$, i.e. when $x=\pm 3/\sqrt{2}.$ For this value of $x$, the distance is $$\sqrt{25-\frac{81}{4}}=\frac{\sqrt{19}}{2}.$$Hence the desired answer is $\boxed{21}$. The answer is $\boxed{21}$

The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $\boxed{2\left(\frac{2k - l + 4}{k}\right)}$. However, we know that the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, so we can use the fact that the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$ that are distance 6 apart to set up another equation:

$$(2k - l + 4)^2 + (l - 4)^2 = 36.$$

We can solve this equation for $l$ in terms of $k$. Then we can substitute this expression for $l$ back into the sum of squares of the distances to the origin to get a numerical value.

Let's do this:

Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Completing the square, we get $y=(x + 1)^2 - 7 $. The vertex of the graph of this equation is thus $(-1, -7)$.The distance between $(4, 5)$ and $(-1, -7)$ is $\sqrt{(4-(-1))^2 + (5-(-7))^2} = \sqrt{25+144} =\boxed{13}$. The answer is $\boxed{13}$

The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $\boxed{\frac{9 \cdot (1 - \sqrt{5})^2}{5} + \frac{9 \cdot (1 + \sqrt{5})^2}{5}}$. However, this is not a positive integer, but an algebraic expression. We made a mistake in our calculations. Let's retrace our steps and correct the mistake.

The equation of the parabola is $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$. When $y = 4$, we have $4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l$. Rearranging terms, we get $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$. This is a quadratic equation, and its solutions are the x-coordinates of the points of intersection of the parabola and the line $y = 4$. Let's denote these solutions as $x_1$ and $x_2$. The distance between these two points is given by $|x_2 - x_1|$. According to Vieta's formulas, we have $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1 \cdot x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$. Since the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, we have $|x_2 - x_1| = 6$. Squaring both sides, we get $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 36$. Expanding the left side using the identity $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = (x_2 + x_1)^2 - 4x_1x_2$, we get $4x_1x_2 = (x_2 + x_1)^2 - 36$. Substituting $x_1 + x_2 = 2$ and $x_1 \cdot x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$, we get $4 \cdot \frac{l - 4}{k} = 4 - 36$, which simplifies to $\frac{4l - 16}{k} = -32$. Multiplying both sides by $k$, we get $4l - 16 = -32k$. Since we are asked to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin, we need to find $(x_1^2 + x_2^2)$. Using the identity $(x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = x_1^2 + x_2^2$, we get $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 4 - 2 \cdot \frac{l - 4}{k} = 4 - 2 \cdot \frac{l - 4}{1} = 4 - 2(l - 4) = 4 - 2l + 8 = 12 - 2l$. Now we substitute $l = \frac{32k + 16}{4}$ (from the equation $4l - 16 = -32k$), we get $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = 12 - 2 \cdot \frac{32k + 16}{4} = 12 - 16k - 8 = 4 - 16k$. Now we substitute $k = 1$ (from the equation $4l - 16 = -32k$), we get $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = 4 - 16 \cdot 1 = -12$. But this is impossible, because the square of a distance cannot be negative. We made a mistake in our calculations.

Let's retrace our steps and correct the mistake.

The equation of the parabola is $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$. When $y = 4$, we have $4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l$. Rearranging terms, we get $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$. This is a quadratic equation, and its solutions are the x-coordinates of the points of intersection of the parabola and the line $y = 4$. Let's denote these solutions as $x_1$ and $x_2$. The distance between these two points is given by $|x_2 - x_1|$. According to Vieta's formulas, we have $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1 \cdot x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$. Since the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, we have $|x_2 - x_1| = 6$. Squaring both sides, we get $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 36$. Expanding the left side using the identity $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = (x_2 + x_1)^2 - 4x_1x_2$, we get $4x_1x_2 = (x_2 + x_1)^2 - 36$. Substituting $x_1 + x_2 = 2$ and $x_1 \cdot x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$, we get $4 \cdot \frac{l - 4}{k} = 4 - 36$, which simplifies to $\frac{4l - 16}{k} = -32$. Multiplying both sides by $k$, we get $4l - 16 = -32k$. Now we substitute $l = \frac{32k + 16}{4}$, we get $4 \cdot \frac{32k + 16}{4} - 16 = -32k$, which simplifies to $32k + 16 - 16 = -32k$, which simplifies to $32k = -32k$. This equation is not true for any value of $k$, which means we made a mistake in

In general minimization problems like this require calculus, but one elementary optimization method that sometimes works is completing the square.  We have $$\sqrt{x^2+x^4-10x^2+25}=\sqrt{(x^2-9/2)^2+(25-81/4)}.$$This expression is minimized when the square equals $0$, i.e. when $x=\pm 3/\sqrt{2}.$ For this value of $x$, the distance is $$\sqrt{25-\frac{81}{4}}=\frac{\sqrt{19}}{2}.$$Hence the desired answer is $\boxed{21}$. The answer is $\boxed{21}$

```
The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is minimized at $37.56$. However, this is not an integer. We made an error in our calculations. Let's go back and reevaluate the problem.

We know that the distance between the points $A$ and $B$ is 6. The distance formula for two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is $\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$. In this case, $y_1 = y_2 = 4$, so the distance formula simplifies to $\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2} = |x_2 - x_1| = 6$. Thus, the difference in the x-coordinates of the points $A$ and $B$ is 6.

The x-coordinates of the points $A$ and $B$ are the solutions of the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$. By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots of this equation is $\frac{2k}{k} = 2$, and the product of the roots is $\frac{l - 4}{k}$. Since the

**Problem:** 
"The smallest distance between the origin and a point on the parabola $y=x^2-5$ can be expressed as $\sqrt{a}/b$, where $a$ and $b$ are positive integers, and $a$ is not divisible by the square of any prime.  Find $a+b$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the distance formula, we are trying to minimize $\sqrt{x^2+y^2}=\sqrt{x^2+x^4-10x^2+25}$. In general minimization problems like this require calculus, but one elementary optimization method that sometimes works is completing the square.  We have $$\sqrt{x^2+x^4-10x^2+25}=\sqrt{(x^2-9/2)^2+(25-81/4)}.$$This expression is minimized when the square equals $0$, i.e. when $x=\pm 3/\sqrt{2}.$ For this value of $x$, the distance is $$\sqrt{25-\frac{81}{4}}=\frac{\sqrt{19}}{2}.$$Hence the desired answer is $\boxed{21}$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $\mathcal{P}$ be the parabola in the plane determined by the equation $y = x^2.$  Suppose a circle $\mathcal{C}$ intersects $\mathcal{P}$ at four distinct points.  If three of these points are $(-28,784),$ $(-2,4),$ and $(13,169),$ find the sum of the distances from the focus of $\mathcal{P}$ to all four of the intersection points."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Let the four intersection points be $(a,a^2),$ $(b,b^2),$ $(c,c^2),$ and $(d,d^2).$  Let the equation of the circle be
\[(x - k)^2 + (y - h)^2 = r^2.\]Substituting $y = x^2,$ we get
\[(x - k)^2 + (x^2 - h)^2 = r^2.\]Expanding this equation, we get a fourth degree polynomial whose roots are $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ and $d.$  Furthermore, the coefficient of $x^3$ is 0, so by Vieta's formulas, $a + b + c + d = 0.$

We are given that three intersection points are $(-28,784),$ $(-2,4),$ and $(13,196),$ so the fourth root is $-((-28) + (-2) + 13) = 17.$

The distance from the focus to a point on the parabola is equal to the distance from the point to the directrix, which is $y = -\frac{1}{4}.$  Thus, the sum of the distances is
\[784 + \frac{1}{4} + 4 + \frac{1}{4} + 169 + \frac{1}{4} + 17^2 + \frac{1}{4} = \boxed{1247}.\] The answer is $\boxed{1247}$
