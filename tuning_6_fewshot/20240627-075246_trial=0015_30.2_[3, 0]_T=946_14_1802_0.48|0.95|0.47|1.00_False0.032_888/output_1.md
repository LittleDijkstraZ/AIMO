**Problem:** 
"What is the minimum value of the expression $x^2+y^2+2x-4y+8$ for real $x$ and $y$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Rearranging the expression, we have  \[x^2+2x+y^2-4y+8\]Completing the square in $x$, we need to add and subtract $(2/2)^2=1$. Completing the square in $y$, we need to add and subtract $(4/2)^2=4$. Thus, we have \[(x^2+2x+1)-1+(y^2-4y+4)-4+8 \Rightarrow (x+1)^2+(y-2)^2+3\]Since the minimum value of $(x+1)^2$ and $(y-2)^2$ is $0$ (perfect squares can never be negative), the minimum value of the entire expression is $\boxed{3}$, and is achieved when $x=-1$ and $y=2$. The answer is $\boxed{3}$

**Problem**
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


This problem is a bit tricky to solve directly. However, we can simplify it by using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.

The given condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$. By the triangle inequality, this is equivalent to $|x-2y| = |2y-x| = 20$.

Now, we can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality:
\[(1^2+2^2)(x^2+y^2) \geq (x+2y)^2.\]
Simplifying, we get $5(x^2+y^2) \geq (x+2y)^2$.

Similarly, we can apply the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to the expression $5y^2+5x^2$:
\[(2^2+1^2)(y^2+x^2) \geq (2y+x)^2.\]
Simplifying, we get $5(y^2+x^2) \geq (2y+x)^2$.

Adding these two inequalities, we get
\[10(x^2+y^2) \geq (x+2y)^2 + (2y+x)^2.\]
Expanding, we get
\[10(x^2+y^2) \geq 5x^2 + 10xy + 5y^2.\]
Rearranging, we get
\[5(x^2+y^2) - 10xy \geq 0.\]
But from the given condition, we know that $|x-2y| = |2y-x| = 20$, so $x+2y = 20$ or $x+2y = -20$.

If $x+2y = 20$, then $10xy = 5(x^2+y^2) - 10(x+2y)^2/5 = 5(x^2+y^2) - 400$.
If $x+2y = -20$, then $10xy = 5(x^2+y^2) - 10(x+2y)^2/5 = 5(x^2+y^2) + 400$.

In either case, we have $10xy = 5(x^2+y^2) \pm 400$.

Substituting this into the original expression $5x^2+5y^2-10xy$, we get
\[5x^2+5y^2-10xy = 5(x^2+y^2) - (5(x^2+y^2) \pm 400) = \mp 400.\]
Since the original expression must be non-negative, the minimum value is $-400$. However, this is not possible, as the original expression is $5x^2+5y^2-10xy$, which is clearly non-negative.

Therefore, we must have made a mistake in our reasoning. Let's go back and check our work.

Upon reexamination, we realize that we made a mistake in our application of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. The correct inequality should be
\[(1^2+2^2)(x^2+y^2) \geq (x-2y)^2.\]
Simplifying, we get $5(x^2+y^2) \geq (x-2y)^2$.

Similarly, we should have applied the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to the expression $5y^2+5x^2$:
\[(2^2+1^2)(y^2+x^2) \geq (2y-x)^2.\]
Simplifying, we get $5(y^2+x^2) \geq (2y-x)^2$.

Adding these two inequalities, we get
\[10(x^2+y^2) \geq (x-2y)^2 + (2y-x)^2.\]
Expanding, we get
\[10(x^2+y^2) \geq 5x^2 - 10xy + 5y^2.\]
Rearranging, we get
\[5(x^2+y^2) + 10xy \geq 0.\]
But from the given condition, we know that $|x-2y| = |2y-x| = 20$, so $x-2y = 20$ or $x-2y = -20$.

If $x-2y = 20$, then $10xy = 5(x^2+y^2) - 10(x-2y)^2/5 = 5(x^2+y^2) - 400$.
If $x-2y = -20$, then $10xy = 5(x^2+y^2) - 10(x-2y)^2/5 = 5(x^2+y^2) + 400$.

In either case, we have $10xy = 5(x^2+y^2) \mp 400$.

Substituting this into the original expression $5x^2+5y^2-10xy$, we get
\[5x^2+5y^2-10xy = 5(x^2+y^2) - (5(x^2+y^2) \mp 400) = \pm 400.\]
Since the original expression must be non-negative, the minimum value is $400$.

Therefore, the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $400$. The answer is: $400$

**Problem:** 
"Find the minimum value of $2x^2 + 2y^2 + 5z^2 - 2xy - 4yz - 4x - 2z + 15$ over all real numbers $x,$ $y,$ $z.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
We can write the given expression as
\begin{align*}
&(x^2 - 4x + 4) + (x^2 - 2xy + y^2) + (y^2 - 4yz + 4z^2) + (z^2 - 2z + 1) + 10 \\
&= (x - 2)^2 + (x - y)^2 + (y - 2z)^2 + (z - 1)^2 + 10
\end{align*}The minimum value is then $\boxed{10},$ which occurs when $x = 2,$ $y = 2,$ and $z = 1.$ The answer is $\boxed{10}$

**Problem**
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we can use the method of completing the square. First, let's rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $(x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2) + (y^2 - 4xy + 4x^2) = (x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2$.
Now, we know that $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$. By the triangle inequality, we have $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| \geq |(x - 2y) - (y - 2x)| = |x - 2y - y + 2x| = |x - 3x + 2y - y| = |2y - x| = 40$.
So, we have $|2y - x| = 40$. Squaring both sides, we get $(2y - x)^2 = 40^2$. Expanding, we have $4y^2 - 4xy + x^2 = 1600$. Rearranging, we get $x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2 = 1600$.
Now, we can substitute this into our original expression: $(x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2 = 1600$.
Since $(x - 2y)^2$ and $(y - 2x)^2$ are both non-negative, their sum is minimized when both terms are equal to 0. This occurs when $x - 2y = 0$ and $y - 2x = 0$, which gives $x = 2y$ and $y = 2x$.
Substituting $x = 2y$ into the equation $|2y - x| = 40$, we get $|2y - 2y| = 40$, which simplifies to $0 = 40$. This is a contradiction, so we must have made a mistake somewhere.
However, we can still use the fact that $(x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2 = 1600$ to find the minimum value of $(x - 2y)^2$ and $(y - 2x)^2$.
Since $(x - 2y)^2$ and $(y - 2x)^2$ are both non-negative, their sum is minimized when both terms are equal to half of the sum, or when both terms are equal to $\frac{1600}{2} = 800$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $(x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2$ is 800.
So, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is 800. The answer is: $800$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"What is the minimum value of the expression $2x^2+3y^2+8x-24y+62$ for real $x$ and $y$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Rearranging the expression, we have  \[2x^2+8x+3y^2-24y+62\]We first complete the square in $x$. Factoring a 2 from the first two terms of the expression, we get  \[2(x^2+4x)+3y^2-24y+62\]In order for the expression inside the parenthesis to be a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(4/2)^2=4$ inside the parenthesis. Doing this, we have \[2(x^2+4x+4-4)+3y^2-24y+62 \Rightarrow 2(x+2)^2+3y^2-24y+54\]Now we complete the square in $y$. Factoring a 3 from the $y$ terms in the expression, we get \[2(x+2)^2+3(y^2-8y)+54\]In order for the expression inside the second parenthesis to be a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(8/2)^2=16$ inside the parenthesis. Doing this, we have \[2(x+2)^2+3(y^2-8y+16-16)+54 \Rightarrow 2(x+2)^2+3(y-4)^2+6\]Since the minimum value of $2(x+2)^2$ and $3(y-4)^2$ is $0$ (perfect squares can never be negative), the minimum value of the entire expression is $\boxed{6}$, and is achieved when $x=-2$ and $y=4$. The answer is $\boxed{6}$

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


This problem is a bit more complex than the previous ones, but we can still solve it using the same technique of completing the square.

First, let's rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $(x^2-4xy+4y^2) + (4y^2-8xy+4x^2) = (x-2y)^2 + (2x-y)^2$.

Now, let's analyze the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. We can rewrite this as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$, which simplifies to $2|x-2y| = 40$. Therefore, $|x-2y| = 20$.

Since the square of a real number is always non-negative, we have $(x-2y)^2 \ge 0$ and $(2x-y)^2 \ge 0$. Therefore, $(x-2y)^2 + (2x-y)^2 \ge 0$.

But we know that $(x-2y)^2 = 20^2 = 400$ from the constraint, so the minimum value of $(x-2y)^2 + (2x-y)^2$ is indeed $400$.

So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $400$. The answer is: $400$
