**Problem:** 
"Let $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_ 2= (-16,2).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that
\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as
\[\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1.\]Find $h + k + a + b.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we first need to understand the given equation and how it defines the points that form the convex polygon.

The equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. The product of two terms is zero if and only if either of the terms is zero. This gives us two separate equations:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which simplifies to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which simplifies to $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The solutions to these equations are as follows:

1. From $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, we have $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$. Similarly, from $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, we have $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$. This gives us a total of 4 equations.
2. From $\vert x \vert = 8$, we have $x = 8$ or $x = -8$. Similarly, from $\vert y \vert = 8$, we have $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. This gives us a total of 4 equations.

Now, we need to solve these 8 equations and find the points that satisfy them. The 8 equations give us the vertices of the polygon. To find the area of the polygon, we can use the shoelace formula. The shoelace formula is used to find the area of a polygon given its vertices. The formula is:

$A = \frac{1}{2} \vert (x_1y_2 + x_2y_3 + \dots + x_ny_1) - (y_1x_2 + y_2x_3 + \dots + y_nx_1) \vert$

After solving the equations and finding the vertices of the polygon, we can use the shoelace formula to find the area of the polygon.

Here is a Python script that solves the problem and calculates the area of the polygon:

```python

    # Equation 1: |x + y| = 10, |x - y| = 10
    eq1_1 = Abs(x + y) - 10
    eq1_2 = Abs(x - y) - 10

    # Equation 2: |x| = 8, |y| = 8

            vertices.add((x2, y2))
    return vertices

    # The vertices are in the form (x, y)
    # The shoelace formula requires the vertices to be in clockwise order
    vertices = sorted(vertices, key=lambda v: (v[1], v[0]))

    # Calculate the area using the shoelace formula
    x_coords, y_coords = zip(*vertices)
    area = abs(sum(x_coords[i]*y_coords[i+1] - x_coords[i+1]*y_coords[i] for i in range(len(vertices))) / 2)

    return area

vertices = find_vertices()
area = shoelace_formula(vertices)
print(area)
```

```

The above script contains an error as we are trying to use the indices of the vertices list out of range when calculating the area using the shoelace formula. This is because the vertices list is not in clockwise order. We need to sort the vertices in clockwise order before using the shoelace formula. Let's modify the script to fix this error:

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if both of its factors are equal to zero. The factor $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ is zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The factor $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2$ is zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The solutions to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ are the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. The solutions to $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ are the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersection of these lines form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either term must be zero. This gives us four separate conditions:
1. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$.
2. $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.

Solving these conditions, we find that the points $\left(x, y\right)$ must satisfy:
1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
2. $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

This gives us the following four sets of points:
1. $x + y = \pm 10$,
2. $x - y = \pm 10$,
3. $x = \pm 8$,
4. $y = \pm 8$.

These equations represent the sides of a square with side length 10 and centered at the origin. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of this square, which is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 100.
The answer is: $100$

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we first need to understand the equation and its implications. The equation is a product of two quadratic expressions equal to zero. Therefore, either one of the expressions must be zero for the equation to hold. This gives us two separate cases to consider.

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This equation implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This is only possible when $x = y = 5$ or $x = -y = -5$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This equation implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This is only possible when $x = 8$ or $x = -8$ and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

Combining these two cases, we find that the points that satisfy the equation are $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$, and $(5, 5)$, $(-5, -5)$, $(-5, 5)$, and $(5, -5)$. These points form a rectangle with side lengths 16 and 10, so the area of the rectangle is $16 \times 10 = 160$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 160.

The answer is: $160$

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



To find the area of the convex polygon, we need to first identify the points that satisfy the given equation and then calculate the area based on those points.

The equation given is: 
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$

This equation is satisfied when either of the two factors is zero. So we have two cases:

1. Either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two lines in the plane.
2. Either $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two lines in the plane.

The intersection of these lines will give us the vertices of the polygon.

To find the vertices, we can solve the equations for each combination of the two cases. 

After solving the equations, we find the vertices to be the points:
$$(8,0), (-8,0), (0,8), (0,-8), (8,8), (8,-8), (-8,8), (-8,-8)$$

Now we can calculate the area of the polygon formed by these vertices. 

The polygon is a square with side length 16. The area of a square is given by the square of the side length, so the area of the polygon is $16^2 = 256$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def calculate_area():
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = calculate_area()
print(result)
```
