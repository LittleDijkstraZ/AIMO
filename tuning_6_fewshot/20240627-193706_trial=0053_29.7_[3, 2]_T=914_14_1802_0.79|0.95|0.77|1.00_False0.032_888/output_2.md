**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let \[f(x) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
-x + 3 & \text{if } x \le 0, \\
2x - 5 & \text{if } x > 0.
\end{array}
\right.\]How many solutions does the equation $f(f(x)) = 4$ have?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
To solve the equation $f(f(x)) = 4,$ we first find the values $x$ such that $f(x) = 4.$

Either $f(x) = -x + 3$ (for $x \le 0$) or $f(x) = 2x - 5$ (for $x > 0$). If $-x + 3 = 4,$ then $x = -1.$ Note that this value satisfies $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = 4,$ then $x = 9/2.$ Note that this value satisfies $x > 0.$ Therefore, the solutions to $f(x) = 4$ are $x = -1$ and $x = 9/2.$

Next, we solve for the values $x$ such that $f(x) = -1.$ If $-x + 3 = -1,$ then $x = 4.$ This value does not satisfy $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = -1,$ then $x = 2.$ This value satisfies $x > 0.$

Finally, we solve for the values $x$ such that $f(x) = 9/2.$ If $-x + 3 = 9/2,$ then $x = -3/2.$ This value satisfies $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = 9/2,$ then $x = 19/4.$ This value satisfies $x > 0.$

Therefore, the equation $f(f(x)) = 4$ has the solutions $x = 2,$ $-3/2,$ and $19/4,$ for a total of $\boxed{3}$ solutions. The answer is $\boxed{3}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


The question asks for the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has $4$ distinct solutions.

To solve this problem, we can start by considering the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}.\] This equation is equivalent to a piecewise function of $x$. We can break it down into different cases depending on the value of $x$.

1. If $x \leq 1$, then $\vert x - 1 \vert = 1 - x$. The equation becomes \[\vert 1 - x - 2 \vert = \frac{m}{100},\] which simplifies to \[\vert -x - 1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}.\] This is further simplified to \[\vert x + 1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}.\] This equation has two solutions, $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

2. If $1 < x \leq 3$, then $\vert x - 1 \vert = x - 1$. The equation becomes \[\vert x - 1 - 2 \vert = \frac{m}{100},\] which simplifies to \[\vert x - 3 \vert = \frac{m}{100}.\] This equation has two solutions, $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.

3. If $x > 3$, then $\vert x - 1 \vert = x - 1$. The equation becomes \[\vert x - 1 - 2 \vert = \frac{m}{100},\] which simplifies to \[\vert x - 3 \vert = \frac{m}{100}.\] This equation has two solutions, $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Now we need to find the values of $m$ for which these four solutions are distinct. This happens when $1 + \frac{m}{100} < 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $m < 100$. Also, $3 + \frac{m}{100} > 3$, which is always true. So the only condition we need to satisfy is $1 + \frac{m}{100} < 3 - \frac{m}{100}$. This simplifies to $m < 100$.

Since $m$ is a positive integer, the possible values of $m$ are $1, 2, ..., 99$. Therefore, there are 99 possible values of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions.

The value of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 99.
The answer is: 99

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We first notice that the right side of the equation, $m/100$, is always positive. This implies that the absolute value of the left side, $| |x - 1| - 2 |$, must also be positive. The only way this can happen is if $|x - 1| - 2$ is either $0$ or $-m/100$.

2. If $|x - 1| - 2 = 0$, then $|x - 1| = 2$, which implies $x - 1 = 2$ or $x - 1 = -2$. Solving these gives $x = 3$ or $x = -1$.

3. If $|x - 1| - 2 = -m/100$, then $|x - 1| = 2 - m/100$. This implies $x - 1 = 2 - m/100$ or $x - 1 = -(2 - m/100)$. Solving these gives $x = 3 - m/100$ or $x = -1 + m/100$.

4. For the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, one of these equations must have two distinct solutions and the other must have one distinct solution. This implies that the value of $m/100$ must be between $1$ and $2$. Therefore, $1 < m/100 < 2$, which gives $100 < m < 200$.

5. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from $101$ to $199$, inclusive. There are $100$ such integers.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is $100$.
The answer is: $100$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"For certain ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ of real numbers, the system of equations
\[\begin{aligned} ax+by&=1 \\ x^2 + y^2 &= 50  \end{aligned}\]has at least one solution, and each solution is an ordered pair $(x,y)\,$ of integers. How many such ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ are there?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The graph of $ax+by=1$ is a line, while the graph of $x^2+y^2=50$ is a circle centered at the origin. Therefore, $(a, b)$ satisfies the conditions if and only if the line and circle intersect at least once, and they intersect only at lattice points (points with integer coordinates).

Knowing this, it makes sense to look for lattice points on the circle whose equation is $x^2+y^2=50$. Testing cases, we find that there are twelve lattice points on the circle: $(\pm 1, \pm 7)$, $(\pm 7, \pm 1)$, and $(\pm 5, \pm 5)$ (where the two $\pm$ signs in each pair are independent of each other).

There are $\tbinom{12}{2} = 66$ pairs of these points, and each pair determines a line. However, the graph of $ax+by=1$ can never pass through the origin $(0, 0)$, since if $x=y=0$, then $ax+by=0 \neq 1$. Therefore, the six pairs which consist of diametrically opposed points are invalid, since the line through them passes through the origin. This corrects our count to $66 - 6 = 60$.

In addition, for each of the twelve points, there is a line tangent to the circle at that point, so that the only solution to the system is that one point. This brings the final total to $60 + 12 = \boxed{72}$. The answer is $\boxed{72}$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many solutions does the equation \[\frac{(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)\dotsm(x-100)}{(x-1^2)(x-2^2)(x-3^2)\dotsm(x-100^2)} = 0\]have for $x$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Any solution to this equation must make the numerator of the left-hand side zero, while keeping the denominator non-zero. The numerator is zero when $x$ is one of the numbers $1, 2, 3, \dots, 100.$ However, for any value in this list that is a perfect square, the denominator will also be zero, so that value of $x$ will not be a root. Therefore, we want to find the number of integers in the list $1, 2, \dots, 100$ which are not perfect squares. The perfect squares in the list are $1^2, 2^2, \dots, 10^2,$ so there are $10$ perfect squares, and \[100 - 10 = \boxed{90}\]integers which are not perfect squares. The answer is $\boxed{90}$

The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has $4$ distinct solutions is $100$. However, this does not mean that all the values of $m$ will give $4$ distinct solutions. Some values of $m$ will give only $2$ or $0$ solutions. To find the exact number of values of $m$ that give $4$ distinct solutions, we need to analyze the behavior of the equation more closely.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions when the right side, $\frac{m}{100}$, falls into the interval $(0, 1)$. This is because the left side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, takes on all values in the interval $[0, 1]$ as $x$ varies over the real numbers.

Therefore, we want to find the number of multiples of $\frac{1}{100}$ in the interval $(0, 1)$. This is simply equal to $100$.

So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $100$. The answer is $\boxed{100}$.
