**Problem:** 
"The function $f(n)$ is defined on the positive integers such that $f(f(n)) = 2n$ and $f(4n + 1) = 4n + 3$ for all positive integers $n.$  Find $f(1000).$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Consider the expression $f(f(f(a))).$  Since $f(f(a)) = 2a,$ this is equal to $f(2a).$  But taking $n = f(a)$ in $f(f(n)) = 2n,$ we get
\[f(f(f(a))) = 2f(a).\]Hence,
\[f(2a) = 2f(a)\]for all positive integers $a.$

Then
\[f(1000) = 2f(500) = 4f(250) = 8f(125).\]Taking $n = 31$ in $f(4n + 1) = 4n + 3,$ we get
\[f(125) = 127,\]so $f(1000) = \boxed{1016}.$ The answer is $\boxed{1016}$

**Problem**
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step.

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we can use the given conditions to find the value of $f(100)$ step by step.

1. From the condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we can substitute $n = 1$ to get $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1$, which implies $f(1)=1$.
2. Then, from the condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we can substitute $n = f(1) = 1$ to get $f(f(f(f(1))))=8f(1)-7=1$, which implies $f(f(1))=1$.
3. Since we know $f(1)=1$, from the condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we can substitute $n = f(1) = 1$ to get $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1$, which implies $f(1)=1$.

So we have found $f(1) = 1$.

4. From the condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can substitute $n = 1$ to get $f(2*1)=2f(1)+1=3$, which implies $f(2)=3$.
5. From the condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can substitute $n = 2$ to get $f(2*2)=2f(2)+1=7$, which implies $f(4)=7$.
6. From the condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can substitute $n = 4$ to get $f(2*4)=2f(4)+1=15$, which implies $f(8)=15$.

By continuing this process, we can find that $f(16)=31$, $f(32)=63$, $f(64)=127$, and so on. We can observe that $f(2^n) = 2^n - 1$ for all positive integers $n$.

7. Now we want to find $f(100)$, and we know $100 = 2^6 + 2^2$.
8. From the condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can substitute $n = 2^6 = 64$ to get $f(2*64)=2f(64)+1=2(127)+1=255$, which implies $f(128)=255$.
9. Then, from the condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can substitute $n = 2^2 = 4$ to get $f(2*4)=2f(4)+1=2(7)+1=15$, which implies $f(8)=15$.
10. Finally, from the condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can substitute $n = 100 = 2^6 + 2^2$ to get $f(2*100)=2f(100)+1$.
11. Since $100 = 2^6 + 2^2$, we know $f(100) = f(2^6 + 2^2) = f(128) + f(8) - 1 = 255 + 15 - 1 = 269$.

So, the value of $f(100)$ is 269. The answer is: $269$

## QUESTION 4 - 1 
- TIME_SPENT : 455 secs

1_
**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $f$ be a function taking the nonnegative integers to the positive integers such that $f(0) = f(1) = 1$ and
\[\frac{f(n) f(m + 1)}{f(m)} + \frac{f(n) f(n - m)}{f(n - m - 1)} = f(n + 1)\]for all nonnegative integers $n$ and $m,$ where $n \ge m + 1.$

Find the smallest nonnegative integer $n$ such that $f(n) > 10^6.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Setting $m = n - 1$ in the given functional equation, we get
\[\frac{f(n) \cdot f(n)}{f(n - 1)} + f(n) = f(n + 1),\]for all $n \ge 1.$  Then
\[\frac{f(n)}{f(n - 1)} + 1 = \frac{f(n + 1)}{f(n)}.\]Let $g(n) = \frac{f(n)}{f(n - 1)}$ for $n \ge 1.$  Then $g(1) = \frac{f(1)}{f(0)} = 1,$ and
\[g(n) + 1 = g(n + 1).\]Then $g(n) = n$ for all $n \ge 1.$  Hence,
\[g(n) g(n - 1) \dotsm g(2) g(1) = \frac{f(n)}{f(n - 1)} \cdot \frac{f(n - 1)}{f(n - 2)} \dotsm \frac{f(2)}{f(1)} \cdot \frac{f(1)}{f(0)},\]which simplifies to
\[n(n - 1) \dotsm (2)(1) = \frac{f(n)}{f(0)}.\]Therefore, $f(n) = n!$ for all $n \ge 1.$

Since $f(9) = 9! = 326880$ and $f(10) = 10! = 3628800,$ the smallest such $n$ is $\boxed{10}.$ The answer is $\boxed{10}$

**Solution:** 


To find $f(100)$, we can start by using the second condition $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. We can substitute $n=50$ to get $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$. Then we can substitute $n=25$ to get $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$. We can continue this process until we reach the base case $f(1)$, which we can find by directly applying the first condition $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$.

The first step is to find the base case $f(1)$. By substituting $n=1$ into the first condition, we get $f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = -1$. This does not give us a useful result, so we must have made a mistake. Let's try substituting $n=2$ into the first condition instead:
$$f(f(f(2))) = 8*2 - 7 = 9.$$
Now, we need to find the value of $f(f(2))$ that makes this equation true. From the second condition, $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$. Let's call this value $x$, so $x = 2f(2) + 1$. Now we can substitute this into the equation $f(f(f(2))) = 9$:
$$f(x) = 9.$$
From the second condition again, if $f(x) = 9$, then $9 = 2f\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) + 1$. Solving for $f\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)$, we get
$$f\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = \frac{9 - 1}{2} = 4.$$
From the second condition again, if $f\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 4$, then $4 = 2f\left(\frac{x}{4}\right) + 1$. Solving for $f\left(\frac{x}{4}\right)$, we get
$$f\left(\frac{x}{4}\right) = \frac{4 - 1}{2} = 1.5.$$
But the function $f$ only takes integer values, so we must have made a mistake somewhere. Let's go back and check our work.

We made a mistake in our substitution of $n=2$ into the first condition. Instead, we should have started with the base case $f(1)$. From the first condition, we have
$$f(f(f(1))) = -1.$$
If we let $f(f(1)) = x$, then we have $f(x) = -1$. From the second condition, if $f(x) = -1$, then $-1 = 2f\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) + 1$. Solving for $f\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)$, we get
$$f\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = \frac{-1 - 1}{2} = -1.$$
This means that $\frac{x}{2} = 1$, so $x = 2$. Therefore, $f(f(1)) = 2$. If we let $f(1) = a$, then $f(2) = 2a + 1$. From the first condition, we have
$$f(f(f(1))) = f(f(a)) = -1.$$
From the second condition, if $f(f(a)) = -1$, then $-1 = 2f\left(\frac{f(a)}{2}\right) + 1$. Solving for $f\left(\frac{f(a)}{2}\right)$, we get
$$f\left(\frac{f(a)}{2}\right) = \frac{-1 - 1}{2} = -1.$$
This means that $\frac{f(a)}{2} = 1$, so $f(a) = 2$. Therefore, $f(1) = a = 1$. We have found the base case $f(1) = 1$.

Now we can use the second condition to find $f(2)$, $f(4)$, $f(8)$, and so on, until we reach $f(100)$. We have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2(1) + 1 = 3$, $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2(3) + 1 = 7$, $f(8) = 2f(4) + 1 = 2(7) + 1 = 15$, and so on. We can continue this process to find that $f(100) = 191$. The answer is: $\boxed{191}$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"The function $f$ is defined on the set of integers and satisfies \[f(n)= \begin{cases}  n-3 & \mbox{if }n\ge 1000 \\  f(f(n+5)) & \mbox{if }n<1000. \end{cases}\]Find $f(84)$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Denote by (1) and (2) the two parts of the definition of $f$, respectively. If we begin to use the definition of $f$ to compute $f(84)$, we use (2) until the argument is at least $1000$: \[f(84) = f(f(89)) = f(f(f(94))) = \dots = f^N(1004)\](where $f^N$ denotes composing $f$ with itself $N$ times, for some $N$). The numbers $84, 89, 94, \dots, 1004$ form an arithmetic sequence with common difference $5$; since $1004 - 84 = 920 = 184 \cdot 5$, this sequence has $184 + 1 = 185$ terms, so $N = 185$.

At this point, (1) and (2) are both used: we compute \[\begin{aligned} f^N(1004) &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-1}(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-1}(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(1000) \\ &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(997) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1002) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(999) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1004). \end{aligned}\]Repeating this process, we see that \[f^N(1004) = f^{N-2}(1004) = f^{N-4}(1004) = \dots = f^3(1004).\](The pattern breaks down for $f^k(1004)$ when $k$ is small, so it is not true that $f^3(1004) = f(1004)$.) Now, we have \[f^3(1004) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^2(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^2(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(1000) \stackrel{(1)}{=} \boxed{997}.\] The answer is $\boxed{997}$

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



To find $f(100)$, we first need to understand the properties of the function $f$. From the given conditions, we have:

1. $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$
2. $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$

We can use the second condition to find $f(100)$ by expressing $100$ as $2*50$. Then we can use the second condition again to find $f(50)$ and so on. 

Let's define a recursive function `f` to calculate $f(n)$:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

def f(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    elif n % 2 == 0:
        return 2*f(n/2) + 1
    else:
        return 8*n - 7

result = f(100)
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 775.0

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
775.0
```
The output is not correct, as the function $f$ is supposed to return an integer value. We must have made a mistake in our implementation. Let's retrace our steps and correct the implementation.

Looking back at the conditions, we see that the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ suggests that $f$ is an odd function. That is, $f(-n) = -f(n)$. The second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ implies that $f$ is a monotonically increasing function. 

Given these properties, we can update our recursive function `f` as follows:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def f(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    elif n % 2 == 0:
        return 2*f(n/2) + 1
    else:
        return -(8*n - 7)

result = f(100)
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS -769.0

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
-769.0
```
The output is still not correct, as the function $f$ should return a positive integer value. We must have made another mistake in our implementation. Let's retrace our steps once more and correct the implementation.

We notice that our implementation of `f` is not tail-recursive, which means that it will repeatedly call itself until the base case is reached. This is inefficient and can lead to overflow errors for large values of `n`. Let's rewrite the function `f` using a loop instead of recursion:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def f(n):
    while n > 1:
        if n % 2 == 0:
            n = n / 2
            result = 2*result + 1
        else:
            n = 8*n - 7
            result = -result
    return result

result = f(100)
print(result)
```

FAIL


INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
Traceback: line 33, in f
    result = 2*result + 1
UnboundLocalError: local variable 'result' referenced before assignment

```
After examining our new implementation, we find that we are getting an error because we forgot to initialize `result` before the loop. Let's correct this:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def f(n):
    result = 1
    while n > 1:
        if n % 2 == 0:
            n = n / 2
            result = 2*result + 1
        else:
            n = 8*n - 7
            result = -result
    return result

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"The function $f(n)$ is defined on the positive integers such that $f(f(n)) = 2n$ and $f(4n + 1) = 4n + 3$ for all positive integers $n.$  Find $f(1000).$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Consider the expression $f(f(f(a))).$  Since $f(f(a)) = 2a,$ this is equal to $f(2a).$  But taking $n = f(a)$ in $f(f(n)) = 2n,$ we get
\[f(f(f(a))) = 2f(a).\]Hence,
\[f(2a) = 2f(a)\]for all positive integers $a.$

Then
\[f(1000) = 2f(500) = 4f(250) = 8f(125).\]Taking $n = 31$ in $f(4n + 1) = 4n + 3,$ we get
\[f(125) = 127,\]so $f(1000) = \boxed{1016}.$ The answer is $\boxed{1016}$

The value of $f(100)$ is 793. However, this result does not seem to be consistent with the function definition. Let's revise the approach and try again.

Let's start from the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. If we let $n = 1$, we get $f(f(f(1))) = 1$. Because $f(f(1)) = 1$, we can simplify the equation to $f(f(1)) = 1$. 

Next, let's consider the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. If we let $n = 1$, we get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. Since $f(f(1)) = 1$, we have $f(2) = 3$. 

Now we have the values $f(1) = 1$ and $f(2) = 3$. Let's use these values to find $f(4)$ using the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. If we let $n = 2$, we get $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2(3) + 1 = 7$.

Next, we want to find $f(7)$. We can use the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. If we let $n = 4$, we get $f(f(f(4))) = 8(4) - 7 = 27$. Because $f(f(7)) = 27$, we can simplify this equation to $f(7) = 27$.

Finally, we can find $f(100)$ using the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. If we let $n = 50$, we get $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$. However, we don't know the value of $f(50)$ yet. But we can use the equation $f(4n + 1) = 4n + 3$ to find $f(50)$. If we let $n = 12$, we get $f(4(12) + 1) = 4(12) + 3$, which simplifies to $f(50) = 51$.

Substituting $f(50) = 51$ into the equation $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$, we get $f(100) = 2(51) + 1 = 103$.

So, the value of $f(100)$ is 103. However, this result does not seem to be consistent with the function definition. Let's revise the approach and try again.

Let's start from the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. If we let $n = 1$, we get $f(f(f(1))) = 1$. Because $f(f(1)) = 1$, we can simplify the equation to $f(f(1)) = 1$. 

Next, let's consider the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. If we let $n = 1$, we get $f(2)

Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Consider the expression $f(f(f(a))).$  Since $f(f(a)) = 2a,$ this is equal to $f(2a).$  But taking $n = f(a)$ in $f(f(n)) = 2n,$ we get
\[f(f(f(a))) = 2f(a).\]Hence,
\[f(2a) = 2f(a)\]for all positive integers $a.$

Then
\[f(1000) = 2f(500) = 4f(250) = 8f(125).\]Taking $n = 31$ in $f(4n + 1) = 4n + 3,$ we get
\[f(125) = 127,\]so $f(1000) = \boxed{1016}.$ The answer is $\boxed{1016}$

**Problem**
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


This problem is a bit tricky because it involves understanding how the function works and how to apply the given conditions to find the value of $f(100)$. Let's start by applying the function to the value 100:

1. First, we apply the condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. By setting $n=50$, we get $f(100)=2f(50)+1$.
2. To find $f(50)$, we again apply the condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ by setting $n=25$. So, $f(50)=2f(25)+1$.
3. To find $f(25)$, we apply the condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. By setting $n=25$, we get $f(f(f(25)))=8*25-7=193$. But we know that $f(f(f(25)))=f(25)$, so $f(25)=193$.
4. Substituting $f(25)=193$ into $f(50)=2f(25)+1$, we get $f(50)=2*193+1=387$.
5. Finally, substituting $f(50)=387$ into $f(100)=2f(50)+1$, we get $f(100)=2*387+1=775$.

So, $f(100)=775$. The answer is $\boxed{775}$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"The function $f$ is defined on the set of integers and satisfies \[f(n)= \begin{cases}  n-3 & \mbox{if }n\ge 1000 \\  f(f(n+5)) & \mbox{if }n<1000. \end{cases}\]Find $f(84)$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Denote by (1) and (2) the two parts of the definition of $f$, respectively. If we begin to use the definition of $f$ to compute $f(84)$, we use (2) until the argument is at least $1000$: \[f(84) = f(f(89)) = f(f(f(94))) = \dots = f^N(1004)\](where $f^N$ denotes composing $f$ with itself $N$ times, for some $N$). The numbers $84, 89, 94, \dots, 1004$ form an arithmetic sequence with common difference $5$; since $1004 - 84 = 920 = 184 \cdot 5$, this sequence has $184 + 1 = 185$ terms, so $N = 185$.

At this point, (1) and (2) are both used: we compute \[\begin{aligned} f^N(1004) &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-1}(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-1}(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(1000) \\ &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(997) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1002) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(999) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1004). \end{aligned}\]Repeating this process, we see that \[f^N(1004) = f^{N-2}(1004) = f^{N-4}(1004) = \dots = f^3(1004).\](The pattern breaks down for $f^k(1004)$ when $k$ is small, so it is not true that $f^3(1004) = f(1004)$.) Now, we have \[f^3(1004) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^2(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^2(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(1000) \stackrel{(1)}{=} \boxed{997}.\] The answer is $\boxed{997}$

To solve this problem, we can use a recursive approach. We start by setting $f(100)$ and calculating $f(f(100))$ using the second given equation. Then we calculate $f(f(f(100)))$ using the first equation and equating it to $8 \cdot 100 - 7$. From this equation, we can express $f(100)$ in terms of $f(f(100))$ and use the second equation to express $f(f(100))$ in terms of $f(100)$. This will give us an equation which we can solve for $f(100)$.

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we can use the second equation to find the value of $f(100)$.
We have $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. Let's set $n = 50$, then we get $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.
We can't directly find the value of $f(50)$ from the given information, so we need to find a way to relate $f(50)$ to a known value.
We can use the first equation to do this. We have $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. If we let $n = 25$, then we get $f(f(f(25))) = 8(25) - 7 = 193$.
But we know that $f(f(f(25))) = f(f(50))$, so $f(f(50)) = 193$.
Now we can use the second equation to find $f(50)$. We have $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. If we let $n = 25$, then we get $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.
We need to find the value of $f(25)$. We can use the first equation again. We have $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. If we let $n = 12.5$, but $n$ must be an integer, so we must have made a mistake in our calculation.
Let's go back and check our work. We found that $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$. We also found that $f(f(f(25))) = 193$, which means $f(f(50)) = 193$, so $f(50) = f(f^{-1}(193))$.
But we know that $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, so $f(f^{-1}(193)) = \frac{193 + 7}{8} = 24$.
Therefore, $f(50) = 24$, and we can substitute this into our equation for $f(100)$ to get $f(100) = 2(24) + 1 = 49$.
So the value of $f(100)$ is 49. The answer is: $49$

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


This problem is challenging because it involves a function that satisfies a complicated set of conditions. We can approach this problem by first trying to find the function for small input values and then look for a pattern.

Let's start by calculating the function for $f(1)$:
We know that $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$, and from the second condition, $f(2*1)=2*f(1)+1$. So we get $f(2)=2*f(1)+1$. But we don't know the value of $f(1)$, so we cannot directly solve for $f(1)$ from this equation. 

However, we can look at the first condition again. If $f(f(f(1)))=1$, then $f(f(1))$ must be an input that gives an output of 1 in the function defined by the second condition. The smallest such input is 1 itself, because $f(2*1)=f(2)$ gives an output that is greater than 1 (since $f(2)=2*f(1)+1>1$) and therefore cannot be 1. So we have $f(f(1))=1$. 

If $f(f(1))=1$, then from the second condition again, we have $f(2)=2*f(1)+1=1$. Solving this equation gives $f(1)=0$. 

Now that we have found $f(1)$, we can find $f(2)$ using the second condition: $f(2)=2*f(1)+1=2*0+1=1$. 

We can continue this process to find $f(3)$, $f(4)$, etc. By doing this, we find that $f(n)=n-1$ for all positive integers $n$. 

Finally, we can calculate $f(100)$ using the function we found: $f(100)=100-1=99$.

So the value of $f(100)$ is 99. The answer is $\boxed{99}$.

\[\frac{f(n) f(m + 1)}{f(m)} + \frac{f(n) f(n - m)}{f(n - m - 1)} = f(n + 1)\]for all nonnegative integers $n$ and $m,$ where $n \ge m + 1.$

Find the smallest nonnegative integer $n$ such that $f(n) > 10^6.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Setting $m = n - 1$ in the given functional equation, we get
\[\frac{f(n) \cdot f(n)}{f(n - 1)} + f(n) = f(n + 1),\]for all $n \ge 1.$  Then
\[\frac{f(n)}{f(n - 1)} + 1 = \frac{f(n + 1)}{f(n)}.\]Let $g(n) = \frac{f(n)}{f(n - 1)}$ for $n \ge 1.$  Then $g(1) = \frac{f(1)}{f(0)} = 1,$ and
\[g(n) + 1 = g(n + 1).\]Then $g(n) = n$ for all $n \ge 1.$  Hence,
\[g(n) g(n - 1) \dotsm g(2) g(1) = \frac{f(n)}{f(n - 1)} \cdot \frac{f(n - 1)}{f(n - 2)} \dotsm \frac{f(2)}{f(1)} \cdot \frac{f(1)}{f(0)},\]which simplifies to
\[n(n - 1) \dotsm (2)(1) = \frac{f(n)}{f(0)}.\]Therefore, $f(n) = n!$ for all $n \ge 1.$

Since $f(9) = 9! = 326880$ and $f(10) = 10! = 3628800,$ the smallest such $n$ is $\boxed{10}.$ The answer is $\boxed{10}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we can use a recursive function to calculate $f(100)$ using the given conditions. Here is a Python function `f(n)` that implements the function described by the problem:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def f(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 3
    elif n % 2 == 0:
        return 2 * f(n // 2) + 1
    else:
        return 8 * n - 7

result = f(100)
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 775

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
775
```
The value of $f(100)$ is $775$. Therefore, $f(100) = 775$. The answer is: $775$.
