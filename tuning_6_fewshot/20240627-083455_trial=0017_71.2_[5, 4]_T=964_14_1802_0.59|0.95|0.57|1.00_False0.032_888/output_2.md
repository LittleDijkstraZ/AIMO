 The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is a piecewise function with $4$ cases to consider:
1. When $x-1 \geq 2$, the equation becomes $\vert x-1-2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\vert x-3 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. This gives two equations: $x-3=\frac{m}{100}$ and $x-3=-\frac{m}{100}$. Solving these gives $x=3+\frac{m}{100}$ and $x=3-\frac{m}{100}$.
2. When $1 < x-1 < 2$, the equation becomes $\vert -(x-1)-2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\vert -x+1-2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, and further simplifies to $\vert -x-1 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. This gives two equations: $-x-1=\frac{m}{100}$ and $-x-1=-\frac{m}{100}$. Solving these gives $x=-1-\frac{m}{100}$ and $x=-1+\frac{m}{100}$.
3. When $x-1 \leq 1$, the equation becomes $\vert 1-x-2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\vert -x-1 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. This gives two equations: $-x-1=\frac{m}{100}$ and $-x-1=-\frac{m}{100}$. Solving these gives $x=-1-\frac{m}{100}$ and $x=-1+\frac{m}{100}$.

For the equation to have $4$ distinct solutions, the values of $x$ from the first and third cases must be different from the values of $x$ from the second case. This means that $3+\frac{m}{100} \neq -1+\frac{m}{100}$, or $4=\frac{2m}{100}$, or $m=200$.

Therefore, there is only $1$ positive integer $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. The answer is: $1$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, we need to understand that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. This means that the right-hand side $\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal to 2.
2. To make this happen, we need to find the value of $m$ such that $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. Solving for $m$ gives us $m = 200$.

So the only positive integer value of $m$ that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions is 200.

The answer is: $200$.

The perfect squares in the list are $1^2, 2^2, \dots, 10^2,$ so there are $10$ perfect squares, and \[100 - 10 = \boxed{90}\]integers which are not perfect squares. The answer is $\boxed{90}$

**Solution:**


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $2$. This is because the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, can take on values in the range $[-2, 1]$ for $x$, and the absolute value of this expression is equal to $\frac{m}{100}$. Therefore, we have $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which implies $100 < m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are precisely the integers from $101$ to $199$, inclusive. The number of such integers is $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$.

**Solution:** 



The problem is asking for how many positive integers $m$ the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. 

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be rewritten as $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.

The number of solutions of this equation is determined by the number of times the graph of $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ intersects the line $y = \frac{m}{100}$.

The graph of $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a V-shape with the vertices at $(1-2,0) = (-1,0)$, $(1,0)$, and $(1+2,0) = (3,0)$.

The line $y = \frac{m}{100}$ is a horizontal line that intersects the y-axis at $y = \frac{m}{100}$.

For the equation to have $4$ distinct solutions, the line $y = \frac{m}{100}$ must intersect the graph of $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ at $4$ distinct points. This happens when $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $0$ and $2$, or in other words, when $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$.

Solving the inequality $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$ gives $0 < m < 200$.

The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from $1$ to $199$.

Therefore, the number of such positive integers $m$ is $199$.

However, we need to check if the number of solutions is indeed $4$ for each of these $m$.

For $m=1$, the equation becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{1}{100}$, which has $4$ solutions.

For $m=2$, the equation becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{2}{100}$, which also has $4$ solutions.

We can continue this process for all $m$ from $1$ to $199$, and we will find that for each $m$, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ solutions.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $199$.

However, this is not the correct answer. The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ that the equation has $4$ distinct solutions, not the values of $m$ themselves.

The correct answer is $1$.

The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $1$.
The answer is $\boxed{1}$.

To solve this problem, we first need to understand the structure of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. The left-hand side of the equation is a piecewise function with four cases depending on the value of $x$. The right-hand side of the equation is a constant that we can adjust to control the number of solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have four distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}=1$. Solving for $m$ gives $m=100$.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is $1$.
The answer is $\boxed{1}$.

**Solution:** 



To solve the problem, we need to determine the value of $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. 

First, we can notice that the right-hand side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be positive, so $m$ must be positive. 

Next, we can consider the graph of $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. This function has a "V" shape, with the vertex of the "V" at $x = 1$. The function is equal to $2 - \vert x-1 \vert$ for $x \leq 1$ and $\vert x-1 \vert - 2$ for $x \geq 1$. 

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have $4$ distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is the height of the "V" shape at a point where the "V" intersects the line $y = \frac{m}{100}$. 

The "V" shape intersects the line $y = \frac{m}{100}$ at $y = 1$ and $y = 3$, so $\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal to $1$ or $3$. 

If $\frac{m}{100} = 1$, then $m = 100$. If $\frac{m}{100} = 3$, then $m = 300$. 

So, the value of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $m = 100$ or $m = 300$. However, we need to determine the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy this condition. 

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $2$.
The answer is $\boxed{2}$.

**Solution:** 



We will use the property of absolute value function to solve this problem. The function $|x - 1| - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if the equation $|x - 1| = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions and the equation $|x - 1| = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ has 2 distinct solutions.

We can solve the first equation $|x - 1| = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ as follows:

1. If $2 + \frac{m}{100} > 0$, then $x - 1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x - 1 = -(2 + \frac{m}{100})$.
2. Solving $x - 1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ gives $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.
3. Solving $x - 1 = -(2 + \frac{m}{100})$ gives $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

So the first equation has 2 distinct solutions if and only if $3 + \frac{m}{100} > -1 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $m > -50$.

Similarly, we can solve the second equation $|x - 1| = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ as follows:

1. If $2 - \frac{m}{100} > 0$, then $x - 1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ or $x - 1 = -(2 - \frac{m}{100})$.
2. Solving $x - 1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ gives $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
3. Solving $x - 1 = -(2 - \frac{m}{100})$ gives $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

So the second equation has 2 distinct solutions if and only if $3 - \frac{m}{100} > -1 + \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $m < 50$.

Therefore, the equation $|x - 1| - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $-50 < m < 50$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are $1$ to $49$, inclusive. So there are $49$ such positive integers $m$.

The value of $m$ for which the equation has exactly four distinct solutions is 49. The answer is: 49

To solve this problem, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly four distinct solutions. 

Let's start by analyzing the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. The right-hand side $\frac{m}{100}$ must be a positive number, so $m$ must be a positive integer. The number of solutions to this equation will depend on the value of $\frac{m}{100}$.

When $\frac{m}{100} < 2$, the equation simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which has two solutions.

When $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, the equation simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$, which has two solutions.

When $2 < \frac{m}{100} < 3$, the equation simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which has four solutions.

When $\frac{m}{100} = 3$, the equation simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = 3$, which has two solutions.

When $\frac{m}{100} > 3$, the equation simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which has two solutions.

Therefore, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100} = 2 + \epsilon$ for some small positive $\epsilon$. This means $\frac{m}{100} = 2 + \epsilon$ should be in the range $2 < \frac{m}{100} < 3$. 

This gives us $200 < m < 300$, so the possible values of $m$ are the integers from 201 to 299, inclusive. The number of these integers is $299 - 201 + 1 = 99$.

Therefore, there are 99 positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly four distinct solutions.

The answer is: $99$

Assistant:

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is less than 2 but greater than or equal to 0. This is because the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, oscillates between 0 and 4 as $x$ varies over the real numbers, and it equals $\frac{m}{100}$ exactly 4 times if $\frac{m}{100}$ is in the interval $[0, 2)$. Therefore, we want to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $0 \leq \frac{m}{100} < 2$. This is equivalent to finding the number of positive integers $m$ in the interval $[0, 200)$. The answer is the number of integers from 1 to 200, which is 200. However, we must exclude 0 since $\frac{m}{100}$ cannot be equal to 0. So the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition is 200 - 1 = 199. The value of $m$ that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions is 199. The answer is: $199$

## QUESTION 2 - 13 
- TIME_SPENT : 409 secs

13_
**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many solutions does the equation \[\frac{(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)\dotsm(x-100)}{(x-1^2)(x-2^2)(x-3^2)\dotsm(x-100^2)} = 0\]have for $x$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Any solution to this equation must make the numerator of the left-hand side zero, while keeping the denominator non-zero. The numerator is zero when $x$ is one of the numbers $1, 2, 3, \dots, 100.$ However, for any value in this list that is a perfect square, the denominator will also be zero, so that value of $x$ will not be a root. Therefore, we want to find the number of integers in the list $1, 2, \dots, 100$ which are not perfect squares. The perfect squares in the list are $1^2, 2^2, \dots, 10^2,$ so there are $10$ perfect squares, and \[100 - 10 = \boxed{90}\]integers which are not perfect squares. The answer is $\boxed{90}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we need to find the value of $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

We know that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be rewritten as a piecewise function:

\[
\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100} \Rightarrow
\begin{cases}
\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}, & \text{if } \vert x-1 \vert -2 \geq 0 \\
-(\vert x-1 \vert -2) = \frac{m}{100}, & \text{if } \vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0
\end{cases}
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\begin{cases}
\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}, & \text{if } \vert x-1 \vert -2 \geq 0 \\
\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}, & \text{if } \vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0
\end{cases}
\]

This further simplifies to:

\[
\begin{cases}
x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100} \text{ or } x-1 = -(2 + \frac{m}{100}), & \text{if } x \geq 1 \\
x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100} \text{ or } x-1 = -(2 - \frac{m}{100}), & \text{if } x < 1
\end{cases}
\]

Solving these equations gives us the solutions for $x$. The number of distinct solutions will be 4 if and only if the following conditions are met:

1. The equation $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ has one solution greater than or equal to 1.
2. The equation $x-1 = -(2 + \frac{m}{100})$ has one solution less than 1.
3. The equation $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ has one solution less than 1.
4. The equation $x-1 = -(2 - \frac{m}{100})$ has one solution greater than or equal to 1.

These conditions are met if and only if $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Thus, the value of $m$ we are looking for is $200$.

Therefore, the value of $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is $200$. The answer is: $200$
