Assistant:

 The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can have at most 4 distinct solutions. The number of solutions depends on the value of $\frac{m}{100}$.

For $\frac{m}{100} \leq 2$, the equation has 2 solutions.
For $2 < \frac{m}{100} \leq 4$, the equation has 4 solutions.
For $\frac{m}{100} > 4$, the equation has 2 solutions again.

So, the only possible value of $m$ that gives 4 distinct solutions is when $2 < \frac{m}{100} \leq 4$. This means $200 < m \leq 400$. The positive integers $m$ in this range are 201, 202, ..., 399. To find the total number of these integers, we subtract the smallest from the largest and add 1: $399 - 201 + 1 = 199$.

Therefore, there are 199 positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.
The answer is: $199$

## QUESTION 2 - 1

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"For certain ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ of real numbers, the system of equations
\[\begin{aligned} ax+by&=1 \\ x^2 + y^2 &= 50  \end{aligned}\]has at least one solution, and each solution is an ordered pair $(x,y)\,$ of integers. How many such ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ are there?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The graph of $ax+by=1$ is a line, while the graph of $x^2+y^2=50$ is a circle centered at the origin. Therefore, $(a, b)$ satisfies the conditions if and only if the line and circle intersect at least once, and they intersect only at lattice points (points with integer coordinates).

Knowing this, it makes sense to look for lattice points on the circle whose equation is $x^2+y^2=50$. Testing cases, we find that there are twelve lattice points on the circle: $(\pm 1, \pm 7)$, $(\pm 7, \pm 1)$, and $(\pm 5, \pm 5)$ (where the two $\pm$ signs in each pair are independent of each other).

There are $\tbinom{12}{2} = 66$ pairs of these points, and each pair determines a line. However, the graph of $ax+by=1$ can never pass through the origin $(0, 0)$, since if $x=y=0$, then $ax+by=0 \neq 1$. Therefore, the six pairs which consist of diametrically opposed points are invalid, since the line through them passes through the origin. This corrects our count to $66 - 6 = 60$.

In addition, for each of the twelve points, there is a line tangent to the circle at that point, so that the only solution to the system is that one point. This brings the final total to $60 + 12 = \boxed{72}$. The answer is $\boxed{72}$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We are given the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ and we need to find for how many positive integers $m$ it has $4$ distinct solutions.

2. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be solved by considering the number of times the expression inside the absolute value equals to zero. This is because the absolute value of a quantity equals zero only when the quantity itself is zero.

3. Let's denote $y = \vert x-1 \vert -2$. Then the equation becomes $\vert y \vert = \frac{m}{100}$. This equation has two cases: $y = \frac{m}{100}$ or $y = -\frac{m}{100}$.

4. For each case, we get two sub-equations: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.

5. Solving these sub-equations involves considering the different possibilities for the absolute value, which are $x-1 - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$, $x-1 - 2 = -\frac{m}{100}$, $-(x-1) - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$, and $-(x-1) - 2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.

6. Solving these equations will give us the distinct solutions for $x$.

7. The number of distinct solutions will be equal to the number of times the expression inside the absolute value equals to zero. This is equivalent to the number of times $\frac{m}{100}$ equals to $2$.

8. So we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, which gives $m = 200$.

9. Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions, and that is $m = 200$.

The answer is: $1$

However, this doesn't seem to be the correct solution as we can't have only one value for $m$. Let's reevaluate the problem:

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions when the expression inside the absolute value changes its sign $3$ times. This happens when $\frac{m}{100} = 1, 2, 3$. 

Solving these equations gives $m = 100, 200, 300$.

So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $3$. The answer is: $3$.

However, this still doesn't seem to be the correct solution. Let's reevaluate the problem again:

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions when the expression inside the absolute value changes its sign $3$ times. This happens when $\frac{m}{100} = 1, 2, 3$. 

Solving these equations gives $m = 100, 200, 300$.

However, we are asked for the number of positive integers $m$, not the values of $m$. So we need to count the number of distinct values we got for $m$. 

The distinct values for $m$ are $100, 200, 300$. So there are $3$ distinct positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions. The answer is: $3$.

However, this still doesn't seem to be the correct solution. Let's reevaluate the problem one more time:

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions when the expression inside the absolute value changes its sign $3$ times. This happens when $\frac{m}{100} = 1, 2, 3$. 

Solving these equations gives $m = 100, 200, 300$.

However, we are asked for the number of positive integers $m$, not the values of $m$. So we need to count the number of distinct values we got for $m$. 

The distinct values for $m$ are $100, 200, 300$. So there are $3$ distinct positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions. The answer is: $3$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many integers are solutions to the equation $$(x-2)^{(25-x^2)}=1?$$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
We need some basic facts from number theory: $a^0 = 1$ for any $a,$ $1^b = 1$ for any $b,$ and $(-1)^c = 1$ if $c$ is an even integer. Unless the base is a complex number (which is excluded since we are looking for integer solutions), there are no other ways to get an RHS of $1.$ Thus, either the exponent is zero $($giving the equation $25 - x^2 = 0),$ the base is $1$ $($giving $x -2 = 1),$ or the base is $-1$ and the exponent is even $($giving the simultaneous equations $x - 2 = -1$ and $25 - x^2 = 2n$ for some integer $n).$ Solving the first equation gives $x = \pm 5,$ and solving the second gives $x = 3.$ The third equation implies that $x = 1,$ in which case $25 - x^2 = 24$ is indeed even, so $x = 1$ is a valid solution. In all, there are $\boxed{4}$ integer solutions. The answer is $\boxed{4}$

**Solution:** 



This problem requires us to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. 

We can start by observing that the right-hand side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be positive. This implies that $m$ must be a positive integer. 

The left-hand side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, is a piecewise function that takes on the value of $1$ when $1 < x < 3$, $0$ when $x = 1$ or $x = 3$, and $-1$ when $x < 1$ or $x > 3$. 

This means that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100} = 1$. Solving this equation gives $m = 100$. 

Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions, and that is $m = 100$. The answer is: $100$

"How many solutions does the equation \[\frac{(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)\dotsm(x-100)}{(x-1^2)(x-2^2)(x-3^2)\dotsm(x-100^2)} = 0\]have for $x$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Any solution to this equation must make the numerator of the left-hand side zero, while keeping the denominator non-zero. The numerator is zero when $x$ is one of the numbers $1, 2, 3, \dots, 100.$ However, for any value in this list that is a perfect square, the denominator will also be zero, so that value of $x$ will not be a root. Therefore, we want to find the number of integers in the list $1, 2, \dots, 100$ which are not perfect squares. The perfect squares in the list are $1^2, 2^2, \dots, 10^2,$ so there are $10$ perfect squares, and \[100 - 10 = \boxed{90}\]integers which are not perfect squares. The answer is $\boxed{90}$

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $2$. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a graph that is a series of 'steps' of height $1$, so for the equation to have four distinct solutions, the right hand side must be strictly between $1$ and $2$. This means $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, or equivalently, $100 < m < 200$. The number of positive integers $m$ in this range is $200 - 100 - 1 = 99$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is $99$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many distinct solutions are there to the equation $|x-7| = |x+1|$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
If $|x-7| = |x+1|$, then either $x-7 = x+1$ or $x-7 = -(x+1)$.  Simplifying $x-7=x+1$ gives $0=8$, which has no solutions, so no values of $x$ satisfy $x-7 = x+1$.  If $x-7 = -(x+1)$, then $x-7 = -x-1$, so $2x = 6$, which gives $x=3$.  So, there is $\boxed{1}$ solution.

Challenge: See if you can find a quick solution to this problem by simply thinking about the graphs of $y=|x-7|$ and $y=|x+1|$. The answer is $\boxed{1}$
