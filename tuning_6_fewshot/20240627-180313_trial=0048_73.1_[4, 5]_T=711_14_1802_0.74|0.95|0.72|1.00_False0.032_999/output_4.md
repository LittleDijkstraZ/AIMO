"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."

Assistant:

 To solve this problem, we need to find the value of $f(100)$ given the two conditions for the function $f$. 

First, let's try to find some values of the function $f$ by substituting some small values into the given conditions.

For $n=1$, we have $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$. This implies $f(f(1))=1$.
Since $f(f(1))=1$, we have $f(1)=1$.

For $n=2$, we have $f(f(f(2)))=8*2-7=9$. This implies $f(f(2))=9$.
Using $f(1)=1$, we can find $f(2)$ by substituting $n=1$ into the second condition: $f(2*1)=2f(1)+1 \Rightarrow f(2)=2*1+1=3$.

For $n=3$, we have $f(f(f(3)))=8*3-7=17$. This implies $f(f(3))=17$.
Using $f(2)=3$, we can find $f(3)$ by substituting $n=2$ into the second condition: $f(2*2)=2f(2)+1 \Rightarrow f(4)=2*3+1=7$.
Using $f(3)=7$, we can find $f(6)$ by substituting $n=3$ into the second condition: $f(2*3)=2f(3)+1 \Rightarrow f(6)=2*7+1=15$.
Using $f(6)=15$, we can find $f(9)$ by substituting $n=6$ into the second condition: $f(2*6)=2f(6)+1 \Rightarrow f(12)=2*15+1=31$.
Using $f(9)=31$, we can find $f(18)$ by substituting $n=9$ into the second condition: $f(2*9)=2f(9)+1 \Rightarrow f(18)=2*31+1=63$.
Using $f(18)=63$, we can find $f(27)$ by substituting $n=18$ into the second condition: $f(2*18)=2f(18)+1 \Rightarrow f(36)=2*63+1=127$.
Using $f(27)=127$, we can find $f(81)$ by substituting $n=27$ into the second condition: $f(2*27)=2f(27)+1 \Rightarrow f(54)=2*127+1=255$.

From these calculations, we can see that the function $f$ seems to be increasing very fast. It seems that $f(n)$ is equal to $2^n-1$ for $n$ up to 5. 

Let's check if this pattern holds for $n=4$. Using $f(3)=7$, we can find $f(12)$ by substituting $n=3$ into the second condition: $f(2*3)=2f(3)+1 \Rightarrow f(6)=2*7+1=15$. This is indeed $2^3-1=7$, so the pattern holds for $n=4$.

Now, let's try to prove by induction that $f(n)=2^n-1$ for all $n$.

Base case: We have already shown that $f(1)=1=2^1-1$, $f(2)=3=2^2-1$, and $f(3)=7=2^3-1$.

Inductive step: Assume that $f(k)=2^k-1$ for some $k \geq 3$. We need to show that $f(k+1)=2^{k+1}-1$.

Using the second condition, we have $f(2k)=2f(k)+1$. Substituting our inductive hypothesis, we get $f(2k)=2(2^k-1)+1=2^{k+1}-1$. Since $k+1=\frac{2k}{2}$, we have $f(k+1)=f\left(\frac{2k}{2}\right)=f(2k)=2^{k+1}-1$. This completes the inductive step.

By induction, we have proven that $f(n)=2^n-1$ for all $n$.

Finally, we can find $f(100)$ by substituting $n=100$ into this formula: $f(100)=2^{100}-1$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"The function $f$ is defined on the set of integers and satisfies \[f(n)= \begin{cases}  n-3 & \mbox{if }n\ge 1000 \\  f(f(n+5)) & \mbox{if }n<1000. \end{cases}\]Find $f(84)$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Denote by (1) and (2) the two parts of the definition of $f$, respectively. If we begin to use the definition of $f$ to compute $f(84)$, we use (2) until the argument is at least $1000$: \[f(84) = f(f(89)) = f(f(f(94))) = \dots = f^N(1004)\](where $f^N$ denotes composing $f$ with itself $N$ times, for some $N$). The numbers $84, 89, 94, \dots, 1004$ form an arithmetic sequence with common difference $5$; since $1004 - 84 = 920 = 184 \cdot 5$, this sequence has $184 + 1 = 185$ terms, so $N = 185$.

At this point, (1) and (2) are both used: we compute \[\begin{aligned} f^N(1004) &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-1}(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-1}(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(1000) \\ &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(997) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1002) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(999) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1004). \end{aligned}\]Repeating this process, we see that \[f^N(1004) = f^{N-2}(1004) = f^{N-4}(1004) = \dots = f^3(1004).\](The pattern breaks down for $f^k(1004)$ when $k$ is small, so it is not true that $f^3(1004) = f(1004)$.) Now, we have \[f^3(1004) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^2(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^2(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(1000) \stackrel{(1)}{=} \boxed{997}.\] The answer is $\boxed{997}$

**Solution:** 



To find $f(100)$, we first need to find $f(f(100))$ and $f(2 \cdot 50) = 2f(50) + 1$. Then we can use the first equation to find $f(f(f(50))) = 8 \cdot 50 - 7 = 393$. Continuing, we can find $f(f(50))$ and $f(100)$.

Let's use Python to solve this problem:

The value of $f(100)$ is not an integer, which contradicts the given conditions. Let's try another approach.

Let's use mathematical reasoning to solve this problem.

From $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we can find $f(f(n))$ by setting $n=f(n)$: $f(f(f(f(n)))) = f(8n-7) \implies f(8n-7) = 8f(n) - 7$.

Then, substitute $n = f(n)$ into $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$: $f(2f(n)) = 2f(f(n)) + 1$.

Now, substitute $n = f(n)$ into the equation $f(8n-7) = 8f(n) - 7$: $f(8f(n) - 7) = 8f(f(n)) - 7$.

Comparing this equation with $f(2f(n)) = 2f(f(n)) + 1$, we can see that they are the same when $8f(n) - 7 = 2f(n) + 1$, which simplifies to $6f(n) = 8$, so $f(n) = \frac{4}{3}$. But this does not satisfy $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"The function $f(n)$ is defined on the positive integers such that $f(f(n)) = 2n$ and $f(4n + 1) = 4n + 3$ for all positive integers $n.$  Find $f(1000).$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Consider the expression $f(f(f(a))).$  Since $f(f(a)) = 2a,$ this is equal to $f(2a).$  But taking $n = f(a)$ in $f(f(n)) = 2n,$ we get
\[f(f(f(a))) = 2f(a).\]Hence,
\[f(2a) = 2f(a)\]for all positive integers $a.$

Then
\[f(1000) = 2f(500) = 4f(250) = 8f(125).\]Taking $n = 31$ in $f(4n + 1) = 4n + 3,$ we get
\[f(125) = 127,\]so $f(1000) = \boxed{1016}.$ The answer is $\boxed{1016}$

The solution provided is incorrect because it attempts to solve the given equations directly and doesn't take into account the recursive nature of the function $f$. Instead, we need to use the given equations to deduce some properties of the function $f$ and use these properties to find $f(100)$.

From the first equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, we can deduce that $f$ is a one-to-one function, meaning that each value of $f(n)$ corresponds to exactly one value of $n$. From the second equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, we can deduce that $f$ is an increasing function, since $f(2n)$ is always greater than $f(n)$.

Now, let's try to find $f(1)$. From the second equation, we have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. But from the first equation, we also have $f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = -1$. Since $f$ is one-to-one and increasing, this means that $f(1)$ must be the only value such that $f(f(f(1))) = -1$. Therefore, we must have $f(1) = 1$.

Now we can use the second equation to find $f(2)$: $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2*1 + 1 = 3$.

Similarly, we can find $f(3)$: $f(3) = 2f(1.5) + 1$. But $f(1.5)$ cannot be an integer, so we must have a mistake in our reasoning. Let's try to find $f(4)$ instead: $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2*3 + 1 = 7$.

Continuing in this way, we can find $f(5) = 2f(2.5) + 1 = 2*4 + 1 = 9$, $f(6) = 2f(3) + 1 = 2*7 + 1 = 15$, and so on. By observing the pattern, we can conjecture that $f(n) = 2n - 1$ for all positive integers $n$.

Now we can check if this conjecture satisfies the given equations:
1. For the first equation, $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$: If $f(n) = 2n - 1$, then $f(f(f(n))) = f(f(2n - 1)) = f(2(2n - 1) - 1) = f(4n - 3) = 2(4n - 3) - 1 = 8n - 7$.
2. For the second equation, $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$: If $f(n) = 2n - 1$, then $f(2n) = 2(2n - 1) - 1 = 4n - 3 = 2(2n - 1) + 1 = 2f(n) + 1$.

Since both equations are satisfied by the conjecture $f(n) = 2n - 1$, we conclude that $f(100) = 2*100 - 1 = 199$.

So, the value of $f(100)$ is 199. The answer is $\boxed{199}$.

At this point, (1) and (2) are both used: we compute \[\begin{aligned} f^N(1004) &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-1}(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-1}(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(1000) \\ &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(997) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1002) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(999) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1004). \end{aligned}\]Repeating this process, we see that \[f^N(1004) = f^{N-2}(1004) = f^{N-4}(1004) = \dots = f^3(1004).\](The pattern breaks down for $f^k(1004)$ when $k$ is small, so it is not true that $f^3(1004) = f(1004)$.) Now, we have \[f^3(1004) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^2(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^2(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(1000) \stackrel{(1)}{=} \boxed{997}.\] The answer is $\boxed{997}$

**Problem**
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step.

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



To find $f(100)$, we first need to use the second equation from the problem statement, which is $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. We can apply this equation repeatedly to express $f(100)$ in terms of $f(50)$, $f(25)$, and so on, until we reach $f(1)$, for which we know the value from the first equation in the problem statement.

We start with $f(100)$ and apply the equation repeatedly:

\[f(100) = 2f(50) + 1.\]
\[f(50) = 2f(25) + 1.\]
\[f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1,\]

but we can't go any further because $12.5$ is not a positive integer. So we need to find a way to express $f(12.5)$ in terms of $f$ of an integer. We notice that $12.5 = \frac{25}{2}$, so we can write

\[f(25) = 2f\left(\frac{25}{2}\right) + 1.\]

Now we apply the first equation from the problem statement, which is $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, to find $f\left(\frac{25}{2}\right)$. We set $n = \frac{25}{2}$ and solve for $f\left(\frac{25}{2}\right)$:

\[f(f(f\left(\frac{25}{2}\right))) = 8\left(\frac{25}{2}\right) - 7 = 100 - 7 = 93.\]

So, we have

\[f(25) = 2f\left(\frac{25}{2}\right) + 1 = 2(93) + 1 = 186 + 1 = 187.\]

Now we substitute $f(25) = 187$ into the equation for $f(50)$:

\[f(50) = 2f(25) + 1 = 2(187) + 1 = 374 + 1 = 375.\]

Finally, we substitute $f(50) = 375$ into the equation for $f(100)$:

\[f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2(375) + 1 = 750 + 1 = 751.\]

So, $f(100) = 751$. The answer is $\boxed{751}$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $f$ be a function taking the nonnegative integers to the positive integers such that $f(0) = f(1) = 1$ and
\[\frac{f(n) f(m + 1)}{f(m)} + \frac{f(n) f(n - m)}{f(n - m - 1)} = f(n + 1)\]for all nonnegative integers $n$ and $m,$ where $n \ge m + 1.$

Find the smallest nonnegative integer $n$ such that $f(n) > 10^6.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Setting $m = n - 1$ in the given functional equation, we get
\[\frac{f(n) \cdot f(n)}{f(n - 1)} + f(n) = f(n + 1),\]for all $n \ge 1.$  Then
\[\frac{f(n)}{f(n - 1)} + 1 = \frac{f(n + 1)}{f(n)}.\]Let $g(n) = \frac{f(n)}{f(n - 1)}$ for $n \ge 1.$  Then $g(1) = \frac{f(1)}{f(0)} = 1,$ and
\[g(n) + 1 = g(n + 1).\]Then $g(n) = n$ for all $n \ge 1.$  Hence,
\[g(n) g(n - 1) \dotsm g(2) g(1) = \frac{f(n)}{f(n - 1)} \cdot \frac{f(n - 1)}{f(n - 2)} \dotsm \frac{f(2)}{f(1)} \cdot \frac{f(1)}{f(0)},\]which simplifies to
\[n(n - 1) \dotsm (2)(1) = \frac{f(n)}{f(0)}.\]Therefore, $f(n) = n!$ for all $n \ge 1.$

Since $f(9) = 9! = 326880$ and $f(10) = 10! = 3628800,$ the smallest such $n$ is $\boxed{10}.$ The answer is $\boxed{10}$

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."

**Solution:** 



To solve the problem, we can start by observing the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We can infer that $f(n)$ is an increasing function. 

Given $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we can substitute $m = f(n)$ to simplify the equation to $f(f(m)) = 8 \cdot f^{-1}(m) - 7$. 

Now let's consider the first few values of $f(n)$:

- $f(1)$ must be a positive integer, so $f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = 1$. This implies $f(f(1)) = 1$, so $f(1) = 1$.
- Using $f(1) = 1$, we can find $f(f(2)) = 8*2 - 7 = 9$. This implies $f(2) = 3$.
- Using $f(2) = 3$, we can find $f(f(3)) = 8*3 - 7 = 17$. This implies $f(3) = 5$.

By continuing this process, we can find $f(4) = 7$, $f(5) = 9$, $f(6) = 11$, and so on. 

We can observe a pattern that $f(n) = 2n - 1$ for all positive integers $n$. 

Now we can check if this pattern satisfies the original conditions:

- $f(f(f(n))) = f(f(2n - 1)) = 2f(2n - 1) - 1 = 2(2(2n - 1) - 1) - 1 = 8n - 7$.
- $f(2n) = 2(2n - 1) + 1 = 2n + 1 = 2f(n) + 1$.

So the pattern $f(n) = 2n - 1$ satisfies both conditions. 

Finally, we can calculate $f(100)$ using the pattern: $f(100) = 2*100 - 1 = 199$.

The value of $f(100)$ is 199. The answer is: $199$

"The function $f(n)$ is defined on the positive integers such that $f(f(n)) = 2n$ and $f(4n + 1) = 4n + 3$ for all positive integers $n.$  Find $f(1000).$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Consider the expression $f(f(f(a))).$  Since $f(f(a)) = 2a,$ this is equal to $f(2a).$  But taking $n = f(a)$ in $f(f(n)) = 2n,$ we get
\[f(f(f(a))) = 2f(a).\]Hence,
\[f(2a) = 2f(a)\]for all positive integers $a.$

Then
\[f(1000) = 2f(500) = 4f(250) = 8f(125).\]Taking $n = 31$ in $f(4n + 1) = 4n + 3,$ we get
\[f(125) = 127,\]so $f(1000) = \boxed{1016}.$ The answer is $\boxed{1016}$

**Solution:** 



We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. From this, we can see that $f(f(n))$ is an increasing function, and since the range of positive integers is mapped to positive integers, $f(n)$ must also be an increasing function. Additionally, $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ tells us that $f(n)$ is an odd function.

We can start by finding $f(1)$ using the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. Setting $n=1$, we have $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$, so $f(f(1))=1$ and thus $f(1)=1$.

Next, we can use $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to find $f(2)$ by setting $n=1$, giving $f(2)=2f(1)+1=2*1+1=3$.

Continuing this process, we can find $f(3)$ by setting $n=\frac{3}{2}$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. This gives $f(f(f(\frac{3}{2})))=8*\frac{3}{2}-7=5$, so $f(f(\frac{3}{2}))=5$ and thus $f( \frac{3}{2})=5$. However, this contradicts our earlier finding that $f(n)$ is an odd function, as $f(1)=1$ is odd while $f(\frac{3}{2})=5$ is not. This suggests that we have made a mistake in our previous steps.

Let's go back and check our work. We noticed that $f(f(n))$ is an increasing function and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. The second equation implies that $f(n)$ is an odd function. From $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we know that $f(f(n))$ is also an increasing function. Combining these two facts, we can conclude that $f(n)$ itself must be an increasing odd function.

We started by setting $n=1$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, and found that $f(1)=1$. Then we set $n=1$ in the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ and found that $f(2)=3$. Continuing this process, we found that $f(3)=5$.

Now, we can use the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to find $f(6)$ by setting $n=3$, giving $f(6)=2f(3)+1=2*5+1=11$. Then, we can use the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to find $f(11)$ by setting $n=6$, giving $f(11)=8*6-7=45$.

Finally, we can use the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to find $f(22)$ by setting $n=11$, giving $f(22)=2f(11)+1=2*45+1=91$. We can continue this process to find larger values of $f(n)$, but we notice that the values of $f(n)$ are getting larger very quickly. This suggests that we might be missing some important pattern or relationship.

Let's go back and look at the original problem statement again. We are given that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. The first equation tells us that $f(n)$ is a cubic function of the form $f(n)=an^3+bn^2+cn+d$. Setting $n=1$ in this equation, we get $f(1)=a+b+c+d$. But we know from our previous work that $f(1)=1$, so $a+b+c+d=1$.

The second equation tells us that $f(n)$ is an odd function, so $f(-n)=-f(n)$. Setting $n=-1$ in the cubic equation, we get $f(-1)=-a+b-c+d$. But since $f(-1)=-f(1)=-1$, we have $-a+b-c+d=-1$.

Subtracting these two equations, we get $2a+2c=2$, or $a+c=1$. This means that the cubic function $f(n)=an^3+bn^2+cn+d$ must be of the form $f(n)=an^3+bn^2+(1-a)n+d$.

Now, we can use the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to find the coefficients $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$. Setting $n=1$ in this equation, we get $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$, so $f(f(1))=1$ and thus $f(1)=1$. This confirms our earlier finding that $f(1)=1$.

Setting $n=2$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we get $f(f(f(2)))=8*2-7=9$, so $f(f(2))=9$. But we know from our earlier work that $f(2)=3$, so $f(f(2))=f(3)=5$. This implies that $f(9)=5$.

Setting $n=3$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we get $f(f(f(3)))=8*3-7=17$, so $f(f(3))=17$. But we know from our earlier work that $f(3)=5$, so $f(f(3))=f(5)=17$. This implies that $f(17)=5$.

Finally, setting $n=5$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we get $f(f(f(5)))=8*5-7=33$, so $f(f(5))=33$. But we know from our earlier work that $f(5)=17$, so $f(f(5))=f(17)=5$. This implies that $f(33)=5$.

Continuing this process, we find that $f(65)=5$, $f(129)=5$, and so on. We notice that the values of $n$ for which $f(n)=5$ are of the form $n=3^k+2$. This suggests that the function $f(n)$ might be of the form $f(n)=5$ for $n=3^k+2$ and $f(n)=n^3+2$ for all other values of $n$.

To confirm this, we can substitute $f(n)=5$ for $n=3^k+2$ into the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and check that it holds true. For $n=3^k+2$, we have $f(f(f(n)))=f(f(5))=f(17)=5$, and $8n-7=8(3^k+2)-7=24^k+16-7=24^k+9$. Since $5=9$ is not possible, we must have made a mistake in our earlier work.

Let's go back and check our work again. We noticed that $f(f(n))$ is an increasing function and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. The second equation implies that $f(n)$ is an odd function. From $f(f

Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Denote by (1) and (2) the two parts of the definition of $f$, respectively. If we begin to use the definition of $f$ to compute $f(84)$, we use (2) until the argument is at least $1000$: \[f(84) = f(f(89)) = f(f(f(94))) = \dots = f^N(1004)\](where $f^N$ denotes composing $f$ with itself $N$ times, for some $N$). The numbers $84, 89, 94, \dots, 1004$ form an arithmetic sequence with common difference $5$; since $1004 - 84 = 920 = 184 \cdot 5$, this sequence has $184 + 1 = 185$ terms, so $N = 185$.

At this point, (1) and (2) are both used: we compute \[\begin{aligned} f^N(1004) &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-1}(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-1}(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(1000) \\ &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(997) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1002) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(999) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1004). \end{aligned}\]Repeating this process, we see that \[f^N(1004) = f^{N-2}(1004) = f^{N-4}(1004) = \dots = f^3(1004).\](The pattern breaks down for $f^k(1004)$ when $k$ is small, so it is not true that $f^3(1004) = f(1004)$.) Now, we have \[f^3(1004) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^2(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^2(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(1000) \stackrel{(1)}{=} \boxed{997}.\] The answer is $\boxed{997}$

**Solution:** 



We are given two equations for the function $f(n)$: $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We can start by trying to simplify the first equation by setting $n=1$: $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$. This tells us that $f(1)$ is a number such that when we apply the function $f$ three times, we get 1.

Now, let's try to use the second equation to find a relationship between $f(n)$ and $f(2n)$. Setting $n=1$ in the second equation gives $f(2)=2f(1)+1$. We can substitute $f(1)$ from the first equation into this equation: $f(2)=2*1+1=3$.

Next, let's try to use the second equation to find a relationship between $f(n)$ and $f(3n)$. Setting $n=2$ in the second equation gives $f(6)=2f(3)+1$. We can substitute $f(3)$ from the second equation with $n=1$: $f(6)=2*f(2)+1=2*3+1=7$.

Now, let's try to use the first equation to find $f(100)$. Setting $n=12$ in the first equation gives $f(f(f(12)))=8*12-7=88$. We can substitute $f(12)$ from the second equation with $n=6$: $f(12)=2f(6)+1=2*7+1=15$. Now we have $f(f(15))=88$.

Again, using the second equation, we can find $f(15)$: $f(15)=2f(7.5)+1$. But $f(7.5)$ is not an integer, so we cannot proceed this way. Instead, let's try to use the fact that $f(f(f(1)))=1$. Since $f(f(f(1)))=1$, we have $f(1)=x$, where $f(x)=1$. Substituting this into the second equation gives $f(2n)=2*1+1=3$, so $f(2)=3$. Similarly, we can find $f(3)=5$, $f(6)=7$, and so on.

After trying different values of $n$, we find that $f(100)=191$.

So, the value of $f(100)$ is 191. The answer is: $191$.

Let's think step by step:
Consider the expression $f(f(f(a))).$  Since $f(f(a)) = 2a,$ this is equal to $f(2a).$  But taking $n = f(a)$ in $f(f(n)) = 2n,$ we get
\[f(f(f(a))) = 2f(a).\]Hence,
\[f(2a) = 2f(a)\]for all positive integers $a.$

Then
\[f(1000) = 2f(500) = 4f(250) = 8f(125).\]Taking $n = 31$ in $f(4n + 1) = 4n + 3,$ we get
\[f(125) = 127,\]so $f(1000) = \boxed{1016}.$ The answer is $\boxed{1016}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
**Problem**
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


We will first find $f(1)$. From the second equation, when $n=1$, we have $f(2)=2f(1)+1$. From the first equation, when $n=1$, we have $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$, which means $f(f(1))=1$ since $f$ is a function from natural numbers to natural numbers. So we get $f(2)=1$. Substituting $n=2$ into the second equation, we get $f(4)=2f(2)+1=3$. Substituting $n=4$ into the second equation, we get $f(8)=2f(4)+1=7$. Substituting $n=8$ into the second equation, we get $f(16)=2f(8)+1=15$. Continuing this process, we find that $f(32)=31$, $f(64)=63$, and $f(128)=127$. 

Now we substitute $n=128$ into the first equation, we get $f(f(f(128)))=8*128-7=1015$. Since $f(f(128))=127$, we have $f(127)=1015$.

We can see that $f(f(n))=2n-1$ for all positive integers $n$. So $f(1)=1$ and $f(n)=2n-1$ for all positive integers $n$ except $1$.

Finally, substituting $n=100$ into the second equation, we get $f(200)=2f(100)+1$. Since $f(100)=2*100-1=199$, we have $f(200)=2*199+1=399$. Substituting $n=200$ into the second equation, we get $f(400)=2f(200)+1=799$. Substituting $n=400$ into the second equation, we get $f(800)=2f(400)+1=1599$. Continuing this process, we find that $f(1600)=3199$, $f(3200)=6399$, and $f(6400)=12799$.

Now we substitute $n=6400$ into the first equation, we get $f(f(f(6400)))=8*6400-7=51199$. Since $f(f(6400))=12799$, we have $f(12799)=51199$.

So $f(100)=199$.
