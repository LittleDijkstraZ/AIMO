**Problem:** 
"Find the minimum value of $2x^2 + 2y^2 + 5z^2 - 2xy - 4yz - 4x - 2z + 15$ over all real numbers $x,$ $y,$ $z.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
We can write the given expression as
\begin{align*}
&(x^2 - 4x + 4) + (x^2 - 2xy + y^2) + (y^2 - 4yz + 4z^2) + (z^2 - 2z + 1) + 10 \\
&= (x - 2)^2 + (x - y)^2 + (y - 2z)^2 + (z - 1)^2 + 10
\end{align*}The minimum value is then $\boxed{10},$ which occurs when $x = 2,$ $y = 2,$ and $z = 1.$ The answer is $\boxed{10}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solve, Eq

def calculate_minimum_value():
    # Define the variables
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # Define the constraint equation
    constraint_eq = Eq(abs(x - 2*y) + abs(y - 2*x), 40)

    # Define the expression to minimize
    expression = 5*x**2 + 5*y**2 - 8*x*y

    # Solve the constraint equation for y
    y_sol = solve(constraint_eq, y)[0]

    # Substitute y in the expression
    expression_subs = expression.subs(y, y_sol)

    # Find the derivative of the expression
    derivative = expression_subs.diff(x)

    # Solve the equation derivative = 0 to find the critical points
    critical_points = solve(derivative, x)

    # Evaluate the expression at the critical points
    minimum_value = min([expression_subs.subs(x, point) for point in critical_points])

    return minimum_value

result = calculate_minimum_value()
print(result)
```

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"What is the minimum value of the expression $x^2+y^2-6x+4y+18$ for real $x$ and $y$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Rearranging the expression, we have  \[x^2-6x+y^2+4y+18\]Completing the square in $x$, we need to add and subtract $(6/2)^2=9$. Completing the square in $y$, we need to add and subtract $(4/2)^2=4$. Thus, we have \[(x^2-6x+9)-9+(y^2+4y+4)-4+18 \Rightarrow (x-3)^2+(y+2)^2+5\]Since the minimum value of $(x-3)^2$ and $(y+2)^2$ is $0$ (perfect squares can never be negative), the minimum value of the entire expression is $\boxed{5}$, and is achieved when $x=3$ and $y=-2$. The answer is $\boxed{5}$
