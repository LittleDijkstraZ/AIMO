**Example**

**Problem:** 
"For certain ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ of real numbers, the system of equations
\[\begin{aligned} ax+by&=1 \\ x^2 + y^2 &= 50  \end{aligned}\]has at least one solution, and each solution is an ordered pair $(x,y)\,$ of integers. How many such ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ are there?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The graph of $ax+by=1$ is a line, while the graph of $x^2+y^2=50$ is a circle centered at the origin. Therefore, $(a, b)$ satisfies the conditions if and only if the line and circle intersect at least once, and they intersect only at lattice points (points with integer coordinates).

Knowing this, it makes sense to look for lattice points on the circle whose equation is $x^2+y^2=50$. Testing cases, we find that there are twelve lattice points on the circle: $(\pm 1, \pm 7)$, $(\pm 7, \pm 1)$, and $(\pm 5, \pm 5)$ (where the two $\pm$ signs in each pair are independent of each other).

There are $\tbinom{12}{2} = 66$ pairs of these points, and each pair determines a line. However, the graph of $ax+by=1$ can never pass through the origin $(0, 0)$, since if $x=y=0$, then $ax+by=0 \neq 1$. Therefore, the six pairs which consist of diametrically opposed points are invalid, since the line through them passes through the origin. This corrects our count to $66 - 6 = 60$.

In addition, for each of the twelve points, there is a line tangent to the circle at that point, so that the only solution to the system is that one point. This brings the final total to $60 + 12 = \boxed{72}$. The answer is $\boxed{72}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


The first step is to analyze the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. 

This equation has four distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is between $1$ and $2$. This is because the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a graph that looks like a "V" with the "bottom" of the "V" between $y=1$ and $y=2$. 

The value of $m$ that makes $\frac{m}{100}$ equal to $1$ is $m=100$, and the value of $m$ that makes $\frac{m}{100}$ equal to $2$ is $m=200$. So the possible values of $m$ are the integers from $100$ to $200$, inclusive. 

To find the number of these integers, we subtract the smallest possible value of $m$ from the largest possible value of $m$ and then add $1$. This gives us $200 - 100 + 1 = 101$.

However, we have counted the value $m=100$ twice, once in the set of integers from $100$ to $200$, and once in the set of integers from $100$ to $100$. We need to subtract one from our result to correct for this double-counting.

So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is $101 - 1 = 100$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def count_m():
    # The possible values of m are the integers from 100 to 200, inclusive.
    # To find the number of these integers, we subtract the smallest possible value of m from the largest possible value of m and then add 1.
    m_values = list(range(100, 201))
    # The actual number of m values is one less than the length of the list.
    num_m_values = len(m_values) - 1
    return num_m_values

num_m_values = count_m()
print(num_m_values)
```

CODE RESULTS 100

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output

The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is $100$. The answer is $\boxed{100}$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 To solve this problem, we need to understand the properties of the absolute value function and how it affects the number of solutions to an equation. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $0$ and $2$. This is because the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, oscillates between $0$ and $4$, and we want $\frac{m}{100}$ to be in the range where it intersects the function four times. 

So, we need to find the values of $m$ such that $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. This simplifies to $0 < m < 200$. 

The number of positive integers in this range is the difference of the largest and smallest possible values of $m$, plus one. So, the number of such $m$ is $200 - 1 + 1 = 200$.

Here is a Python program that calculates the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy $0 < m < 200$:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def count_m():
    return 200 - 1 + 1

result = count_m()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 200

```
The number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy $0 < m < 200$ is 200. Therefore, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions for 200 values of $m$. The answer is: $200$

**Solution:** 



To solve this problem, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly $4$ distinct solutions.

We can start by analyzing the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.

The expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ represents the distance between $x$ and $1$ and is at least $0$. The right-hand side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, is positive and can be any positive value. Therefore, for the equation to have $4$ distinct solutions, the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be such that the graph of the left-hand side "jumps" up and down twice. This happens when $\frac{m}{100}$ is less than $2$ but greater than $0$. 

So, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Multiplying all parts of the inequality by $100$, we get $0 < m < 200$. The positive integers in this range are from $1$ to $199$, inclusive. 

To count the number of these integers, we subtract the smallest possible value of $m$ from the largest possible value of $m$ and add $1$ (because both endpoints are included). So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $199 - 1 + 1 = 199$.

The value of $m$ that satisfies this condition is $1$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly $4$ distinct solutions is $199$.

The answer is: $199$.

## QUESTION 2 - 6

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many distinct solutions are there to the equation $|x-7| = |x+1|$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
If $|x-7| = |x+1|$, then either $x-7 = x+1$ or $x-7 = -(x+1)$.  Simplifying $x-7=x+1$ gives $0=8$, which has no solutions, so no values of $x$ satisfy $x-7 = x+1$.  If $x-7 = -(x+1)$, then $x-7 = -x-1$, so $2x = 6$, which gives $x=3$.  So, there is $\boxed{1}$ solution.

Challenge: See if you can find a quick solution to this problem by simply thinking about the graphs of $y=|x-7|$ and $y=|x+1|$. The answer is $\boxed{1}$
