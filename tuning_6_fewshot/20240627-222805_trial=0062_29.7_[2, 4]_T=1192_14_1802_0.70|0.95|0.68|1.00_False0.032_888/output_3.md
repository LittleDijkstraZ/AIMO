**Problem:** 
"How many square units are in the area of the triangle whose vertices are the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the curve $y = (x-3)^2 (x+2)$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we need to find where this curve intersects the $x$ and $y$ axes.  If $y=0$, then $(x-3)^2(x+2)=0$, which has solutions of $x=3$ and $x=-2$.  If $x=0$, then $y=(-3)^2(2)=18$.  So, the curve has two $x$-intercepts and one $y$-intercept.  The length of the base along the $x$-axis is $3-(-2)=5$.  The height from this base is equal to the $y$-intercept, 18.  The area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 5\cdot 18=\boxed{45}$. The answer is $\boxed{45}$

**Problem:** 
"An ellipse is defined parametrically by
\[(x,y) = \left( \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t}, \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t} \right).\]Then the equation of the ellipse can be written in the form
\[Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0,\]where $A,$ $B,$ $C,$ $D,$ $E,$ and $F$ are integers, and $\gcd(|A|,|B|,|C|,|D|,|E|,|F|) = 1.$  Find $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F|.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
In the equation $y = \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\cos t$ to get
\[\cos t = \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3}.\]In the equation $x = \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\sin t$ to get
\[\sin t = \frac{1}{2} x (2 - \cos t) + 1 = \frac{1}{2} x \left( 2 - \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right) + 1 = 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)}.\]Since $\cos^2 t + \sin^2 t = 1,$
\[\left( \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right)^2 + \left( 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)} \right)^2 = 1.\]Multiplying both sides by $(2(y + 3))^2$ and expanding, it will simplify to
\[81x^2 - 36xy + 16y^2 - 108x + 240y + 900 = 0.\]Therefore, $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F| = 81 + 36 + 16 + 108 + 240 + 900 = \boxed{1381}.$ The answer is $\boxed{1381}$

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $A \cdot B = 0$ is true if and only if $A=0$ or $B=0$. Thus, the given equation is satisfied if either $A = (|x+y| - 10)^2 + (|x-y| - 10)^2 = 0$ or $B = (|x| - 8)^2 + (|y| - 8)^2 = 0$.

For $A = 0$, we have $|x+y| = 10$ and $|x-y| = 10$. This implies that $x+y = \pm 10$ and $x-y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we find that the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy $A=0$ are $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, and $(0, -10)$.

For $B = 0$, we have $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations, we find that the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy $B=0$ are $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The convex polygon formed by these points is a square with side length $20$. To find the area of the square, we simply square the length of one of its sides. The area of the square is $20^2 = 400$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $400$.

The answer is: $400$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Find the number of 10-tuples $(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{10})$ of real numbers such that
\[(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2 = \frac{1}{11}.\]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,
\begin{align*}
&[(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + \dots + 1^2 + 1^2)][(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2] \\
&\ge [(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + (x_2 - x_3) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10}]^2 = 1.
\end{align*}From the given condition, we have equality, so by the equality condition for Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[\frac{1 - x_1}{1} = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{1} = \frac{x_2 - x_3}{1} = \dots = \frac{x_9 - x_{10}}{1} = \frac{x_{10}}{1}.\]Let
\[d = 1 - x_1 = x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_3 = \dots = x_9 - x_{10} = x_{10}.\]Then
\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so
\[(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_{10}) = \left( \frac{10}{11}, \frac{9}{11}, \frac{8}{11}, \dots, \frac{1}{11} \right).\]In particular, there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Solution:** 



We can start by noting that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. This means we can set each factor equal to zero and solve for the possible values of $x$ and $y$. 

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \implies \vert x + y \vert = 10 \implies x + y = \pm 10$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \implies \vert x - y \vert = 10 \implies x - y = \pm 10$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \implies \vert x \vert = 8 \implies x = \pm 8$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \implies \vert y \vert = 8 \implies y = \pm 8$.

From these equations, we can see that the possible values of $x$ and $y$ are:

- $x = 8, y = 2$ or $x = 8, y = -2$ or $x = -8, y = 2$ or $x = -8, y = -2$.
- $x = 10, y = 0$ or $x = -10, y = 0$.

Plotting these points on a coordinate plane, we find that they form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$.

label("$x$", (x/2, -0.1), S);

[/asy]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Let $w$ be the width of each of the identical rectangles. Since $PQ=3w$, $RS=2x$ and $PQ=RS$ (because $PQRS$ is a rectangle), then $2x = 3w$, or $$w=\frac{2}{3}x.$$ Therefore, the area of each of the five identical rectangles is $$x\left(\frac{2}{3}x\right)=\frac{2}{3}x^2.$$ Since the area of $PQRS$ is 4000 and it is made up of five of these identical smaller rectangles, then $$5\left(\frac{2}{3}x^2\right)=4000$$ or $$\frac{10}{3}x^2 = 4000$$ or $x^2 = 1200$ or $x \approx 34.6$ which, when rounded off to the nearest integer, is $\boxed{35}.$ The answer is $\boxed{35}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


This problem is a challenge in understanding the properties of absolute values and how they relate to the geometry of the problem. The equation given is a product of two terms equal to zero, which means that either of the terms must be zero. This gives us four cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first two cases, this implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. Geometrically, this represents all points $(x, y)$ that are at a distance of 10 units from the origin in the $x+y$ and $x-y$ directions respectively. These are two lines that pass through the origin and make an angle of 45 degrees with the x-axis.

For the third and fourth cases, this implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. Geometrically, this represents all points $(x, y)$ that are at a distance of 8 units from the origin in the x and y directions respectively. These are two lines that pass through the origin and make an angle of 90 degrees with the x-axis.

The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 10 (since the lines from the first two cases are the diagonals of the square formed by the lines from the third and fourth cases). The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. So, the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units.
The answer is: $100$

**Solution:**


This problem requires a deep understanding of absolute value functions and how they can be used to describe geometric shapes in the plane. The given equation involves absolute value expressions, which means it is split into multiple cases based on the values of $x$ and $y$.

The equation is equal to zero when either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. Each of these cases corresponds to a line or a pair of lines in the $xy$-plane. The intersection of these lines form a rectangle with side lengths 16 and 20, which is the convex polygon in question.

The area of this rectangle is simply the product of its side lengths, which is $16 \times 20 = 320$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 320 square units.

Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we need to understand the properties of absolute values and how they can be used to simplify the given expression.

1. The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ equals to zero if and only if both of the factors equal to zero.

2. The factor $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(8,2)$, $(8,-2)$, $(-8,2)$, and $(-8,-2)$.

3. The factor $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these four equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

4. Combining the results from step 2 and step 3, the polygon is a square with side length 16.

5. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    # The side length of the square is 16
