**Problem:** 
"Let $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_ 2= (-16,2).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that
\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as
\[\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1.\]Find $h + k + a + b.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



First, we need to understand the given equation and the conditions it imposes on the points $(x, y)$. The equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.

The first term is zero when either $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x - y| - 10 = 0$. These conditions imply that $|x + y| = 10$ or $|x - y| = 10$. The solutions to these equations form a diamond shape centered at the origin with vertices at $(\pm 10, 0)$ and $(0, \pm 10)$.

The second term is zero when either $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$. These conditions imply that $|x| = 8$ or $|y| = 8$. The solutions to these equations form a square with side length 16 centered at the origin.

The intersection of the two shapes forms a convex polygon, which is a square with side length 8 (the smaller of the two squares). The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 64. The answer is: $64$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if and only if at least one of the factors is zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. 

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length 20.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length 16.

The area of the convex polygon formed by the intersection of these two squares is the area of the larger square minus the area of the smaller square. The area of a square with side length $s$ is $s^2$, so the area of the larger square is $20^2 = 400$ and the area of the smaller square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $400 - 256 = 144$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many square units are in the area of the triangle whose vertices are the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the curve $y = (x-3)^2 (x+2)$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we need to find where this curve intersects the $x$ and $y$ axes.  If $y=0$, then $(x-3)^2(x+2)=0$, which has solutions of $x=3$ and $x=-2$.  If $x=0$, then $y=(-3)^2(2)=18$.  So, the curve has two $x$-intercepts and one $y$-intercept.  The length of the base along the $x$-axis is $3-(-2)=5$.  The height from this base is equal to the $y$-intercept, 18.  The area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 5\cdot 18=\boxed{45}$. The answer is $\boxed{45}$

**Solution:**


This problem is a bit complex and requires a deep understanding of absolute value functions and their properties. The equation given is a product of two terms, each of which is a squared expression containing absolute value functions. The only way for this product to be zero is if at least one of the terms is zero. This gives us four separate absolute value equations to solve.

The solutions to these absolute value equations give us the coordinates of the vertices of the polygon. Once we have the vertices, we can calculate the area of the polygon using the Shoelace formula or by dividing the polygon into triangles and summing their areas.

However, solving this problem analytically is quite involved and time-consuming. A much easier way to solve this problem is to recognize that the given equation actually represents four lines in the plane: $x + y = 10$, $x - y = 10$, $x = 8$, and $y = 8$. These lines form a rectangle with side lengths 10 and 16, and the area of this rectangle is $10 \times 16 = 160$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 160 square units.

Here is a Python function to calculate the area of the polygon:

    # The given equation represents four lines in the plane:
    # x + y = 10, x - y = 10, x = 8, and y = 8.
    # These lines form a rectangle with side lengths 10 and 16.
    side1 = 10
    side2 = 16

    # The area of the rectangle is the product of its side lengths.
    area = side1 * side2

    return area

result = area_of_polygon()

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $A \cdot B = 0$ implies that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the given equation is satisfied if either of the following two conditions hold:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, or
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first condition to hold, we need $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$, which gives us four lines in the plane: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. The intersection of these lines forms a rectangle with vertices at $(10,0)$, $(-10,0)$, $(0,10)$, and $(0,-10)$.

For the second condition to hold, we need $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us four lines in the plane: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. The intersection of these lines forms a square with vertices at $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

The intersection of the two sets of lines forms a polygon, which is the convex polygon in question. To find its area, we can simply multiply the lengths of its sides. The side length of the rectangle is $20$, and the side length of the square is $16$. Therefore, the area of the polygon is $20 \times 16 = 320$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $320$. The answer is: $320$

**Solution:**


The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. Therefore, either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

The first term is zero when $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these equations are all the points in the plane that are at a distance of 10 units from the line $x + y = 0$ or $x - y = 0$. These lines are perpendicular bisectors of the coordinate axes, and the points that are at a distance of 10 units from them form a square with side length 20.

The second term is zero when $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. This implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are all the points in the plane that are at a distance of 8 units from the x-axis or the y-axis. These lines are the x-axis and the y-axis, and the points that are at a distance of 8 units from them form a square with side length 16.

The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon whose area we want to find. This intersection is a square with side length 8 (the shorter side of the two squares). The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$. So the area of the convex polygon is 64.

Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Let $w$ be the width of each of the identical rectangles. Since $PQ=3w$, $RS=2x$ and $PQ=RS$ (because $PQRS$ is a rectangle), then $2x = 3w$, or $$w=\frac{2}{3}x.$$ Therefore, the area of each of the five identical rectangles is $$x\left(\frac{2}{3}x\right)=\frac{2}{3}x^2.$$ Since the area of $PQRS$ is 4000 and it is made up of five of these identical smaller rectangles, then $$5\left(\frac{2}{3}x^2\right)=4000$$ or $$\frac{10}{3}x^2 = 4000$$ or $x^2 = 1200$ or $x \approx 34.6$ which, when rounded off to the nearest integer, is $\boxed{35}.$ The answer is $\boxed{35}$

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The expression $ab = 0$ is true if and only if $a = 0$ or $b = 0$. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The first two equations are equivalent to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, respectively. These are the equations of two pairs of parallel lines, each pair being 20 units apart. The third and fourth equations are equivalent to $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, respectively. These are the equations of two circles centered at the origin with radius 8.
The intersection of the two pairs of parallel lines is a square with side length 10, and the intersection of the two circles is also a square with side length 8. The area of the convex polygon formed by the intersection of these four figures is the sum of the areas of these two squares.
The area of a square with side length $a$ is $a^2$, so the area of the larger square is $10^2 = 100$, and the area of the smaller square is $8^2 = 64$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $100 + 64 = 164$. The answer is: $164$

The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. 

The first expression is zero when either $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x - y| - 10 = 0$, which means $|x + y| = 10$ or $|x - y| = 10$. These are the equations of two lines passing through the origin with slopes 1 and -1.

The second expression is zero when either $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$, which means $|x| = 8$ or $|y| = 8$. These are the equations of two lines parallel to the y-axis at x = 8 and x = -8, and two lines parallel to the x-axis at y = 8 and y = -8.

Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

Let's consider the first term:
\[(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0.\]
This equation is only satisfied when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, and $(-5,-5)$.

Now let's consider the second term:
\[(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0.\]
This equation is only satisfied when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(8,0)$, $(0,8)$, $(-8,0)$, and $(0,-8)$.

Combining the two sets of vertices, we get the polygon as a square with side length $10$. The area of a square is given by the square of its side length, so the area of the polygon is $10^2 = 100$.

```python

    # Side length of the square

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.

The first term is zero when either $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x-y| - 10 = 0$. These simplify to $|x+y| = 10$ and $|x-y| = 10$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x+y = 10$, $x+y = -10$, $x-y = 10$, and $x-y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle.

The second term is zero when either $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$. These simplify to $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square.

The intersection of the rectangle and the square is the convex polygon that encloses the points that satisfy the equation. This polygon is a square with side length 8.

The area of a square is the side length squared, so the area of this square is $8^2 = 64$. The answer is: $64$
