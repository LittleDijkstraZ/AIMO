**Problem:** 
"How many square units are in the area of the triangle whose vertices are the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the curve $y = (x-3)^2 (x+2)$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we need to find where this curve intersects the $x$ and $y$ axes.  If $y=0$, then $(x-3)^2(x+2)=0$, which has solutions of $x=3$ and $x=-2$.  If $x=0$, then $y=(-3)^2(2)=18$.  So, the curve has two $x$-intercepts and one $y$-intercept.  The length of the base along the $x$-axis is $3-(-2)=5$.  The height from this base is equal to the $y$-intercept, 18.  The area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 5\cdot 18=\boxed{45}$. The answer is $\boxed{45}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. Therefore, either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

The first term is zero when $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. These equations simplify to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, and $(0, -10)$.

The second term is zero when $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. These equations simplify to $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(8, 0)$, $(-8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, and $(0, -8)$.

The intersection of the two rectangles is the convex polygon enclosed by the points that satisfy the given equation. This intersection is a square with side length 8. The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 64.

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.
The first expression is zero when either $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x-y| - 10 = 0$.
This means $|x+y| = 10$ or $|x-y| = 10$.
The second expression is zero when either $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$.
This means $|x| = 8$ or $|y| = 8$.
The solutions to these equations are the points that lie on the lines $x+y = \pm 10$, $x-y = \pm 10$, $x = \pm 8$, and $y = \pm 8$.
These lines form a square with side length 16.
The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
So the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is $0$ if and only if at least one of the factors is $0$. Therefore, we have four cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
3. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
4. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For each case, we can set each factor to $0$ and solve for $x$ and $y$. The solutions will give us the vertices of the polygon. Then we can use the Shoelace formula to calculate the area of the polygon.

The Shoelace formula for a polygon with vertices $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), \dots, (x_n, y_n)$ is given by:

$$\frac{1}{2} \left| \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i y_{i+1} - y_i x_{i+1} \right|$$

where the indices are taken modulo $n$.

After calculating the area, we can print the result.

However, this problem is a bit too complex to be solved directly using sympy. Instead, we can use geometric intuition to simplify the problem.

The conditions $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ imply that $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on a square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$.

The conditions $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ imply that $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on a square with side length $16$.

The intersection of these two squares is a square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$, which is the convex polygon we are looking for.

The area of a square with side length $a$ is $a^2$, so the area of the convex polygon is $(10\sqrt{2})^2 = 200$.

So the area of the convex polygon is $200$. The answer is: $200$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Find the number of 10-tuples $(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{10})$ of real numbers such that
\[(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2 = \frac{1}{11}.\]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,
\begin{align*}
&[(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + \dots + 1^2 + 1^2)][(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2] \\
&\ge [(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + (x_2 - x_3) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10}]^2 = 1.
\end{align*}From the given condition, we have equality, so by the equality condition for Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[\frac{1 - x_1}{1} = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{1} = \frac{x_2 - x_3}{1} = \dots = \frac{x_9 - x_{10}}{1} = \frac{x_{10}}{1}.\]Let
\[d = 1 - x_1 = x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_3 = \dots = x_9 - x_{10} = x_{10}.\]Then
\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so
\[(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_{10}) = \left( \frac{10}{11}, \frac{9}{11}, \frac{8}{11}, \dots, \frac{1}{11} \right).\]In particular, there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Solution:** 


The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. 

Let's consider the first expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This expression is zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only way this can happen is if $x = 0$ and $y = 0$.

Now let's consider the second expression $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This expression is zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The only way this can happen is if $x = 8$ and $y = 8$ or $x = -8$ and $y = -8$.

So the points that satisfy the given equation are $(0, 0)$, $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, and $(-8, -8)$. These points form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_ 2= (-16,2).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that
\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as
\[\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1.\]Find $h + k + a + b.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

**Solution:**


The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.

The first term is zero when $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle.

The second term is zero when $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. This implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines also form a rectangle.

The intersection of the two rectangles is a square with side length 10 (the distance between the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$, or the distance between the lines $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$).

The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 100.

Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,
\begin{align*}

\end{align*}From the given condition, we have equality, so by the equality condition for Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[\frac{1 - x_1}{1} = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{1} = \frac{x_2 - x_3}{1} = \dots = \frac{x_9 - x_{10}}{1} = \frac{x_{10}}{1}.\]Let
\[d = 1 - x_1 = x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_3 = \dots = x_9 - x_{10} = x_{10}.\]Then
\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so
\[(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_{10}) = \left( \frac{10}{11}, \frac{9}{11}, \frac{8}{11}, \dots, \frac{1}{11} \right).\]In particular, there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Solution:**


The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$.

Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The intersection of these two squares is a smaller square with side length 4 and vertices at $(4, 4)$, $(4, -4)$, $(-4, 4)$, and $(-4, -4)$. The area of this square is $4^2 = 16$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 16.

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we first need to understand the given equation and the conditions under which it equals zero. The equation is a product of two terms, so it equals zero if either of the terms equals zero. 

The first term is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. This term equals zero if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This happens if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two lines in the coordinate plane, so they enclose a rectangle with side lengths 20 in the x and y directions.

The second term is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. This term equals zero if both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This happens if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two circles with radius 8 in the coordinate plane, so they enclose a square with side length 16.

The intersection of the two regions is the set of points that satisfy both conditions. The rectangle and square intersect at their centers, and the intersection is a smaller square with side length 8. The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$. So the area of the convex polygon is 64.

The answer is: $64$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the four lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

Similarly, the expression $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us the four lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 10 (the distance between the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$, or between the lines $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$).

The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 100.

The answer is: $100$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The expression $A = ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ equals to zero if and only if at least one of the following conditions is met:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From the first condition, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

From the second condition, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersection points of these lines are the vertices of the polygon. We can find these points by solving the systems of equations formed by the pairs of lines. There are 9 intersection points in total.

The area of the polygon can be found by calculating the area of the rectangle formed by the lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$ and subtracting the areas of the four right triangles formed by the lines $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$ and the coordinate axes.

The rectangle has side lengths 16, so its area is $16 \times 16 = 256$.

Each right triangle has base and height of 10, so its area is $\frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10 = 50$. Since there are four such triangles, their total area is $4 \times 50 = 200$.

Therefore, the area of the polygon is $256 - 200 = 56$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 56. The answer is: $56$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many square units are in the area of the triangle whose vertices are the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the curve $y = (x-3)^2 (x+2)$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we need to find where this curve intersects the $x$ and $y$ axes.  If $y=0$, then $(x-3)^2(x+2)=0$, which has solutions of $x=3$ and $x=-2$.  If $x=0$, then $y=(-3)^2(2)=18$.  So, the curve has two $x$-intercepts and one $y$-intercept.  The length of the base along the $x$-axis is $3-(-2)=5$.  The height from this base is equal to the $y$-intercept, 18.  The area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 5\cdot 18=\boxed{45}$. The answer is $\boxed{45}$
