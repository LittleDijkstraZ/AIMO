**Problem:** 
"Let $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_ 2= (-16,2).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that
\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as
\[\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1.\]Find $h + k + a + b.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Five identical rectangles are arranged to form a larger rectangle $PQRS$, as shown.  The area of $PQRS$ is $4000$.  What is the length, $x$, rounded off to the nearest integer? [asy]
real x = 1; real w = 2/3;

// Draw outer square and labels

draw(left--right);
label("$x$", (x/2, -0.1), S);

[/asy]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Let $w$ be the width of each of the identical rectangles. Since $PQ=3w$, $RS=2x$ and $PQ=RS$ (because $PQRS$ is a rectangle), then $2x = 3w$, or $$w=\frac{2}{3}x.$$ Therefore, the area of each of the five identical rectangles is $$x\left(\frac{2}{3}x\right)=\frac{2}{3}x^2.$$ Since the area of $PQRS$ is 4000 and it is made up of five of these identical smaller rectangles, then $$5\left(\frac{2}{3}x^2\right)=4000$$ or $$\frac{10}{3}x^2 = 4000$$ or $x^2 = 1200$ or $x \approx 34.6$ which, when rounded off to the nearest integer, is $\boxed{35}.$ The answer is $\boxed{35}$

It seems that I made a mistake in the calculation. Let's correct it.

The equation is satisfied when either of the factors is zero. So we solve each factor separately.

For the first factor, $|x+y| - 10 = 0$, we get $|x+y| = 10$, which gives us two equations: $x+y = 10$ and $x+y = -10$.

For the second factor, $|x-y| - 10 = 0$, we get $|x-y| = 10$, which gives us two equations: $x-y = 10$ and $x-y = -10$.

For the third factor, $|x| - 8 = 0$, we get $|x| = 8$, which gives us two equations: $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.

For the fourth factor, $|y| - 8 = 0$, we get $|y| = 8$, which gives us two equations: $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

The points on the polygon are the intersections of these solutions. We can find the intersections by solving the system of equations:

1. $x+y = 10$ and $x-y = 10$
2. $x+y = 10$ and $x-y = -10$
3. $x+y = -10$ and $x-y = 10$
4. $x+y = -10$ and $x-y = -10$
5. $x = 8$ and $y = 8$
6. $x = 8$ and $y = -8$
7. $x = -8$ and $y = 8$
8. $x = -8$ and $y = -8$

Solving these systems of equations, we get the following points:

1. $(x, y) = (10, 0)$
2. $(x, y) = (0, -10)$
3. $(x, y) = (-10, 0)$
4. $(x, y) = (0, 10)$
5. $(x, y) = (8, 8)$
6. $(x, y) = (8, -8)$
7. $(x, y) = (-8, 8)$
8. $(x, y) = (-8, -8)$

The polygon is a square with side length 16. So, the area of the polygon is $16^2 = 256$.

So the answer is $\boxed{256}$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"An ellipse is defined parametrically by
\[(x,y) = \left( \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t}, \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t} \right).\]Then the equation of the ellipse can be written in the form
\[Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0,\]where $A,$ $B,$ $C,$ $D,$ $E,$ and $F$ are integers, and $\gcd(|A|,|B|,|C|,|D|,|E|,|F|) = 1.$  Find $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F|.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
In the equation $y = \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\cos t$ to get
\[\cos t = \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3}.\]In the equation $x = \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\sin t$ to get
\[\sin t = \frac{1}{2} x (2 - \cos t) + 1 = \frac{1}{2} x \left( 2 - \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right) + 1 = 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)}.\]Since $\cos^2 t + \sin^2 t = 1,$
\[\left( \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right)^2 + \left( 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)} \right)^2 = 1.\]Multiplying both sides by $(2(y + 3))^2$ and expanding, it will simplify to
\[81x^2 - 36xy + 16y^2 - 108x + 240y + 900 = 0.\]Therefore, $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F| = 81 + 36 + 16 + 108 + 240 + 900 = \boxed{1381}.$ The answer is $\boxed{1381}$

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we can use the fact that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. 

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the square as $(8, 2)$, $(8, -18)$, $(-18, -18)$, and $(-18, 2)$.

The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the square as $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$.

The convex polygon formed by the union of these two squares is a 8x16 rectangle. Therefore, its area is $8 \times 16 = 128$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    # Length of the rectangle

    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Find the number of 10-tuples $(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{10})$ of real numbers such that
\[(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2 = \frac{1}{11}.\]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,
\begin{align*}
&[(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + \dots + 1^2 + 1^2)][(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2] \\
&\ge [(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + (x_2 - x_3) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10}]^2 = 1.
\end{align*}From the given condition, we have equality, so by the equality condition for Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[\frac{1 - x_1}{1} = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{1} = \frac{x_2 - x_3}{1} = \dots = \frac{x_9 - x_{10}}{1} = \frac{x_{10}}{1}.\]Let
\[d = 1 - x_1 = x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_3 = \dots = x_9 - x_{10} = x_{10}.\]Then
\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so
\[(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_{10}) = \left( \frac{10}{11}, \frac{9}{11}, \frac{8}{11}, \dots, \frac{1}{11} \right).\]In particular, there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Solution:** 



This problem involves the concept of absolute value and the properties of absolute value to simplify the equations. The absolute value $|x|$ is defined as $x$ if $x \geq 0$, and $-x$ if $x < 0$. Thus, we can split the absolute value terms into two cases based on the sign of the expressions inside the absolute value. 

The equation to solve is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. This equation is satisfied if either of the two factors is zero. 

The first factor is zero if either $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x-y| - 10 = 0$. These equations simplify to $|x+y| = 10$ and $|x-y| = 10$. The second factor is zero if either $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$, which simplifies to $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. 

Now we can solve these equations:

1. For $|x+y| = 10$, we have two cases: $x+y = 10$ or $x+y = -10$. These give two lines in the $xy$-plane.
2. For $|x-y| = 10$, we have two cases: $x-y = 10$ or $x-y = -10$. These give two more lines in the $xy$-plane.
3. For $|x| = 8$, we have two cases: $x = 8$ or $x = -8$. These give two parallel lines in the $xy$-plane.
4. For $|y| = 8$, we have two cases: $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. These give two more parallel lines in the $xy$-plane.

The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$
