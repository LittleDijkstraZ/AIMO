**Problem:** 
"What is the minimum value of the expression $x^2+y^2+2x-4y+8$ for real $x$ and $y$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Rearranging the expression, we have  \[x^2+2x+y^2-4y+8\]Completing the square in $x$, we need to add and subtract $(2/2)^2=1$. Completing the square in $y$, we need to add and subtract $(4/2)^2=4$. Thus, we have \[(x^2+2x+1)-1+(y^2-4y+4)-4+8 \Rightarrow (x+1)^2+(y-2)^2+3\]Since the minimum value of $(x+1)^2$ and $(y-2)^2$ is $0$ (perfect squares can never be negative), the minimum value of the entire expression is $\boxed{3}$, and is achieved when $x=-1$ and $y=2$. The answer is $\boxed{3}$

**Problem**
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


This problem is a bit tricky to solve directly. However, we can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to solve it.

The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states that for any real numbers $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$ and $b_1, b_2, ..., b_n$, we have:
\[(a_1^2 + a_2^2 + ... + a_n^2)(b_1^2 + b_2^2 + ... + b_n^2) \geq (a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 + ... + a_nb_n)^2.\]

Let's apply the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to the given problem. Let $a_1 = x$, $a_2 = y$, $b_1 = 1$, and $b_2 = -2$. Then we have:
\[(x^2 + y^2)(1^2 + (-2)^2) \geq (x - 2y)^2.\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[(x^2 + y^2)(5) \geq (x - 2y)^2.\]
So, we have:
\[5x^2 + 5y^2 \geq (x - 2y)^2.\]

Now, let's look at the expression we want to minimize: $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$. We can rewrite it as:
\[5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 4(x - 2y)^2 + 12xy.\]

From the inequality we derived above, we know that $5x^2 + 5y^2 \geq (x - 2y)^2$. So, we have:
\[5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 4(x - 2y)^2 + 12xy \geq 12xy - 4(x - 2y)^2.\]

Now, we need to minimize $12xy - 4(x - 2y)^2$. Since $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we know that $x - 2y$ and $y - 2x$ have the same absolute value. So, we can assume without loss of generality that $x - 2y = 20$. Then, we have:
\[12xy - 4(x - 2y)^2 = 12xy - 4(20)^2 = 12xy - 1600.\]

To minimize this expression, we need to maximize $xy$. By AM-GM inequality, we have:
\[xy \leq \left(\frac{x + y}{2}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{20}{2}\right)^2 = 100.\]
Equality occurs when $x = y = 10$. So, the maximum value of $xy$ is $100$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is:
\[12xy - 4(x - 2y)^2 \geq 12(100) - 4(20)^2 = 1200 - 1600 = -400.\]

However, this is not possible because the expression we are minimizing is always nonnegative. So, we must have made a mistake in our reasoning. Let's go back and reevaluate the problem.

We know that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. By the triangle inequality, we have:
\[|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |(x-2y) - (y-2x)| = |x - 2y - y + 2x| = |x - 3y + 2x| = |3x - 3y| = 3|x - y| = 40.\]
So, we have $|x - y| = \frac{40}{3}$.

Now, let's look at the expression we want to minimize: $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$. We can rewrite it as:
\[5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = 5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x - y)^2 + 2xy] - 8xy = 5(x - y)^2 + 3xy.\]

We want to minimize this expression. By AM-GM inequality, we have:
\[5(x - y)^2 + 3xy \geq 2\sqrt{5(x - y)^2 \cdot 3xy} = 2\sqrt{15(x - y)^2 xy}.\]

To minimize this expression, we need to maximize $\sqrt{15(x - y)^2 xy}$. By AM-GM inequality, we have:
\[\sqrt{15(x - y)^2 xy} \leq \frac{15(x - y)^2 + xy}{2}.\]

By the triangle inequality, we have:
\[|(x - 2y) - (y - 2x)| \leq |x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40.\]
So, we have $|x - 3y + 2x| \leq 40$, which implies $|3x - 3y| \leq 40$, and finally $|x - y| \leq \frac{40}{3}$.

By the AM-GM inequality, we have:
\[xy \leq \left(\frac{x + y}{2}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{\frac{40}{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{20}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{400}{9}.\]

So, the maximum value of $\sqrt{15(x - y)^2 xy}$ is:
\[\frac{15(x - y)^2 + xy}{2} \leq \frac{15\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 + \frac{400}{9}}{2} = \frac{15 \cdot \frac{1600}{9} + \frac{400}{9}}{2} = \frac{24000}{9 \cdot 2} = \frac{12000}{9}.\]

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is:
\[5(x - y)^2 + 3xy \geq 2\sqrt{15(x - y)^2 xy} \geq 2 \cdot \frac{12000}{9} = \frac{24000}{9}.\]

However, this is not possible because the expression we are minimizing is always nonnegative. So, we must have made a mistake in our reasoning. Let's go back and reevaluate the problem again.

We know that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. By the triangle inequality, we have:
\[|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |(x-2y) - (y-2x)| = |x - 2y - y + 2x| = |x - 3y + 2x| = |3x - 3y| = 3|x - y| = 40.\]
So, we have $|x - y| = \frac{40}{3}$.

Now, let's look at the expression we want to minimize: $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$. We can rewrite it as:
\[5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = 5(x^2 + y^2)

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"What is the minimum value of the expression $x^2+y^2-6x+4y+18$ for real $x$ and $y$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Rearranging the expression, we have  \[x^2-6x+y^2+4y+18\]Completing the square in $x$, we need to add and subtract $(6/2)^2=9$. Completing the square in $y$, we need to add and subtract $(4/2)^2=4$. Thus, we have \[(x^2-6x+9)-9+(y^2+4y+4)-4+18 \Rightarrow (x-3)^2+(y+2)^2+5\]Since the minimum value of $(x-3)^2$ and $(y+2)^2$ is $0$ (perfect squares can never be negative), the minimum value of the entire expression is $\boxed{5}$, and is achieved when $x=3$ and $y=-2$. The answer is $\boxed{5}$

**Solution:**


This problem is a bit tricky to solve directly, but we can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to solve it.

The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states that for any real numbers $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$ and $b_1, b_2, ..., b_n$, we have:
\[(a_1^2 + a_2^2 + ... + a_n^2)(b_1^2 + b_2^2 + ... + b_n^2) \geq (a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 + ... + a_nb_n)^2.\]

In this case, we can let $a_1 = x$, $a_2 = y$, $b_1 = 1$, and $b_2 = -2$. Then we have:
\[(x^2 + y^2)(1^2 + (-2)^2) \geq (x - 2y)^2.\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[(x^2 + y^2)(1 + 4) \geq (x - 2y)^2,\]
\[5(x^2 + y^2) \geq (x - 2y)^2.\]

Similarly, we can let $a_1 = y$, $a_2 = x$, $b_1 = -2$, and $b_2 = 1$. Then we have:
\[(y^2 + x^2)((-2)^2 + 1^2) \geq (y - 2x)^2.\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[(y^2 + x^2)(4 + 1) \geq (y - 2x)^2,\]
\[5(y^2 + x^2) \geq (y - 2x)^2.\]

Adding these two inequalities, we get:
\[10(x^2 + y^2) \geq (x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2.\]

Now, we know that $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$, so $(x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2 = 40^2 = 1600$.

Substituting this into the inequality, we get:
\[10(x^2 + y^2) \geq 1600,\]
\[x^2 + y^2 \geq \frac{1600}{10} = 160.\]

Now, we want to minimize $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$. We can rewrite this as:
\[5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy.\]

We know that $x^2 + y^2 \geq 160$, and we want to minimize $5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy$. To do this, we want to make $8xy$ as large as possible. The maximum value of $8xy$ occurs when $x = y$, and in this case, $8xy = 8x^2$. So, we want to maximize $x^2$.

Since $x^2 + y^2 \geq 160$, and $x = y$, we have $2x^2 \geq 160$, so $x^2 \geq 80$. Therefore, the maximum value of $8xy = 8x^2$ is $8 \cdot 80 = 640$.

Substituting this into the expression $5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy$, we get:
\[5 \cdot 160 - 640 = 800 - 640 = 160.\]

So, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is 160. The answer is: $160$

"If $x + 2y= 4$ and $xy = -8$, what is the value of $x^2 + 4y^2$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
We see that $(x + 2y)^2 = (x^2 + 4y^2) + 4xy = 4^2 = 16$. We want to find $x^2 + 4y^2$ and are given $xy = -8$. So, $x^2 + 4y^2 + 4xy = x^2 + 4y^2 + 4(-8) = 16$. It follows that $x^2 + 4y^2 = \boxed{48}$. The answer is $\boxed{48}$
