**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_ 2= (-16,2).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that
\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as
\[\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1.\]Find $h + k + a + b.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

**Solution:** 



The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. Let's consider each case separately.

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
This equation is satisfied only when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the square as $(5, 5)$, $(5, -5)$, $(-5, -5)$, and $(-5, 5)$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
This equation is satisfied only when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the square as $(8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, $(-8, 0)$, and $(0, -8)$.

The two squares intersect at the origin $(0, 0)$. The side length of the first square is $10\sqrt{2}$ and the side length of the second square is $16$. The area of the convex polygon formed by the intersection of the two squares is the sum of the areas of the two squares minus the area of their intersection.

The area of a square with side length $a$ is $a^2$. So the area of the first square is $(10\sqrt{2})^2 = 200$, and the area of the second square is $16^2 = 256$. The area of their intersection (which is another square with side length $0$) is $0$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $200 + 256 - 0 = 456$.

However, this is not the correct answer. The mistake was in assuming that the intersection of the two squares is a square with side length $0$. The intersection of the two squares is actually a smaller square with side length $8\sqrt{2}$. The area of this square is $(8\sqrt{2})^2 = 128$.

So the correct area of the convex polygon is $200 + 256 - 128 = 328$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $328$. The answer is: $328$

**Solution:**


The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

The first term is zero when $|x+y| = 10$ or $|x-y| = 10$. These are the equations of two pairs of parallel lines, so they enclose a rectangle with side lengths $20$ and $20\sqrt{2}$.

The second term is zero when $|x| = 8$ or $|y| = 8$. These are the equations of four lines, two vertical and two horizontal, each passing through the points $(8,0)$ and $(-8,0)$ and $(0,8)$ and $(0,-8)$ respectively. These lines enclose a square with side length $16$.

The area of the rectangle is $20 \times 20\sqrt{2} = 400\sqrt{2}$, and the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. The area of the convex polygon formed by the intersection of the two shapes is the sum of the areas of the rectangle and the square minus the area of the region they have in common.

The common region is a square with side length $8$, so its area is $8^2 = 64$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $400\sqrt{2} + 256 - 64 = 392 + 192\sqrt{2}$.

However, this is not a valid answer, as the area of a polygon cannot be expressed as a number plus a square root of a number. Let's reevaluate the problem.

The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.

The first term is zero when $|x+y| = 10$ or $|x-y| = 10$. These are the equations of two pairs of parallel lines, so they enclose a rectangle with side lengths $20$ and $20\sqrt{2}$.

The second term is zero when $|x| = 8$ or $|y| = 8$. These are the equations of four lines, two vertical and two horizontal, each passing through the points $(8,0)$ and $(-8,0)$ and $(0,8)$ and $(0,-8)$ respectively. These lines enclose a square with side length $16$.

The area of the rectangle is $20 \times 20\sqrt{2} = 400\sqrt{2}$, and the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. The area of the convex polygon formed by the union of the two shapes is the sum of the areas of the rectangle and the square.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $400\sqrt{2} + 256 = 656 + 400\sqrt{2}$.

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

The first term is zero when $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. These equations simplify to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle.

The second term is zero when $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. These equations simplify to $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines also form a rectangle.

The intersection of the two rectangles is a square with side length 10 (the distance between the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$, or the distance between the lines $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$). The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 100.

The first expression is zero when either $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x-y| - 10 = 0$. These equations simplify to $|x+y| = 10$ and $|x-y| = 10$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x+y = 10$, $x+y = -10$, $x-y = 10$, and $x-y = -10$.

The second expression is zero when either $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$. These equations simplify to $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersection points of these lines are the vertices of the polygon. By plotting these lines on a graph, we find that the vertices of the polygon are $(-8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, $(8, -8)$, and $(8, 8)$.

The polygon is a square with side length 16. The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256.
