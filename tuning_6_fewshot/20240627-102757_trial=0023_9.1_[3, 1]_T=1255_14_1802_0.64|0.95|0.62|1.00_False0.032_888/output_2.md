**Problem:** 
"How many distinct solutions are there to the equation $|x-7| = |x+1|$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
If $|x-7| = |x+1|$, then either $x-7 = x+1$ or $x-7 = -(x+1)$.  Simplifying $x-7=x+1$ gives $0=8$, which has no solutions, so no values of $x$ satisfy $x-7 = x+1$.  If $x-7 = -(x+1)$, then $x-7 = -x-1$, so $2x = 6$, which gives $x=3$.  So, there is $\boxed{1}$ solution.

Challenge: See if you can find a quick solution to this problem by simply thinking about the graphs of $y=|x-7|$ and $y=|x+1|$. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to the positive difference between 2 and 3.
This means $\frac{m}{100}=1$, so $m=100$.

Therefore, the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is $m=100$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def find_m():
    """Find the value of m for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions."""
    m = 100
    return m

result = find_m()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 100

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
100
```
The value of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is $100$. The answer is $\boxed{100}$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions. The right-hand side is positive, so $| |x - 1| - 2 |$ must be positive, which means $|x - 1| - 2$ must be either $+\frac{m}{100}$ or $-\frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two sub-equations to solve:

1. $|x - 1| - 2 = +\frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $|x - 1| = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.
2. $|x - 1| - 2 = -\frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $|x - 1| = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.

For the first equation, $|x - 1| = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, we have two sub-cases:

1.1. $x - 1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.
1.2. $-(x - 1) = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

For the second equation, $|x - 1| = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, we have two sub-cases:

2.1. $x - 1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
2.2. $-(x - 1) = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

We want the equation to have four distinct solutions, so the ranges of the four solutions must be disjoint. This happens when $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which simplifies to $0 < m < 200$. So we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ in this range.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solve

def find_m():
    m = symbols('m')
    # find the number of positive integers m in the range 0 < m < 200
    num_m = solve(m - 200, m)[0] - 1
    return num_m

num_m = find_m()
print(num_m)
```

CODE RESULTS 199

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
199
```
The number of positive integers $m$ in the range $0 < m < 200$ is $199$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions is $199$. The answer is: $199$.
