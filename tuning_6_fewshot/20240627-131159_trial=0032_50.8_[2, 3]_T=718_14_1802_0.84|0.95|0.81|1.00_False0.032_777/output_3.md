**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Find the number of 10-tuples $(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{10})$ of real numbers such that
\[(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2 = \frac{1}{11}.\]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,
\begin{align*}
&[(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + \dots + 1^2 + 1^2)][(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2] \\
&\ge [(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + (x_2 - x_3) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10}]^2 = 1.
\end{align*}From the given condition, we have equality, so by the equality condition for Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[\frac{1 - x_1}{1} = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{1} = \frac{x_2 - x_3}{1} = \dots = \frac{x_9 - x_{10}}{1} = \frac{x_{10}}{1}.\]Let
\[d = 1 - x_1 = x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_3 = \dots = x_9 - x_{10} = x_{10}.\]Then
\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so
\[(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_{10}) = \left( \frac{10}{11}, \frac{9}{11}, \frac{8}{11}, \dots, \frac{1}{11} \right).\]In particular, there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if at least one of the factors is zero. This gives us four cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
3. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
4. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For each case, we can solve the equations to find the points that satisfy the conditions. Then, we can plot these points on a coordinate plane and connect them to form the polygon.

After plotting the points and connecting them, we find that the polygon is a square with side length 16. The area of a square is given by the square of the side length, so the area of the polygon is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many square units are in the area of the triangle whose vertices are the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the curve $y = (x-3)^2 (x+2)$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we need to find where this curve intersects the $x$ and $y$ axes.  If $y=0$, then $(x-3)^2(x+2)=0$, which has solutions of $x=3$ and $x=-2$.  If $x=0$, then $y=(-3)^2(2)=18$.  So, the curve has two $x$-intercepts and one $y$-intercept.  The length of the base along the $x$-axis is $3-(-2)=5$.  The height from this base is equal to the $y$-intercept, 18.  The area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 5\cdot 18=\boxed{45}$. The answer is $\boxed{45}$

**Solution:** 


The problem is asking for the area of a polygon formed by the intersection of the solution sets of two inequalities. The inequalities are given by $|x + y| - 10 = 0$, $|x - y| - 10 = 0$, $|x| - 8 = 0$, and $|y| - 8 = 0$. 

First, let's solve each inequality separately:

1. $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ implies $|x + y| = 10$, which gives $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$. These are two parallel lines.

2. $|x - y| - 10 = 0$ implies $|x - y| = 10$, which gives $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$. These are also two parallel lines.

3. $|x| - 8 = 0$ implies $|x| = 8$, which gives $x = 8$ and $x = -8$. These are two vertical lines.

4. $|y| - 8 = 0$ implies $|y| = 8$, which gives $y = 8$ and $y = -8$. These are two horizontal lines.

The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,
\begin{align*}

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only way both of these are true is if $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$. The first case gives $x = 10$ and $y = 0$, and the second case gives $x = -10$ and $y = 0$.
Similarly, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, so $x = 8$ or $x = -8$ and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

The four points that satisfy both conditions are $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$. These points form a rectangle with side lengths of 20 and 16. The area of this rectangle is $20 \times 16 = 320$.

**Solution:** 



First, we notice that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

In the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two circles in the $xy$-plane.

In the second case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two more circles in the $xy$-plane.

The intersection of these circles forms a square with side length 16. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. So the area of the convex polygon is 256.
The answer is: $256$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The given equation is a product of two expressions, each of which must be equal to zero for the product to be zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
For the first case, both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ must be zero. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.
For the second case, both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2$ must be zero. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.
The intersection of these eight lines forms a square with side length 10 (since the distance between the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ is 10). The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we first need to understand the given equation and the conditions that make it equal to zero. The equation is:
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]
This equation is equal to zero if either of the two factors is zero. 

The first factor is zero if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These conditions define a square with side length 10 and vertices at $(5, 5)$, $(-5, 5)$, $(-5, -5)$, and $(5, -5)$.

The second factor is zero if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These conditions define a square with side length 16 and vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(8, -8)$.

The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon we are interested in. The vertices of this polygon are the same as the vertices of the smaller square. 

To find the area of this polygon, we can simply find the area of the smaller square. The side length of the smaller square is 10 (since it's inscribed in the square defined by the first factor), so its area is $10^2 = 100$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 100.

The answer is: $100$

This equation equals zero if either of the two factors equals zero. The first factor equals zero if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The second factor equals zero if $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

Now let's analyze these conditions:
1. If $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, this represents a square with side length 20 centered at the origin.
2. If $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, this also represents a square with side length 20 centered at the origin.
3. If $\vert x \vert = 8$, this represents a square with side length 16 centered at the origin, aligned with the x-axis.
4. If $\vert y \vert = 8$, this represents a square with side length 16 centered at the origin, aligned with the y-axis.

The intersection of these squares forms a convex polygon, which is a square with side length 16 centered at the origin. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256.
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols

def area_of_polygon():
    # Calculate the area of the polygon
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length**2
    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is $\boxed{256}$.
