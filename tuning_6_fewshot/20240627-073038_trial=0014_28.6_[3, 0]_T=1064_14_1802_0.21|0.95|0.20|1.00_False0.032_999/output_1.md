**Problem:** 
"What is the minimum value of the expression $2x^2+3y^2+8x-24y+62$ for real $x$ and $y$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Rearranging the expression, we have  \[2x^2+8x+3y^2-24y+62\]We first complete the square in $x$. Factoring a 2 from the first two terms of the expression, we get  \[2(x^2+4x)+3y^2-24y+62\]In order for the expression inside the parenthesis to be a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(4/2)^2=4$ inside the parenthesis. Doing this, we have \[2(x^2+4x+4-4)+3y^2-24y+62 \Rightarrow 2(x+2)^2+3y^2-24y+54\]Now we complete the square in $y$. Factoring a 3 from the $y$ terms in the expression, we get \[2(x+2)^2+3(y^2-8y)+54\]In order for the expression inside the second parenthesis to be a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(8/2)^2=16$ inside the parenthesis. Doing this, we have \[2(x+2)^2+3(y^2-8y+16-16)+54 \Rightarrow 2(x+2)^2+3(y-4)^2+6\]Since the minimum value of $2(x+2)^2$ and $3(y-4)^2$ is $0$ (perfect squares can never be negative), the minimum value of the entire expression is $\boxed{6}$, and is achieved when $x=-2$ and $y=4$. The answer is $\boxed{6}$

**Problem**
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


This problem is a bit more complex than the previous one, but we can still solve it using the same technique of completing the square.

First, let's rewrite the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$. Now, let's consider the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite it as $5(x^2-1.6xy+y^2)$. Now, let's complete the square inside the parenthesis:

\[x^2-1.6xy+y^2 = (x^2-1.6xy+0.64y^2) + 0.36y^2 = (x-0.8y)^2 + 0.36y^2.\]

Now, we have $5(x^2-1.6xy+y^2) = 5[(x-0.8y)^2 + 0.36y^2] = 5(x-0.8y)^2 + 1.8y^2$.

Since $(x-0.8y)^2$ and $y^2$ are both non-negative, the minimum value of $5(x-0.8y)^2 + 1.8y^2$ is achieved when both $(x-0.8y)^2 = 0$ and $y^2 = 0$, which implies $x = 0$ and $y = 0$. However, this does not satisfy the equation $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$.

To find the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we can use the fact that the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is minimized when $x = 0.8y$. Substituting $x = 0.8y$ into the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we get $|0.8y-2y| + |y-1.6y| = 40$, which simplifies to $| -1.2y | + | -0.6y | = 40$. This further simplifies to $1.8y = 40$, so $y = \frac{40}{1.8} = \frac{200}{9}$.

Substituting $y = \frac{200}{9}$ into $x = 0.8y$, we get $x = \frac{160}{9}$.

Finally, substituting $x = \frac{160}{9}$ and $y = \frac{200}{9}$ into $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get $5\left(\frac{160}{9}\right)^2 + 5\left(\frac{200}{9}\right)^2 - 8\left(\frac{160}{9}\right)\left(\frac{200}{9}\right) = \frac{16000}{9}$.

So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $\frac{16000}{9}$. The answer is: $\boxed{\frac{16000}{9}}$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"If $x + 2y= 4$ and $xy = -8$, what is the value of $x^2 + 4y^2$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
We see that $(x + 2y)^2 = (x^2 + 4y^2) + 4xy = 4^2 = 16$. We want to find $x^2 + 4y^2$ and are given $xy = -8$. So, $x^2 + 4y^2 + 4xy = x^2 + 4y^2 + 4(-8) = 16$. It follows that $x^2 + 4y^2 = \boxed{48}$. The answer is $\boxed{48}$

**Problem**
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


This problem is a bit tricky to solve directly. However, we can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to solve it. The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states that for any real numbers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ and $b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n$, we have
\[(a_1^2 + a_2^2 + \ldots + a_n^2)(b_1^2 + b_2^2 + \ldots + b_n^2) \geq (a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 + \ldots + a_nb_n)^2.\]

Let's apply the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to the given problem. Let $a_1 = x - 2y$, $a_2 = y - 2x$, $b_1 = 1$, and $b_2 = 1$. Then we have
\[((x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2)(1^2 + 1^2) \geq ((x - 2y)(1) + (y - 2x)(1))^2.\]
Simplifying the left side gives
\[((x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2)(2) \geq (x - 2y + y - 2x)^2.\]
Simplifying the right side gives
\[((x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2)(2) \geq (-x + y)^2.\]
Since $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$, we have $-x + y = 20$. Substituting this into the inequality gives
\[((x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2)(2) \geq 20^2.\]
Simplifying the right side gives
\[((x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2)(2) \geq 400.\]
Dividing both sides by 2 gives
\[(x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2 \geq 200.\]
Now, let's substitute $x - 2y = a$ and $y - 2x = b$. Then we have
\[a^2 + b^2 \geq 200.\]
We want to minimize $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$. We can rewrite this as
\[5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy = 5\left(\frac{a^2 + b^2}{4}\right) - 4ab = \frac{5(a^2 + b^2)}{4} - 4ab.\]
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we know that $a^2 + b^2 \geq 200$. Therefore, we want to minimize $\frac{5(a^2 + b^2)}{4} - 4ab$ subject to the constraint $a^2 + b^2 \geq 200$.

By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we also know that $(a^2 + b^2)(1^2 + 1^2) \geq (a(1) + b(1))^2$, which simplifies to $2(a^2 + b^2) \geq (a + b)^2$. Since $a + b = -x + y = 20$, we have $2(a^2 + b^2) \geq 20^2 = 400$. Therefore, $a^2 + b^2 \geq 200$.

So, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is achieved when $a^2 + b^2 = 200$. In this case, the minimum value is $\frac{5(200)}{4} - 4ab$.

To find the value of $ab$, we can use the fact that $(a + b)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + 2ab$. Since $a + b = 20$ and $a^2 + b^2 = 200$, we have $20^2 = 200 + 2ab$, which gives $2ab = 400 - 200 = 200$. Therefore, $ab = 100$.

Substituting this into the expression for the minimum value gives
\[\frac{5(200)}{4} - 4(100) = \frac{1000}{4} - 400 = 250 - 400 = -150.\]
However, this is not possible since the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ must be nonnegative. The mistake we made is that the minimum value of $a^2 + b^2$ is actually $200$, not $400$. Let's correct this.

Since $a + b = -x + y = 20$, we have $20^2 = (a + b)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + 2ab$. We know that $a^2 + b^2 = 200$, so we can substitute this into the equation to get $400 = 200 + 2ab$, which gives $2ab = 200$. Therefore, $ab = 100$.

Substituting this into the expression for the minimum value gives
\[\frac{5(200)}{4} - 4(100) = \frac{1000}{4} - 400 = 250 - 400 = -150.\]
Again, this is not possible since the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ must be nonnegative. The mistake we made is that we didn't consider the possibility that $a^2 + b^2$ could be less than 200.

In fact, by the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we know that $(a^2 + b^2)(1^2 + 1^2) \geq (a(1) + b(1))^2$, which simplifies to $2(a^2 + b^2) \geq (a + b)^2$. Since $a + b = -x + y = 20$, we have $2(a^2 + b^2) \geq 20^2 = 400$. Therefore, $a^2 + b^2 \geq 200$.

So, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is achieved when $a^2 + b^2 = 200$. In this case, the minimum value is $\frac{5(200)}{4} - 4ab$.

To find the value of $ab$, we can use the fact that $(a - b)^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab$. Since $a^2 + b^2 = 200$, we have $(a - b)^2 = 200 - 2ab$. We also know that $(a - b)^2 \geq 0$, so we must have $200 - 2ab \geq 0$, which gives $2ab \leq 200$. Therefore, $ab \leq 100$.

Since $ab = 100$ gives a minimum value of $-150$, which is not possible, we must have $ab < 100$. The smallest possible value of $ab$ is achieved when $a = b = 10$, which gives $ab = 100 - \epsilon$ for some small positive $\epsilon$. Substituting this into the expression for the minimum value gives
\[\frac{5(200)}{4} - 4(100 - \epsilon) = \frac{1000}{4} - 400 + 4\epsilon = 250 - 4

**Problem**
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


This problem is a bit tricky to solve directly, but we can use a trick to simplify it. Let's define a new variable $z = x - 2y$. Then we have $|z| + |2z - x| = 40$. We can rewrite this as $|z| + |2z - (z + y)| = 40$, which simplifies to $|z| + |z - y| = 40$. This is a well-known property of absolute values, and it represents a square with side length 40. The area of this square is $40^2/2 = 800$.

Now, let's go back to the original problem. We want to minimize $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = 5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy$. We know that $x^2 + y^2 = (x - 2y)^2 + 5(y - 2x)^2/4 = z^2 + 5(2z - x)^2/4 = z^2 + 5(4z^2 - 4xz + x^2)/4 = z^2 + 5z^2 - 5xz + x^2 = 6z^2 - 5xz + x^2$.

So, we want to minimize $5(6z^2 - 5xz + x^2) - 8xy = 30z^2 - 25xz + 5x^2 - 8xy$. But we know that $z = x - 2y$, so $xz = x(x - 2y) = x^2 - 2xy$. Substituting this into our expression, we get $30z^2 - 25(x^2 - 2xy) + 5x^2 - 8xy = 30z^2 - 25x^2 + 50xy + 5x^2 - 8xy = 30z^2 - 20x^2 + 42xy$.

But we know that $z^2 + y^2 = x^2$, so $z^2 = x^2 - y^2$. Substituting this into our expression, we get $30(x^2 - y^2) - 20x^2 + 42xy = 30x^2 - 30y^2 - 20x^2 + 42xy = 10x^2 - 30y^2 + 42xy$.

Now, we know that the area of the square is 800, so $x^2 + y^2 = 800$. We want to minimize $10x^2 - 30y^2 + 42xy$, subject to the constraint $x^2 + y^2 = 800$.

By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have $(1^2 + (-3)^2)(x^2 + y^2) \geq (x + 3y)^2$, so $(10)(800) \geq (x + 3y)^2$, or $8000 \geq (x + 3y)^2$. Taking the square root of both sides, we get $\sqrt{8000} \geq x + 3y$.

But we also have $(1^2 + 3^2)(x^2 + y^2) \geq (x - 3y)^2$, so $(10)(800) \geq (x - 3y)^2$, or $8000 \geq (x - 3y)^2$. Taking the square root of both sides, we get $\sqrt{8000} \geq x - 3y$.

Adding these two inequalities, we get $2\sqrt{8000} \geq 2x$, so $\sqrt{8000} \geq x$. Similarly, we get $\sqrt{8000} \geq 3y$, so $\sqrt{8000}/3 \geq y$.

Now, we want to minimize $10x^2 - 30y^2 + 42xy$, subject to the constraints $\sqrt{8000} \geq x$ and $\sqrt{8000}/3 \geq y$. By the AM-GM inequality, we have
\[10x^2 - 30y^2 + 42xy \geq 3\sqrt[3]{(10x^2)(30y^2)(42xy)} = 3\sqrt[3]{12600x^3y^3} = 3\sqrt[3]{12600(8000/3)} = 3\sqrt[3]{33600000} = 3000.\]

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is 3000. The answer is: $3000$

Assistant:

 To solve this problem, we can use the method of completing the square. First, we rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $(x^2-4xy+4y^2) + (y^2-8xy+16x^2) = (x-2y)^2 + (y-4x)^2$.

Now, we know that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. By the triangle inequality, we have $|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |(x-2y) - (y-2x)| = |x-y|$. So, $|x-y| = 40$.

Since $(x-2y)^2 + (y-4x)^2 = (x-y)^2 + 2(x-y)(3x-3y) + 12(x-y)^2 = 13(x-y)^2$, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is achieved when $(x-2y)^2 + (y-4x)^2$ is minimized. This occurs when $(x-2y) = 0$ and $(y-4x) = 0$, or equivalently, $x = 2y$ and $y = 4x$.

Substituting $x = 2y$ into $|x-y| = 40$, we get $|2y-y| = 40$, which simplifies to $|y| = 40$. Since $y$ is a real number, we must have $y = \pm 40$. If $y = 40$, then $x = 2y = 80$. If $y = -40$, then $x = 2y = -80$.

Now, we substitute these values into the expression $(x-2y)^2 + (y-4x)^2$:

If $x = 80$ and $y = 40$, then $(x-2y)^2 + (y-4x)^2 = (80-2*40)^2 + (40-4*80)^2 = (0)^2 + (-240)^2 = 57600$.

If $x = -80$ and $y = -40$, then $(x-2y)^2 + (y-4x)^2 = (-80-2*(-40))^2 + (-40-4*(-80))^2 = (0)^2 + (240)^2 = 57600$.

So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 57600. The answer is: $57600$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"What is the minimum value of the expression $2x^2+3y^2+8x-24y+62$ for real $x$ and $y$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Rearranging the expression, we have  \[2x^2+8x+3y^2-24y+62\]We first complete the square in $x$. Factoring a 2 from the first two terms of the expression, we get  \[2(x^2+4x)+3y^2-24y+62\]In order for the expression inside the parenthesis to be a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(4/2)^2=4$ inside the parenthesis. Doing this, we have \[2(x^2+4x+4-4)+3y^2-24y+62 \Rightarrow 2(x+2)^2+3y^2-24y+54\]Now we complete the square in $y$. Factoring a 3 from the $y$ terms in the expression, we get \[2(x+2)^2+3(y^2-8y)+54\]In order for the expression inside the second parenthesis to be a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(8/2)^2=16$ inside the parenthesis. Doing this, we have \[2(x+2)^2+3(y^2-8y+16-16)+54 \Rightarrow 2(x+2)^2+3(y-4)^2+6\]Since the minimum value of $2(x+2)^2$ and $3(y-4)^2$ is $0$ (perfect squares can never be negative), the minimum value of the entire expression is $\boxed{6}$, and is achieved when $x=-2$ and $y=4$. The answer is $\boxed{6}$

**Solution:**


This problem is a bit tricky to solve directly. However, we can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to solve it. The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states that for any real numbers $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$ and $b_1, b_2, ..., b_n$, we have
\[(a_1^2 + a_2^2 + ... + a_n^2)(b_1^2 + b_2^2 + ... + b_n^2) \geq (a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 + ... + a_nb_n)^2.\]

In this problem, we can let $a_1 = x$, $a_2 = y$, $b_1 = 1$, and $b_2 = -2$. Then we have
\[(x^2 + y^2)(1^2 + (-2)^2) \geq (x - 2y)^2.\]
Simplifying the left side gives
\[(x^2 + y^2)(1 + 4) \geq (x - 2y)^2,\]
\[5(x^2 + y^2) \geq (x - 2y)^2.\]
Similarly, we can let $a_1 = y$, $a_2 = x$, $b_1 = -2$, and $b_2 = 1$. Then we have
\[(y^2 + x^2)((-2)^2 + 1^2) \geq (y - 2x)^2.\]
Simplifying the left side gives
\[(y^2 + x^2)(4 + 1) \geq (y - 2x)^2,\]
\[5(y^2 + x^2) \geq (y - 2x)^2.\]
Adding these two inequalities together, we get
\[10(x^2 + y^2) \geq (x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2.\]
Since $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$, we have
\[(x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2 = 40^2 = 1600.\]
Substituting this into the inequality, we get
\[10(x^2 + y^2) \geq 1600,\]
\[x^2 + y^2 \geq \frac{1600}{10} = 160.\]
Now we want to minimize $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$. We can rewrite this as
\[5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy = 5(x^2 + y^2) - 4(2xy) = 5(x^2 + y^2) - 4[(x - y)^2 - (x^2 + y^2)] = 9(x^2 + y^2) - 4(x - y)^2.\]
Since $x^2 + y^2 \geq 160$, we have
\[9(x^2 + y^2) \geq 9 \cdot 160 = 1440.\]
And since $(x - y)^2 \geq 0$, we have
\[9(x^2 + y^2) - 4(x - y)^2 \geq 1440 - 4 \cdot 0 = 1440.\]
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is $1440$.
The answer is: $1440$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"What is the minimum value of the expression $2x^2+3y^2+8x-24y+62$ for real $x$ and $y$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Rearranging the expression, we have  \[2x^2+8x+3y^2-24y+62\]We first complete the square in $x$. Factoring a 2 from the first two terms of the expression, we get  \[2(x^2+4x)+3y^2-24y+62\]In order for the expression inside the parenthesis to be a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(4/2)^2=4$ inside the parenthesis. Doing this, we have \[2(x^2+4x+4-4)+3y^2-24y+62 \Rightarrow 2(x+2)^2+3y^2-24y+54\]Now we complete the square in $y$. Factoring a 3 from the $y$ terms in the expression, we get \[2(x+2)^2+3(y^2-8y)+54\]In order for the expression inside the second parenthesis to be a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(8/2)^2=16$ inside the parenthesis. Doing this, we have \[2(x+2)^2+3(y^2-8y+16-16)+54 \Rightarrow 2(x+2)^2+3(y-4)^2+6\]Since the minimum value of $2(x+2)^2$ and $3(y-4)^2$ is $0$ (perfect squares can never be negative), the minimum value of the entire expression is $\boxed{6}$, and is achieved when $x=-2$ and $y=4$. The answer is $\boxed{6}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
**Problem**
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


This problem is a bit tricky to solve directly, but we can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to solve it.

The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states that for any real numbers $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$ and $b_1, b_2, ..., b_n$, we have:
\[(a_1^2 + a_2^2 + ... + a_n^2)(b_1^2 + b_2^2 + ... + b_n^2) \geq (a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 + ... + a_nb_n)^2.\]

Let's apply this inequality to our problem. Let $a_1 = x$, $a_2 = y$, $b_1 = 1$, and $b_2 = -2$. Then we have:
\[(x^2 + y^2)(1^2 + (-2)^2) \geq (x - 2y)^2.\]
Simplifying the left side gives:
\[(x^2 + y^2)(1 + 4) \geq (x - 2y)^2,\]
\[5(x^2 + y^2) \geq (x - 2y)^2.\]

Similarly, let $a_1 = y$, $a_2 = x$, $b_1 = -2$, and $b_2 = 1$. Then we have:
\[(y^2 + x^2)((-2)^2 + 1^2) \geq (y - 2x)^2.\]
Simplifying the left side gives:
\[(y^2 + x^2)(4 + 1) \geq (y - 2x)^2,\]
\[5(y^2 + x^2) \geq (y - 2x)^2.\]

Adding these two inequalities together, we get:
\[10(x^2 + y^2) \geq (x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2.\]

Now, let's substitute the given condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ into the inequality. Since $|a| + |b| \geq |a + b|$, we have:
\[|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| \geq |(x - 2y) + (y - 2x)| = |-x - y| = |-(x + y)| = |x + y|.\]
So, $|x + y| = 40$.

Now, let's substitute this into the inequality:
\[10(x^2 + y^2) \geq (x + y)^2.\]
Substituting $|x + y| = 40$, we get:
\[10(x^2 + y^2) \geq 40^2 = 1600.\]
Dividing both sides by 10, we get:
\[x^2 + y^2 \geq 160.\]

Now, let's substitute this into the expression we want to minimize:
\[5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = 5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy.\]
Since $x^2 + y^2 \geq 160$, we have:
\[5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy \geq 5*160 - 8xy = 800 - 8xy.\]

To minimize this expression, we need to maximize $8xy$. By the AM-GM inequality, we have:
\[8xy \leq 4(x^2 + y^2).\]
Substituting $x^2 + y^2 \geq 160$, we get:
\[8xy \leq 4*160 = 640.\]

So, the maximum value of $8xy$ is 640. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is:
\[800 - 640 = 160.\]
The answer is: $160$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"If $x + 2y= 4$ and $xy = -8$, what is the value of $x^2 + 4y^2$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
We see that $(x + 2y)^2 = (x^2 + 4y^2) + 4xy = 4^2 = 16$. We want to find $x^2 + 4y^2$ and are given $xy = -8$. So, $x^2 + 4y^2 + 4xy = x^2 + 4y^2 + 4(-8) = 16$. It follows that $x^2 + 4y^2 = \boxed{48}$. The answer is $\boxed{48}$
