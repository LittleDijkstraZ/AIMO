**Problem:** 
"Let $\mathcal{P}$ be the parabola in the plane determined by the equation $y = x^2.$  Suppose a circle $\mathcal{C}$ intersects $\mathcal{P}$ at four distinct points.  If three of these points are $(-28,784),$ $(-2,4),$ and $(13,169),$ find the sum of the distances from the focus of $\mathcal{P}$ to all four of the intersection points."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Let the four intersection points be $(a,a^2),$ $(b,b^2),$ $(c,c^2),$ and $(d,d^2).$  Let the equation of the circle be
\[(x - k)^2 + (y - h)^2 = r^2.\]Substituting $y = x^2,$ we get
\[(x - k)^2 + (x^2 - h)^2 = r^2.\]Expanding this equation, we get a fourth degree polynomial whose roots are $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ and $d.$  Furthermore, the coefficient of $x^3$ is 0, so by Vieta's formulas, $a + b + c + d = 0.$

We are given that three intersection points are $(-28,784),$ $(-2,4),$ and $(13,196),$ so the fourth root is $-((-28) + (-2) + 13) = 17.$

The distance from the focus to a point on the parabola is equal to the distance from the point to the directrix, which is $y = -\frac{1}{4}.$  Thus, the sum of the distances is
\[784 + \frac{1}{4} + 4 + \frac{1}{4} + 169 + \frac{1}{4} + 17^2 + \frac{1}{4} = \boxed{1247}.\] The answer is $\boxed{1247}$

The output is not a numerical value, which indicates that the solution is incorrect. Let's try a different approach.

From the equation of the parabola, we have $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$. When $y = 4$, we get $4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l$. Rearranging terms, we have $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$. This is a quadratic equation, and its solutions are the x-coordinates of the points of intersection of the parabola and the line $y = 4$. Let's denote these solutions as $x_1$ and $x_2$.

The distance between these two points is given by $|x_2 - x_1| = 6$. Using the formula for the difference of the roots of a quadratic equation, we have $|x_2 - x_1| = \frac{2\sqrt{D}}{a}$, where $D$ is the discriminant of the quadratic equation and $a$ is the coefficient of $x^2$. In this case, $D = (2k)^2 - 4k(l - 4) = 4k^2 - 4k(l - 4) = 4k(k - l + 4)$. So we have $\frac{2\sqrt{4k(k - l + 4)}}{k} = 6$, which simplifies to $\sqrt{4(k - l + 4)} = 3$. Squaring both sides, we get $4(k - l + 4) = 9$, or $k - l + 4 = \frac{9}{4}$. Solving for $l$, we get $l = k - \frac{1}{4}$.

Now, we want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. For point $A$ (or $B$), we have $x = x_1$ (or $x = x_2$) and $y = kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l$ (or $y = kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l$). So the square of the distance is $(x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2)$ (or $(x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2)$).

Let's calculate this sum for the solutions $x_1$ and $x_2$. We have:

\[(x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2) + (x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2)\]

Substituting $l = k - \frac{1}{4}$, we get:

\[(x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + k - \frac{1}{4})^2) + (x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + k - \frac{1}{4})^2)\]

Now, we can use the fact that $x_1$ and $x_2$ are the roots of the quadratic equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$. Therefore, $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k} = \frac{k - \frac{1}{4} - 4}{k} = \frac{k - \frac{17}{4}}{k}$.

We can use these relations to simplify the expression above. After simplification, we get:

\[(2^2 + (k(2)^2 - 2k(2) + k - \frac{1}{4})^2) = (4 + (4k - 4k + k - \frac{1}{4})^2) = 4 + (\frac{3}{4})^2 = 4 + \frac{9}{16} = \frac{64 + 9}{16} = \frac{73}{16}\]

So the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $\frac{73}{16}$.

The answer is: $\boxed{\frac{73}{16}}$

**Problem:** 
"Let $\mathcal{P}$ be the parabola in the plane determined by the equation $y = x^2.$  Suppose a circle $\mathcal{C}$ intersects $\mathcal{P}$ at four distinct points.  If three of these points are $(-28,784),$ $(-2,4),$ and $(13,169),$ find the sum of the distances from the focus of $\mathcal{P}$ to all four of the intersection points."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Let the four intersection points be $(a,a^2),$ $(b,b^2),$ $(c,c^2),$ and $(d,d^2).$  Let the equation of the circle be
\[(x - k)^2 + (y - h)^2 = r^2.\]Substituting $y = x^2,$ we get
\[(x - k)^2 + (x^2 - h)^2 = r^2.\]Expanding this equation, we get a fourth degree polynomial whose roots are $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ and $d.$  Furthermore, the coefficient of $x^3$ is 0, so by Vieta's formulas, $a + b + c + d = 0.$

We are given that three intersection points are $(-28,784),$ $(-2,4),$ and $(13,196),$ so the fourth root is $-((-28) + (-2) + 13) = 17.$

The distance from the focus to a point on the parabola is equal to the distance from the point to the directrix, which is $y = -\frac{1}{4}.$  Thus, the sum of the distances is
\[784 + \frac{1}{4} + 4 + \frac{1}{4} + 169 + \frac{1}{4} + 17^2 + \frac{1}{4} = \boxed{1247}.\] The answer is $\boxed{1247}$

**Problem**
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we first need to find the coordinates of points $A$ and $B$. Since the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$, we can set $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$ and solve for $x$. The solutions to this equation are the $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$.

Let's denote the roots of the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$ as $x_1$ and $x_2$. We know that $|x_1 - x_2| = 6/k$ (since the distance between the points is 6 divided by the scale factor $k$ of the parabola).

Now, we need to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin $(0, 0)$ is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. So we need to find the sum of $x_1^2 + y_1^2 = x_1^2 + (4)^2$ and $x_2^2 + y_2^2 = x_2^2 + (4)^2$.

Let's denote $S = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 8(x_1 + x_2) + 32$. We can express $x_1 + x_2$ and $x_1x_2$ in terms of the coefficients of the quadratic equation using Vieta's formulas. We have $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$.

Substituting these into the expression for $S$, we get $S = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 16 + 32 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 + 48 = 2^2 - 2\frac{l - 4}{k} + 48 = 4 - \frac{2l - 8}{k} + 48 = \frac{4k - 2l + 8}{k} + 48$.

We also know that $|x_1 - x_2| = 6/k$, so $(x_1 - x_2)^2 = \left(\frac{6}{k}\right)^2 \Rightarrow x_1^2 + x_2^2 - 2x_1x_2 = \left(\frac{6}{k}\right)^2 \Rightarrow x_1^2 + x_2^2 = 2\frac{l - 4}{k} + \left(\frac{6}{k}\right)^2$.

Substituting this into the expression for $S$, we get $S = 2\frac{l - 4}{k} + \left(\frac{6}{k}\right)^2 + \frac{4k - 2l + 8}{k} + 48 = 2(l - 4) + 36 + 4k - 2l + 8 + 48k = 4k + 84 + 48k = 52k + 84$.

We know that $k > 0$, so $S > 84$. To minimize $S$, we should minimize $k$. Since $k > 0$, the minimum value of $k$ is 1. Substituting $k = 1$ into the expression for $S$, we get $S = 52 + 84 = 136$.

Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is 136. The answer is: $136$

"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


This problem involves finding the sum of the squares of the distances from points $A$ and $B$ to the origin, given that the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$ that are distance 6 apart.

First, we find the x-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$ by setting $y = 4$ in the equation of the parabola and solving for $x$. This gives us the equation $4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l$, or $kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0$.

By the quadratic formula, the x-coordinates of $A$ and $B$ are given by $\frac{2k \pm \sqrt{(2k)^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k} = 1 \pm \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k} = 1 \pm \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}}{2k}$.

The distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, so we have $\left| \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}}{k} \right| = 6$. Squaring both sides gives $\frac{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}{k^2} = 36$. Multiplying both sides by $k^2$ gives $4k^2 - 4kl + 16k = 36k^2$. Rearranging terms gives $32k^2 = 4kl$, so $8k = l$.

Now we want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. For point $A$, this is $\sqrt{(1 - \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}}{2k})^2 + 4}$. For point $B$, this is $\sqrt{(1 + \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}}{2k})^2 + 4}$.

The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is therefore
\[(1 - \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}}{2k})^2 + 4 + (1 + \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}}{2k})^2 + 4.\]

We can simplify this expression using the fact that $8k = l$. After simplifying, we find that the sum of the squares of the distances is $100$.

Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is 100. The answer is: $100$

    # (solutions[1]**2 + solutions[0]**2) = (solutions[1]**2 - 2*solutions[1]*solutions[0] + solutions[0]**2) + 4*(solutions[1]*solutions[0])
    # to get (solutions[1]**2 + solutions[0]**2) = 36 + 4*(solutions[1]*solutions[0])
    # We know that the product of the roots of a quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0 is c/a,
    # so solutions[1]*solutions[0] = l/k.
    # Substituting this into the equation gives (solutions[1]**2 + solutions[0]**2) = 36 + 4*(l/k)
    # We want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from A and B to the origin,
    # which is (solutions[1]**2 + solutions[0]**2).
    # Therefore, we can substitute this into the equation to get the sum of the squares of the distances = 36 + 4*(l/k)

    # We know that l = 4 (since the parabola intersects the line y = 4 at A and B),
    # so we can substitute this into the equation to get the sum of the squares of the distances = 36 + 4*(4/k) = 36 + 16/k
    # We also know that k > 0 (since the parabola is a valid graph),
    # so we can substitute this into the equation to get the sum of the squares of the distances = 36 + 16/k

    # We want to find the minimum value of this expression,
    # which occurs when 16/k is minimized (since 36 is a constant).
    # Since k > 0, 16/k is minimized when k is maximized.
    # The maximum value of k is achieved when the parabola is as 'wide' as possible,
    # which occurs when the vertex of the parabola is at the origin (since the vertex is the point (h, k) in the equation y = a(x - h)^2 + k,
    # and the vertex is at the origin when h = 0 and k = 0).
    # Therefore, the maximum value of k is achieved when the parabola is y = x^2,
    # and in this case, k = 1.
    # Substituting this into the equation gives the sum of the squares of the distances = 36 + 16/1 = 52.
