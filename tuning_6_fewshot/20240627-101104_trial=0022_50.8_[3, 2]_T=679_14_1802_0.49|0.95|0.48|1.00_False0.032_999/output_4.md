**Problem:** 
"Let $
f(n) =
\begin{cases}
n^2+1 & \text{if }n\text{ is odd} \\
\dfrac{n}{2} & \text{if }n\text{ is even}
\end{cases}.
$

For how many integers $n$ from 1 to 100, inclusive, does $f ( f (\dotsb f (n) \dotsb )) = 1$ for some number of applications of $f$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we note that if $n$ is a positive integer, then $f(n)$ is also a positive integer.  We claim that $f ( f (\dotsb f (n) \dotsb )) = 1$ for some number of applications of $f$ only for $n = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32,$ and $64.$  (In other words, $n$ must be a power of 2.)

Note that $f(1) = 2,$ so $f(f(1)) = f(2) = 1.$  If $n > 1$ is a power of 2, it is easy to see that repeated applications of $f$ on $n$ eventually reach 1.

Suppose $n$ is an odd positive integer, where $n > 1.$  Write $n = 2k + 1,$ where $k$ is a positive integer.  Since $n$ is odd,
\[f(n) = n^2 + 1 = (2k + 1)^2 + 1 = 4k^2 + 4k + 2 = 2(2k^2 + 2k + 1).\]Since $2k^2 + 2k$ is always even, $2k^2 + 2k + 1$ is always odd (and greater than 1), so $f(n)$ can never be a power of 2 when $n$ is odd and greater than 1.

Now, suppose $n$ is even.  For example, if $n = 2^3 \cdot 11,$ then
\[f(2^3 \cdot 11) = f(2^2 \cdot 11) = f(2 \cdot 11) = f(11),\]which we know is not a power of 2.

More generally, suppose $n = 2^e \cdot m,$ where $e$ is nonnegative and $m$ is odd.  Then
\[f(2^e \cdot m) = f(2^{e - 1} \cdot m) = f(2^{e - 2} \cdot m) = \dots = f(m).\]If $m = 1,$ then $n$ is a power of 2, and the sequence eventually reaches 1.  Otherwise, $f(m)$ is not a power of 2.  We also know that $f(m)$ is odd and greater than 1, $f(f(m))$ is not a power of 2 either, and so on.  Thus, the sequence can never reach 1.

Therefore, $n$ must be one of the $\boxed{7}$ values 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, or 64. The answer is $\boxed{7}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we can use the second equation to find the value of $f(100)$. We know that $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, so we can find $f(50)$ and $f(25)$ first.

We start with $f(50)$:
\[f(50) = 2f(25) + 1.\]

Next, we find $f(25)$:
\[f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1.\]
But $12.5$ is not a natural number, so we cannot use the second equation directly. We need to use the first equation to find a way to continue.

From the first equation, we know that $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. If we let $n = 12.5$, we get
\[f(f(f(12.5))) = 8 \cdot 12.5 - 7 = 93.\]

Now we can use this to find $f(25)$:
\[f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1 = 2 \cdot 93^{1/3} + 1 = 2 \cdot 4.5 + 1 = 10.\]

Finally, we can find $f(50)$:
\[f(50) = 2f(25) + 1 = 2 \cdot 10 + 1 = 21.\]

And then we can find $f(100)$:
\[f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2 \cdot 21 + 1 = 43.\]

So, $f(100) = 43$. The answer is $\boxed{43}$.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We are given the function $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. This implies that if we apply the function $f$ three times to any number $n$, we get $8n-7$.

2. We also know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. This means that if we double any number $n$, applying the function $f$ to it is equivalent to doubling the result of applying $f$ to $n$ and then adding 1.

3. We want to find $f(100)$. To do this, we can use the second equation to find $f(200)$, then use that to find $f(400)$, and finally use that to find $f(800)$.

4. We know that $f(f(f(800)))=8*800-7=6400-7=6393$.

5. But we also know that $f(f(f(800)))$ is equivalent to applying the function $f$ three times to $800$. So we have $f(f(f(800)))=f(f(6400-7))=f(f(6393))$.

6. Using the second equation, we can find $f(6393)$ by doubling $f(3196.5)$ and adding 1. But $3196.5$ is not an integer, so we must be missing something.

7. Let's go back and look at the first equation again. If we set $n=1$, we get $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$. This means that there must be a value $m$ such that $f(m)=1$.

8. Now, let's substitute $m$ into the second equation. We have $f(2m)=2f(m)+1=2*1+1=3$. This means that there must be a value $k$ such that $f(k)=3$.

9. Continuing in this way, we find that $f(15)=5$, $f(30)=10$, $f(60)=20$, $f(120)=40$, $f(240)=80$, $f(480)=160$, $f(960)=320$, $f(1920)=640$, $f(3840)=1280$, $f(7680)=2560$, $f(15360)=5120$, $f(30720)=10240$, $f(61440)=20480$, $f(122880)=40960$, $f(245760)=81920$, $f(491520)=163840$, $f(983040)=327680$, $f(1966080)=655360$, $f(3932160)=1310720$, $f(7864320)=2621440$, $f(15728640)=5242880$, $f(31457280)=10485760$, $f(62914560)=20971520$, $f(125829120)=41943040$, $f(251658240)=83886080$, $f(503316480)=167772160$, $f(1006632960)=335544320$, $f(2013265920)=671088640$, $f(4026531840)=1342177280$, $f(8053063680)=2684354560$, $f(16106127360)=5368709120$, $f(32212254720)=10737418240$.

10. Now we can see that $f(32212254720)=10737418240$. But we want to find $f(800)$, not $f(32212254720)$.

11. Notice that $800=2^3*100$. So we can use the second equation repeatedly to find $f(800)$.

12. We have $f(800)=2f(400)+1$, $f(400)=2f(200)+1$, and $f(200)=2f(100)+1$.

13. We know that $f(100)$ is the value we are trying to find. But we can use the second equation to find $f(200)$, $f(400)$, and $f(800)$ in terms of $f(100)$.

14. We have $f(200)=2f(100)+1$, $f(400)=2f(200)+1=2(2f(100)+1)+1=4f(100)+3$, and $f(800)=2f(400)+1=2(4f(100)+3)+1=8f(100)+7$.

15. But we know that $f(800)=10737418240$. So we have $8f(100)+7=10737418240$, and solving for $f(100)$ gives $f(100)=\frac{10737418240-7}{8}=1342177279$.

So, $f(100)=1342177279$.

But this is not an integer, so we must have made a mistake somewhere. Let's go back and check our work.

After re-examining our steps, we realize that we made a mistake in step 10. We should have stopped at $f(3840)=1280$ instead of continuing. This is because $800$ is not a power of $2$, so we cannot simply use the second equation to find $f(800)$ in terms of $f(100)$.

Let's go back and re-evaluate the problem.

We know that $f(f(f(800)))=6393$. This means that there must be a value $m$ such that $f(m)=6393$.

Now, let's substitute $m$ into the second equation. We have $f(2m)=2f(m)+1=2*6393+1=12787$. This means that there must be a value $k$ such that $f(k)=12787$.

Continuing in this way, we find that $f(6393)=1$, $f(3196.5)$ is not an integer, so we must be missing something.

Let's go back and look at the first equation again. If we set $n=1$, we get $f(f(f(1)))=1$. This

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $
f(n) =
\begin{cases}
n^2+1 & \text{if }n\text{ is odd} \\
\dfrac{n}{2} & \text{if }n\text{ is even}
\end{cases}.
$

For how many integers $n$ from 1 to 100, inclusive, does $f ( f (\dotsb f (n) \dotsb )) = 1$ for some number of applications of $f$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we note that if $n$ is a positive integer, then $f(n)$ is also a positive integer.  We claim that $f ( f (\dotsb f (n) \dotsb )) = 1$ for some number of applications of $f$ only for $n = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32,$ and $64.$  (In other words, $n$ must be a power of 2.)

Note that $f(1) = 2,$ so $f(f(1)) = f(2) = 1.$  If $n > 1$ is a power of 2, it is easy to see that repeated applications of $f$ on $n$ eventually reach 1.

Suppose $n$ is an odd positive integer, where $n > 1.$  Write $n = 2k + 1,$ where $k$ is a positive integer.  Since $n$ is odd,
\[f(n) = n^2 + 1 = (2k + 1)^2 + 1 = 4k^2 + 4k + 2 = 2(2k^2 + 2k + 1).\]Since $2k^2 + 2k$ is always even, $2k^2 + 2k + 1$ is always odd (and greater than 1), so $f(n)$ can never be a power of 2 when $n$ is odd and greater than 1.

Now, suppose $n$ is even.  For example, if $n = 2^3 \cdot 11,$ then
\[f(2^3 \cdot 11) = f(2^2 \cdot 11) = f(2 \cdot 11) = f(11),\]which we know is not a power of 2.

More generally, suppose $n = 2^e \cdot m,$ where $e$ is nonnegative and $m$ is odd.  Then
\[f(2^e \cdot m) = f(2^{e - 1} \cdot m) = f(2^{e - 2} \cdot m) = \dots = f(m).\]If $m = 1,$ then $n$ is a power of 2, and the sequence eventually reaches 1.  Otherwise, $f(m)$ is not a power of 2.  We also know that $f(m)$ is odd and greater than 1, $f(f(m))$ is not a power of 2 either, and so on.  Thus, the sequence can never reach 1.

Therefore, $n$ must be one of the $\boxed{7}$ values 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, or 64. The answer is $\boxed{7}$

**Solution:** 



To find $f(100)$, we need to use the given equations to transform $100$ into a value that we can easily compute. 

First, let's try to simplify the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. If we set $n = f(n')$ for some $n'$, then we have $f(f(f(n')))=8f(n')-7$. This means that applying the function $f$ three times to any number $n'$ gives $8f(n')-7$. 

Now, let's try to use the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. If we set $n = f(n')$ for some $n'$, then we have $f(2f(n'))=2f(f(n'))+1$. This means that doubling a number and applying the function $f$ gives twice the result of applying the function $f$ to the number, plus one.

Let's try to find a number $n'$ such that $f(n') = 1$. From the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, if we set $n = 1$, we get $f(2)=2f(1)+1$. If we set $f(1) = 1$, then we have $f(2)=2*1+1=3$. Now, if we set $n = 3$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we get $f(f(f(3)))=8*3-7=19$. But we know that $f(f(3))=f(2*1+1)=2f(1)+1=2*1+1=3$, so $f(3)=19/3$, which is not an integer, so $f(1) = 1$ is not a valid solution.

Let's try another value for $f(1)$. If we set $f(1) = 2$, then we have $f(2)=2f(1)+1=2*2+1=5$. Now, if we set $n = 5$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we get $f(f(f(5)))=8*5-7=33$. But we know that $f(f(5))=f(2*2+1)=2f(2)+1=2*5+1=11$, so $f(5)=33/11=3$, and $f(3)=19/3$, which is not an integer, so $f(1) = 2$ is also not a valid solution.

Let's try another value for $f(1)$. If we set $f(1) = 3$, then we have $f(2)=2f(1)+1=2*3+1=7$. Now, if we set $n = 7$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we get $f(f(f(7)))=8*7-7=51$. But we know that $f(f(7))=f(2*3+1)=2f(3)+1$, and $f(3)=f(2*1+1)=2f(1)+1=2*3+1=7$, so $f(7)=51/7$, which is not an integer, so $f(1) = 3$ is also not a valid solution.

Let's try another value for $f(1)$. If we set $f(1) = 4$, then we have $f(2)=2f(1)+1=2*4+1=9$. Now, if we set $n = 9$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we get $f(f(f(9)))=8*9-7=65$. But we know that $f(f(9))=f(2*4+1)=2f(4)+1$, and $f(4)=f(2*2)=2f(2)=2*9=18$, so $f(9)=65/18$, which is not an integer, so $f(1) = 4$ is also not a valid solution.

Let's try another value for $f(1)$. If we set $f(1) = 5$, then we have $f(2)=2f(1)+1=2*5+1=11$. Now, if we set $n = 11$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we get $f(f(f(11)))=8*11-7=83$. But we know that $f(f(11))=f(2*5+1)=2f(5)+1$, and $f(5)=f(2*2+1)=2f(2)+1=2*11+1=23$, so $f(11)=83/23=3.608695652173913$, which is not an integer, so $f(1) = 5$ is also not a valid solution.

Let's try another value for $f(1)$. If we set $f(1) = 6$, then we have $f(2)=2f(1)+1=2*6+1=13$. Now, if we set $n = 13$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we get $f(f(f(13)))=8*13-7=99$. But we know that $f(f(13))=f(2*6+1)=2f(6)+1$, and $f(6)=f(2*3)=2f(3)=2*13=26$, so $f(13)=99/26=3.8076923076923077$, which is not an integer, so $f(1) = 6$ is also not a valid solution.

Let's try another value for $f(1)$. If we set $f(1) = 7$, then we have $f(2)=2f(1)+1=2*7+1=15$. Now, if we set $n = 15$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we get $f(f(f(15)))=8*15-7=113$. But we know that $f(f(15))=f(2*7+1)=2f(7)+1$, and $f(7)=f(2*3+1)=2f(3)+1=2*15+1=31$, so $f(15)=113/31=3.6451612903225806$, which is not an integer, so $f(1) = 7$ is also not a valid solution.

Let's try another value for $f(1)$. If we set $f(1) = 8$, then we have $f(2)=2f(1)+1=2*8+1=17$. Now, if we set $n = 17$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we get $f(f(f(17)))=8*17-7=129$. But we know that $f(f(17))=f(2*8+1)=2f(8)+1$, and $f(8)=f(2*4)=2f(4)=2*17=34$, so $f(17)=129/34=3.7999999

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"The function $f$ is defined on the set of integers and satisfies \[f(n)= \begin{cases}  n-3 & \mbox{if }n\ge 1000 \\  f(f(n+5)) & \mbox{if }n<1000. \end{cases}\]Find $f(84)$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Denote by (1) and (2) the two parts of the definition of $f$, respectively. If we begin to use the definition of $f$ to compute $f(84)$, we use (2) until the argument is at least $1000$: \[f(84) = f(f(89)) = f(f(f(94))) = \dots = f^N(1004)\](where $f^N$ denotes composing $f$ with itself $N$ times, for some $N$). The numbers $84, 89, 94, \dots, 1004$ form an arithmetic sequence with common difference $5$; since $1004 - 84 = 920 = 184 \cdot 5$, this sequence has $184 + 1 = 185$ terms, so $N = 185$.

At this point, (1) and (2) are both used: we compute \[\begin{aligned} f^N(1004) &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-1}(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-1}(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(1000) \\ &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(997) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1002) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(999) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1004). \end{aligned}\]Repeating this process, we see that \[f^N(1004) = f^{N-2}(1004) = f^{N-4}(1004) = \dots = f^3(1004).\](The pattern breaks down for $f^k(1004)$ when $k$ is small, so it is not true that $f^3(1004) = f(1004)$.) Now, we have \[f^3(1004) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^2(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^2(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(1000) \stackrel{(1)}{=} \boxed{997}.\] The answer is $\boxed{997}$

**Problem**
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



First, we can see that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ tells us that $f$ is an injective (one-to-one) function. This is because if $f(a) = f(b)$, then applying $f$ three times on both sides gives $f(f(f(a))) = f(f(f(b)))$, or $8a-7 = 8b-7$, which implies $a=b$.

Next, we can use the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to find $f(1)$, $f(2)$, $f(3)$, and so on. We can start with $n=1$, we get $f(2)=2f(1)+1$. Since $f$ is injective, $f(1)$ cannot be zero, so we can assume $f(1)=1$ (we can check later if our assumption is correct). Then we have $f(2)=2*1+1=3$.

Then we can use $f(2)=3$ to find $f(4)$ using the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we get $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2*3+1=7$.

Then we can use $f(4)=7$ to find $f(8)$ using the same equation, we get $f(8)=2f(4)+1=2*7+1=15$.

We can continue this process, and we find that $f(1)=1$, $f(2)=3$, $f(4)=7$, $f(8)=15$, $f(16)=31$, $f(32)=63$, and so on. It seems that $f(2^n)=2^n+1-2$.

Now we can use the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to verify our assumption. If we let $n=2^k$, then $f(f(f(2^k)))=8*2^k-7$. Since $f(2^k)=2^k+1-2=2^k-1$, we have $f(f(f(2^k)))=f(f(2^k-1))=f(2^{k-1}-1)$.

We can continue this process, and we find that $f(f(f(2^k)))=2^k-1$ for all $k$. So our assumption $f(2^n)=2^n+1-2$ is correct.

Finally, we can find $f(100)$ by expressing $100$ as a sum of powers of $2$. We have $100=64+32+4=2^6+2^5+2^2$. So $f(100)=f(2^6+2^5+2^2)=f(2^6)+f(2^5)+f(2^2)=63+31+3=97$.

So $f(100)=97$. The answer is: $97$

**Problem:** 
"The function $f(n)$ is defined on the positive integers such that $f(f(n)) = 2n$ and $f(4n + 1) = 4n + 3$ for all positive integers $n.$  Find $f(1000).$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Consider the expression $f(f(f(a))).$  Since $f(f(a)) = 2a,$ this is equal to $f(2a).$  But taking $n = f(a)$ in $f(f(n)) = 2n,$ we get
\[f(f(f(a))) = 2f(a).\]Hence,
\[f(2a) = 2f(a)\]for all positive integers $a.$

Then
\[f(1000) = 2f(500) = 4f(250) = 8f(125).\]Taking $n = 31$ in $f(4n + 1) = 4n + 3,$ we get
\[f(125) = 127,\]so $f(1000) = \boxed{1016}.$ The answer is $\boxed{1016}$

**Problem**
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."

**Solution:**



To solve this problem, we need to find the value of $f(100)$ given the function $f$ that satisfies the two conditions $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.

First, let's find the value of $f(1)$ using the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Setting $n=1$, we get $f(2)=2f(1)+1$. Since $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$, we have $f(1)=1$.

Now we can use the second condition to find the value of $f(2)$: $f(2)=2f(1)+1=2*1+1=3$.

Next, we can find the value of $f(3)$ using the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. Setting $n=1$, we get $f(f(f(1)))=f(f(1))=f(3)=8*1-7=1$. But we already know that $f(1)=1$, so $f(3)=1$.

Finally, we can find the value of $f(100)$ using the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We know that $f(100)$ is twice $f(50)$ plus one. Similarly, $f(50)$ is twice $f(25)$ plus one, and so on. We can keep applying this rule until we reach $f(1)$, which we know is 1.

So we have:
$f(1) = 1$
$f(2) = 3$
$f(3) = 1$
$f(4) = 5$
$f(5) = 3$
$f(6) = 7$
$f(7) = 1$
$f(8) = 9$
$f(9) = 3$
$f(10) = 11$
...
$f(100) = 191$

So the value of $f(100)$ is 191. The answer is: $191$

**Solution:** 



To find the value of $f(100)$, we need to use the given equations step by step. 

First, let's find the value of $f(f(100))$ using the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$:
\[f(f(f(100)))=8(100)-7=793.\]

Then, we can find the value of $f(f(100))$ by setting $n=100$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$:
\[f(f(f(100)))=8(100)-7=793.\]
So, $f(f(100))$ is the number that when substituted into $f$ gives $793$.

Next, let's find the value of $f(100)$ by setting $n=f(100)$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$:
\[f(f(f(100)))=8f(100)-7.\]
But we know that $f(f(f(100)))=793$, so we can substitute this into the equation:
\[793=8f(100)-7.\]
Adding $7$ to both sides gives:
\[800=8f(100).\]
Dividing both sides by $8$ gives:
\[f(100)=100.\]

So the value of $f(100)$ is $100$.

Therefore, the value of $f(100)$ is $100$. The answer is: $\boxed{100}$

**Solution:** 



To find the value of $f(100)$, we first need to find a general expression for $f(n)$. We are given two equations:

1. $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$
2. $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$

From equation (2), we can see that $f(n)$ is an increasing function. We can start by substituting $n = 1$ into equation (2) to get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. Now, we can substitute $n = 2$ into equation (2) to get $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$. By substituting $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$ into this equation, we get $f(4) = 2(2f(1) + 1) + 1 = 4f(1) + 3$.

Continuing this process, we can find that $f(2^k) = 2^kf(1) + (2^k - 1)$ for all positive integers $k$.

Now, let's substitute $n = f(1)$ into equation (1). We get $f(f(f(f(1)))) = 8f(1) - 7$. Since $f(f(f(1))) = f(f(2)) = f(2f(1) + 1)$, we can substitute $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$ into this equation to get $f(2f(1) + 1) = 8f(1) - 7$. By substituting $f(2f(1) + 1) = 2f(f(1)) + 1$, we get $2f(f(1)) + 1 = 8f(1) - 7$. Solving this equation for $f(1)$, we get $f(1) = 3$.

Now, we can find $f(100)$ by finding $f(2^6 + 34)$, which is $f(64 + 34) = f(98)$. By substituting $n = 49$ into equation (2), we get $f(98) = 2f(49) + 1$. By substituting $n = 24$ into equation (2), we get $f(49) = 2f(24) + 1$. By substituting $n = 12$ into equation (2), we get $f(24) = 2f(12) + 1$. By substituting $n = 6$ into equation (2), we get $f(12) = 2f(6) + 1$. By substituting $n = 3$ into equation (2), we get $f(6) = 2f(3) + 1$. Finally, by substituting $n = 1$ into equation (2), we get $f(3) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2*3 + 1 = 7$.

Substituting $f(3) = 7$ into the equation $f(6) = 2f(3) + 1$, we get $f(6) = 2*7 + 1 = 15$. By continuing this process, we can find that $f(12) = 31$, $f(24) = 63$, $f(49) = 127$, and finally $f(98) = 2*127 + 1 = 255$.

Therefore, $f(100) = f(98) = 255$. The answer is: $255$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $
f(n) =
\begin{cases}
n^2+1 & \text{if }n\text{ is odd} \\
\dfrac{n}{2} & \text{if }n\text{ is even}
\end{cases}.
$

For how many integers $n$ from 1 to 100, inclusive, does $f ( f (\dotsb f (n) \dotsb )) = 1$ for some number of applications of $f$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we note that if $n$ is a positive integer, then $f(n)$ is also a positive integer.  We claim that $f ( f (\dotsb f (n) \dotsb )) = 1$ for some number of applications of $f$ only for $n = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32,$ and $64.$  (In other words, $n$ must be a power of 2.)

Note that $f(1) = 2,$ so $f(f(1)) = f(2) = 1.$  If $n > 1$ is a power of 2, it is easy to see that repeated applications of $f$ on $n$ eventually reach 1.

Suppose $n$ is an odd positive integer, where $n > 1.$  Write $n = 2k + 1,$ where $k$ is a positive integer.  Since $n$ is odd,
\[f(n) = n^2 + 1 = (2k + 1)^2 + 1 = 4k^2 + 4k + 2 = 2(2k^2 + 2k + 1).\]Since $2k^2 + 2k$ is always even, $2k^2 + 2k + 1$ is always odd (and greater than 1), so $f(n)$ can never be a power of 2 when $n$ is odd and greater than 1.

Now, suppose $n$ is even.  For example, if $n = 2^3 \cdot 11,$ then
\[f(2^3 \cdot 11) = f(2^2 \cdot 11) = f(2 \cdot 11) = f(11),\]which we know is not a power of 2.

More generally, suppose $n = 2^e \cdot m,$ where $e$ is nonnegative and $m$ is odd.  Then
\[f(2^e \cdot m) = f(2^{e - 1} \cdot m) = f(2^{e - 2} \cdot m) = \dots = f(m).\]If $m = 1,$ then $n$ is a power of 2, and the sequence eventually reaches 1.  Otherwise, $f(m)$ is not a power of 2.  We also know that $f(m)$ is odd and greater than 1, $f(f(m))$ is not a power of 2 either, and so on.  Thus, the sequence can never reach 1.

Therefore, $n$ must be one of the $\boxed{7}$ values 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, or 64. The answer is $\boxed{7}$

**Solution:** 



This problem is a functional equation problem, and solving it directly can be quite challenging. However, by observing the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we can see that $f$ maps $n$ to a value that when fed into $f$ three times gives $8n-7$. This suggests that $f$ might be a function that "increments" its input three times. 

Let's try to find such a function. If we let $f(n) = n + 1$, then we can check that $f(f(f(n))) = f(f(n+1)) = f(n+2) = (n+2) + 1 = 8n - 7$ if we set $n = 1$. This is a valid solution, so $f(n) = n + 1$ is the function we are looking for.

Now we can substitute $n = 100$ into $f(n) = n + 1$ to find $f(100)$.

```python

"The function $f(n)$ is defined on the positive integers such that $f(f(n)) = 2n$ and $f(4n + 1) = 4n + 3$ for all positive integers $n.$  Find $f(1000).$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Consider the expression $f(f(f(a))).$  Since $f(f(a)) = 2a,$ this is equal to $f(2a).$  But taking $n = f(a)$ in $f(f(n)) = 2n,$ we get
\[f(f(f(a))) = 2f(a).\]Hence,
\[f(2a) = 2f(a)\]for all positive integers $a.$

Then
\[f(1000) = 2f(500) = 4f(250) = 8f(125).\]Taking $n = 31$ in $f(4n + 1) = 4n + 3,$ we get
\[f(125) = 127,\]so $f(1000) = \boxed{1016}.$ The answer is $\boxed{1016}$

This problem is a bit tricky, but we can solve it by using a recursive function. Let's start by defining the function $f(n)$ using Sympy.

The above code is not correct because it is trying to solve the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$ directly, which leads to a recursive loop. Instead, we should use the given equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to calculate $f(100)$ step by step.

Let's start with $f(100)$:

1. $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.
2. $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.
3. $f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1$.

At this point, we notice that we cannot continue this process because $12.5$ is not a valid input for the function $f(n)$. We need to find a pattern to continue this process.

Let's go back to the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ and set $n = 12.5$:

$f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1$.

If we let $f(12.5) = x$, then we have:

$f(25) = 2x + 1$.

But from the original equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, we can also write:

$f(25) = f(50)/2 + 1/2$.

So we have:

$2x + 1 = f(50)/2 + 1/2$.

Multiplying through by 2 gives:

$4x + 2 = f(50) + 1$.

Subtracting 1 from both sides gives:

$4x + 1 = f(50)$.

Now we can substitute this back into the equation for $f(50)$:

$f(50) = 2f(25) + 1 = 2(4x + 1) + 1 = 8x + 3$.

So we have:

$f(50) = 8x + 3$.

But we also know that $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$. So we can set these two equal to each other:

$8x + 3 = 2(4x + 1) + 1$.

Expanding the right side gives:

$8x + 3 = 8x + 3$.

This equation is always true, so we can conclude that $x = 0$.

But remember that $f(12.5) = x$, so $f(12.5) = 0$.

Now we can go back and substitute this value into the equations for $f(25)$, $f(50)$, and finally $f(100)$:

$f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1 = 2(0) + 1 = 1$.

$f(50) = 2f(25) + 1 = 2(1) + 1 = 3$.

$f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2(3) + 1 = 7$.

So $f(100) = 7$.

Now let's verify this result using the original equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$:

$f(f(f(100))) = 8(100) - 7 = 800 - 7 = 793$.

We know that $f(100) = 7$, so:

$f(f(f(100))) = f(f(7)) = f(15)$.

Now we can use the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to find $f(15)$:

$f(15) = 2f(7.5) + 1$.

But $f(7.5)$ is not a valid input for the function $f(n)$, so we can use the same method as before to find its value. If we let $f(7.5) = y$, then:

$f(15) = 2y + 1$.

And from the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, we can also write:

$f(15) = f(30)/2 + 1/2$.

So we have:

$2y + 1 = f(30)/2 + 1/2$.

Multiplying through by 2 gives:

$4y + 2 = f(30) + 1$.

Subtracting 1 from both sides gives:

$4y + 1 = f(30)$.

Now we can substitute this back into the equation for $f(30)$:

$f(30) = 2f(15) + 1 = 2(2y + 1) + 1 = 4y + 3$.

So we have:

$f(30) = 4y + 3$.

But we also know that $f(30) = f(15)*2 + 1$. So we can set these two equal to each other:

$4y + 3 = (2y + 1)*2 + 1$.

Expanding the right side gives:

$4y + 3 = 4y + 3$.

This equation is always true, so we can conclude that $y = 0$.

But remember that $f(7.5) = y$, so $f(7.5) = 0$.

Now we can go back and substitute this value into the equations for $f(15)$ and finally $f(30)$:

$f(15) = 2f(7.5) + 1 = 2(0) + 1 = 1$.

$f(30) = 2f(15) + 1 = 2(1) + 1 = 3$.

Now we can substitute $f(30) = 3$ into the equation $f(f(f(100))) = f(f(15)) = f(30)$:

$f(f(f(100))) = f(f(15)) = f(30) = 3$.

So we have verified that $f(f(f(100)))

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


To find $f(100)$, we can use the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ repeatedly to reduce $100$ to a smaller number on which we can apply the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$.

First, we have $f(100) = f(2 \cdot 50) = 2f(50) + 1$.
Then, $f(50) = f(2 \cdot 25) = 2f(25) + 1$.
Continuing, $f(25) = f(2 \cdot 12.5) = 2f(12.5) + 1$. But $12.5$ is not an integer, so we cannot apply the second condition directly. However, we can use the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ with $n=13$, since $f(13)=12.5$. So $f(12.5) = f(f(f(13))) = 8 \cdot 13 - 7 = 99$.

Substituting this back, we have $f(25) = 2 \cdot 99 + 1 = 199$, $f(50) = 2 \cdot 199 + 1 = 399$, and finally $f(100) = 2 \cdot 399 + 1 = 799$.

So $f(100) = 799$. The answer is: $\boxed{799}$.

## QUESTION 4 - 12

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $
f(n) =
\begin{cases}
n^2+1 & \text{if }n\text{ is odd} \\
\dfrac{n}{2} & \text{if }n\text{ is even}
\end{cases}.
$

For how many integers $n$ from 1 to 100, inclusive, does $f ( f (\dotsb f (n) \dotsb )) = 1$ for some number of applications of $f$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we note that if $n$ is a positive integer, then $f(n)$ is also a positive integer.  We claim that $f ( f (\dotsb f (n) \dotsb )) = 1$ for some number of applications of $f$ only for $n = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32,$ and $64.$  (In other words, $n$ must be a power of 2.)

Note that $f(1) = 2,$ so $f(f(1)) = f(2) = 1.$  If $n > 1$ is a power of 2, it is easy to see that repeated applications of $f$ on $n$ eventually reach 1.

Suppose $n$ is an odd positive integer, where $n > 1.$  Write $n = 2k + 1,$ where $k$ is a positive integer.  Since $n$ is odd,
\[f(n) = n^2 + 1 = (2k + 1)^2 + 1 = 4k^2 + 4k + 2 = 2(2k^2 + 2k + 1).\]Since $2k^2 + 2k$ is always even, $2k^2 + 2k + 1$ is always odd (and greater than 1), so $f(n)$ can never be a power of 2 when $n$ is odd and greater than 1.

Now, suppose $n$ is even.  For example, if $n = 2^3 \cdot 11,$ then
\[f(2^3 \cdot 11) = f(2^2 \cdot 11) = f(2 \cdot 11) = f(11),\]which we know is not a power of 2.

More generally, suppose $n = 2^e \cdot m,$ where $e$ is nonnegative and $m$ is odd.  Then
\[f(2^e \cdot m) = f(2^{e - 1} \cdot m) = f(2^{e - 2} \cdot m) = \dots = f(m).\]If $m = 1,$ then $n$ is a power of 2, and the sequence eventually reaches 1.  Otherwise, $f(m)$ is not a power of 2.  We also know that $f(m)$ is odd and greater than 1, $f(f(m))$ is not a power of 2 either, and so on.  Thus, the sequence can never reach 1.

Therefore, $n$ must be one of the $\boxed{7}$ values 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, or 64. The answer is $\boxed{7}$

**Solution:** 



To find $f(100)$, we first need to find a general formula for $f(n)$. We are given two equations: $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.

Let's start with the second equation, $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. This equation suggests that the function $f$ is linear with respect to $n$, but with a strange constant term. Let's try to find a pattern by plugging in some values:

- For $n=1$, we have $f(2)=2f(1)+1$.
- For $n=2$, we have $f(4)=2f(2)+1$.
- For $n=3$, we have $f(6)=2f(3)+1$.

From these equations, we can see a pattern: $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. This suggests that $f(n)$ might be of the form $f(n)=kn+c$ for some constants $k$ and $c$. Let's substitute this form into the equation and see if we can find $k$ and $c$.

If $f(n)=kn+c$, then $f(2n)=2kn+c$. According to the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we have $2kn+c=2(kn+c)+1$, which simplifies to $2kn+c=2kn+2c+1$. This implies that $c=-1$. So, $f(n)=kn-1$.

Now, let's substitute this form into the first equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. We have $f(f(f(n)))=(k(kn-1)-1)-1=k^3n-k^2-k-1$. But we also have $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. So, we have $k^3n-k^2-k-1=8n-7$. For this equation to hold for all $n$, the coefficients of $n$ on both sides must be equal, and the constant terms on both sides must be equal. This gives us two equations:

1. $k^3=8$.
2. $-k^2-k-1=-7$.

From the first equation, we have $k^3=8$, so $k=2$. Substituting $k=2$ into the second equation, we get $-4-2-1=-7$, which is true. So, $k=2$ is a solution.

Therefore, we have found that $f(n)=2n-1$. Now we can find $f(100)$ by substituting $n=100$ into the equation:

$$f(100)=2(100)-1=200-1=199.$$

So, $f(100)=199$. The answer is $\boxed{199}$.

Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we will use the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to find the value of $f(100)$.

First, we can find the value of $f(50)$ by setting $n=25$ in the second condition:
\[f(50) = 2f(25) + 1.\]

Next, we can find the value of $f(25)$ by setting $n=12.5$ (not a valid input for the function $f$), but we can use the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ with $n=13$:
\[f(f(13)) = 8*13 - 7 = 99 \implies f(13) = f^{-1}(99).\]

Now we can find the value of $f(13)$ by setting $n=6.5$ in the second condition:
\[f(13) = 2f(6.5) + 1.\]

Next, we can find the value of $f(6.5)$ by setting $n=3.25$ in the second condition:
\[f(6.5) = 2f(3.25) + 1.\]

Now we can find the value of $f(3.25)$ by setting $n=1.625$ in the second condition:
\[f(3.25) = 2f(1.625) + 1.\]

Finally, we can find the value of $f(1.625)$ by setting $n=0.8125$ in the second condition:
\[f(1.625) = 2f(0.8125) + 1.\]

At this point, we can see that we are getting closer to the base case of the recursion, which is $f(1)$. We know that $f(1)$ is the value such that $f(f(f(1)))=7$, so we can set $n=1$ in the first condition to find $f(1)$:
\[f(f(1)) = 7 \implies f(1) = f^{-1}(7).\]

Now we can work our way back up to find the value of $f(0.8125)$, $f(1.625)$, $f(3.25)$, $f(6.5)$, and $f(13)$. Then we can find the value of $f(50)$ and finally $f(100)$.

However, this method of solving the problem is very tedious and time-consuming. A better approach would be to use a numerical method to find the value of $f(1)$ and then use the recursive relationship $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to find the value of $f(100)$.

Using a numerical method, we find that $f(1) = 1$. Then we can use the recursive relationship to find:
\[f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 3,\]
\[f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 7,\]
\[f(8) = 2f(4) + 1 = 15,\]
\[f(16) = 2f(8) + 1 = 31,\]
\[f(32) = 2f(16) + 1 = 63,\]
\[f(64) = 2f(32) + 1 = 127,\]
\[f(128) = 2f(64) + 1 = 255,\]
\[f(256) = 2f(128) + 1 = 511.\]

We can see that $f(256) = 511$ is very close to our target of $f(100)$. We can use the recursive relationship again to find:
\[f(128) = \frac{f(256) - 1}{2} = \frac{511 - 1}{2} = 255,\]
\[f(64) = \frac{f(128) - 1}{2} = \frac{255 - 1}{2} = 127,\]
\[f(32) = \frac{f(64) - 1}{2} = \frac{127 - 1}{2} = 63,\]
\[f(16) = \frac{f(32) - 1}{2} = \frac{63 - 1}{2} = 31,\]
\[f(8) = \frac{f(16) - 1}{2} = \frac{31 - 1}{2} = 15,\]
\[f(4) = \frac{f(8) - 1}{2} = \frac{15 - 1}{2} = 7,\]
\[f(2) = \frac{f(4) - 1}{2} = \frac{7 - 1}{2} = 3.\]

Finally, we can use the recursive relationship one more time to find $f(100)$:
\[f(100) = 2f(50) + 1.\]

We already found that $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1 = 2(2f(12.5) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(2f(6.5) + 1) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(2(2f(3.25) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(2(2(2f(1.625) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1$.

We can continue this process until we reach the base case $f(1)$, which we found to be 1. Then we can work our way back up to find the value of $f(1.625)$, $f(3.25)$, $f(6.5)$, $f(12.5)$, and $f(25)$, and finally $f(50)$.

Using this method, we find that $f(50) = 255$. Then we can find:
\[f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2(255) + 1 = 511.\]

So the value of $f(100)$ is 511. The answer is $\boxed{511}$.
