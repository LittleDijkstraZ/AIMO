**Problem:** 
"What is the minimum value of the expression $x^2+y^2+2x-4y+8$ for real $x$ and $y$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Rearranging the expression, we have  \[x^2+2x+y^2-4y+8\]Completing the square in $x$, we need to add and subtract $(2/2)^2=1$. Completing the square in $y$, we need to add and subtract $(4/2)^2=4$. Thus, we have \[(x^2+2x+1)-1+(y^2-4y+4)-4+8 \Rightarrow (x+1)^2+(y-2)^2+3\]Since the minimum value of $(x+1)^2$ and $(y-2)^2$ is $0$ (perfect squares can never be negative), the minimum value of the entire expression is $\boxed{3}$, and is achieved when $x=-1$ and $y=2$. The answer is $\boxed{3}$

**Problem**
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solve, simplify

def minimum_value():
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # Define the function and the constraint
    f = 5*x**2 + 5*y**2 - 8*x*y
    constraint = abs(x - 2*y) + abs(y - 2*x) - 40

    # Solve the constraint for y
    y_solution = solve(constraint, y)[0]

    # Substitute y in the function
    f = f.subs(y, y_solution)

    # Find the derivative of the function
    f_prime = f.diff(x)

    # Solve the derivative equal to zero to find the critical points
    critical_points = solve(f_prime, x)

    # Substitute the critical points in the function to find the minimum value
    min_value = min([f.subs(x, point) for point in critical_points])

    # Simplify the minimum value
    min_value = simplify(min_value)

    return min_value

result = minimum_value()
print(result)
```

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"What is the minimum value of the expression $x^2+y^2-6x+4y+18$ for real $x$ and $y$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Rearranging the expression, we have  \[x^2-6x+y^2+4y+18\]Completing the square in $x$, we need to add and subtract $(6/2)^2=9$. Completing the square in $y$, we need to add and subtract $(4/2)^2=4$. Thus, we have \[(x^2-6x+9)-9+(y^2+4y+4)-4+18 \Rightarrow (x-3)^2+(y+2)^2+5\]Since the minimum value of $(x-3)^2$ and $(y+2)^2$ is $0$ (perfect squares can never be negative), the minimum value of the entire expression is $\boxed{5}$, and is achieved when $x=3$ and $y=-2$. The answer is $\boxed{5}$

from sympy import symbols, solve, diff

def minimum_value():
    # Define the symbols

    expr = 5*x**2 + 5*y**2 - 8*x*y
    constraint = abs(x - 2*y) + abs(y - 2*x) - 40

    # Since the constraint is symmetric in x and y, we can assume without loss of generality that x >= y.
    # Then the constraint simplifies to:
    # x - 2y + 2x - y - 40 = 0
    # which simplifies to:
    # 3x - 3y = 40
    # or
    # x - y = 40/3

    # Solve the constraint for y
    y_expr = solve(x - y - 40/3, y)[0]

    # Substitute y in the expression
    expr_subs = expr.subs(y, y_expr)

    # Differentiate the expression with respect to x
