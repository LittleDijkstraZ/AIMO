Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The given equation is a product of two terms equals to zero. Therefore, either the first term equals to zero or the second term equals to zero. We can split the problem into two cases:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
This equation holds only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. Solving these equations, we get $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$. So, we have a square with side length 20.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
This equation holds only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. So, we have a square with side length 16.

Now, we can find the intersection of these two squares. The intersection is a square with side length 8.

The area of the convex polygon is the area of the square with side length 20 minus the area of the square with side length 8.

The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of the larger square is $20^2 = 400$ and the area of the smaller square is $8^2 = 64$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $400 - 64 = 336$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 336.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    # Side lengths of the squares
    side_large = 20
    side_small = 8

    # Areas of the squares
    area_large = side_large**2
    area_small = side_small**2

    # Area of the convex polygon
    area_polygon = area_large - area_small

    return area_polygon

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 336

INTERMEDIATE OUT :

The area of the convex polygon is 336. The answer is: $336$

 The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. 

Let's analyze each expression separately:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$: This expression is equal to zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0)$.

2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$: This expression is equal to zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(8, 0), (-8, 0), (0, 8), (0, -8)$.

Combining the vertices from both expressions, we find that the polygon is a square with side length 10. The area of a square is given by the square of the side length, so the area of the polygon is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_ 2= (-16,2).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that
\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as
\[\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1.\]Find $h + k + a + b.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero, which means either one of the expressions is zero.

The first expression is: $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. This expression will be zero if and only if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) = 0$. This gives us $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

The second expression is: $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. This expression will be zero if and only if both $(\vert x \vert - 8) = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8) = 0$. This gives us $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The solutions of these equations are:
1. For $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, the solutions are the points on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.
2. For $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, the solutions are the points on the lines $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.
3. For $\vert x \vert = 8$, the solutions are the points on the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.
4. For $\vert y \vert = 8$, the solutions are the points on the lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

The points that satisfy all these equations are the vertices of a square with side length 10 (the distance between the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$, or the distance between the lines $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$). The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points that satisfy the given equation is 100.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    side_length = 10
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 100

INTERMEDIATE OUT :

The area of the convex polygon is $100$. The answer is $\boxed{100}$.

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

The first term is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$ and the second term is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. 

If the first term is zero, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. 

If the second term is zero, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersection points of these lines are the vertices of the polygon. By drawing these lines, we can see that the polygon is a square with side length 16. 

The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side, so the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

**Solution:** 



First, let's understand the problem. The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. We need to find the set of points $(x, y)$ that satisfy this condition.

The first expression is zero when either $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x - y| - 10 = 0$. These equations simplify to $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$. The solutions to these equations are the points that lie on the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle.

The second expression is zero when either $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$. These equations simplify to $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. The solutions to these equations are the points that lie on the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square.

The intersection of the rectangle and the square is the set of points that satisfy both conditions, which is the convex polygon we are looking for. The area of the convex polygon is the area of the rectangle formed by the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. The length of the rectangle is $20$ (from $-10$ to $10$ along the x-axis) and the width is $20$ (from $-10$ to $10$ along the y-axis). Therefore, the area of the rectangle is $20 \times 20 = 400$.

So the area of the convex polygon is $400$. The answer is: $400$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Find the number of 10-tuples $(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{10})$ of real numbers such that
\[(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2 = \frac{1}{11}.\]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,
\begin{align*}
&[(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + \dots + 1^2 + 1^2)][(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2] \\
&\ge [(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + (x_2 - x_3) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10}]^2 = 1.
\end{align*}From the given condition, we have equality, so by the equality condition for Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[\frac{1 - x_1}{1} = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{1} = \frac{x_2 - x_3}{1} = \dots = \frac{x_9 - x_{10}}{1} = \frac{x_{10}}{1}.\]Let
\[d = 1 - x_1 = x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_3 = \dots = x_9 - x_{10} = x_{10}.\]Then
\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so
\[(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_{10}) = \left( \frac{10}{11}, \frac{9}{11}, \frac{8}{11}, \dots, \frac{1}{11} \right).\]In particular, there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Solution:** 


The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. 

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. This expression is zero if and only if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This happens if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two squares with side length 10 centered at the origin.

The second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. This expression is zero if and only if both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This happens if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This is the equation of a square with side length 16 centered at the origin.

The intersection of these two squares is a square with side length 6 (since the distance from the origin to the farthest corner of the smaller square is 10, and the distance to the farthest corner of the larger square is 16, so the difference is 6 on each side).

The area of this square is $6^2 = 36$. So the area of the convex polygon is 36.
The answer is $\boxed{36}$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many square units are in the area of the triangle whose vertices are the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the curve $y = (x-3)^2 (x+2)$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we need to find where this curve intersects the $x$ and $y$ axes.  If $y=0$, then $(x-3)^2(x+2)=0$, which has solutions of $x=3$ and $x=-2$.  If $x=0$, then $y=(-3)^2(2)=18$.  So, the curve has two $x$-intercepts and one $y$-intercept.  The length of the base along the $x$-axis is $3-(-2)=5$.  The height from this base is equal to the $y$-intercept, 18.  The area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 5\cdot 18=\boxed{45}$. The answer is $\boxed{45}$
