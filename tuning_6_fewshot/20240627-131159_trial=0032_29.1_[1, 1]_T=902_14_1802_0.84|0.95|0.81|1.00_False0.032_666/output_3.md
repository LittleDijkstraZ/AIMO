**Problem:** 
"Let $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_ 2= (-16,2).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that
\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as
\[\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1.\]Find $h + k + a + b.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. 

The first expression is zero when either $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x - y| - 10 = 0$, which means $|x + y| = 10$ or $|x - y| = 10$. These are the equations of two lines passing through the origin at angles of $45^\circ$ and $135^\circ$ respectively.

The second expression is zero when either $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$, which means $|x| = 8$ or $|y| = 8$. These are the equations of two lines parallel to the x-axis at $y = 8$ and the y-axis at $x = 8$.

The intersection of these lines form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So the area of the convex polygon is 256.

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, which means that either one of the expressions is zero. Therefore, the points that satisfy the equation are the solutions to each of the two equations:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first equation, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the square: $(5, 5), (5, -5), (-5, 5), (-5, -5)$.

For the second equation, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the square: $(8, 0), (0, 8), (-8, 0), (0, -8)$.

The points that satisfy the given equation are the union of the vertices of these two squares. The convex polygon formed by these points is a larger square with side length 10. Therefore, the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many square units are in the area of the triangle whose vertices are the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the curve $y = (x-3)^2 (x+2)$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we need to find where this curve intersects the $x$ and $y$ axes.  If $y=0$, then $(x-3)^2(x+2)=0$, which has solutions of $x=3$ and $x=-2$.  If $x=0$, then $y=(-3)^2(2)=18$.  So, the curve has two $x$-intercepts and one $y$-intercept.  The length of the base along the $x$-axis is $3-(-2)=5$.  The height from this base is equal to the $y$-intercept, 18.  The area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 5\cdot 18=\boxed{45}$. The answer is $\boxed{45}$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


The problem asks for the area of a polygon defined by the points that satisfy the given equation. The equation is a product of two terms, each of which is a squared absolute value minus a constant. The only way for this product to be zero is if either of the terms is zero. Therefore, we need to find the points that satisfy each term separately.

1. Solve the equation $|x + y| - 10 = 0$. This gives $|x + y| = 10$, or $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$. These are two lines in the plane.
2. Solve the equation $|x - y| - 10 = 0$. This gives $|x - y| = 10$, or $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$. These are also two lines in the plane.
3. Solve the equation $|x| - 8 = 0$. This gives $|x| = 8$, or $x = 8$ or $x = -8$. These are two vertical lines in the plane.
4. Solve the equation $|y| - 8 = 0$. This gives $|y| = 8$, or $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. These are two horizontal lines in the plane.

The intersection of these lines forms a rectangle with vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$. The area of this rectangle is $16 \times 16 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

The error still persists. Let's try another approach.

The given equation can be rewritten as:
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0\]

The first factor is zero when either $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. This gives us the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$. Similarly, the second factor is zero when either $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which gives us the lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

The intersections of these lines form a square with side length 20. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.
