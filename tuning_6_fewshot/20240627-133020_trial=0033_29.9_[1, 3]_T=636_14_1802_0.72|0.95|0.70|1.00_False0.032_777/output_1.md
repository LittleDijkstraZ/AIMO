**Problem:** 
"What is the minimum value of the expression $2x^2+3y^2+8x-24y+62$ for real $x$ and $y$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Rearranging the expression, we have  \[2x^2+8x+3y^2-24y+62\]We first complete the square in $x$. Factoring a 2 from the first two terms of the expression, we get  \[2(x^2+4x)+3y^2-24y+62\]In order for the expression inside the parenthesis to be a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(4/2)^2=4$ inside the parenthesis. Doing this, we have \[2(x^2+4x+4-4)+3y^2-24y+62 \Rightarrow 2(x+2)^2+3y^2-24y+54\]Now we complete the square in $y$. Factoring a 3 from the $y$ terms in the expression, we get \[2(x+2)^2+3(y^2-8y)+54\]In order for the expression inside the second parenthesis to be a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(8/2)^2=16$ inside the parenthesis. Doing this, we have \[2(x+2)^2+3(y^2-8y+16-16)+54 \Rightarrow 2(x+2)^2+3(y-4)^2+6\]Since the minimum value of $2(x+2)^2$ and $3(y-4)^2$ is $0$ (perfect squares can never be negative), the minimum value of the entire expression is $\boxed{6}$, and is achieved when $x=-2$ and $y=4$. The answer is $\boxed{6}$

**Problem**
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


This problem is a bit complex and requires a bit of algebraic manipulation to solve. However, with the help of Python's sympy library, we can solve it easily.

First, we can rewrite the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$. Using the property of absolute value, we can rewrite this as $(2y-x) + (2x-y) = 40$ or $(2y-x) - (2x-y) = 40$. The first case simplifies to $y + x = 40$ and the second case simplifies to $y - 3x = 40$.

Now, we can solve these equations to find the relationship between $x$ and $y$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

def solve_equations():
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # Setup equations
    eq1 = Eq(y + x, 40)
    eq2 = Eq(y - 3*x, 40)

    # Solve the equations
    solution1 = solve(eq1, y)
    solution2 = solve(eq2, y)

    return solution1, solution2

solution1, solution2 = solve_equations()
print(solution1, solution2)
```

CODE RESULTS [40 - x] [3*x + 40]

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
[40 - x] [3*x + 40]
```

Now we substitute the solutions into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ and find its minimum value.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, simplify

def find_minimum():
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # Substitute the solutions into the expression
    expr1 = 5*x**2 + 5*(40 - x)**2 - 8*x*(40 - x)
    expr2 = 5*x**2 + 5*(3*x + 40)**2 - 8*x*(3*x + 40)

    # Simplify the expressions
    simplified_expr1 = simplify(expr1)
    simplified_expr2 = simplify(expr2)

    # Find the minimum value
    min_value = min(simplified_expr1.subs(x, 20), simplified_expr2.subs(x, -40/3))

    return min_value

min_value = find_minimum()
print(min_value)
```

CODE RESULTS 800

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
800
```

The minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 800. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{800}$.

**Problem**
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


This problem seems a bit more complex than the previous ones, so we'll need to use a bit of mathematical analysis to solve it. 

First, we can rewrite the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ as $|2(y-x)| + |(y-2x)| = 40$. This can be further simplified using the property $|a| + |b| = |a+b| + |a-b|$, so we have $|3(y-x)| = 40$. This implies that $3|y-x| = 40$, or $|y-x| = \frac{40}{3}$.

Now, let's consider the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite this as $(5x^2-8xy+5y^2) = 5(x^2 - \frac{8}{5}xy + y^2) = 5[(x - \frac{4}{5}y)^2 + \frac{9}{5}y^2]$.

Since $|y-x| = \frac{40}{3}$, we know that $(x - \frac{4}{5}y)^2 \geq 0$, so the minimum value of $(x - \frac{4}{5}y)^2$ is 0. Therefore, the minimum value of $5(x - \frac{4}{5}y)^2 + \frac{9}{5}y^2$ is $\frac{9}{5}y^2$.

Now, we want to minimize $\frac{9}{5}y^2$ given $|y-x| = \frac{40}{3}$. Since $|y-x| = \frac{40}{3}$ implies that $y$ and $x$ are within a distance of $\frac{40}{3}$ of each other, the minimum value of $y^2$ (and thus of $\frac{9}{5}y^2$) is achieved when $y$ is at one of the endpoints of the interval where $y$ and $x$ can vary.

If $y$ is at the left endpoint of the interval, then $y = x - \frac{40}{3}$, and we have $\frac{9}{5}y^2 = \frac{9}{5}(x - \frac{40}{3})^2$. If $y$ is at the right endpoint of the interval, then $y = x + \frac{40}{3}$, and we have $\frac{9}{5}y^2 = \frac{9}{5}(x + \frac{40}{3})^2$.

By comparing these two expressions, we find that the minimum value of $\frac{9}{5}y^2$ is achieved when $y = x - \frac{40}{3}$. Substituting this into the equation $|y-x| = \frac{40}{3}$, we get $|x - \frac{40}{3} - x| = \frac{40}{3}$, which simplifies to $|- \frac{40}{3}| = \frac{40}{3}$, which is true.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is achieved when $y = x - \frac{40}{3}$, and substituting this into the expression for $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ gives $5x^2 + 5(x - \frac{40}{3})^2 - 8x(x - \frac{40}{3})$.

Now, we can simplify this expression to find its minimum value. After simplifying, we get $5x^2 + 5(x^2 - \frac{80}{3}x + \frac{1600}{9}) - 8x^2 + \frac{320}{3}x = -3x^2 + \frac{200}{3}x + \frac{1600}{9}$.

To find the minimum value of this expression, we can take the derivative with respect to $x$ and set it equal to 0. The derivative is $-6x + \frac{200}{3}$, and setting this equal to 0 gives $x = \frac{100}{9}$.

Substituting this value of $x$ back into the expression for the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get $-3(\frac{100}{9})^2 + \frac{200}{3}(\frac{100}{9}) + \frac{1600}{9} = -\frac{10000}{27} + \frac{20000}{27} + \frac{1600}{9} = \frac{1600}{9}$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\frac{1600}{9}$.

The answer is: $\boxed{\frac{1600}{9}}$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"What is the minimum value of the expression $x^2+y^2+2x-4y+8$ for real $x$ and $y$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Rearranging the expression, we have  \[x^2+2x+y^2-4y+8\]Completing the square in $x$, we need to add and subtract $(2/2)^2=1$. Completing the square in $y$, we need to add and subtract $(4/2)^2=4$. Thus, we have \[(x^2+2x+1)-1+(y^2-4y+4)-4+8 \Rightarrow (x+1)^2+(y-2)^2+3\]Since the minimum value of $(x+1)^2$ and $(y-2)^2$ is $0$ (perfect squares can never be negative), the minimum value of the entire expression is $\boxed{3}$, and is achieved when $x=-1$ and $y=2$. The answer is $\boxed{3}$
