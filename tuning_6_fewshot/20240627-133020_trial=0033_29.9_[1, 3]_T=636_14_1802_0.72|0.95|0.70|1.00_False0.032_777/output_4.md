**Problem:** 
"The function $f(n)$ is defined on the positive integers such that $f(f(n)) = 2n$ and $f(4n + 1) = 4n + 3$ for all positive integers $n.$  Find $f(1000).$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Consider the expression $f(f(f(a))).$  Since $f(f(a)) = 2a,$ this is equal to $f(2a).$  But taking $n = f(a)$ in $f(f(n)) = 2n,$ we get
\[f(f(f(a))) = 2f(a).\]Hence,
\[f(2a) = 2f(a)\]for all positive integers $a.$

Then
\[f(1000) = 2f(500) = 4f(250) = 8f(125).\]Taking $n = 31$ in $f(4n + 1) = 4n + 3,$ we get
\[f(125) = 127,\]so $f(1000) = \boxed{1016}.$ The answer is $\boxed{1016}$

**Problem**
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


To find the value of $f(100)$, we need to use the given functional equations. Let's start with the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. If we set $n=f(n')$, where $n'$ is some integer, we get $f(f(f(n')))=8f(n')-7$. Comparing this with the given equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we can conclude that $f(n)=n$ for all $n$. This is because if $f(n)\neq n$, then we can always find some $n'$ such that $f(n')\neq n'$, which contradicts the equation $f(f(f(n')))=8f(n')-7$.

Now we can substitute $f(n)=n$ into the second given equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We get $f(2n)=2n+1$. To find $f(100)$, we just substitute $n=50$ into this equation:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def f(n):
    return 2 * n + 1

result = f(50)
print(result)
```

So, $f(100) = 101$. The answer is: $101$

**Problem**
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


We can start by applying the second condition to the first condition in the problem statement.
Substituting $f(n)$ into the second condition, we get $f(f(f(n)))=f(2f(n)+1)$.
Equating this with the given $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we have $f(2f(n)+1)=8n-7$.
Now, we can substitute $n = \frac{f(n)+1}{2}$ into the equation to get $f(2\cdot \frac{f(n)+1}{2}+1)=8\cdot \frac{f(n)+1}{2}-7$.
Simplifying the equation, we have $f(f(n)+1)=4f(n)+3$.
Now, let's substitute $f(n)$ with $x$, so we have $f(x+1)=4x+3$.
We can use this equation to find $f(100)$ by starting with $x=99$ and iterating backwards until we reach $x=1$.
Here's a Python function to calculate $f(100)$:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def calculate_f_100():
    x = 99
    f_x = 4*x + 3
    for _ in range(98):
        f_x = 4*x + 3
        x -= 1
    return f_x

result = calculate_f_100()
print(result)
```

The value of $f(100)$ is 11. The answer is: 11

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"The function $f$ is defined on the set of integers and satisfies \[f(n)= \begin{cases}  n-3 & \mbox{if }n\ge 1000 \\  f(f(n+5)) & \mbox{if }n<1000. \end{cases}\]Find $f(84)$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Denote by (1) and (2) the two parts of the definition of $f$, respectively. If we begin to use the definition of $f$ to compute $f(84)$, we use (2) until the argument is at least $1000$: \[f(84) = f(f(89)) = f(f(f(94))) = \dots = f^N(1004)\](where $f^N$ denotes composing $f$ with itself $N$ times, for some $N$). The numbers $84, 89, 94, \dots, 1004$ form an arithmetic sequence with common difference $5$; since $1004 - 84 = 920 = 184 \cdot 5$, this sequence has $184 + 1 = 185$ terms, so $N = 185$.

At this point, (1) and (2) are both used: we compute \[\begin{aligned} f^N(1004) &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-1}(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-1}(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(1000) \\ &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(997) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1002) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(999) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1004). \end{aligned}\]Repeating this process, we see that \[f^N(1004) = f^{N-2}(1004) = f^{N-4}(1004) = \dots = f^3(1004).\](The pattern breaks down for $f^k(1004)$ when $k$ is small, so it is not true that $f^3(1004) = f(1004)$.) Now, we have \[f^3(1004) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^2(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^2(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(1000) \stackrel{(1)}{=} \boxed{997}.\] The answer is $\boxed{997}$

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



This problem involves finding a function $f$ that satisfies two conditions. We can start by trying to find the value of $f(1)$. From the second condition, we have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. Substituting this into the first condition, we get $f(f(f(1))) = f(f(2)) = f(2f(1) + 1) = 8 \cdot 1 - 7 = 1$. Therefore, $f(f(2)) = 1$. But from the second condition again, we have $f(f(2)) = 2f(f(1)) + 1$. Combining these two equations, we get $2f(f(1)) + 1 = 1$, so $f(f(1)) = 0$. But from the first condition, we have $f(f(f(1))) = f(0) = 1$, so $f(0) = 1$.

Now, we can use the second condition to find $f(1)$. We have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. But from the first condition, we have $f(f(1)) = 0$, so $f(1) = 1$.

Now that we have $f(1) = 1$, we can use the second condition to find $f(2)$. We have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2 \cdot 1 + 1 = 3$.

We can continue this process to find $f(3)$, $f(4)$, and so on. However, this method can be quite tedious. Instead, we can use a recursive function to compute $f(n)$ for any positive integer $n$. Here is a Python function that computes $f(n)$:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def f(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    elif n % 2 == 0:
        return 2 * f(n // 2) + 1
    else:
        return f((n - 1) // 2)

result = f(100)
print(result)
```

**Problem**
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


To find $f(100)$, we can use the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to find the value of $f(50)$ first, and then use the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to find the value of $f(f(50))$ and finally $f(100)$.

Let's start with $f(50)$. Using the second condition with $n=25$, we have
\[f(50) = 2f(25) + 1.\]
We still need to find $f(25)$. We can use the second condition again with $n=12.5$, but $n$ must be a positive integer, so this method doesn't work. However, we can use the first condition with $n=12.5$ to get
\[f(f(f(12.5))) = 8(12.5) - 7 = 100.\]
But $f(f(f(12.5)))$ is equal to $f(f(25))$ because $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. So we have
\[f(f(25)) = 100.\]
Now we can substitute this into the equation for $f(50)$ to get
\[f(50) = 2f(25) + 1 = 2(f(f(25))/2 - 0.5) + 1 = 2(50 - 0.5) + 1 = 100.\]
Now we can use the first condition to find $f(100)$:
\[f(f(f(100))) = 8(100) - 7 = 793.\]
But $f(f(f(100)))$ is equal to $f(100)$ because $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. So we have
\[f(100) = 793.\]
The value of $f(100)$ is $793$.

However, this result contradicts the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Let's check:
\[f(200) = 2f(100) + 1 = 2(793) + 1 = 1587.\]
But $f(200)$ should be equal to $8(100) - 7 = 793$ according to the first condition. This contradiction means we made a mistake in our calculation.

Let's go back and check our work. We found that $f(50) = 100$ using the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. But we used the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to find $f(f(50))$ and $f(100)$, which might have introduced an error. Let's try using the second condition directly to find $f(100)$:
\[f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2(100) + 1 = 201.\]
Now let's check if this value of $f(100)$ satisfies the first condition:
\[f(f(f(100))) = f(f(201)) = f(402) = 2f(201) + 1 = 2(201) + 1 = 403.\]
And $8(100) - 7 = 793 \neq 403$, so this value of $f(100)$ also doesn't satisfy the first condition.

It seems we made a mistake in our calculation of $f(50)$. Let's go back and reevaluate $f(25)$:
\[f(50) = 2f(25) + 1.\]
We can use the second condition with $n=12.5$ to get
\[f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 0.5.\]
But we still need to find $f(12.5)$. We can use the first condition with $n=6.25$ to get
\[f(12.5) = 8(6.25) - 7 = 50.\]
Now we can substitute this into the equation for $f(25)$ to get
\[f(25) = 2(50) + 0.5 = 100.5.\]
Now we can substitute this into the equation for $f(50)$ to get
\[f(50) = 2(100.5) + 1 = 202.\]
Now let's check if this value of $f(50)$ satisfies the second condition:
\[f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2(202) + 1 = 405.\]
And $f(f(f(100))) = f(f(405)) = f(810) = 8(100) - 7 = 793$, so this value of $f(100)$ does satisfy the first condition.

Finally, let's check if this value of $f(100)$ satisfies the second condition:
\[f(200) = 2f(100) + 1 = 2(405) + 1 = 811.\]
And $8(100) - 7 = 793 \neq 811$, so this value of $f(100)$ doesn't satisfy the second condition.

It seems we made a mistake in our calculation of $f(200)$. Let's go back and reevaluate $f(100)$:
\[f(200) = 8(100) - 7 = 793.\]
Now let's check if this value of $f(100)$ satisfies the second condition:
\[f(200) = 2f(100) + 1 = 2(793) + 1 = 1587.\]
And $1587 \neq 793$, so this value of $f(100)$ doesn't satisfy the second condition either.

It seems we made a mistake in our calculation of $f(200)$. Let's go back and reevaluate $f(100)$:
\[f(100) = \frac{f(200) + 7}{2} = \frac{793 + 7}{2} = 400.\]
Now let's check if this value of $f(100)$ satisfies the first condition:
\[f(f(f(100))) = f(f(400)) = f(800) = 8(100) - 7 = 793.\]
And this value of $f(100)$ satisfies the first condition.

Now let's check if this value of $f(100)$ satisfies the second condition:
\[f(200) = 2f(100) + 1 = 2(400) + 1 = 801.\]
And $8(100) - 7 = 793 \neq 801$, so this value of $f(100)$ doesn't satisfy the second condition.

It seems we made a mistake in our calculation of $f(200)$. Let's go back and reevaluate $f(100)$:
\[f(100) = \frac{f(200) - 1}{2}

"The function $f(n)$ is defined on the positive integers such that $f(f(n)) = 2n$ and $f(4n + 1) = 4n + 3$ for all positive integers $n.$  Find $f(1000).$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Consider the expression $f(f(f(a))).$  Since $f(f(a)) = 2a,$ this is equal to $f(2a).$  But taking $n = f(a)$ in $f(f(n)) = 2n,$ we get

Then
\[f(1000) = 2f(500) = 4f(250) = 8f(125).\]Taking $n = 31$ in $f(4n + 1) = 4n + 3,$ we get
\[f(125) = 127,\]so $f(1000) = \boxed{1016}.$ The answer is $\boxed{1016}$

**Problem**
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


To solve this problem, we can use the second condition to simplify the first condition. 

If we substitute $f(n)$ into the second condition, we get $f(f(n)) = 2f(n) + 1$. 

Now substitute $f(f(n))$ into the first condition, we get $f(2f(n) + 1) = 8n - 7$.

Now, let's try to find $f(100)$ using the second condition. We know that $f(2 \cdot 50) = 2f(50) + 1$, so $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.

But we don't know $f(50)$ yet. We can use the second condition again to find $f(50)$: $f(2 \cdot 25) = 2f(25) + 1$, so $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.

Similarly, we can find $f(25)$: $f(2 \cdot 12.5) = 2f(12.5) + 1$, so $f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1$.

However, we can't continue this process indefinitely because we are dealing with non-integer values. We need to find a pattern or a way to stop this recursive process.

Notice that the function $f$ maps positive integers to positive integers. Also, the second condition $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ implies that $f(n)$ is an odd number when $n$ is even. 

We can guess that $f(n) = 2n - 1$ for all positive integers $n$. 

Let's check if this guess satisfies the given conditions:

1. For the first condition, $f(f(f(n))) = f(f(2n - 1)) = f(2(2n - 1) - 1) = f(4n - 3) = 8n - 7$.
2. For the second condition, $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1 = 2(2n - 1) + 1 = 4n - 1$.

So, $f(n) = 2n - 1$ satisfies both conditions. Therefore, $f(100) = 2 \cdot 100 - 1 = 199$.

```python

def calculate_f_100():

**Solution:**


We first need to solve the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to find the form of the function $f$.

**Problem:** 
"The function $f(n)$ is defined on the positive integers such that $f(f(n)) = 2n$ and $f(4n + 1) = 4n + 3$ for all positive integers $n.$  Find $f(1000).$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Consider the expression $f(f(f(a))).$  Since $f(f(a)) = 2a,$ this is equal to $f(2a).$  But taking $n = f(a)$ in $f(f(n)) = 2n,$ we get
\[f(f(f(a))) = 2f(a).\]Hence,
\[f(2a) = 2f(a)\]for all positive integers $a.$

Then
\[f(1000) = 2f(500) = 4f(250) = 8f(125).\]Taking $n = 31$ in $f(4n + 1) = 4n + 3,$ we get
\[f(125) = 127,\]so $f(1000) = \boxed{1016}.$ The answer is $\boxed{1016}$

**Problem**
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we first need to find a value for $f(1)$. We can start by setting $n = 1$ in the second condition $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. But we also know from the first condition $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$ that $f(f(f(1))) = f(f(2)) = 8(1) - 7 = 1$. So $f(f(2)) = 1$. Substituting $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$ into this equation gives $f(2f(1) + 1) = 1$. 

Now we need to solve this equation to find the value of $f(1)$. The only way for $f(2f(1) + 1)$ to be 1 is if $2f(1) + 1 = 1$, so $2f(1) = 0$, and therefore $f(1) = 0$.

Now that we have $f(1) = 0$, we can find $f(100)$ by repeatedly applying the second condition. We have:

$f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$,
$f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$,
$f(25) = 2f(12.5)$,

But we know that $f$ only takes integer inputs, so we must have made a mistake somewhere. Let's go back and check our work. When we set $n = 1$ in the second condition, we assumed that $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. However, this is not necessarily true if $f(1)$ is not 1. Let's try another approach.

We know that $f(f(f(1))) = 1$, so $f(f(1)) = f(2)$. Substituting $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$ into this equation gives $f(2f(1) + 1) = f(2)$. Now we can substitute $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$ into the left side of the equation to get $f(2f(1) + 1) = 2f(1) + 1$. This means that if $n = f(1)$, then $f(2n + 1) = 2n + 1$.

Now we can use this result to find $f(100)$. Since $100 = 2*50$, we have $f(100) = f(2*50) = 2*50 + 1 = 101$. So $f(100) = 101$.

The value of $f(100)$ is 101. The answer is: $101$

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


We first plug $n=1$ into the second equation to get $f(2)=2f(1)+1$.
Then we plug $f(1)$ into the first equation from the first condition to get $f(f(f(1)))=8f(1)-7$.
Since $f(f(f(1)))=f(2)$, we have $f(2)=8f(1)-7$.
But we know from the second equation that $f(2)=2f(1)+1$, so we have $2f(1)+1=8f(1)-7$.
Simplifying this equation gives $6f(1)=8$, so $f(1)=\frac{4}{3}$.
However, since $f(1)$ is a natural number, we have made an error in our calculations.
Let's try a different approach.

We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$.
If we let $n=1$, we get $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1$.
This means that $f(f(1))=1$ since $f$ is a function that maps natural numbers to natural numbers.
Then we can plug $f(1)$ into the second equation to get $f(2)=2f(1)+1$.
Since $f(f(1))=1$, we have $f(1)=1$.

Now we can plug $f(1)=1$ into the second equation to get $f(2)=2(1)+1=3$.
Then we can plug $f(2)=3$ into the first equation to get $f(f(f(2)))=8(2)-7=9$.
Since $f(f(f(2)))=f(3)$, we have $f(3)=9$.

Continuing this process, we can find that $f(4)=5$, $f(5)=7$, $f(6)=9$, and so on.
We can see that $f(n)=2n-1$ for all positive integers $n$.

Now we can calculate $f(100)=2(100)-1=199$.

So the value of $f(100)$ is $199$. The answer is: $199$

First, we know that $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, so if we set $n = f(n)$, we have $f(f(n)) = 8f(n) - 7$.
Then, if we set $n = f(n)$ again, we have $f(n) = 8f(f(n)) - 7$.
We are also given that $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$.

To solve this, we can use a recursive function in Python to calculate $f(n)$ for any positive integer $n$.

Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Denote by (1) and (2) the two parts of the definition of $f$, respectively. If we begin to use the definition of $f$ to compute $f(84)$, we use (2) until the argument is at least $1000$: \[f(84) = f(f(89)) = f(f(f(94))) = \dots = f^N(1004)\](where $f^N$ denotes composing $f$ with itself $N$ times, for some $N$). The numbers $84, 89, 94, \dots, 1004$ form an arithmetic sequence with common difference $5$; since $1004 - 84 = 920 = 184 \cdot 5$, this sequence has $184 + 1 = 185$ terms, so $N = 185$.

At this point, (1) and (2) are both used: we compute \[\begin{aligned} f^N(1004) &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-1}(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-1}(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(1000) \\ &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(997) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1002) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(999) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1004). \end{aligned}\]Repeating this process, we see that \[f^N(1004) = f^{N-2}(1004) = f^{N-4}(1004) = \dots = f^3(1004).\](The pattern breaks down for $f^k(1004)$ when $k$ is small, so it is not true that $f^3(1004) = f(1004)$.)

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


We can solve this problem by first calculating $f(1)$ using the second equation in the problem statement and then use the first equation to calculate $f(100)$.

First, let's find $f(1)$:
Since $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, we have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. But we also know that $f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = 1$, so $f(f(1)) = 1$. Therefore, $f(2) = 2*1 + 1 = 3$, and $f(1) = (3-1)/2 = 1$.

Now, we can use the first equation to calculate $f(100)$:
We have $f(f(f(100))) = 8*100 - 7 = 793$. We know that $f(f(100)) = x$ implies $f(x) = 100$. So we need to find $x$ such that $f(x) = 100$.

We can start by calculating $f(100)$:
Since $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, we have $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1 = 2*100 + 1 = 201$. But we also know that $f(f(f(100))) = 793$, so $f(201) = 793$. Therefore, $f(100) = (793-1)/2 = 396$.

Finally, we have found that $f(100) = 396$.

**Solution:**


To solve this problem, we can use the second condition and iterate it to find the value of $f(100)$.

Starting with $f(100)$, we can apply the second condition to get $f(200)$. Then we can apply the second condition to $f(200)$ to get $f(400)$, and so on. 

After several iterations, we find that $f(100) = 199$.

Now let's write a python program to verify this:

We can see that the result is not correct. Let's analyze the problem again.

We have the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, and we can rewrite it as $f(f(f(n))) - 8n + 7 = 0$.

If we substitute $f(n) = 2n + 1$ into the equation, we get $f(f(2n + 1)) - 8n + 7 = 0$.

Let's calculate $f(f(2n + 1))$. By the second condition, we have $f(2(2n + 1) + 1) = f(4n + 3) = 2f(2n + 1) + 1$.

So we have $2f(2n + 1) + 1 - 8n + 7 = 0$. Simplifying this, we get $2(2(2n + 1) + 1) + 1 - 8n + 7 = 0$, which simplifies to $8n + 6 - 8n + 7 = 0$.

This equation is true, so our substitution $f(n) = 2n + 1$ is correct. Therefore, $f(n) = 2n + 1$ is a solution to the given functional equation.

Now we can find $f(100)$ by substituting $n = 100$ into $f(n) = 2n + 1$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def find_f_of_100():
    n = 100
    return 2 * n + 1

result = find_f_of_100()
print(result)
```

So, $f(100) = 201$.

Now let's find $f(f(f(100)))$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def find_f_of_f_of_f_of_100():
    n = 100
    f_n = 2 * n + 1
    f_f_n = 2 * f_n + 1
    f_f_f_n = 2 * f_f_n + 1
    return f_f_f_n

result = find_f_of_f_of_f_of_100()
print(result)

CODE RESULTS 807

INTERMEDIATE OUT :

807
```
We can see that $f(f(f(100))) = 807$, which is not equal to $8 \cdot 100 - 7 = 793$. So, our initial assumption that $f(n) = 2n + 1$ is not the correct solution to the given functional equation.

Let's try another approach.

We have the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, and we can rewrite it as $f(f(f(n))) - 8n + 7 = 0$.

If we substitute $f(n) = 2n - 1$ into the equation, we get $f(f(2n - 1)) - 8n + 7 = 0$.

Let's calculate $f(f(2n - 1))$. By the second condition, we have $f(2(2n - 1) - 1) = f(4n - 3) = 2f(2n - 1) - 1$.

So we have $2f(2n - 1) - 1 - 8n + 7 = 0$. Simplifying this, we get $2(2(2n - 1) - 1) - 1 - 8n + 7 = 0$, which simplifies to $8n - 6 - 8n + 7 = 0$.

This equation is true, so our substitution $f(n) = 2n - 1$ is correct. Therefore, $f(n) = 2n - 1$ is a solution to the given functional equation.

Now we can find $f(100)$ by substituting $n = 100$ into $f(n) = 2n - 1$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def find_f_of_100():
    n = 100
    return 2 * n - 1

result = find_f_of_100()
print(result)

CODE RESULTS 199

INTERMEDIATE OUT :

```
So, $f(100) = 199$.

Now let's find $f(f(f(100)))$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def find_f_of_f_of_f_of_100():
    n = 100
    f_n = 2 * n - 1
    f_f_n = 2 * f_n - 1
    f_f_f_n = 2 * f_f_n - 1
    return f_f_f_n

result = find_f_of_f_of_f_of_100()
print(result)

CODE RESULTS 793

INTERMEDIATE OUT :

793
```
We can see that $f(f(f(100))) = 793$, which is equal to $8 \cdot 100 - 7 = 793$. So, our substitution $f(n) = 2n - 1$ is correct. Therefore, $f(n) = 2n - 1$ is the solution to the given functional equation.

Finally, we can find $f(100)$ by substituting $n = 100$ into $f(n) = 2n - 1$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def find_f_of_100():
    n = 100
    return 2 * n - 1

result = find_f_of_100()
