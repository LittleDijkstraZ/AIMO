**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let \[f(x) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
-x + 3 & \text{if } x \le 0, \\
2x - 5 & \text{if } x > 0.
\end{array}
\right.\]How many solutions does the equation $f(f(x)) = 4$ have?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
To solve the equation $f(f(x)) = 4,$ we first find the values $x$ such that $f(x) = 4.$

Either $f(x) = -x + 3$ (for $x \le 0$) or $f(x) = 2x - 5$ (for $x > 0$). If $-x + 3 = 4,$ then $x = -1.$ Note that this value satisfies $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = 4,$ then $x = 9/2.$ Note that this value satisfies $x > 0.$ Therefore, the solutions to $f(x) = 4$ are $x = -1$ and $x = 9/2.$

Next, we solve for the values $x$ such that $f(x) = -1.$ If $-x + 3 = -1,$ then $x = 4.$ This value does not satisfy $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = -1,$ then $x = 2.$ This value satisfies $x > 0.$

Finally, we solve for the values $x$ such that $f(x) = 9/2.$ If $-x + 3 = 9/2,$ then $x = -3/2.$ This value satisfies $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = 9/2,$ then $x = 19/4.$ This value satisfies $x > 0.$

Therefore, the equation $f(f(x)) = 4$ has the solutions $x = 2,$ $-3/2,$ and $19/4,$ for a total of $\boxed{3}$ solutions. The answer is $\boxed{3}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**



The equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is less than $2$ but greater than $0$. This is because the expression $| |x-1|-2|$ can have at most four distinct solutions:
- If $| |x-1|-2|>2$, the equation has no solutions.
- If $| |x-1|-2|=2$, the equation has exactly two solutions.
- If $0<| |x-1|-2|<2$, the equation has exactly four distinct solutions.
- If $| |x-1|-2|=0$, the equation has exactly one solution.

We need to find the values of $m$ such that $0<\frac{m}{100}<2$. This is equivalent to $0<m<200$.

So the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition is $200 - 1 = 199$.

But we have to remember that $m$ must be a divisor of $100$. The divisors of $100$ are $1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100$. So we have to subtract these values from $199$.

The number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition is $199 - 9 = 190$.

So the answer is $\boxed{190}$.
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def count_m():
    """For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"""
    total_count = 199
    divisors_count = 9
    count = total_count - divisors_count
    return count

result = count_m()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 190

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
190
```
The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions is $190$. Therefore, the value of the unknown variable $m$ is $190$. The answer is $\boxed{190}$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many solutions does the equation \[\frac{(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)\dotsm(x-100)}{(x-1^2)(x-2^2)(x-3^2)\dotsm(x-100^2)} = 0\]have for $x$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Any solution to this equation must make the numerator of the left-hand side zero, while keeping the denominator non-zero. The numerator is zero when $x$ is one of the numbers $1, 2, 3, \dots, 100.$ However, for any value in this list that is a perfect square, the denominator will also be zero, so that value of $x$ will not be a root. Therefore, we want to find the number of integers in the list $1, 2, \dots, 100$ which are not perfect squares. The perfect squares in the list are $1^2, 2^2, \dots, 10^2,$ so there are $10$ perfect squares, and \[100 - 10 = \boxed{90}\]integers which are not perfect squares. The answer is $\boxed{90}$

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"

**Solution:** 



This problem requires us to find the value of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly four distinct solutions. The right-hand side of the equation is a constant, and the left-hand side is a piecewise function that can take the forms $|x-3|$ or $-(x-3)$ depending on the value of $x$. 

The number of solutions to the equation will depend on the value of $\frac{m}{100}$. We can analyze the equation in different cases:

1. If $\frac{m}{100} < 2$, then the equation simplifies to $|x-1| - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$, and further simplifies to $|x-1| = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. This equation has no solutions, because the left-hand side is always less than or equal to $1$, while the right-hand side is greater than $2$ when $\frac{m}{100} < 2$.

2. If $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, then the equation simplifies to $|x-1| - 2 = 2$, and further simplifies to $|x-1| = 4$. This equation has two solutions, $x = 5$ and $x = -3$. However, since we are looking for positive integer solutions, we discard $x = -3$, and only consider $x = 5$.

3. If $2 < \frac{m}{100} < 3$, then the equation simplifies to $|x-1| - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$, and further simplifies to $|x-1| = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. This equation has two solutions, given by $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

4. If $\frac{m}{100} = 3$, then the equation simplifies to $|x-1| - 2 = 3$, and further simplifies to $|x-1| = 5$. This equation has no solutions, because the left-hand side is always less than or equal to $1$, while the right-hand side is greater than $1$.

5. If $\frac{m}{100} > 3$, then the equation simplifies to $|x-1| - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$, and further simplifies to $|x-1| = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. This equation has no solutions, because the left-hand side is always less than or equal to $1$, while the right-hand side is greater than $1$.

From the above analysis, we see that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly four distinct positive integer solutions when $\frac{m}{100} = 2$ or $2 < \frac{m}{100} < 3$. This means $m$ can be any integer between $200$ and $300$, inclusive. The number of such integers is $101$.

So, the value of $m$ for which the equation has exactly four distinct solutions is $101$. The answer is $\boxed{101}$.

## QUESTION 2 - 5

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"For certain ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ of real numbers, the system of equations
\[\begin{aligned} ax+by&=1 \\ x^2 + y^2 &= 50  \end{aligned}\]has at least one solution, and each solution is an ordered pair $(x,y)\,$ of integers. How many such ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ are there?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The graph of $ax+by=1$ is a line, while the graph of $x^2+y^2=50$ is a circle centered at the origin. Therefore, $(a, b)$ satisfies the conditions if and only if the line and circle intersect at least once, and they intersect only at lattice points (points with integer coordinates).

Knowing this, it makes sense to look for lattice points on the circle whose equation is $x^2+y^2=50$. Testing cases, we find that there are twelve lattice points on the circle: $(\pm 1, \pm 7)$, $(\pm 7, \pm 1)$, and $(\pm 5, \pm 5)$ (where the two $\pm$ signs in each pair are independent of each other).

There are $\tbinom{12}{2} = 66$ pairs of these points, and each pair determines a line. However, the graph of $ax+by=1$ can never pass through the origin $(0, 0)$, since if $x=y=0$, then $ax+by=0 \neq 1$. Therefore, the six pairs which consist of diametrically opposed points are invalid, since the line through them passes through the origin. This corrects our count to $66 - 6 = 60$.

In addition, for each of the twelve points, there is a line tangent to the circle at that point, so that the only solution to the system is that one point. This brings the final total to $60 + 12 = \boxed{72}$. The answer is $\boxed{72}$

**Solution:** 


To solve the problem, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has four distinct solutions.

First, we can notice that the right-hand side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be positive, so $m$ must be a positive integer.

Next, we can observe that the absolute value function $\vert \cdot \vert$ makes the expression inside it non-negative, and the double absolute value makes the expression inside it twice non-negative. This means that the left-hand side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, must be a non-negative number.

The graph of $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a V-shape with the bottom of the V at $y = 0$ and the top of the V at $y = 2$. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is within the range of the V-shape's height, which is from $0$ to $2$. Therefore, we have $0 \leq \frac{m}{100} \leq 2$.

Multiplying all sides of the inequalities by $100$, we get $0 \leq m \leq 200$.

The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are $1, 2, 3, ..., 200$. Therefore, there are $200$ positive integers $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions.
The answer is $\boxed{200}$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many integers are solutions to the equation $$(x-2)^{(25-x^2)}=1?$$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
We need some basic facts from number theory: $a^0 = 1$ for any $a,$ $1^b = 1$ for any $b,$ and $(-1)^c = 1$ if $c$ is an even integer. Unless the base is a complex number (which is excluded since we are looking for integer solutions), there are no other ways to get an RHS of $1.$ Thus, either the exponent is zero $($giving the equation $25 - x^2 = 0),$ the base is $1$ $($giving $x -2 = 1),$ or the base is $-1$ and the exponent is even $($giving the simultaneous equations $x - 2 = -1$ and $25 - x^2 = 2n$ for some integer $n).$ Solving the first equation gives $x = \pm 5,$ and solving the second gives $x = 3.$ The third equation implies that $x = 1,$ in which case $25 - x^2 = 24$ is indeed even, so $x = 1$ is a valid solution. In all, there are $\boxed{4}$ integer solutions. The answer is $\boxed{4}$

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we can start by analyzing the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.
This equation has 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is an integer between 1 and 2, inclusive.
Therefore, we need to find the number of integers $m$ such that $\frac{m}{100}$ is in the interval $[1, 2]$.
The possible values of $\frac{m}{100}$ are $1, \frac{3}{2}, 2$.
For $\frac{m}{100}$ to be an integer, it must be either 1 or 2.
So, the possible values of $m$ are 100 and 200.
Therefore, there are 2 values of $m$ that satisfy the condition. The answer is: $2$

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We first need to understand that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. This means that the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, should be equal to $2$.

2. To solve for $m$, we can multiply both sides of the equation by $100$ to get rid of the fraction, resulting in $m = 200$.

3. Therefore, the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $200$.

Now, let's implement this in Python:

```python

def find_m():
    m = 200
    return m

result = find_m()

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let \[f(x) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
-x + 3 & \text{if } x \le 0, \\
2x - 5 & \text{if } x > 0.
\end{array}
\right.\]How many solutions does the equation $f(f(x)) = 4$ have?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
To solve the equation $f(f(x)) = 4,$ we first find the values $x$ such that $f(x) = 4.$

Either $f(x) = -x + 3$ (for $x \le 0$) or $f(x) = 2x - 5$ (for $x > 0$). If $-x + 3 = 4,$ then $x = -1.$ Note that this value satisfies $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = 4,$ then $x = 9/2.$ Note that this value satisfies $x > 0.$ Therefore, the solutions to $f(x) = 4$ are $x = -1$ and $x = 9/2.$

Next, we solve for the values $x$ such that $f(x) = -1.$ If $-x + 3 = -1,$ then $x = 4.$ This value does not satisfy $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = -1,$ then $x = 2.$ This value satisfies $x > 0.$

Finally, we solve for the values $x$ such that $f(x) = 9/2.$ If $-x + 3 = 9/2,$ then $x = -3/2.$ This value satisfies $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = 9/2,$ then $x = 19/4.$ This value satisfies $x > 0.$

Therefore, the equation $f(f(x)) = 4$ has the solutions $x = 2,$ $-3/2,$ and $19/4,$ for a total of $\boxed{3}$ solutions. The answer is $\boxed{3}$

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The number of solutions of the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] is equal to the number of times the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ intersects the horizontal line $y = \frac{m}{100}$.
The function $f(x)$ has a graph that is V-shaped with a maximum at $x=1$. The value of the function at $x=1$ is $f(1) = 2$. The function decreases to $0$ as $x$ goes to $\pm \infty$. Therefore, the function $f(x)$ intersects the line $y = \frac{m}{100}$ exactly once if $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, twice if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, and does not intersect if $\frac{m}{100} > 2$.
So, the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. This is equivalent to $100 < m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from $101$ to $199$, inclusive. The number of such integers is $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has $4$ distinct solutions is $99$.
The value of $m$ that makes the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions is $m=150$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has $4$ distinct solutions is $1$. The value of $m$ that makes the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions is $m=150$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has $4$ distinct solutions is $1$.

In summary, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has $4$ distinct solutions is $1$. The answer is: $1$

**Solution:** 



We are given the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ and we need to find the number of positive integer values of $m$ for which the equation has exactly 4 distinct solutions.

Firstly, we need to understand that the expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a piecewise function with four pieces. The function $\vert x-1 \vert$ is a V-shaped graph with its vertex at $(1,0)$. Therefore, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a similar V-shaped graph with its vertices at $(1,2)$ and $(1,-2)$. The graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a "ladder" of width 1 and height 2 centered at $x=1$.

Now, we set $\frac{m}{100}$ to be the height of this "ladder". For the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, the height $\frac{m}{100}$ must be between 1 and 2 (exclusive), because if it is equal to 1 or 2, the "ladder" will have only 3 or 2 steps respectively.

Therefore, we have $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which simplifies to $100 < m < 200$. The positive integer values of $m$ in this range are 101 through 199, which gives us a total of 100 possible values.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solve

def number_of_solutions():
    m = symbols('m')
    # Set up the inequality
    inequality = 100 < m < 200
    # Get all integer solutions
    solutions = list(range(101, 200))
    return len(solutions)

result = number_of_solutions()
print(result)
```

The solution provided above is incorrect because the `solve` function does not work with inequalities. To solve this problem, we need to find the number of positive integer values of $m$ for which the equation has exactly 4 distinct solutions. As mentioned earlier, this occurs when the height $\frac{m}{100}$ is between 1 and 2 (exclusive). Therefore, the possible values for $m$ are 101 through 199. To find the total number of such values, we simply subtract the smallest value from the largest value and add 1.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def number_of_solutions():
    lower_bound = 101
    upper_bound = 199
    number_of_values = upper_bound - lower_bound + 1
    return number_of_values

result = number_of_solutions()
print(result)
```

The number of positive integer values of $m$ for which the equation has exactly 4 distinct solutions is $99$. However, this result seems incorrect. The original inequality $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$ implies $100 < m < 200$, and the number of positive integers in this range is indeed 100, not 99. Let's revise our approach.

We are looking for the number of positive integer values of $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly 4 distinct solutions. As we've established earlier, this occurs when the height $\frac{m}{100}$ is between 1 and 2 (exclusive), or in other words, $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Multiplying all parts of the inequality by 100, we get $100 < m < 200$. The positive integer values of $m$ in this range are 101 through 199, giving us a total of 100 possible values.

Therefore, the correct answer is 100, not 99. The mistake in the previous solution was in not including both the lower and upper bounds of the range when calculating the number of values. The lower bound 101 and the upper bound 199 are both included in the range of possible values for $m$, so we need to count both of them. This is done by subtracting the lower bound from the upper bound and adding 1. The calculation $199 - 101 + 1$ gives the correct result of 100.

The final answer is:

The number of positive integer values of $m$ for which the equation has exactly 4 distinct solutions is 100. The answer is: $100$

**Problem:** 
"How many solutions does the equation \[\frac{(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)\dotsm(x-100)}{(x-1^2)(x-2^2)(x-3^2)\dotsm(x-100^2)} = 0\]have for $x$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Any solution to this equation must make the numerator of the left-hand side zero, while keeping the denominator non-zero. The numerator is zero when $x$ is one of the numbers $1, 2, 3, \dots, 100.$ However, for any value in this list that is a perfect square, the denominator will also be zero, so that value of $x$ will not be a root. Therefore, we want to find the number of integers in the list $1, 2, \dots, 100$ which are not perfect squares. The perfect squares in the list are $1^2, 2^2, \dots, 10^2,$ so there are $10$ perfect squares, and \[100 - 10 = \boxed{90}\]integers which are not perfect squares. The answer is $\boxed{90}$

**Solution:** 


To solve the problem, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly 4 distinct solutions. 

Let's solve the equation step by step:

1. First, we notice that the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, is always nonnegative. Therefore, the number of solutions to the equation is the same as the number of solutions to the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=k$, where $k$ is a nonnegative number.

2. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=k$ can be rewritten as two separate equations: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = k$ and $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -k$.

3. Each of these equations can be further rewritten as four separate equations: $x-1 - 2 = k$, $x-1 - 2 = -k$, $-(x-1) - 2 = k$, and $-(x-1) - 2 = -k$.

4. Solving these equations gives us the solutions: $x = 1 + k + 2 = k + 3$, $x = 1 - k + 2 = 3 - k$, $x = 1 - k - 2 = -k - 1$, and $x = 1 + k - 2 = k - 1$.

5. We want the equation to have exactly 4 distinct solutions. This happens when $k = 1$. In this case, the solutions are $x = 4$, $x = 2$, $x = -2$, and $x = 0$.

6. Therefore, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100} = 1$, which gives $m = 100$.

So, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions, and that is $m = 100$. The answer is $\boxed{1}$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many integers are solutions to the equation $$(x-2)^{(25-x^2)}=1?$$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
We need some basic facts from number theory: $a^0 = 1$ for any $a,$ $1^b = 1$ for any $b,$ and $(-1)^c = 1$ if $c$ is an even integer. Unless the base is a complex number (which is excluded since we are looking for integer solutions), there are no other ways to get an RHS of $1.$ Thus, either the exponent is zero $($giving the equation $25 - x^2 = 0),$ the base is $1$ $($giving $x -2 = 1),$ or the base is $-1$ and the exponent is even $($giving the simultaneous equations $x - 2 = -1$ and $25 - x^2 = 2n$ for some integer $n).$ Solving the first equation gives $x = \pm 5,$ and solving the second gives $x = 3.$ The third equation implies that $x = 1,$ in which case $25 - x^2 = 24$ is indeed even, so $x = 1$ is a valid solution. In all, there are $\boxed{4}$ integer solutions. The answer is $\boxed{4}$

**Solution:** 


The problem requires us to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. We can approach this problem by considering the cases for the values of $m$.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can have $4$ distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly less than $2$. This is because the expression on the left side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, oscillates between $0$ and $4$ as $x$ varies over the real numbers. It equals $0$ when $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$, which gives $x = 3$ or $x = -1$. It equals $4$ when $\vert x-1 \vert = 6$, which has no real solutions. For values of $\frac{m}{100}$ strictly between $0$ and $2$, the equation will have $4$ distinct solutions.

Therefore, the values of $m$ we are interested in are those such that $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Multiplying all sides of the inequality by $100$ gives $0 < m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ in this range are $1, 2, ..., 199$, and there are $199$ of them.

However, we need to find the number of these integers that make the equation have $4$ distinct solutions. As stated earlier, this occurs when $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which is equivalent to $0 < m < 200$. The positive integers in this range are exactly the integers from $1$ to $199$, and there are $199$ of them.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $199$. However, we need to find the number of these integers that make the equation have $4$ distinct solutions. As stated earlier, this occurs when $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which is equivalent to $0 < m < 200$. The positive integers in this range are exactly the integers from $1$ to $199$, and there are $199$ of them.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $199$. However, as per the problem statement, we are asked to find the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy this condition. Since the range of positive integers $m$ that we found is from $1$ to $199$, there are $199$ such positive integers $m$.

The answer is: $199$
