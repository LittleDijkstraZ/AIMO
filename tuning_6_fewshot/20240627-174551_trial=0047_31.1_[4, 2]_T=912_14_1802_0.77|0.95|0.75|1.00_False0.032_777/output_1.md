**Problem:** 
"Find the minimum value of $2x^2 + 2y^2 + 5z^2 - 2xy - 4yz - 4x - 2z + 15$ over all real numbers $x,$ $y,$ $z.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
We can write the given expression as
\begin{align*}
&(x^2 - 4x + 4) + (x^2 - 2xy + y^2) + (y^2 - 4yz + 4z^2) + (z^2 - 2z + 1) + 10 \\
&= (x - 2)^2 + (x - y)^2 + (y - 2z)^2 + (z - 1)^2 + 10
\end{align*}The minimum value is then $\boxed{10},$ which occurs when $x = 2,$ $y = 2,$ and $z = 1.$ The answer is $\boxed{10}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
**Problem**
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


To find the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we can use the method of completing the square.

First, let's rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $(x-y)^2 + 2(x^2 + y^2)$. 

Now, let's analyze the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. By the triangle inequality, we have $|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |(x-2y) - (y-2x)| = |x-y|$. So we have $|x-y| = 20$.

Substitute $x-y = 20$ into the expression $(x-y)^2 + 2(x^2 + y^2)$, we get $400 + 2(x^2 + y^2)$.

Now we need to minimize $400 + 2(x^2 + y^2)$. This is equivalent to minimizing $x^2 + y^2$.

By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have $(1^2 + 1^2)(x^2 + y^2) \geq (x + y)^2$, so $2(x^2 + y^2) \geq (x + y)^2$.

By the triangle inequality, we have $|x+y| \leq |x-y| + |2y| = 20 + 2|y|$. So $(x + y)^2 \leq (20 + 2|y|)^2$.

Therefore, $2(x^2 + y^2) \geq (20 + 2|y|)^2$.

Taking the minimum of both sides, we get $2(x^2 + y^2) \geq (20 + 0)^2 = 400$, so $x^2 + y^2 \geq 200$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $400 + 2 \cdot 200 = 800$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def min_value():
    """What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"""
    min_value = 800
    return min_value

result = min_value()
print(result)
```

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solve, simplify, Eq, Abs

def minimum_value():
    # Define the variables
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # Define the function and the equation
    f = 5*x**2 + 5*y**2 - 8*x*y
    eq = Eq(Abs(x - 2*y) + Abs(y - 2*x), 40)

    # Solve the equation for y
    y_sol = solve(eq, y)[0]

    # Substitute y in the function
    f = f.subs(y, y_sol)

    # Take the derivative of the function
    f_prime = f.diff(x)

    # Find the critical points
    critical_points = solve(f_prime, x)

    # Evaluate the function at the critical points
    values = [f.subs(x, cp) for cp in critical_points]

    # Return the minimum value
    return min(values)

result = minimum_value()
print(result)
```
