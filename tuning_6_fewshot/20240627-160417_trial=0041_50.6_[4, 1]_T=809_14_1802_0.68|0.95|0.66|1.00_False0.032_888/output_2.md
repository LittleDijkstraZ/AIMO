**Problem:** 
"How many integers are solutions to the equation $$(x-2)^{(25-x^2)}=1?$$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
We need some basic facts from number theory: $a^0 = 1$ for any $a,$ $1^b = 1$ for any $b,$ and $(-1)^c = 1$ if $c$ is an even integer. Unless the base is a complex number (which is excluded since we are looking for integer solutions), there are no other ways to get an RHS of $1.$ Thus, either the exponent is zero $($giving the equation $25 - x^2 = 0),$ the base is $1$ $($giving $x -2 = 1),$ or the base is $-1$ and the exponent is even $($giving the simultaneous equations $x - 2 = -1$ and $25 - x^2 = 2n$ for some integer $n).$ Solving the first equation gives $x = \pm 5,$ and solving the second gives $x = 3.$ The third equation implies that $x = 1,$ in which case $25 - x^2 = 24$ is indeed even, so $x = 1$ is a valid solution. In all, there are $\boxed{4}$ integer solutions. The answer is $\boxed{4}$

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has $4$ distinct solutions.

We know that the expression on the left side can take three different forms:

1. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 \geq 0$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\vert x-1 \vert -2$.
2. If $-\frac{m}{100} \leq \vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=-\vert x-1 \vert +2 + \frac{m}{100}$.
3. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=2-\vert x-1 \vert + \frac{m}{100}$.

Now, we need to find the number of solutions for each of these cases.

For the first case, we have $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two equations:

1. $x-1 -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.
2. $1-x -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

For the second case, we have $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 + \frac{m}{100} = \frac{m}{100}$. This simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$, which gives us two solutions: $x = -1$ and $x = 3$.

For the third case, we have $2-\vert x-1 \vert + \frac{m}{100} = \frac{m}{100}$. This simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$, which gives us the same solutions as the second case.

So, the solutions for the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] are $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$, $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$, $x = -1$, and $x = 3$. The only way for this equation to have only 4 distinct solutions is if $\frac{m}{100} = 0$, which implies $m=0$. However, $m$ cannot be $0$ because the equation has 4 distinct solutions. Therefore, there are no such positive integers $m$.

However, we made a mistake in our reasoning. The equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] actually has 4 distinct solutions for $m=200$.

The correct solutions for the equation are $x = -1 + \frac{200}{100} = 1$, $x = 3 + \frac{200}{100} = 5$, $x = -1$, and $x = 3$.

So, there is one positive integer $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions, and that integer is $m=200$.

The answer is: $200$.

## QUESTION 2 - 1

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"For certain ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ of real numbers, the system of equations
\[\begin{aligned} ax+by&=1 \\ x^2 + y^2 &= 50  \end{aligned}\]has at least one solution, and each solution is an ordered pair $(x,y)\,$ of integers. How many such ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ are there?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The graph of $ax+by=1$ is a line, while the graph of $x^2+y^2=50$ is a circle centered at the origin. Therefore, $(a, b)$ satisfies the conditions if and only if the line and circle intersect at least once, and they intersect only at lattice points (points with integer coordinates).

Knowing this, it makes sense to look for lattice points on the circle whose equation is $x^2+y^2=50$. Testing cases, we find that there are twelve lattice points on the circle: $(\pm 1, \pm 7)$, $(\pm 7, \pm 1)$, and $(\pm 5, \pm 5)$ (where the two $\pm$ signs in each pair are independent of each other).

There are $\tbinom{12}{2} = 66$ pairs of these points, and each pair determines a line. However, the graph of $ax+by=1$ can never pass through the origin $(0, 0)$, since if $x=y=0$, then $ax+by=0 \neq 1$. Therefore, the six pairs which consist of diametrically opposed points are invalid, since the line through them passes through the origin. This corrects our count to $66 - 6 = 60$.

In addition, for each of the twelve points, there is a line tangent to the circle at that point, so that the only solution to the system is that one point. This brings the final total to $60 + 12 = \boxed{72}$. The answer is $\boxed{72}$

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


To solve this problem, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has $4$ distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have $4$ distinct solutions if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $0$ and $2$. Therefore, we have $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$.

Multiplying all sides of the inequalities by $100$ gives $0 < m < 200$.

The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from $1$ to $199$.

So, the number of such positive integers $m$ is $199$.

```python

def count_positive_integers():
    """For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"""

result = count_positive_integers()
print(result)

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let \[f(x) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
-x + 3 & \text{if } x \le 0, \\
2x - 5 & \text{if } x > 0.
\end{array}
\right.\]How many solutions does the equation $f(f(x)) = 4$ have?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
To solve the equation $f(f(x)) = 4,$ we first find the values $x$ such that $f(x) = 4.$

Either $f(x) = -x + 3$ (for $x \le 0$) or $f(x) = 2x - 5$ (for $x > 0$). If $-x + 3 = 4,$ then $x = -1.$ Note that this value satisfies $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = 4,$ then $x = 9/2.$ Note that this value satisfies $x > 0.$ Therefore, the solutions to $f(x) = 4$ are $x = -1$ and $x = 9/2.$

Next, we solve for the values $x$ such that $f(x) = -1.$ If $-x + 3 = -1,$ then $x = 4.$ This value does not satisfy $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = -1,$ then $x = 2.$ This value satisfies $x > 0.$

Finally, we solve for the values $x$ such that $f(x) = 9/2.$ If $-x + 3 = 9/2,$ then $x = -3/2.$ This value satisfies $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = 9/2,$ then $x = 19/4.$ This value satisfies $x > 0.$

Therefore, the equation $f(f(x)) = 4$ has the solutions $x = 2,$ $-3/2,$ and $19/4,$ for a total of $\boxed{3}$ solutions. The answer is $\boxed{3}$

**Solution:** 


The problem asks for how many positive integers $m$ the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. 

We can start by solving the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ for different values of $m$. 

For each value of $m$, we can solve the equation by first considering the absolute value inside the absolute value:

1. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, then $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.
2. This gives two sub-cases to consider:
   a. If $x-1 \ge 0$, then $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, so $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.
   b. If $x-1 < 0$, then $-(x-1) = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, so $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

3. Similarly, if $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$, then $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
4. This gives two sub-cases to consider:
   a. If $x-1 \ge 0$, then $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, so $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
   b. If $x-1 < 0$, then $-(x-1) = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, so $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Now, for each of the four equations we found, we need to check how many distinct solutions they have. 

We can do this by graphing each equation and counting the number of intersections with the x-axis. 

After doing this for each value of $m$, we find that the equation has 4 distinct solutions when $m=200$. 

So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is $1$. The answer is: $1$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many distinct solutions are there to the equation $|x-7| = |x+1|$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
If $|x-7| = |x+1|$, then either $x-7 = x+1$ or $x-7 = -(x+1)$.  Simplifying $x-7=x+1$ gives $0=8$, which has no solutions, so no values of $x$ satisfy $x-7 = x+1$.  If $x-7 = -(x+1)$, then $x-7 = -x-1$, so $2x = 6$, which gives $x=3$.  So, there is $\boxed{1}$ solution.

Challenge: See if you can find a quick solution to this problem by simply thinking about the graphs of $y=|x-7|$ and $y=|x+1|$. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


We can start by noting that the equation $| |x-1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. This is because $| |x-1| - 2|$ is equal to 2 only when $|x-1| = 3$, which gives us three distinct solutions $x = 4, x = -2$.

To confirm this, we can solve the equation $| |x-1| - 2| = 2$. This gives us two sub-equations:

1. $|x-1| - 2 = 2 \implies |x-1| = 4 \implies x = 5, -3$.
2. $|x-1| - 2 = -2 \implies |x-1| = 0 \implies x = 1$.

So we have 4 distinct solutions $x = 5, -3, 1$.

Therefore, the value of $m$ is $2 \cdot 100 = 200$.
The answer is: $200$

\right.\]How many solutions does the equation $f(f(x)) = 4$ have?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
To solve the equation $f(f(x)) = 4,$ we first find the values $x$ such that $f(x) = 4.$

Either $f(x) = -x + 3$ (for $x \le 0$) or $f(x) = 2x - 5$ (for $x > 0$). If $-x + 3 = 4,$ then $x = -1.$ Note that this value satisfies $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = 4,$ then $x = 9/2.$ Note that this value satisfies $x > 0.$ Therefore, the solutions to $f(x) = 4$ are $x = -1$ and $x = 9/2.$

Next, we solve for the values $x$ such that $f(x) = -1.$ If $-x + 3 = -1,$ then $x = 4.$ This value does not satisfy $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = -1,$ then $x = 2.$ This value satisfies $x > 0.$

Finally, we solve for the values $x$ such that $f(x) = 9/2.$ If $-x + 3 = 9/2,$ then $x = -3/2.$ This value satisfies $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = 9/2,$ then $x = 19/4.$ This value satisfies $x > 0.$

Therefore, the equation $f(f(x)) = 4$ has the solutions $x = 2,$ $-3/2,$ and $19/4,$ for a total of $\boxed{3}$ solutions. The answer is $\boxed{3}$

**Solution:**


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $2$. 

This is because the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, can equal $2$ or $-2$. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=2$ has four solutions: $x = -1, 5$. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=-2$ has no solutions because the absolute value of a quantity cannot be negative.

Therefore, we need to find the value of $m$ such that $\frac{m}{100}=2$.
