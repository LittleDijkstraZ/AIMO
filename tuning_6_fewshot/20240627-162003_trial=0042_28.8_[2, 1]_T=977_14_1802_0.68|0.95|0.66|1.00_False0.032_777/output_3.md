**Problem:** 
"An ellipse is defined parametrically by
\[(x,y) = \left( \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t}, \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t} \right).\]Then the equation of the ellipse can be written in the form
\[Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0,\]where $A,$ $B,$ $C,$ $D,$ $E,$ and $F$ are integers, and $\gcd(|A|,|B|,|C|,|D|,|E|,|F|) = 1.$  Find $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F|.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
In the equation $y = \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\cos t$ to get
\[\cos t = \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3}.\]In the equation $x = \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\sin t$ to get
\[\sin t = \frac{1}{2} x (2 - \cos t) + 1 = \frac{1}{2} x \left( 2 - \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right) + 1 = 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)}.\]Since $\cos^2 t + \sin^2 t = 1,$
\[\left( \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right)^2 + \left( 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)} \right)^2 = 1.\]Multiplying both sides by $(2(y + 3))^2$ and expanding, it will simplify to
\[81x^2 - 36xy + 16y^2 - 108x + 240y + 900 = 0.\]Therefore, $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F| = 81 + 36 + 16 + 108 + 240 + 900 = \boxed{1381}.$ The answer is $\boxed{1381}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



This problem is a geometry problem about finding the area of a polygon. The equation given is a product of two expressions, each of which is a squared absolute value minus a constant. The only way for this product to be zero is if at least one of the expressions is zero. 

So we have four cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For each case, we solve the equation and plot the resulting lines on a graph. The intersection points of these lines will be the vertices of the polygon.

1. For the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which gives $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.
2. For the second case, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which gives $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.
3. For the third case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$, which gives $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.
4. For the fourth case, we have $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

Plotting these lines on a graph, we find that they form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So the area of the convex polygon is 256.

```python

def area_of_polygon():

    # The side length of the square is 16
    side_length = 16

    # The area of the square is side_length^2
    area = side_length**2

    return area

result = area_of_polygon()

The area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is $\boxed{256}$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_ 2= (-16,2).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that
\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as
\[\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1.\]Find $h + k + a + b.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

**Solution:** 



To solve this problem, we first need to understand that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, we can break down the equation into two separate equations:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first equation, both terms must be zero:

$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$

This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

For the second equation, both terms must be zero:

$(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

Combining these conditions, we find that the points that satisfy the original equation are those that lie on the squares with side length 16 centered at the origin. The intersection of these squares is a 8 by 8 square, so its area is $8^2 = 64$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 64. The answer is: $64$

**Solution:** 


The problem involves absolute value functions and squared terms, which makes it challenging to solve directly using sympy. However, we can observe that the product of two expressions is zero if and only if at least one of the expressions is zero. Therefore, we can break the problem into two cases:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For Case 1, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the square as $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0)$.

For Case 2, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the square as $(8, 0), (-8, 0), (0, 8), (0, -8)$.

The intersection of the two cases gives us a total of 8 vertices, which form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100.

    case1 = ((Abs(x + y) - 10)**2 + (Abs(x - y) - 10)**2)
    # Case 2: |x| = 8 and |y| = 8
    case2 = ((Abs(x) - 8)**2 + (Abs(y) - 8)**2)

    # Solve the equations
    vertices_case1 = solve([case1], (x, y))
    vertices_case2 = solve([case2], (x, y))

    # Intersection of the two cases
    vertices = set(vertices_case1).intersection(set(vertices_case2))

    # The vertices form a square with side length 10
    side_length = 10

    # Calculate the area of the square
    area = side_length**2

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
For the product of two numbers to be zero, either one of the numbers must be zero. So we have two cases:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations gives us the vertices of a square with side length 20. The area of the square is $20^2 = 400$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these four equations gives us the vertices of a square with side length 16. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.
The convex polygon enclosed by the points is the union of these two squares. So the area of the convex polygon is $400 + 256 = 656$.
The answer is: $656$.

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.
The first term is zero when $|\pm x \pm y| = 10$ and the second term is zero when $|\pm x| = 8$ or $|\pm y| = 8$.
The first equation represents a square with side length 20, and the second equation represents a square with side length 16.
The intersection of these two squares forms a convex polygon, which is the area we need to find.
The area of the square with side length 20 is $20^2 = 400$, and the area of the square with side length 16 is $16^2 = 256$.
The intersection of these two squares is a smaller square with side length 8 (the difference between the side lengths of the two squares).
The area of this smaller square is $8^2 = 64$.
The area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares minus the area of the smaller square: $400 + 256 - 64 = 592$.
So, the area of the convex polygon is 592 square units.
The answer is: $592$

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. Therefore, either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.

The first expression is zero when either $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x-y| - 10 = 0$. These equations simplify to $|x+y| = 10$ and $|x-y| = 10$.

The second expression is zero when either $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$. These equations simplify to $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$.

The solutions to $|x+y| = 10$ are the lines $x+y = 10$ and $x+y = -10$. The solutions to $|x-y| = 10$ are the lines $x-y = 10$ and $x-y = -10$. The solutions to $|x| = 8$ are the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$. The solutions to $|y| = 8$ are the lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

These lines enclose a rectangle with vertices at $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$. The length of the rectangle is $16$ and the width is $16$, so the area of the rectangle is $16 \times 16 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256.
