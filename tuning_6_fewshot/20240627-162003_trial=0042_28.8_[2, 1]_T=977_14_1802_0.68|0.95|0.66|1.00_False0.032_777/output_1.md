"If $x + 2y= 4$ and $xy = -8$, what is the value of $x^2 + 4y^2$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
We see that $(x + 2y)^2 = (x^2 + 4y^2) + 4xy = 4^2 = 16$. We want to find $x^2 + 4y^2$ and are given $xy = -8$. So, $x^2 + 4y^2 + 4xy = x^2 + 4y^2 + 4(-8) = 16$. It follows that $x^2 + 4y^2 = \boxed{48}$. The answer is $\boxed{48}$

**Problem**
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


To solve this problem, we first need to observe that the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is equivalent to $|x-2y| = |2x-y|$. This implies that $x-2y = 2x-y$ or $x-2y = -(2x-y)$. Solving these two equations gives us $x = 3y$ or $x = y$.

Now, let's substitute $x = 3y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We get:

\[5(3y)^2 + 5y^2 - 8(3y)(y) = 5(9y^2) + 5y^2 - 24y^2 = 41y^2.\]

Similarly, if we substitute $x = y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get:

\[5y^2 + 5y^2 - 8y^2 = 2y^2.\]

Since we are looking for the minimum value of the expression, we need to compare the values of $41y^2$ and $2y^2$. Clearly, $2y^2$ is smaller than $41y^2$ for all non-zero values of $y$. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ occurs when $x = y$.

Now, we need to find the minimum value of $2y^2$ when $y$ ranges over all real numbers. Since $2y^2$ is always non-negative, its minimum value is 0. This occurs when $y = 0$. However, if $y = 0$, then $x = y = 0$, and $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 0 \neq 40$. So, we must consider the case when $x = 3y$. If we set $y = 0$, we get $x = 0$, which also does not satisfy the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. Therefore, we must consider the case when $x = y$ again.

So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ occurs when $x = y$. In this case, the expression simplifies to $2y^2$. To find the minimum value of $2y^2$, we need to consider the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. Substituting $x = y$ into this equation gives $|y-2y| + |y-2y| = 40$, which simplifies to $2|y| = 40$. Solving for $y$ gives $y = \pm 20$. Since we want the minimum value of $2y^2$, we choose $y = -20$. Substituting $y = -20$ into $2y^2$ gives $2(-20)^2 = 800$.

So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 800 when $x$ and $y$ satisfy the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 800. The answer is: $\boxed{800}$

The code above is incorrect because it attempts to solve the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ for $x$ symbolically, which is not possible due to the absolute value function. Instead, we can solve this problem by considering the geometry of the equation. The equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ represents the perimeter of a rectangle with vertices at $(0,0)$, $(x,0)$, $(0,y)$, and $(x,y)$. The minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is achieved when $x$ and $y$ are the semi-diameters of the ellipse $\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1$, where $a^2 = \frac{40}{2}$ and $b^2 = \frac{40}{2}$. 

To find the minimum value, we can use the formula for the minimum value of the expression $ax^2 + by^2 - kxy$ which is given by $a^2 + b^2 - k^2/4$. Here, $a^2 = \frac{40}{2} = 20$, $b^2 = \frac{40}{2} = 20$, and $k = -8$. So the minimum value is $20 + 20 - \frac{(-8)^2}{4} = 40 - 16 = 24$.

However, this approach is incorrect because the given equation does not represent the perimeter of a rectangle. Instead, we can consider the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ as the sum of the distances from $(x,y)$ to the lines $x=2y$ and $y=2x$. This is equivalent to the sum of the distances from $(x,y)$ to the lines $y=\frac{1}{2}x$ and $y=\frac{1}{2}x$, which are parallel lines. The minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is achieved when $(x,y)$ is the center of the ellipse $\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1$, where $a^2 = \frac{40}{2}$ and $b^2 = \frac{40}{2}$. 

Again, we can use the formula for the minimum value of the expression $ax^2 + by^2 - kxy$ which is given by $a^2 + b^2 - k^2/4$. Here, $a^2 = \frac{40}{2} = 20$, $b^2 = \frac{40}{2} = 20$, and $k = -8$. So the minimum value is $20 + 20 - \frac{(-8)^2}{4} = 40 - 16 = 24$.

So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 24. However, this approach is also incorrect because the given equation does not represent the sum of distances from $(x,y)$ to parallel lines. The correct approach is to use the geometry of the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. This equation represents the perimeter of a rectangle with vertices at $(0,0)$, $(x,0)$, $(0,y)$, and $(x,y)$. The minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is achieved when $x$ and $y$ are the semi-diameters of the ellipse $\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1$, where $a^2 = \frac{40}{2}$ and $b^2 = \frac{40}{2}$.

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


To solve this problem, we first need to express the given expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ in terms of $(x-2y)^2$ and $(y-2x)^2$. We know that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$, which implies $(x-2y)^2 + (2y-x)^2 = 40^2$.

Expanding $(x-2y)^2 + (2y-x)^2$, we get $2(x^2 + 4y^2 - 4xy) = 40^2$, or $x^2 + 4y^2 - 4xy = \frac{40^2}{2} = 800$.

Now, we want to find the value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. Notice that $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(x^2 + 4y^2 - 4xy) = 5 \cdot 800 = 4000$.

So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 4000.

    value = 5 * (40**2) / 2
    return value

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


This problem is a bit complex and requires some mathematical analysis and manipulation. But using the given condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we can simplify it to $x = 2y$. Now, we can substitute $x = 2y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to get $5(2y)^2 + 5y^2 - 8(2y)y = 20y^2 + 5y^2 - 16y^2 = 19y^2$. 

Now, we want to find the minimum value of $19y^2$. Since $y^2$ is always non-negative, the minimum value of $19y^2$ is 0, which occurs when $y = 0$. Substituting $y = 0$ into $x = 2y$, we get $x = 0$. So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the given condition is 0.

Here is the Python code to solve the problem:

**Problem:** 
"What is the minimum value of the expression $2x^2+3y^2+8x-24y+62$ for real $x$ and $y$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Rearranging the expression, we have  \[2x^2+8x+3y^2-24y+62\]We first complete the square in $x$. Factoring a 2 from the first two terms of the expression, we get  \[2(x^2+4x)+3y^2-24y+62\]In order for the expression inside the parenthesis to be a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(4/2)^2=4$ inside the parenthesis. Doing this, we have \[2(x^2+4x+4-4)+3y^2-24y+62 \Rightarrow 2(x+2)^2+3y^2-24y+54\]Now we complete the square in $y$. Factoring a 3 from the $y$ terms in the expression, we get \[2(x+2)^2+3(y^2-8y)+54\]In order for the expression inside the second parenthesis to be a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(8/2)^2=16$ inside the parenthesis. Doing this, we have \[2(x+2)^2+3(y^2-8y+16-16)+54 \Rightarrow 2(x+2)^2+3(y-4)^2+6\]Since the minimum value of $2(x+2)^2$ and $3(y-4)^2$ is $0$ (perfect squares can never be negative), the minimum value of the entire expression is $\boxed{6}$, and is achieved when $x=-2$ and $y=4$. The answer is $\boxed{6}$

Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Rearranging the expression, we have  \[x^2+2x+y^2-4y+8\]Completing the square in $x$, we need to add and subtract $(2/2)^2=1$. Completing the square in $y$, we need to add and subtract $(4/2)^2=4$.

The answer is $\boxed{3}$
