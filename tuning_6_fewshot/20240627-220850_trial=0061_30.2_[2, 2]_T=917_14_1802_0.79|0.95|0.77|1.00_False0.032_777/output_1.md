**Problem:** 
"What is the minimum value of the expression $2x^2+3y^2+8x-24y+62$ for real $x$ and $y$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Rearranging the expression, we have  \[2x^2+8x+3y^2-24y+62\]We first complete the square in $x$. Factoring a 2 from the first two terms of the expression, we get  \[2(x^2+4x)+3y^2-24y+62\]In order for the expression inside the parenthesis to be a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(4/2)^2=4$ inside the parenthesis. Doing this, we have \[2(x^2+4x+4-4)+3y^2-24y+62 \Rightarrow 2(x+2)^2+3y^2-24y+54\]Now we complete the square in $y$. Factoring a 3 from the $y$ terms in the expression, we get \[2(x+2)^2+3(y^2-8y)+54\]In order for the expression inside the second parenthesis to be a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(8/2)^2=16$ inside the parenthesis. Doing this, we have \[2(x+2)^2+3(y^2-8y+16-16)+54 \Rightarrow 2(x+2)^2+3(y-4)^2+6\]Since the minimum value of $2(x+2)^2$ and $3(y-4)^2$ is $0$ (perfect squares can never be negative), the minimum value of the entire expression is $\boxed{6}$, and is achieved when $x=-2$ and $y=4$. The answer is $\boxed{6}$

**Problem:** 
"What is the minimum value of the expression $x^2+y^2+2x-4y+8$ for real $x$ and $y$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Rearranging the expression, we have  \[x^2+2x+y^2-4y+8\]Completing the square in $x$, we need to add and subtract $(2/2)^2=1$. Completing the square in $y$, we need to add and subtract $(4/2)^2=4$. Thus, we have \[(x^2+2x+1)-1+(y^2-4y+4)-4+8 \Rightarrow (x+1)^2+(y-2)^2+3\]Since the minimum value of $(x+1)^2$ and $(y-2)^2$ is $0$ (perfect squares can never be negative), the minimum value of the entire expression is $\boxed{3}$, and is achieved when $x=-1$ and $y=2$. The answer is $\boxed{3}$

**Solution:** 


The given problem is a bit complex, and solving it directly might not be straightforward. However, we can make a substitution to simplify it. Let's set $u = x - 2y$ and $v = y - 2x$. Then, the equation $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|u| + |v| = 40$. 

Now, we have the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = \frac{5}{2}((x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2) = \frac{5}{2}(u^2 + v^2)$. 

To minimize this expression under the constraint $|u| + |v| = 40$, we can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality:

$$(u^2 + v^2)(1 + 1) \geq (u + v)^2.$$

Since $|u| + |v| = 40$, we know that $u + v = \pm 40$. Substituting this into the inequality gives us:

$$(u^2 + v^2) \geq \frac{(40)^2}{2} = 800.$$

So, the minimum value of $\frac{5}{2}(u^2 + v^2)$ is $\frac{5}{2} \cdot 800 = 2000$. Therefore, the minimum value of the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is 2000.

So, the answer is: $\boxed{2000}$.

**Problem:** 
"If $x + 2y= 4$ and $xy = -8$, what is the value of $x^2 + 4y^2$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
We see that $(x + 2y)^2 = (x^2 + 4y^2) + 4xy = 4^2 = 16$. We want to find $x^2 + 4y^2$ and are given $xy = -8$. So, $x^2 + 4y^2 + 4xy = x^2 + 4y^2 + 4(-8) = 16$. It follows that $x^2 + 4y^2 = \boxed{48}$. The answer is $\boxed{48}$

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"

**Solution:** 


To find the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we can use the following steps:

1. We know that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ implies that $x - 2y$ and $y - 2x$ have the same absolute value. Therefore, either $x - 2y = y - 2x$ or $x - 2y = -(y - 2x)$.
2. If $x - 2y = y - 2x$, then $3x = 3y$, so $x = y$.
3. If $x - 2y = -(y - 2x)$, then $x - 2y = -y + 2x$, so $x = 2y$.
4. Substituting $x = y$ into $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we get $|x-2x| + |x-2x| = 40$, which simplifies to $|-x| + |-x| = 40$, or $2|x| = 40$, so $|x| = 20$. Therefore, $x = \pm 20$.
5. Substituting $x = 2y$ into $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we get $|2y-2y| + |y-4y| = 40$, which simplifies to $|0| + |-3y| = 40$, or $3|y| = 40$, so $|y| = \frac{40}{3}$. Therefore, $y = \pm \frac{40}{3}$.
6. Since we want to find the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we can substitute $x = y$ into this expression to get $5x^2+5x^2-8x^2 = 2x^2$. The minimum value of $2x^2$ occurs when $x = 0$, so the minimum value is $2(0)^2 = 0$.
7. However, this minimum value occurs when $x = y = 0$, which does not satisfy $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. Therefore, we must substitute $x = 2y$ into $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to get $5(2y)^2 + 5y^2 - 8(2y)(y) = 20y^2 + 5y^2 - 16y^2 = 9y^2$. The minimum value of $9y^2$ occurs when $y = 0$, so the minimum value is $9(0)^2 = 0$.
8. However, this minimum value occurs when $x = y = 0$, which does not satisfy $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. Therefore, we must consider the case when $x = y$ and $x = 2y$ simultaneously. This only happens when $x = y = 0$, which does satisfy $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
9. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $0$.

The minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 0. However, this does not make sense because the original expression is always nonnegative (since it is a sum of squares). The minimum value must be positive.

Let's try a different approach. Notice that $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = (5x^2-8xy+4y^2) + (y^2) = (5x^2-10xy+5y^2) + (3y^2) = (5(x-y)^2) + (3y^2)$. Since $(x-y)^2$ and $y^2$ are both nonnegative, the minimum value of this expression occurs when $(x-y)^2 = 0$ and $y^2 = 0$, which means $x = y = 0$. However, this does not satisfy $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.

Let's try another approach. We can rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $5(x^2-y^2) - 3xy$. Now, let's use the identity $x^2 - y^2 = (x-y)(x+y)$ and $xy = \frac{1}{2}((x+y)^2 - (x^2 - y^2))$. Substituting these into the expression, we get $5((x-y)(x+y)) - 3\left(\frac{1}{2}((x+y)^2 - (x^2 - y^2))\right)$. Expanding and simplifying, we get $\frac{1}{2}((5x+5y)^2 - 13(x^2 - y^2))$. Now, let's use the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. This simplifies to $|x-2y| = |2x-y|$. If $x \geq 2y$, then $x-2y = 2x-y$, so $y = x$. If $x < 2y$, then $x-2y = -(2x-y)$, so $x = y$. Therefore, $x = y$. Substituting $x = y$ into the expression $\frac{1}{2}((5x+5y)^2 - 13(x^2 - y^2))$, we get $\frac{1}{2}((10x)^2 - 13(0)) = 50x^2$. The minimum value of $50x^2$ occurs when $x = 0$, so the minimum value is $50(0)^2 = 0$. However, this does not make sense because the original expression is always nonnegative (since it is a sum of squares). The minimum value must be positive.

Let's try another approach. We can rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $5(x^2-y^2) - 3xy$. Now, let's use the identity $x^2 - y^2 = (x-y)(x+y)$ and $xy = \frac{1}{2}((x+y)^2 - (x^2 - y^2))$. Substituting these into the expression, we get $5((x-y)(x+y)) - 3\left(\frac{1}{2}((x+y)^2 - (x^2 - y^2))\right)$. Expanding and simplifying, we get $\frac{1}{2}((5x+5y)^2 - 13(x^2 - y^2))$. Now, let's use the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. This simplifies to $|x-2y| = |2x-y|$. If $x \geq 2y$, then $x-2y = 2x-y$, so $y = x$. If $x < 2y$, then $x-2y = -(2x-y)$, so $x = y$. Therefore, $x = y$. Substituting $x = y$ into the expression $\frac{1}{2}((5x+5y)^2 - 13(x^2 - y^2))$, we get $\frac{1}{2}((10x)^2 - 13(0)) = 50x^2$. The minimum

Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Rearranging the expression, we have  \[2x^2+8x+3y^2-24y+62\]We first complete the square in $x$. Factoring a 2 from the first two terms of the expression, we get  \[2(x^2+4x)+3y^2-24y+62\]In order for the expression inside the parenthesis to be a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(4/2)^2=4$ inside the parenthesis. Doing this, we have \[2(x^2+4x+4-4)+3y^2-24y+62 \Rightarrow 2(x+2)^2+3y^2-24y+54\]Now we complete the square in $y$.

Doing this, we have \[2(x+2)^2+3(y^2-8y+16-16)+54 \Rightarrow 2(x+2)^2+3(y-4)^2+6\]Since the minimum value of $2(x+2)^2$ and $3(y-4)^2$ is $0$ (perfect squares can never be negative), the minimum value of the entire expression is $\boxed{6}$, and is achieved when $x=-2$ and $y=4$.

**Problem**
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


To solve this problem, we can use the following steps:

1. First, we need to rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $(x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2) + (4y^2 - 8xy + 4x^2) = (x-2y)^2 + (2x-y)^2$.
2. Then, we know that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, which simplifies to $|x-2y| + |x-2y| = 40$, so $|x-2y| = 20$.
3. The minimum value of $(x-2y)^2 + (2x-y)^2$ is 0, which occurs when $x-2y = 0$ and $2x-y = 0$, or $x = 4$ and $y = 2$.
4. Substituting these values into the expression $(x-2y)^2 + (2x-y)^2$, we get $(4-4)^2 + (8-2)^2 = 0 + 36 = 36$.

So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 36.
