**Problem:** 
"What is the minimum value of the expression $2x^2+3y^2+8x-24y+62$ for real $x$ and $y$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Rearranging the expression, we have  \[2x^2+8x+3y^2-24y+62\]We first complete the square in $x$. Factoring a 2 from the first two terms of the expression, we get  \[2(x^2+4x)+3y^2-24y+62\]In order for the expression inside the parenthesis to be a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(4/2)^2=4$ inside the parenthesis. Doing this, we have \[2(x^2+4x+4-4)+3y^2-24y+62 \Rightarrow 2(x+2)^2+3y^2-24y+54\]Now we complete the square in $y$. Factoring a 3 from the $y$ terms in the expression, we get \[2(x+2)^2+3(y^2-8y)+54\]In order for the expression inside the second parenthesis to be a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(8/2)^2=16$ inside the parenthesis. Doing this, we have \[2(x+2)^2+3(y^2-8y+16-16)+54 \Rightarrow 2(x+2)^2+3(y-4)^2+6\]Since the minimum value of $2(x+2)^2$ and $3(y-4)^2$ is $0$ (perfect squares can never be negative), the minimum value of the entire expression is $\boxed{6}$, and is achieved when $x=-2$ and $y=4$. The answer is $\boxed{6}$

**Problem**
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


This problem is a bit tricky to solve directly, but we can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to solve it.

The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states that for any real numbers $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$ and $b_1, b_2, ..., b_n$, we have:
\[(a_1^2 + a_2^2 + ... + a_n^2)(b_1^2 + b_2^2 + ... + b_n^2) \geq (a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 + ... + a_nb_n)^2.\]

Let's apply the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to the given problem. Let $a_1 = x$, $a_2 = y$, $b_1 = 1$, and $b_2 = 1$. Then we have:
\[(x^2 + y^2)(1^2 + 1^2) \geq (x*1 + y*1)^2.\]
Simplifying the inequality gives:
\[(x^2 + y^2)(2) \geq (x + y)^2.\]
Expanding both sides gives:
\[2x^2 + 2y^2 \geq x^2 + 2xy + y^2.\]
Rearranging terms gives:
\[x^2 - 2xy + y^2 \geq 0.\]
This can be rewritten as:
\[(x - y)^2 \geq 0.\]
Since the square of any real number is always non-negative, this inequality holds true.

Now, let's substitute $x - y = a$ and $y - 2x = b$. Then we have:
\[|a| + |b| = 40.\]
By the triangle inequality, we know that $|a| + |b| \geq |a - b|$. So we have:
\[|a - b| \leq |a| + |b| = 40.\]
But we also know that $|a - b| = |x - 2y - (y - 2x)| = |x - 2y - y + 2x| = |3x - 3y| = 3|x - y| = 3|a|$. So we have:
\[3|a| \leq 40.\]
This implies that $|a| \leq \frac{40}{3}$.

Now, let's substitute $x - y = a$ back into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$. We have:
\[5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = 5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x - y)^2 + 2xy] - 8xy = 5[a^2 + 2(x - y)y] - 8xy = 5a^2 + 10ay - 8xy.\]
We want to minimize this expression. By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we know that $a^2 \geq 0$ and $y^2 \geq 0$, so $5a^2 \geq 0$ and $5y^2 \geq 0$. Therefore, the minimum value of $5a^2 + 10ay - 8xy$ is achieved when $a = 0$ and $y = 0$. In this case, the expression becomes $0$.

However, if $a = 0$, then $x = y$. But this contradicts the condition $|a| \leq \frac{40}{3}$. So we must have $y = 0$. Then the condition $|a| \leq \frac{40}{3}$ becomes $|x| \leq \frac{40}{3}$.

Now, let's substitute $y = 0$ into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$. We have:
\[5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = 5x^2 - 8x*0 = 5x^2.\]
We want to minimize this expression under the condition $|x| \leq \frac{40}{3}$. The minimum value of $5x^2$ is achieved when $x = -\frac{40}{3}$ or $x = \frac{40}{3}$. In either case, the minimum value is $5 * \left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{8000}{9}$.

So the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is $\frac{8000}{9}$. The answer is: $\boxed{\frac{8000}{9}}$

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


This problem is a bit tricky to solve directly, but we can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to solve it.

The given expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ can be rewritten as $(x-4y)^2 + (3y)^2$.

The inequality $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|x-4y| + |y-x| = 40$, which simplifies to $|x-4y| + |-y+x| = 40$.

By the triangle inequality, $|x-4y| + |-y+x| \geq |(x-4y) - (-y+x)| = |x-4y + y - x| = |3y| = 40$.

So, we have $|3y| = 40$, which implies $3y = \pm 40$, or $y = \pm \frac{40}{3}$.

Now, substituting $y = \frac{40}{3}$ into the inequality $|x-4y| + |-y+x| = 40$, we get $|x - \frac{160}{3}| + |-\frac{40}{3} + x| = 40$.

By the triangle inequality, $|x - \frac{160}{3}| + |-\frac{40}{3} + x| \geq |(x - \frac{160}{3}) - (-\frac{40}{3} + x)| = |\frac{120}{3}| = 40$.

So, the minimum value of $(x-4y)^2 + (3y)^2$ is achieved when $y = \frac{40}{3}$, and substituting this into the expression gives $(x - \frac{160}{3})^2 + (3 \cdot \frac{40}{3})^2 = (x - \frac{160}{3})^2 + 1600$.

By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, $(x - \frac{160}{3})^2 + 1600 \geq 0$, so the minimum value of $(x-4y)^2 + (3y)^2$ is 0.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0.

**Problem**

**Solution:**


This problem is a bit tricky to solve directly, but we can simplify it by using the fact that $|x-2y| + |y-2x|$ is always equal to $0$. This is because $|x-2y| = |-(y-2x)|$, so the sum of the two absolute values is always equal to $0$. This means that the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is not possible, and there must be a mistake in the problem statement or the conditions given.

However, if we look closely, we can see that the given condition is actually the equation $x - 2y + y - 2x = 40$, which simplifies to $0 = 40$. This is obviously a contradiction, so we must have made a mistake in our reasoning.

Upon revisiting the problem, we realize that we misunderstood the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. The correct interpretation of the condition is that the sum of the absolute values of the differences of $x$ and $2y$, and $y$ and $2x$, is equal to $40$. This is a non-trivial condition and cannot be simplified to $0 = 40$.

So, let's try to solve the problem step by step.

First, we can rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $(x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2) + (4x^2 - 8xy + 4y^2) = (x - 2y)^2 + (2x - y)^2$.

Now, we want to minimize $(x - 2y)^2 + (2x - y)^2$ subject to the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.

Since $(x - 2y)^2 + (2x - y)^2$ is always non-negative, the minimum value is $0$, which occurs when $x - 2y = 0$ and $2x - y = 0$. Solving these equations, we get $x = \frac{4}{3}$ and $y = \frac{2}{3}$.

Substituting these values into the expression $(x - 2y)^2 + (2x - y)^2$, we get $(0)^2 + (0)^2 = 0$. However, this is not possible because the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is not satisfied with these values of $x$ and $y$.

So, we must have made a mistake in our reasoning. Upon revisiting the problem again, we realize that we misunderstood the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. The correct interpretation of the condition is that the sum of the absolute values of the differences of $x$ and $2y$, and $y$ and $2x$, is equal to $40$. This is a non-trivial condition and cannot be simplified to $0 = 40$.

So, let's try to solve the problem step by step.

First, we can rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $(x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2) + (4x^2 - 8xy + 4y^2) = (x - 2y)^2 + (2x - y)^2$.

Now, we want to minimize $(x - 2y)^2 + (2x - y)^2$ subject to the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.

Since $(x - 2y)^2 + (2x - y)^2$ is always non-negative, the minimum value is $0$, which occurs when $x - 2y = 0$ and $2x - y = 0$. Solving these equations, we get $x = \frac{4}{3}$ and $y = \frac{2}{3}$.

Substituting these values into the expression $(x - 2y)^2 + (2x - y)^2$, we get $(0)^2 + (0)^2 = 0$. However, this is not possible because the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is not satisfied with these values of $x$ and $y$.

**Solution:**


This problem is a bit tricky to solve directly. However, we can use the fact that the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ can be rewritten as $(5x-4y)^2 + (5y-4x)^2$. This is a sum of squares, which is always non-negative. Therefore, the minimum value of the expression is 0, which occurs when $5x-4y = 0$ and $5y-4x = 0$, or equivalently, when $x = y$.

Now we need to find the value of $x$ (or $y$) that satisfies the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. Since $x = y$, the condition simplifies to $|x-2x| + |x-2x| = 40$, or $|x| + |-x| = 40$. This simplifies to $2|x| = 40$, so $|x| = 20$. Therefore, $x = 20$ or $x = -20$.

However, we need to check which value of $x$ actually gives the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. By symmetry, it's enough to check $x = 20$. When $x = 20$, we have $y = 20$ (since $x = y$), and the expression becomes $5(20)^2 + 5(20)^2 - 8(20)(20) = 2000$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0 when $x = y$, and this minimum value is achieved when $x = y = 20$. So the minimum value is 2000.

The minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0 when $x = y$, and this minimum value is achieved when $x = y = 20$. However, the value of the expression at $x = y = 20$ is 2000, not 800. It seems we made a mistake in our calculations. Let's retrace our steps and find the mistake.

We found that the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0 when $x = y$. Then we checked the value of the expression when $x = y = 20$. However, we made a mistake in our calculations. Let's correct it.

When $x = y$, the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ simplifies to $10x^2 - 8x^2 = 2x^2$. The minimum value of $2x^2$ is 0, which occurs when $x = 0$. However, when $x = 0$, the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ becomes $|0-2y| + |y-0| = 40$, or $2|y| + |y| = 40$, which simplifies to $3|y| = 40$, so $|y| = \frac{40}{3}$, which is not a real number. Therefore, $x = 0$ is not a valid solution.

Let's try another approach. Since the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ can be rewritten as $(5x-4y)^2 + (5y-4x)^2$, the minimum value of this expression is 0, which occurs when $5x-4y = 0$ and $5y-4x = 0$, or equivalently, when $x = y$.

Now we need to find the value of $x$ (or $y$) that satisfies the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. Since $x = y$, the condition simplifies to $|x-2x| + |x-2x| = 40$, or $|x| + |-x| = 40$. This simplifies to $2|x| = 40$, so $|x| = 20$. Therefore, $x = 20$ or $x = -20$.

However, we need to check which value of $x$ actually gives the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. By symmetry, it's enough to check $x = 20$. When $x = 20$, we have $y = 20$ (since $x = y$), and the expression becomes $5(20)^2 + 5(20)^2 - 8(20)(20) = 2000$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0 when $x = y$, and this minimum value is achieved when $x = y = 20$. So the minimum value is 2000.

However, when $x = 0$, the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ becomes $|0-2y| + |y-0| = 40$, or $2|y| + |y| = 40$, which simplifies to $3|y| = 40$, so $|y| = \frac{40}{3}$, which is not a real number. Therefore, $x = 0$ is not a valid solution.

Let's try another approach. Since the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ can be rewritten as $(5x-4y)^2 + (5y-4x)^2$, the minimum value of this expression is 0, which occurs when $5x-

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"What is the minimum value of the expression $x^2+y^2+2x-4y+8$ for real $x$ and $y$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Rearranging the expression, we have  \[x^2+2x+y^2-4y+8\]Completing the square in $x$, we need to add and subtract $(2/2)^2=1$. Completing the square in $y$, we need to add and subtract $(4/2)^2=4$. Thus, we have \[(x^2+2x+1)-1+(y^2-4y+4)-4+8 \Rightarrow (x+1)^2+(y-2)^2+3\]Since the minimum value of $(x+1)^2$ and $(y-2)^2$ is $0$ (perfect squares can never be negative), the minimum value of the entire expression is $\boxed{3}$, and is achieved when $x=-1$ and $y=2$. The answer is $\boxed{3}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solve, simplify

def minimum_value():
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # Define the expression and the condition
    expr = 5*x**2 + 5*y**2 - 8*x*y
    condition = abs(x - 2*y) + abs(y - 2*x) - 40

    # Solve the condition for y
    y_sol = solve(condition, y)[0]

    # Substitute y in the expression
    expr_subs = expr.subs(y, y_sol)

    # Find the derivative of the expression
    derivative = expr_subs.diff(x)

    # Solve the derivative equal to zero to find the minimum
    x_min = solve(derivative, x)[0]

    # Substitute x_min in the expression
    min_value = expr_subs.subs(x, x_min)

    # Simplify the minimum value
    min_value = simplify(min_value)

    return min_value

result = minimum_value()
print(result)
```
