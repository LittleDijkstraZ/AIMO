**Problem:** 
"How many square units are in the area of the triangle whose vertices are the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the curve $y = (x-3)^2 (x+2)$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we need to find where this curve intersects the $x$ and $y$ axes.  If $y=0$, then $(x-3)^2(x+2)=0$, which has solutions of $x=3$ and $x=-2$.  If $x=0$, then $y=(-3)^2(2)=18$.  So, the curve has two $x$-intercepts and one $y$-intercept.  The length of the base along the $x$-axis is $3-(-2)=5$.  The height from this base is equal to the $y$-intercept, 18.  The area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 5\cdot 18=\boxed{45}$. The answer is $\boxed{45}$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


This problem is a bit tricky to solve directly using sympy. However, we can solve it by analyzing the conditions given in the problem.

The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if both of its factors are equal to zero. 

The first factor is equal to zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the four lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(8, 2)$, $(8, -12)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -12)$.

The second factor is equal to zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations, we get the four lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The intersection of these two rectangles is a square with side length 16 and vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"An ellipse is defined parametrically by
\[(x,y) = \left( \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t}, \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t} \right).\]Then the equation of the ellipse can be written in the form
\[Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0,\]where $A,$ $B,$ $C,$ $D,$ $E,$ and $F$ are integers, and $\gcd(|A|,|B|,|C|,|D|,|E|,|F|) = 1.$  Find $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F|.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
In the equation $y = \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\cos t$ to get
\[\cos t = \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3}.\]In the equation $x = \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\sin t$ to get
\[\sin t = \frac{1}{2} x (2 - \cos t) + 1 = \frac{1}{2} x \left( 2 - \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right) + 1 = 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)}.\]Since $\cos^2 t + \sin^2 t = 1,$
\[\left( \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right)^2 + \left( 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)} \right)^2 = 1.\]Multiplying both sides by $(2(y + 3))^2$ and expanding, it will simplify to
\[81x^2 - 36xy + 16y^2 - 108x + 240y + 900 = 0.\]Therefore, $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F| = 81 + 36 + 16 + 108 + 240 + 900 = \boxed{1381}.$ The answer is $\boxed{1381}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This is only possible when $x = y = \pm 10$ or $x = -y = \pm 10$.

Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This is only possible when $x = y = \pm 8$ or $x = -y = \pm 8$.

The points that satisfy both equations are $(\pm 10, \pm 10)$ and $(\pm 8, \pm 8)$. These points form a square with side length $20$. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $400$.

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


First, we need to understand the given equation: $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. This equation is equivalent to the product of two terms being zero, which means either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.

The first term being zero gives us $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This forms a square with side length 20, so its area is $20^2 = 400$.

The second term being zero gives us $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This forms a square with side length 16, so its area is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the total area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of these two squares, which is $400 + 256 = 656$.

```python

def calculate_area():

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. This gives us two systems of equations to solve:

1. $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x| - 8 = 0$ and $|x - y| - 10 = 0$ and $|y| - 8 = 0$
2. $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x| - 8 = 0$ and $|x - y| - 10 = 0$ and $|y| - 8 = 0$

The solutions to these systems of equations are the vertices of the polygon. The polygon is a square with side length 16 (from $|x| - 8 = 0$ and $|y| - 8 = 0$).

The area of the square is the square of the side length, so the area is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256.

The answer is: $256$

**Solution:**


The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

The first term is zero when $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x - y| - 10 = 0$. These equations simplify to $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(0, 10)$, $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, and $(0, -10)$.

The second term is zero when $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$. These equations simplify to $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, $(0, -8)$, and $(-8, 0)$.

The intersection of the two rectangles is the convex polygon enclosed by the points that satisfy the given equation. This polygon is a square with side length 10 (the distance between the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$, or $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$).

The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units. The answer is: 100

This problem involves understanding the properties of absolute values and the concept of a polygon. The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero, which means that either one of the expressions must be zero. We will consider each case separately.

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$: This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$. These are two lines in the plane.

2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$: This implies that $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$. These are also two lines in the plane.

3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$: This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = 8$ or $x = -8$. These are two vertical lines in the plane.

4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$: This implies that $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. These are two horizontal lines in the plane.

The intersection of these lines will form a rectangle with vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$. The area of this rectangle is $16 \times 16 = 256$. So, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units.
