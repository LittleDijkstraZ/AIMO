**Problem:** 
"The function $f$ is defined on the set of integers and satisfies \[f(n)= \begin{cases}  n-3 & \mbox{if }n\ge 1000 \\  f(f(n+5)) & \mbox{if }n<1000. \end{cases}\]Find $f(84)$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Denote by (1) and (2) the two parts of the definition of $f$, respectively. If we begin to use the definition of $f$ to compute $f(84)$, we use (2) until the argument is at least $1000$: \[f(84) = f(f(89)) = f(f(f(94))) = \dots = f^N(1004)\](where $f^N$ denotes composing $f$ with itself $N$ times, for some $N$). The numbers $84, 89, 94, \dots, 1004$ form an arithmetic sequence with common difference $5$; since $1004 - 84 = 920 = 184 \cdot 5$, this sequence has $184 + 1 = 185$ terms, so $N = 185$.

At this point, (1) and (2) are both used: we compute \[\begin{aligned} f^N(1004) &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-1}(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-1}(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(1000) \\ &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(997) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1002) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(999) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1004). \end{aligned}\]Repeating this process, we see that \[f^N(1004) = f^{N-2}(1004) = f^{N-4}(1004) = \dots = f^3(1004).\](The pattern breaks down for $f^k(1004)$ when $k$ is small, so it is not true that $f^3(1004) = f(1004)$.) Now, we have \[f^3(1004) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^2(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^2(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(1000) \stackrel{(1)}{=} \boxed{997}.\] The answer is $\boxed{997}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



To solve this problem, we will first set up the function $f(n)$ using the given conditions. Then we will use this function to calculate $f(100)$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

def calculate_f():
    # Define the function f(n)
    n = symbols('n')
    f_n = symbols('f_n')

    # From the condition f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7, we get f(f(f(n))) - 8n + 7 = 0
    equation1 = Eq(f_n - 8*n + 7, 0)

    # From the condition f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1, we get f(2n) - 2f(n) - 1 = 0
    equation2 = Eq(f_n.subs(n, 2*n) - 2*f_n - 1, 0)

    # Solve the system of equations
    solution = solve((equation1, equation2), (f_n, n))

    # The solution is a list of tuples, we only need the first tuple
    f_n_solution = solution[0][0]

    # Now we can calculate f(100) by substituting n = 100 into the function f(n)
    f_100 = f_n_solution.subs(n, 100)

    return f_100

result = calculate_f()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS Traceback: line 22, in calculate_f
    f_n_solution = solution[0][0]
KeyError: 0

FAIL


INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
Traceback: line 22, in calculate_f
    f_n_solution = solution[0][0]

```

The error in the code above is due to the fact that we have not correctly defined the function $f(n)$. The function $f(n)$ is defined by the system of equations, and we need to solve this system to get the correct expression for $f(n)$.

Let's try to solve the system of equations again.

```python

    # Define the function f(n)
    n, f_n = symbols('n f_n')

    # From the condition f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7, we get f(f(f(n))) - 8n + 7 = 0
    equation1 = Eq(f_n.subs(n, f_n) - 8*n + 7, 0)

    # From the condition f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1, we get f(2n) - 2f(n) - 1 = 0
    equation2 = Eq(f_n.subs(n, 2*n) - 2*f_n - 1, 0)

    # Solve the system of equations
    solution = solve((equation1, equation2), (f_n, n))

    # The solution is a list of tuples, we only need the first tuple
    f_n_solution = solution[0][0]

    # Now we can calculate f(100) by substituting n = 100 into the function f(n)
    f_100 = f_n_solution.subs(n, 100)

    return f_100

result = calculate_f()
print(result)
```

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"The function $f$ is defined on the set of integers and satisfies \[f(n)= \begin{cases}  n-3 & \mbox{if }n\ge 1000 \\  f(f(n+5)) & \mbox{if }n<1000. \end{cases}\]Find $f(84)$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Denote by (1) and (2) the two parts of the definition of $f$, respectively. If we begin to use the definition of $f$ to compute $f(84)$, we use (2) until the argument is at least $1000$: \[f(84) = f(f(89)) = f(f(f(94))) = \dots = f^N(1004)\](where $f^N$ denotes composing $f$ with itself $N$ times, for some $N$). The numbers $84, 89, 94, \dots, 1004$ form an arithmetic sequence with common difference $5$; since $1004 - 84 = 920 = 184 \cdot 5$, this sequence has $184 + 1 = 185$ terms, so $N = 185$.

At this point, (1) and (2) are both used: we compute \[\begin{aligned} f^N(1004) &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-1}(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-1}(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(1000) \\ &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(997) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1002) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(999) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1004). \end{aligned}\]Repeating this process, we see that \[f^N(1004) = f^{N-2}(1004) = f^{N-4}(1004) = \dots = f^3(1004).\](The pattern breaks down for $f^k(1004)$ when $k$ is small, so it is not true that $f^3(1004) = f(1004)$.) Now, we have \[f^3(1004) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^2(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^2(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(1000) \stackrel{(1)}{=} \boxed{997}.\] The answer is $\boxed{997}$

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


To solve this problem, we can use the second condition to find $f(100)$.
From the second condition, we have $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$.
Then, we can use the first condition to find $f(f(f(100)))$.
We know that $f(f(f(100))) = 8 \cdot 100 - 7 = 793$.
So, we have $f(f(f(100))) = f(200) = 793$.
Then, we can use the second condition again to find $f(100)$.
We have $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$, so $793 = 2f(100) + 1$.
Solving for $f(100)$, we get $f(100) = \frac{793 - 1}{2} = 396$.
Therefore, $f(100) = 396$.
The answer is $\boxed{396}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. Let's set $n=1$, then we have $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$. So $f(f(1))=1$.
2. We also know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Let's set $n=1$, then we have $f(2)=2f(1)+1$. Since $f(f(1))=1$, we have $f(2)=2*1+1=3$.
3. Now let's set $n=2$ in the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we have $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2*3+1=7$.
4. Now let's set $n=4$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we have $f(f(f(4)))=8*4-7=25$. Since $f(f(4))=7$, we have $f(7)=25$.
5. Now let's set $n=7$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we have $f(f(f(7)))=8*7-7=51$. Since $f(f(7))=25$, we have $f(25)=51$.
6. Now let's set $n=25$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we have $f(f(f(25)))=8*25-7=193$. Since $f(f(25))=51$, we have $f(51)=193$.
7. Now let's set $n=51$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we have $f(f(f(51)))=8*51-7=401$. Since $f(f(51))=193$, we have $f(193)=401$.
8. Now let's set $n=193$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we have $f(f(f(193)))=8*193-7=1531$. Since $f(f(193))=401$, we have $f(401)=1531$.
9. Now let's set $n=401$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we have $f(f(f(401)))=8*401-7=3201$. Since $f(f(401))=1531$, we have $f(1531)=3201$.
10. Now let's set $n=1531$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we have $f(f(f(1531)))=8*1531-7=12239$. Since $f(f(1531))=3201$, we have $f(3201)=12239$.
11. Now let's set $n=3201$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we have $f(f(f(3201)))=8*3201-7=25601$. Since $f(f(3201))=12239$, we have $f(12239)=25601$.

14. Now let's set $n=97911$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we have $f(f(f(97911)))=8*97911-7=783281$. Since $f(f(97911))=204801$, we have $f(204801)=783281$.
15. Now let's set $n=204801$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we have $f(f(f(204801)))=8*204801-7=1638401$. Since $f(f(204801))=783281$, we have $f(783281)=1638401$.
16. Now let's set $n=783281$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we have $f(f(f(783281)))=8*783281-7=6266241$. Since $f(f(783281))=1638401$, we have $f(1638401)=6266241$.
17. Now let's set $n=1638401$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we have $f(f(f(1638401)))=8*1638401-7=13107201$. Since $f(f(1638401))=6266241$, we have $f(6266241)=13107201$.
18. Now let's set $n=6266241$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we have $f(f(f(6266241)))=8*6266241-7=50120961$. Since $f(f(6266241))=13107201$, we have $f(13107201)=50120961$.

2. We also know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Let's set $n=1$, then we have $f(2)=2f(1)+1$. Since $f(f(1))=1$, we can substitute $f(1)$ with $1$ in the equation, then we have $f(2)=2*1+1=3$.
3. Now let's set $n=2$ in the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, then we have $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2*3+1=7$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"The function $f$ is defined on the set of integers and satisfies \[f(n)= \begin{cases}  n-3 & \mbox{if }n\ge 1000 \\  f(f(n+5)) & \mbox{if }n<1000. \end{cases}\]Find $f(84)$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Denote by (1) and (2) the two parts of the definition of $f$, respectively. If we begin to use the definition of $f$ to compute $f(84)$, we use (2) until the argument is at least $1000$: \[f(84) = f(f(89)) = f(f(f(94))) = \dots = f^N(1004)\](where $f^N$ denotes composing $f$ with itself $N$ times, for some $N$). The numbers $84, 89, 94, \dots, 1004$ form an arithmetic sequence with common difference $5$; since $1004 - 84 = 920 = 184 \cdot 5$, this sequence has $184 + 1 = 185$ terms, so $N = 185$.

At this point, (1) and (2) are both used: we compute \[\begin{aligned} f^N(1004) &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-1}(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-1}(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(1000) \\ &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(997) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1002) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(999) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1004). \end{aligned}\]Repeating this process, we see that \[f^N(1004) = f^{N-2}(1004) = f^{N-4}(1004) = \dots = f^3(1004).\](The pattern breaks down for $f^k(1004)$ when $k$ is small, so it is not true that $f^3(1004) = f(1004)$.) Now, we have \[f^3(1004) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^2(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^2(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(1000) \stackrel{(1)}{=} \boxed{997}.\] The answer is $\boxed{997}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
**Problem**
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


To solve this problem, we can use the second condition to find the value of $f(100)$.

First, we can find the value of $f(50)$ using the second condition: $f(2 \cdot 50) = 2f(50) + 1$.

Then, we can substitute $f(50)$ into the first condition to find the value of $f(f(50)) = f(f(f(100)))$.

Finally, we can substitute $f(f(50))$ into the first condition to find the value of $f(100)$.

Let's start by finding the value of $f(50)$:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

def find_f_50():
    f_50 = symbols('f_50')
    equation = Eq(2 * f_50 + 1, 8 * 50 - 7)
    solution = solve(equation, f_50)[0]
    return solution

f_50 = find_f_50()
print(f_50)
```

CODE RESULTS 196

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
196
```
So, $f(50) = 196$.

Now, let's find the value of $f(f(50)) = f(f(f(100)))$:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def find_f_f_50():
    f_f_50 = symbols('f_f_50')
    equation = Eq(f_f_50, 8 * 50 - 7)
    solution = solve(equation, f_f_50)[0]
    return solution

f_f_50 = find_f_f_50()
print(f_f_50)
```

CODE RESULTS 393

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
393
```
So, $f(f(50)) = f(f(f(100))) = 393$.

Finally, let's find the value of $f(100)$:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def find_f_100():
    f_100 = symbols('f_100')
    equation = Eq(f_100, 8 * 50 - 7 - 1)
    solution = solve(equation, f_100)[0]
    return solution

f_100 = find_f_100()
print(f_100)
``````output

CODE RESULTS 392

INTERMEDIATE OUT :

392
```
So, $f(100) = 392$.

Therefore, the value of $f(100)$ is $392$. The answer is: $392$

**Problem:** 
"The function $f(n)$ is defined on the positive integers such that $f(f(n)) = 2n$ and $f(4n + 1) = 4n + 3$ for all positive integers $n.$  Find $f(1000).$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Consider the expression $f(f(f(a))).$  Since $f(f(a)) = 2a,$ this is equal to $f(2a).$  But taking $n = f(a)$ in $f(f(n)) = 2n,$ we get
\[f(f(f(a))) = 2f(a).\]Hence,
\[f(2a) = 2f(a)\]for all positive integers $a.$

Then
\[f(1000) = 2f(500) = 4f(250) = 8f(125).\]Taking $n = 31$ in $f(4n + 1) = 4n + 3,$ we get
\[f(125) = 127,\]so $f(1000) = \boxed{1016}.$ The answer is $\boxed{1016}$

To solve this problem, we will first set up the function $f$ using sympy. Then we will use the given conditions to find the value of $f(100)$.

```

The above code fails because we are trying to substitute `n = 100` into the equation `f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7` and `f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1` without first solving for `f(n)` in terms of `n`. This is a circular reference, as we are trying to find `f(n)` and substitute `n = 100` into the equation before we have found `f(n)` in terms of `n`.

Let's try a different approach. We know that `f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7` and `f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1`. We can use these equations to find `f(100)` by first finding `f(50)` and then `f(25)`, and so on.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def find_f_of_100():
    # Initialize f(1)

    f_50 = 2 * f_25 + 1

The above code fails because we are trying to access the first element of a list that is empty. This is because the equations we have defined are not sufficient to uniquely determine the function $f$. We need to make some additional assumptions or use more information about the function to proceed.

However, we can notice that the function $f$ is defined recursively in the problem statement. This suggests that we might be able to use the recursive definition to find $f(100)$.

Let's try to find $f(100)$ using the recursive definition:

From the second equation, we have $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. Let's substitute $n = 50$ to get $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.

Now, let's substitute $n = 25$ into the second equation to get $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.

Continuing this process, we can keep substituting smaller values of $n$ until we reach a value that we can easily find. For example, if we substitute $n = 1$ into the second equation, we get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.

Now, we need more information about the function $f$ to find the value of $f(1)$. However, we can make an assumption that $f(1) = 1$ (this is a reasonable assumption based on the recursive definition of $f$).

Using this assumption, we can now find $f(2) = 2*1 + 1 = 3$.

Continuing this process, we can find $f(50) = 2*3 + 1 = 7$, and finally $f(100) = 2*7 + 1 = 15$.

So, the value of $f(100)$ is 15.

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{15}$.

**Problem**
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we can start by calculating the value of $f(1)$ using the second condition $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. Setting $n = 1$, we get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. But we also know from the first condition that $f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = 1$, so $f(f(1)) = 1$. Again using the second condition, we get $f(2f(1)) = 2f(f(1)) + 1 = 3$. Setting $n = f(1)$ in the second condition, we get $f(2f(1)) = 2f(f(1)) + 1 = 3$. Therefore, $2f(f(1)) + 1 = 3$, which implies $2f(1) + 1 = 3$. Solving for $f(1)$, we get $f(1) = 1$.
Now that we know $f(1) = 1$, we can use the second condition to find $f(2)$: $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2*1 + 1 = 3$.
Continuing this process, we can find $f(3)$, $f(4)$, and so on. We find that $f(1) = 1$, $f(2) = 3$, $f(3) = 5$, $f(4) = 7$, and so on. It appears that $f(n) = 2n - 1$ for all positive integers $n$.
To confirm this, we can substitute $f(n) = 2n - 1$ into the first condition $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. We get $f(f(f(n))) = f(f(2n - 1)) = f(2(2n - 1) - 1) = f(4n - 3) = 2(4n - 3) - 1 = 8n - 7$. This confirms that $f(n) = 2n - 1$ is the correct function.
Finally, we can calculate $f(100)$ by substituting $n = 100$ into $f(n) = 2n - 1$: $f(100) = 2*100 - 1 = 199$.
The value of $f(100)$ is $199$. The answer is: $199$

## QUESTION 4 - 10

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"The function $f$ is defined on the set of integers and satisfies \[f(n)= \begin{cases}  n-3 & \mbox{if }n\ge 1000 \\  f(f(n+5)) & \mbox{if }n<1000. \end{cases}\]Find $f(84)$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Denote by (1) and (2) the two parts of the definition of $f$, respectively. If we begin to use the definition of $f$ to compute $f(84)$, we use (2) until the argument is at least $1000$: \[f(84) = f(f(89)) = f(f(f(94))) = \dots = f^N(1004)\](where $f^N$ denotes composing $f$ with itself $N$ times, for some $N$). The numbers $84, 89, 94, \dots, 1004$ form an arithmetic sequence with common difference $5$; since $1004 - 84 = 920 = 184 \cdot 5$, this sequence has $184 + 1 = 185$ terms, so $N = 185$.

At this point, (1) and (2) are both used: we compute \[\begin{aligned} f^N(1004) &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-1}(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-1}(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(1000) \\ &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(997) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1002) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(999) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1004). \end{aligned}\]Repeating this process, we see that \[f^N(1004) = f^{N-2}(1004) = f^{N-4}(1004) = \dots = f^3(1004).\](The pattern breaks down for $f^k(1004)$ when $k$ is small, so it is not true that $f^3(1004) = f(1004)$.) Now, we have \[f^3(1004) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^2(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^2(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(1000) \stackrel{(1)}{=} \boxed{997}.\] The answer is $\boxed{997}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
**Problem**
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


To solve this problem, we can use the second condition $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to find the value of $f(100)$.

First, we can find the value of $f(50)$ using the second condition: $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.

Next, we can find the value of $f(25)$ using the second condition: $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.

We can continue this process until we reach the base case of $f(1)$, which is given by the first condition: $f(f(f(1))) = 8 - 7 = 1$.

From this, we can find the value of $f(2)$, $f(4)$, $f(8)$, and so on, until we reach $f(25)$.

After finding the value of $f(25)$, we can substitute it back into the equation $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$ to find the value of $f(50)$.

Finally, we can substitute the values of $f(50)$ and $f(25)$ into the equation $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$ to find the value of $f(100)$.

Here is a Python function that calculates $f(100)$:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def calculate_f_100():
    # Base case
    f_1 = 1

    # Calculate f(2), f(4), ..., f(25)

        f_i = 2 * f_1 + 1
        f_1 = f_i

    # Calculate f(50)
    f_50 = 2 * f_25 + 1

    # Calculate f(100)
    f_100 = 2 * f_50 + 1

    return f_100

result = calculate_f_100()
print(result)
```

The code above is incorrect because it does not define the variable `f_25`. Let's correct this and re-run the code.

```python

        f_1 = f_i

    # Calculate f(50)
    f_50 = 2 * f_25 + 1

    # Calculate f(100)
    f_100 = 2 * f_50 + 1

    return f_100

result = calculate_f_100()

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. Let's set $n=1$, then we have $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$. So $f(f(1))=1$.
2. We also know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Let's set $n=1$, then we have $f(2)=2f(1)+1$. Since $f(f(1))=1$, we have $f(2)=2*1+1=3$.
3. Now let's set $n=2$ in the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we have $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2*3+1=7$.
4. Now let's set $n=4$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we have $f(f(f(4)))=8*4-7=25$. Since $f(f(4))=7$, we have $f(7)=25$.
5. Now let's set $n=7$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we have $f(f(f(7)))=8*7-7=51$. Since $f(f(7))=25$, we have $f(25)=51$.
6. Now let's set $n=25$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we have $f(f(f(25)))=8*25-7=193$. Since $f(f(25))=51$, we have $f(51)=193$.
7. Now let's set $n=51$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we have $f(f(f(51)))=8*51-7=401$. Since $f(f(51))=193$, we have $f(193)=401$.
8. Now let's set $n=193$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we have $f(f(f(193)))=8*193-7=1531$. Since $f(f(193))=401$, we have $f(401)=1531$.
9. Now let's set $n=401$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we have $f(f(f(401)))=8*401-7=3201$. Since $f(f(401))=1531$, we have $f(1531)=3201$.
10. Now let's set $n=1531$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we have $f(f(f(1531)))=8*1531-7=12239$. Since $f(f(1531))=3201$, we have $f(3201)=12239$.
11. Now let's set $n=3201$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we have $f(f(f(3201)))=8*3201-7=25601$. Since $f(f(3201))=12239$, we have $f(12239)=25601$.
12. Now let's set $n=12239$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we have $f(f(f(12239)))=8*12239-7=97911$. Since $f(f(12239))=25601$, we have $f(25601)=97911$.
13. Now let's set $n=25601$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we have $f(f(f(25601)))=8*25601-7=204801$. Since $f(f(25601))=97911$, we have $f(97911)=204801$.
14. Now let's set $n=97911$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we have $f(f(f(97911)))=8*97911-7=783281$. Since $f(f(97911))=204801$, we have $f(204801)=783281$.
15. Now let's set $n=204801$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we have $f(f(f(204801)))=8*204801-7=1638401$. Since $f(f(204801))=783281$, we have $f(783281)=1638401$.
16. Now let's set $n=783281$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we have $f(f(f(783281)))=8*783281-7=6266241$. Since $f(f(783281))=1638401$, we have $f(1638401)=6266241$.
17. Now let's set $n=1638401$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we have $f(f(f(1638401)))=8*1638401-7=13107201$. Since $f(f(1638401))=6266241$, we have $f(6266241)=13107201$.
18. Now let's set $n=6266241$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we have $f(f(f(6266241)))=8*6266241-7=50120961$. Since $f(f(6266241))=13107201$, we have $f(13107201)=50120961$.
19. Now let's set $n=13107201$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we have $f(f(f(13107201)))=8*13107201-7=104857601$. Since $f(f(13107201))=50120961$, we have $f(50120961)=104857601$.
20. Now let's set $n=50120961$ in

## QUESTION 4 - 12 
- TIME_SPENT : 571 secs

12_
**Example**

**Problem:** 
"The function $f(n)$ is defined on the positive integers such that $f(f(n)) = 2n$ and $f(4n + 1) = 4n + 3$ for all positive integers $n.$  Find $f(1000).$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Consider the expression $f(f(f(a))).$  Since $f(f(a)) = 2a,$ this is equal to $f(2a).$  But taking $n = f(a)$ in $f(f(n)) = 2n,$ we get
\[f(f(f(a))) = 2f(a).\]Hence,
\[f(2a) = 2f(a)\]for all positive integers $a.$

Then
\[f(1000) = 2f(500) = 4f(250) = 8f(125).\]Taking $n = 31$ in $f(4n + 1) = 4n + 3,$ we get
\[f(125) = 127,\]so $f(1000) = \boxed{1016}.$ The answer is $\boxed{1016}$

**Problem**
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."

**Solution:** 



To find $f(100)$, we can use the second condition $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ repeatedly to get a value for $f(100)$.

First, we can find $f(50)$ by setting $n = 25$:
\[f(50) = 2f(25) + 1.\]
Then, we can find $f(25)$ by setting $n = 12.5$:
\[f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1.\]
But $12.5$ is not a positive integer, so we cannot use the second condition directly. However, we can use the first condition $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$ to find $f(12.5)$. Setting $n = 1$, we get
\[f(f(f(1))) = 8(1) - 7 = 1.\]
Since $f(f(f(1))) = 1$, we have $f(1) = f(f(f(1))) = 1$. Then,
\[f(12.5) = f(f(f(1))) = 1.\]
So,
\[f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1 = 2(1) + 1 = 3.\]
Then,
\[f(50) = 2f(25) + 1 = 2(3) + 1 = 7.\]
Finally,
\[f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2(7) + 1 = 15.\]
So, $f(100) = 15$. The answer is $\boxed{15}$.
