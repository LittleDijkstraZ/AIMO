**Problem:** 
"How many solutions does the equation \[\frac{(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)\dotsm(x-100)}{(x-1^2)(x-2^2)(x-3^2)\dotsm(x-100^2)} = 0\]have for $x$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Any solution to this equation must make the numerator of the left-hand side zero, while keeping the denominator non-zero. The numerator is zero when $x$ is one of the numbers $1, 2, 3, \dots, 100.$ However, for any value in this list that is a perfect square, the denominator will also be zero, so that value of $x$ will not be a root. Therefore, we want to find the number of integers in the list $1, 2, \dots, 100$ which are not perfect squares. The perfect squares in the list are $1^2, 2^2, \dots, 10^2,$ so there are $10$ perfect squares, and \[100 - 10 = \boxed{90}\]integers which are not perfect squares. The answer is $\boxed{90}$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many distinct solutions are there to the equation $|x-7| = |x+1|$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
If $|x-7| = |x+1|$, then either $x-7 = x+1$ or $x-7 = -(x+1)$.  Simplifying $x-7=x+1$ gives $0=8$, which has no solutions, so no values of $x$ satisfy $x-7 = x+1$.  If $x-7 = -(x+1)$, then $x-7 = -x-1$, so $2x = 6$, which gives $x=3$.  So, there is $\boxed{1}$ solution.

Challenge: See if you can find a quick solution to this problem by simply thinking about the graphs of $y=|x-7|$ and $y=|x+1|$. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


This problem is a bit tricky and requires a bit of thinking. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have four distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. This is because the graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ will have a shape of a "V" with the maximum value at 2. So, we need to solve the equation $\frac{m}{100} = 2$ to find the value of $m$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

def find_m():
    m = symbols('m')
    equation = Eq(m/100, 2)
    solution = solve(equation, m)
    return solution[0]

result = find_m()
print(result)
```

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output

```
The value of $m$ that makes the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have four distinct solutions is $200$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy this condition is $1$. The answer is: $1$

Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. To solve this problem, we need to find the range of $m$ that makes the equation have $4$ distinct solutions.

First, we can rewrite the equation as $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. The right side of the equation is always positive, so the absolute value of the left side must be equal to a positive number. This means that $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert > 0$.

The expression $\vert x-1 \vert -2$ can be greater than zero in two cases:
1. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 > 0$, which simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert > 2$. This gives us two sub-cases: $x-1 > 2$ or $x-1 < -2$, which simplifies to $x > 3$ or $x < -1$.
2. $-\vert x-1 \vert -2 > 0$, which simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert < -2$. However, the absolute value of a number cannot be negative, so this case is not possible.

So, the equation has $4$ distinct solutions when $x > 3$ or $x < -1$. The absolute value of the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be equal to the difference between the absolute value of $x-1$ and $2$. Therefore, we have $\frac{m}{100} = \vert x-1 \vert - 2$.

To find the range of $m$, we need to find the range of $\vert x-1 \vert - 2$. When $x > 3$, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = x-1$, so $\frac{m}{100} = x-1 - 2 = x-3$. The minimum value of $x$ is $3$, so the minimum value of $\frac{m}{100}$ is $0$. The maximum value of $x$ is unbounded, so the maximum value of $\frac{m}{100}$ is also unbounded. Therefore, the range of $\frac{m}{100}$ when $x > 3$ is $[0, +\infty)$.

Similarly, when $x < -1$, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = 1-x$, so $\frac{m}{100} = 1-x - 2 = -x-1$. The minimum value of $x$ is $-\infty$, so the minimum value of $\frac{m}{100}$ is $-1$. The maximum value of $x$ is $-1$, so the maximum value of $\frac{m}{100}$ is $0$. Therefore, the range of $\frac{m}{100}$ when $x < -1$ is $(-\infty, 0]$.

Combining the two cases, the range of $\frac{m}{100}$ is $(-\infty, 0] \cup [0, +\infty)$, which is the set of all real numbers except for positive numbers. Therefore, the range of $m$ is $(0, +\infty)$.

However, $m$ is a positive integer, so the range of $m$ is the set of all positive integers. So, there are infinitely many positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions.

However, we are asked to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation has $4$ distinct solutions. Since there are infinitely many positive integers in the range of $m$, the question seems to be flawed. Let's re-examine the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions when the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, is greater than $2$ and less than $3$. This gives us $2 < \frac{m}{100} < 3$, or $200 < m < 300$. The positive integers in this range are $201, 202, \dots, 299$, which is a total of $100$ positive integers.

Therefore, there are $100$ positive integers $m$ such that the equation has $4$ distinct solutions. The answer is $\boxed{100}$.

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. 

The function `count_solutions` will be used to solve this problem. It takes a parameter `m` and returns the number of distinct solutions of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.

The main part of the script will be a loop that iterates over the positive integers from $1$ to $100$, and calls the `count_solutions` function for each value of `m`. It keeps track of the number of times the function returns $4$ distinct solutions, and finally prints the result.

Here is the entire script:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solve

def count_solutions(m):
    x = symbols('x')
    equation = abs(abs(x - 1) - 2) - m / 100
    solutions = solve(equation, x)
    return len(solutions)

count = 0
for m in range(1, 101):
    if count_solutions(m) == 4:
        count += 1

print(count)
```

CODE RESULTS 100

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
100
```
The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $100$. However, this does not mean that all of these values of $m$ will give $4$ distinct solutions. We need to find the values of $m$ that actually give $4$ distinct solutions.

We can do this by looping over the range $1$ to $100$ and checking for each value of $m$ if the equation has $4$ distinct solutions. We can keep track of the values of $m$ that give $4$ solutions in a list called `valid_m_values`.

Finally, we can print the list `valid_m_values` to see the values of $m$ that give $4$ distinct solutions.

Here is the entire script:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solve

def count_solutions(m):
    x = symbols('x')
    equation = abs(abs(x - 1) - 2) - m / 100
    solutions = solve(equation, x)
    return len(solutions)

valid_m_values = []
for m in range(1, 101):
    if count_solutions(m) == 4:
        valid_m_values.append(m)

print(valid_m_values)
```

CODE RESULTS ['']

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output

```
The script is not producing any output, which means there is a mistake in the script. The mistake is in the function `count_solutions` where we are trying to solve the equation `abs(abs(x - 1) - 2) - m / 100 = 0` and then finding the length of the solutions list. This is not the correct approach because the equation `abs(abs(x - 1) - 2) = m / 100` has $4$ distinct solutions for some values of $m$, and has no solutions for other values of $m$. We need to find the values of $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions.

The correct approach is to find the values of $x$ that satisfy the equation `abs(abs(x - 1) - 2) = m / 100` and then count the number of distinct solutions. We can do this by looping over the range $1$ to $100$ and checking for each value of $m$ if the equation has $4$ distinct solutions. We can keep track of the values of $m$ that give $4$ solutions in a list called `valid_m_values`.

valid_m_values = []

        valid_m_values.append(m)

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. The number of solutions of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=k$ (where $k$ is a nonnegative real number) depends on the value of $k$. Specifically, the equation has 4 solutions when $k=1$. Therefore, we need $\frac{m}{100}=1$, which implies $m=100$.

So the positive integer $m$ that makes the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have 4 distinct solutions is $100$.
The answer is: $100$
