**Problem:** 
"Let $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_ 2= (-16,2).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that
\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as
\[\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1.\]Find $h + k + a + b.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.

The first term is zero when $|\pm x \pm y - 10| = 0$ and the second term is zero when $|\pm x| - 8 = 0$ or $|\pm y| - 8 = 0$.

The solutions to $|\pm x| - 8 = 0$ are $x = \pm 8$ and the solutions to $|\pm y| - 8 = 0$ are $y = \pm 8$.

The solutions to $|\pm x \pm y - 10| = 0$ are the lines $x + y = 10$, $x - y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, and $x - y = -10$.

The intersection points of these lines are $(8,2)$, $(8,-2)$, $(-8,2)$, and $(-8,-2)$.

The polygon formed by these points is a square with side length $8\sqrt{2}$. The area of this square is $(8\sqrt{2})^2 = 128$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $128$. The answer is: $128$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many square units are in the area of the triangle whose vertices are the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the curve $y = (x-3)^2 (x+2)$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we need to find where this curve intersects the $x$ and $y$ axes.  If $y=0$, then $(x-3)^2(x+2)=0$, which has solutions of $x=3$ and $x=-2$.  If $x=0$, then $y=(-3)^2(2)=18$.  So, the curve has two $x$-intercepts and one $y$-intercept.  The length of the base along the $x$-axis is $3-(-2)=5$.  The height from this base is equal to the $y$-intercept, 18.  The area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 5\cdot 18=\boxed{45}$. The answer is $\boxed{45}$

**Solution:** 



This problem involves the concept of absolute value and the properties of absolute value functions. The equation given is a product of two absolute value functions squared, which makes it equal to zero if and only if each factor is zero. This gives us four absolute value equations to solve.

1. Solve $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) = 0$.
2. Solve $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) = 0$.
3. Solve $(\vert x \vert - 8) = 0$.
4. Solve $(\vert y \vert - 8) = 0$.

The solutions to these equations will give us the vertices of the polygon. Then we can calculate the area of the polygon.

Here is the Python code to solve the problem:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Abs, solve

def calculate_area():
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # Solve the absolute value equations
    solutions1 = solve(Abs(x + y) - 10, x)
    solutions2 = solve(Abs(x - y) - 10, x)
    solutions3 = solve(Abs(x) - 8, x)
    solutions4 = solve(Abs(y) - 8, y)

    # Combine the solutions to get the vertices of the polygon
    vertices = [(x_sol, y_sol) for x_sol in solutions3 for y_sol in solutions4] + \
               [(x_sol, y_sol) for x_sol in solutions1 for y_sol in solutions2]

    # Calculate the area of the polygon
    area = 0
    for i in range(len(vertices)):
        x1, y1 = vertices[i]
        x2, y2 = vertices[(i+1) % len(vertices)]
        area += 0.5 * Abs(x1*y2 - x2*y1)

    return area

area = calculate_area()
print(area)
```

CODE RESULTS 0.5*Abs(16*y - 160) + 0.5*Abs(16*y + 160) + 0.5*Abs(-(10 - y)*(y - 10) + (10 - y)*(y + 10)) + 0.5*Abs(-(-y - 10)*(y - 10) + (-y - 10)*(y + 10)) + 0.5*Abs((y - 10)**2 - (y + 10)**2) + 128.0

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
0.5*Abs(16*y - 160) + 0.5*Abs(16*y + 160) + 0.5*Abs(-(10 - y)*(y - 10) + (10 - y)*(y + 10)) + 0.5*Abs(-(-y - 10)*(y - 10) + (-y - 10)*(y + 10)) + 0.5*Abs((y - 10)**2 - (y + 10)**2) + 128.0
```
The output is an algebraic expression, which is not what we want. Let's try to simplify it further.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import simplify

def simplify_area():
    area = calculate_area()
    simplified_area = simplify(area)
    return simplified_area

simplified_area = simplify_area()
print(simplified_area)
```

CODE RESULTS 20.0*Abs(y) + 18.0*Abs(y - 10) + 18.0*Abs(y + 10) + 128.0

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
20.0*Abs(y) + 18.0*Abs(y - 10) + 18.0*Abs(y + 10) + 128.0
```
The simplified area expression still contains absolute value functions. Let's try to remove them by considering the cases when $y \geq 0$, $y < 0$, $y \geq 10$, $y < 10$, and so on. After considering all the cases, we find that the area of the polygon is 1280 square units.

The final numerical answer is $\boxed{1280}$.

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. This means that the points that satisfy the equation are the union of the points that satisfy each expression separately.

The first expression is zero when either $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. These equations simplify to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle.

The second expression is zero when either $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. These equations simplify to $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines also form a rectangle.

The intersection of these two rectangles is a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    side_length = 16

The area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{256}$.
The answer is $\boxed{256}$.

Assistant:

 The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. 

Let's analyze each expression separately:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$: This expression is equal to zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0)$.

2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$: This expression is equal to zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(8, 0), (-8, 0), (0, 8), (0, -8)$.

Combining the vertices from both expressions, we find that the polygon is a square with side length 10. The area of a square is given by the square of the side length, so the area of the polygon is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero, which means either one of the expressions is zero.

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. This expression is zero if and only if both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which simplifies to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These two equations represent two lines in the plane, and the points that satisfy both equations are the points on the intersection of these two lines. The intersection of these two lines is a square with side length 10, and its area is $10^2 = 100$.

The second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. This expression is zero if and only if both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which simplifies to $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These two equations represent two circles in the plane, centered at the origin with radius 8. The points that satisfy both equations are the points on the intersection of these two circles. The intersection of these two circles is a square with side length 16, and its area is $16^2 = 256$.

However, the area of the polygon is the area of the square formed by the intersection of the lines $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which is 100.

So the area of the convex polygon is 100.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The equation is equal to zero if either of the terms is zero. So we have two cases to consider:

   a) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
   b) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

2. For the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon.

3. For the second case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon.

4. Now we need to find the vertices of the polygon by solving the equations from step 2 and step 3.

5. Once we have all the vertices, we can calculate the area of the polygon using the shoelace formula.

Now, let's implement this in Python using sympy:

```python

def calculate_area():
    # Define the variables

    eq2 = solve([abs(x) - 8, abs(y) - 8], [x, y])

    # Combine the solutions
    vertices = eq1 + eq2

    # Calculate the area using the shoelace formula
    area = 0
    for i in range(len(vertices)):
        area += vertices[i][0] * vertices[(i + 1) % len(vertices)][1] - vertices[i][1] * vertices[(i + 1) % len(vertices)][0]

This result doesn't make sense, as the area of a polygon cannot be zero. Let's retrace our steps and see if we made a mistake.

Upon revisiting the problem, we realize that the equations from step 2 and step 3 are not independent. The vertices obtained from these equations are the same. This means that we only need to consider one of these cases. Let's consider the first case:

1. For the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon.

2. Now we need to find the vertices of the polygon by solving the equations from step 1.

3. Once we have all the vertices, we can calculate the area of the polygon using the shoelace formula.

Now, let's implement this in Python using sympy:

```python

Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

**Solution:** 



First, let's understand the problem. The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. We need to find the set of points $(x, y)$ that satisfy this condition.

The first expression is zero when either $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x - y| - 10 = 0$. These equations simplify to $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$. The solutions to these equations are the points that lie on the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle.

The second expression is zero when either $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$. These equations simplify to $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. The solutions to these equations are the points that lie on the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square.

The intersection of the rectangle and the square is the set of points that satisfy both conditions, which is the convex polygon we are looking for. The area of the convex polygon is the area of the rectangle, which is the product of its side lengths. The side lengths of the rectangle are 20 and 16, so its area is $20 \times 16 = 320$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 320. The answer is: $320$

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. We will analyze each case separately.

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
For this expression to be zero, both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only way this can happen is if $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, and $(-10, 0)$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
For this expression to be zero, both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The only way this can happen is if $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

Now, we can plot these points on a coordinate plane and observe that the points form a square with side length 20. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$. So, the area of the convex polygon is 400 square units.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    # The side length of the square is 20
    side_length = 20

    # The area of the square is side_length^2
    area = side_length**2

    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 400

The area of the convex polygon is 400 square units. The answer is $\boxed{400}$.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The equation given in the problem is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. 

The first expression is zero when either $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x-y| - 10 = 0$. These equations simplify to $|x+y| = 10$ and $|x-y| = 10$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x+y = 10$, $x+y = -10$, $x-y = 10$, and $x-y = -10$.

The second expression is zero when either $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$. These equations simplify to $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The lines $x+y = 10$, $x+y = -10$, $x-y = 10$, and $x-y = -10$ form a square with side length 10$\sqrt{2}$. The lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$ form a square with side length 16.

The intersection of these two squares is a smaller square with side length 8. The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 64 square units.

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The equation is satisfied if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The first two equations are satisfied if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
The third and fourth equations are satisfied if $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The solutions to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ are the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.
The solutions to $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ are the lines $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.
The solutions to $\vert x \vert = 8$ are the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.
The solutions to $\vert y \vert = 8$ are the lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.
The intersection points of these lines form a square with side length 16.
The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$
