**Problem:** 
"Find the number of 10-tuples $(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{10})$ of real numbers such that
\[(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2 = \frac{1}{11}.\]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,
\begin{align*}
&[(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + \dots + 1^2 + 1^2)][(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2] \\
&\ge [(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + (x_2 - x_3) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10}]^2 = 1.
\end{align*}From the given condition, we have equality, so by the equality condition for Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[\frac{1 - x_1}{1} = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{1} = \frac{x_2 - x_3}{1} = \dots = \frac{x_9 - x_{10}}{1} = \frac{x_{10}}{1}.\]Let
\[d = 1 - x_1 = x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_3 = \dots = x_9 - x_{10} = x_{10}.\]Then
\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so
\[(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_{10}) = \left( \frac{10}{11}, \frac{9}{11}, \frac{8}{11}, \dots, \frac{1}{11} \right).\]In particular, there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

The first term, $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, is zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$. These lines intersect at $(5, 5)$.

The second term, $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$, is zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$. These lines intersect at $(8, 8)$.

The points that satisfy the equation form a square with vertices at $(5, 5)$, $(5, -5)$, $(-5, -5)$, and $(-5, 5)$. The side length of this square is $10$, so its area is $10^2 = 100$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $100$.

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



First, let's understand the problem. The points that satisfy the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ are the points that make either of the two factors equal to zero.

The factors are $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ on the left side, and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2$ on the right side. Each of these factors is zero if and only if the absolute value expression equals its argument. So, the points that satisfy the equation are the points that satisfy:

1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$,
2. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$,
3. $\vert x \vert = 8$, or
4. $\vert y \vert = 8$.

Each of these four conditions describes a square in the coordinate plane. The first two conditions describe squares with side length 20 centered at the origin, and the last two conditions describe squares with side length 16 centered at the origin.

The intersection of these four squares is the polygon we are looking for. This polygon is a square with side length 16, because the smaller squares are entirely contained within the larger squares.

The area of a square with side length $s$ is $s^2$. So, the area of the polygon is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

\[d = 1 - x_1 = x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_3 = \dots = x_9 - x_{10} = x_{10}.\]Then
\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ is equal to zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These equations represent two perpendicular lines $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.

Similarly, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which represent a square with side length 16 centered at the origin.

The intersection of these two sets of points is a square with side length 10 centered at the origin. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $10^2 = 100$.

The answer is: 100.

**Problem:** 
"Let $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_ 2= (-16,2).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that
\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as
\[\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1.\]Find $h + k + a + b.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

**Solution:** 



This problem requires understanding of absolute value function and properties of square root. The equation involves absolute value function, so we need to consider different cases for the absolute value expressions. The equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.

1. Solve the equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ for $x$ and $y$.
2. Solve the equation $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ for $x$ and $y$.
3. Solve the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ for $x$.
4. Solve the equation $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ for $y$.
5. The solutions from steps 1 to 4 form the vertices of the polygon.
6. Calculate the area of the polygon formed by these vertices.

Now, let's solve each step:

1. From $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which gives us two cases: $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.
2. From $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which gives us two cases: $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.
3. From $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$, which gives us two cases: $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.
4. From $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us two cases: $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.
5. By combining the cases from steps 1 to 4, we can find the vertices of the polygon.
6. To calculate the area of the polygon, we can use the formula for the area of a polygon given its vertices. For a square, the area is simply the side length squared. In this case, the side length is 16 (since the distance between the points (8,8) and (8,-8) or (-8,8) and (-8,-8) is 16), so the area of the polygon is $16^2 = 256$.

The final answer is:

The area of the polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $\boxed{256}$

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we need to find the area of the convex polygon formed by the points that satisfy the equation. The equation is given by
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]
If the product of two numbers is zero, then at least one of the numbers must be zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first case, we have:
\[(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0.\]
This equation is satisfied only when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The points that satisfy this condition form a square with side length $20$. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.

For the second case, we have:
\[(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0.\]
This equation is satisfied only when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The points that satisfy this condition form a square with side length $16$. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

However, the second case does not satisfy the first case, so the only points that satisfy both cases are the vertices of the square formed by the first case. Therefore, the convex polygon formed by the points that satisfy the equation is the square with side length $20$. The area of this square is $400$.

The answer is: $\boxed{400}$

**Solution:** 


First, we need to understand the problem. The equation given is a product of two expressions, each of which is a square. The product is zero if and only if at least one of the expressions is zero. Therefore, the points that satisfy the equation are the points that satisfy either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The solutions to $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ are the points where $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which form a square with side length 20. The vertices of this square are $(10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, $(-10, 0)$, and $(0, -10)$.

The solutions to $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ are the points where $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which also form a square with side length 20. The vertices of this square are $(10, -10)$, $(-10, 10)$, $(10, 0)$, and $(0, 10)$.

The solutions to $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ are the points where $\vert x \vert = 8$, which form a square with side length 16. The vertices of this square are $(8, 0)$, $(-8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, and $(0, -8)$.

The solutions to $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ are the points where $\vert y \vert = 8$, which form a square with side length 16. The vertices of this square are $(0, 8)$, $(0, -8)$, $(8, 0)$, and $(-8, 0)$.

The intersection of these four squares is the convex polygon we are looking for. It is a square with side length 8. The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$.

The answer is: $\boxed{64}$.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $A \cdot B = 0$ is true if and only if at least one of the factors is zero. So we have two cases to consider:

1. $A = 0$ or $B = 0$.
2. Both $A$ and $B$ are zero.

In the first case, we have two equations: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. Solving these gives $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points must lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$.

In the second case, we have two more equations: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. Solving these gives $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that the points must lie on the lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

So the points that satisfy the equation are those that lie on the lines $x + y = 10$, $x - y = 10$, $x = \pm 8$, and $y = \pm 8$. These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$. The side lengths of the rectangle are $16$ and $10$, so the area is $16 \times 10 = 160$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 160.

The answer is: $160$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_ 2= (-16,2).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that
\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as
\[\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1.\]Find $h + k + a + b.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$
