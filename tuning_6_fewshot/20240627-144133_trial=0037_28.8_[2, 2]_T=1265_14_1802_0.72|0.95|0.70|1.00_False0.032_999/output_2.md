**Problem:** 
"How many distinct solutions are there to the equation $|x-7| = |x+1|$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
If $|x-7| = |x+1|$, then either $x-7 = x+1$ or $x-7 = -(x+1)$.  Simplifying $x-7=x+1$ gives $0=8$, which has no solutions, so no values of $x$ satisfy $x-7 = x+1$.  If $x-7 = -(x+1)$, then $x-7 = -x-1$, so $2x = 6$, which gives $x=3$.  So, there is $\boxed{1}$ solution.

Challenge: See if you can find a quick solution to this problem by simply thinking about the graphs of $y=|x-7|$ and $y=|x+1|$. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


The problem asks us to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

To solve this problem, we can use the property of absolute value function that if $|f(x)| = a$, then $f(x) = a$ or $f(x) = -a$. This means that we can split the absolute value function into two separate equations and solve for $x$.

Let's first set $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ to $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.

For each of these equations, we can further split the absolute value function into two separate equations:

1. For $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, we have $x-1 -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $x-1 -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$. These simplify to $x-1 = \frac{m}{100} + 2$ and $x-1 = - \frac{m}{100} + 2$. Solving these for $x$ gives $x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$ and $x = -\frac{m}{100} + 2 + 1 = -\frac{m}{100} + 3$.

2. For $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$, we have $x-1 -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$ and $x-1 -2 = \frac{m}{100}$. These simplify to $x-1 = - \frac{m}{100} + 2$ and $x-1 = \frac{m}{100} + 2$. Solving these for $x$ gives $x = -\frac{m}{100} + 3$ and $x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$.

Now we have four possible expressions for $x$:

$$x = \frac{m}{100} + 3, \quad x = -\frac{m}{100} + 3, \quad x = \frac{m}{100} + 3, \quad x = -\frac{m}{100} + 3.$$

These all simplify to the same two expressions:

$$x = \frac{m}{100} + 3, \quad x = -\frac{m}{100} + 3.$$

This means that for each value of $m$, we have two solutions for $x$. We want these solutions to be distinct, which means they should not coincide. This happens when $\frac{m}{100} + 3 = -\frac{m}{100} + 3$, or equivalently, when $m = 0$. However, $m = 0$ is not a positive integer, so we discard it.

For all other positive integer values of $m$, the two solutions for $x$ will be distinct. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is equal to the number of positive integers greater than $0$. There is only one such positive integer, which is $1$.

However, this does not give us the desired $4$ distinct solutions. We must have made a mistake in our reasoning.

Let's go back and re-examine our steps. We made a mistake in our reasoning when we said that if $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ then $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ or $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$. This is not necessarily true.

The correct reasoning is as follows: If $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, then either $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ or $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$. However, the absolute value function has the property that $\vert a \vert = a$ or $\vert a \vert = -a$. So, we should actually have $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ or $\vert -(x-1) \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$. This simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ or $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.

Now let's go back and correct our steps.

For $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, we have $x-1 -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $x-1 -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$. These simplify to $x-1 = \frac{m}{100} + 2$ and $x-1 = - \frac{m}{100} + 2$. Solving these for $x$ gives $x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$ and $x = -\frac{m}{100} + 3$.

For $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$, we have $x-1 -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$ and $x-1 -2 = \frac{m}{100}$. These simplify to $x-1 = - \frac{m}{100} + 2$ and $x-1 = \frac{m}{100} + 2$. Solving these for $x$ gives $x = -\frac{m}{100} + 3$ and $x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$.

Now we have four possible expressions for $x$:

$$x = \frac{m}{100} + 3, \quad x = -\frac{m}{100} + 3, \quad x = \frac{m}{100} + 3, \quad x = -\frac{m}{100} + 3.$$

These all simplify to the same two expressions:

$$x = \frac{m}{100} + 3, \quad x = -\frac{m}{100} + 3.$$

Now we see that for each value of $m$, we have two solutions for $x$. We want these solutions to be distinct, which means they should not coincide. This happens when $\frac{m}{100} + 3 = -\frac{m}{100} + 3$, or equivalently, when $m = 0$. However, $m = 0$ is not a positive integer, so we discard it.

For all other positive integer values of $m$, the two solutions for $x$ will be distinct. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is equal to the number of positive integers greater than $0$. There are infinitely many positive integers greater than $0$.

However, this does not give us the desired $4$ distinct solutions. We must have made a mistake in our reasoning.

Let's go back and re-examine our steps. We made a mistake in our reasoning when we said that if $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, then $\vert x

1_User:

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is in the interval $(0, 2)$. Thus, we have $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which gives $0 < m < 200$. The number of positive integers $m$ in this interval is $199$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 199. The answer is: $199$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many solutions does the equation \[\frac{(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)\dotsm(x-100)}{(x-1^2)(x-2^2)(x-3^2)\dotsm(x-100^2)} = 0\]have for $x$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Any solution to this equation must make the numerator of the left-hand side zero, while keeping the denominator non-zero. The numerator is zero when $x$ is one of the numbers $1, 2, 3, \dots, 100.$ However, for any value in this list that is a perfect square, the denominator will also be zero, so that value of $x$ will not be a root. Therefore, we want to find the number of integers in the list $1, 2, \dots, 100$ which are not perfect squares. The perfect squares in the list are $1^2, 2^2, \dots, 10^2,$ so there are $10$ perfect squares, and \[100 - 10 = \boxed{90}\]integers which are not perfect squares. The answer is $\boxed{90}$

**Solution:** 



This problem is a bit more complex than the previous ones, as it involves a combination of algebraic manipulation and the use of python libraries like `sympy`. Let's break it down into steps:

1. We know that the equation $| |x-1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions, which means that the expression $|x-1| - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$ has two values, one positive and one negative. This is because the absolute value function $|x|$ has two solutions, namely $x$ and $-x$.

2. Let's denote $y = |x - 1| - 2$. Then the equation becomes $|y| = \frac{m}{100}$, which implies that $y = \frac{m}{100}$ and $y = -\frac{m}{100}$.

3. Substituting back $y = |x - 1| - 2$, we get two equations: $|x - 1| - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $|x - 1| - 2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.

4. We can solve these two equations separately. For each equation, we first isolate $|x - 1|$ and then solve for $x$.

5. To solve the equations numerically, we can use python and the `sympy` library.

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we need to find the value of $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly four distinct solutions.

We can start by considering the different cases for the absolute value inside the larger absolute value:

1. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 > 0$, then the equation becomes $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$. This simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.

2. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0$, then the equation becomes $-( \vert x-1 \vert -2 ) = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Now we need to solve these two cases for $x$ and count the number of distinct solutions for each value of $m$.

Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two sub-cases:
- If $x-1 > 0$, then $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.
- If $x-1 < 0$, then $-(x-1) = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Case 2: $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. This also gives us two sub-cases:
- If $x-1 > 0$, then $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
- If $x-1 < 0$, then $-(x-1) = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Now we need to count the number of distinct solutions for each value of $m$. The four distinct solutions are:
- $3 + \frac{m}{100}$
- $-1 + \frac{m}{100}$
- $3 - \frac{m}{100}$
- $-1 - \frac{m}{100}$

For these solutions to be distinct, we need the fractions $\frac{m}{100}$ to be different for each solution. This means that $m$ must be less than $100$.

By trial and error, we can find that for $m=60$, the four distinct solutions are:
- $3 + \frac{60}{100} = 3.6$
- $-1 + \frac{60}{100} = -0.4$
- $3 - \frac{60}{100} = 2.4$
- $-1 - \frac{60}{100} = -1.6$

So, the value of $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is $60$. The answer is $\boxed{60}$.

"How many solutions does the equation \[\frac{(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)\dotsm(x-100)}{(x-1^2)(x-2^2)(x-3^2)\dotsm(x-100^2)} = 0\]have for $x$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Any solution to this equation must make the numerator of the left-hand side zero, while keeping the denominator non-zero. The numerator is zero when $x$ is one of the numbers $1, 2, 3, \dots, 100.$ However, for any value in this list that is a perfect square, the denominator will also be zero, so that value of $x$ will not be a root. Therefore, we want to find the number of integers in the list $1, 2, \dots, 100$ which are not perfect squares. The perfect squares in the list are $1^2, 2^2, \dots, 10^2,$ so there are $10$ perfect squares, and \[100 - 10 = \boxed{90}\]integers which are not perfect squares. The answer is $\boxed{90}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we will first analyze the equation and then use Python to find the number of values of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions.

The equation $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}=1$. This is because the expression $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|$ can take on exactly 4 distinct values when the absolute value is taken twice, which happens when the inner absolute value equals 1.

Therefore, we need to solve the equation $\frac{m}{100}=1$ for $m$. Multiplying both sides by 100, we get $m=100$.

So, the number of positive integer values of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 1. The answer is: 1

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 1$. This is because the expression on the left side of the equation is always between $0$ and $4$, and it equals $0$, $1$, $2$, or $3$ exactly once. Thus, $m=100$ is the only value that makes the equation have $4$ distinct solutions.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many distinct solutions are there to the equation $|x-7| = |x+1|$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
If $|x-7| = |x+1|$, then either $x-7 = x+1$ or $x-7 = -(x+1)$.  Simplifying $x-7=x+1$ gives $0=8$, which has no solutions, so no values of $x$ satisfy $x-7 = x+1$.  If $x-7 = -(x+1)$, then $x-7 = -x-1$, so $2x = 6$, which gives $x=3$.  So, there is $\boxed{1}$ solution.

Challenge: See if you can find a quick solution to this problem by simply thinking about the graphs of $y=|x-7|$ and $y=|x+1|$. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we need to find the value of $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. We can start by analyzing the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions when the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, is equal to $2$. This is because the graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has $4$ distinct intersections with the line $y=\frac{m}{100}$ when $\frac{m}{100}=2$.

Therefore, we have $\frac{m}{100}=2$, which gives $m=200$.

Now we will verify that $m=200$ indeed gives $4$ distinct solutions to the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{200}{100}$.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=2$ can be rewritten as two separate equations:

1) $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 2$, which simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = 4$. This gives two equations: $x-1 = 4$ and $x-1 = -4$. The solutions to these equations are $x = 5$ and $x = -3$, respectively.

2) $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -2$, which simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = 0$. This gives the equation $x-1 = 0$, with solution $x = 1$.

So, the solutions to the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=2$ are $x = 5$, $x = -3$, and $x = 1$. There are $4$ distinct solutions, as required.

Therefore, the value of $m$ that makes the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have $4$ distinct solutions is $m=200$. The answer is: $200$

**Solution:** 



We know that the equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions. The expression $| |x-1|-2|$ is a piecewise function of $x$ which can take the forms of $2 - |x-1|$ or $|x-1| - 2$. This function will be equal to $\frac{m}{100}$ exactly four times, so we need to find the value of $m$ for which the equation $| |x-1|-2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions.

The equation $| |x-1|-2| = \frac{m}{100}$ will have four distinct solutions when the right hand side is between $0$ and $2$. That is, $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which gives $0 < m < 200$.

Now we need to find the value of $m$ for which the equation $| |x-1|-2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has exactly four distinct solutions. This can be done by plotting the function $y = | |x-1|-2|$ and seeing where it intersects the horizontal line $y = \frac{m}{100}$.

The function $y = | |x-1|-2|$ is a "V" shape with the vertex at $x = 1$. The distance between the two "arms" of the "V" is $4$. The line $y = \frac{m}{100}$ will intersect the "V" shape at four distinct points when $\frac{m}{100} = 1$. This gives $m = 100$.

So, the value of $m$ for which the equation $| |x-1|-2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has exactly four distinct solutions is $100$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $| |x-1|-2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions is $1$.
The answer is: $1$
