**Example**

**Problem:** 
"For certain ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ of real numbers, the system of equations
\[\begin{aligned} ax+by&=1 \\ x^2 + y^2 &= 50  \end{aligned}\]has at least one solution, and each solution is an ordered pair $(x,y)\,$ of integers. How many such ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ are there?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The graph of $ax+by=1$ is a line, while the graph of $x^2+y^2=50$ is a circle centered at the origin. Therefore, $(a, b)$ satisfies the conditions if and only if the line and circle intersect at least once, and they intersect only at lattice points (points with integer coordinates).

Knowing this, it makes sense to look for lattice points on the circle whose equation is $x^2+y^2=50$. Testing cases, we find that there are twelve lattice points on the circle: $(\pm 1, \pm 7)$, $(\pm 7, \pm 1)$, and $(\pm 5, \pm 5)$ (where the two $\pm$ signs in each pair are independent of each other).

There are $\tbinom{12}{2} = 66$ pairs of these points, and each pair determines a line. However, the graph of $ax+by=1$ can never pass through the origin $(0, 0)$, since if $x=y=0$, then $ax+by=0 \neq 1$. Therefore, the six pairs which consist of diametrically opposed points are invalid, since the line through them passes through the origin. This corrects our count to $66 - 6 = 60$.

In addition, for each of the twelve points, there is a line tangent to the circle at that point, so that the only solution to the system is that one point. This brings the final total to $60 + 12 = \boxed{72}$. The answer is $\boxed{72}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $0$ and $3$. This means $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 3$, or equivalently, $0 < m < 300$. The number of positive integers $m$ in this range is $299$.

So the answer is $\boxed{299}$.

Here is a Python program that computes the number of positive integers $m$ in the range $(0, 300)$:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def count_positive_integers():
    """Count the number of positive integers m in the range (0, 300)."""
    count = 0
    for m in range(1, 300):
        count += 1
    return count

result = count_positive_integers()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 299

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
299
```
The number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition is $299$. So the answer is $\boxed{299}$.
The answer is: $299$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many solutions does the equation \[\frac{(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)\dotsm(x-100)}{(x-1^2)(x-2^2)(x-3^2)\dotsm(x-100^2)} = 0\]have for $x$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Any solution to this equation must make the numerator of the left-hand side zero, while keeping the denominator non-zero. The numerator is zero when $x$ is one of the numbers $1, 2, 3, \dots, 100.$ However, for any value in this list that is a perfect square, the denominator will also be zero, so that value of $x$ will not be a root. Therefore, we want to find the number of integers in the list $1, 2, \dots, 100$ which are not perfect squares. The perfect squares in the list are $1^2, 2^2, \dots, 10^2,$ so there are $10$ perfect squares, and \[100 - 10 = \boxed{90}\]integers which are not perfect squares. The answer is $\boxed{90}$

The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $10$. However, this number is not one of the options given in the problem. Let's retrace our steps and see if we made a mistake.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions when the right-hand side is equal to the difference of the two breakpoints of the absolute value function $| |x-1|-2|$. The breakpoints of the function $| |x-1|-2|$ are found by setting $|x-1|-2=0$, which gives $|x-1|=2$. This equation has two solutions, $x=3$ and $x=-1$. The difference of these two solutions is $3 - (-1) = 4$. Therefore, the right-hand side of the equation should be equal to $4/100 = 0.04$. However, the value of $m$ we are looking for is $0.04 \times 100 = 4$.

So, we made a mistake in our calculations. Let's retrace our steps and see if we can find the mistake.

We are looking for the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. We know that this equation has $4$ distinct solutions when the right-hand side is equal to the difference of the two breakpoints of the absolute value function $| |x-1|-2|$. The breakpoints of the function $| |x-1|-2|$ are found by setting $|x-1|-2=0$, which gives $|x-1|=2$. This equation has two solutions, $x=3$ and $x=-1$. The difference of these two solutions is $3 - (-1) = 4$. Therefore, the right-hand side of the equation should be equal to $4/100 = 0.04$. However, the value of $m$ we are looking for is $0.04 \times 100 = 4$.

So, the mistake was in our interpretation of the problem. The problem is asking for the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. We interpreted this as the number of positive integers $m$ for which the right-hand side is equal to the difference of the two breakpoints of the absolute value function $| |x-1|-2|$. However, this interpretation is incorrect. The problem is actually asking for the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly $4$ distinct solutions. This means we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions.

To do this, we can use the fact that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions when the right-hand side is equal to the difference of the two breakpoints of the absolute value function $| |x-1|-2|$. The breakpoints of the function $| |x-1|-2|$ are found by setting $|x-1

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 1$. This is because the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a graph that is a "V" shape with the "bottom" of the "V" at $f(x) = 1$. Therefore, the equation $f(x) = \frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100} = 1$, or $m = 100$. So, there is only $1$ positive integer $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions. The answer is: $1$

Assistant:

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is in the interval $(0,2)$. This is because the expression on the left side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, takes on all values in the interval $[0,2]$ as $x$ varies over the real numbers. Therefore, we want to find the number of multiples of $1/100$ in the interval $(0,2)$, which is the same as the number of integers in the interval $(0 \cdot 100, 2 \cdot 100) = (0,200)$. This number is $200$. However, we must subtract 1 because the value $m=0$ does not give 4 distinct solutions. So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is $200 - 1 = 199$. The answer is: 199.

This equation represents a piecewise function with $4$ cases based on the absolute value inside. We can solve each case separately and then count the number of distinct solutions for each $m$.
