**Problem:** 
"How many square units are in the area of the triangle whose vertices are the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the curve $y = (x-3)^2 (x+2)$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we need to find where this curve intersects the $x$ and $y$ axes.  If $y=0$, then $(x-3)^2(x+2)=0$, which has solutions of $x=3$ and $x=-2$.  If $x=0$, then $y=(-3)^2(2)=18$.  So, the curve has two $x$-intercepts and one $y$-intercept.  The length of the base along the $x$-axis is $3-(-2)=5$.  The height from this base is equal to the $y$-intercept, 18.  The area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 5\cdot 18=\boxed{45}$. The answer is $\boxed{45}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The given equation is a product of two terms, each of which is a square of a difference. The only way for the product to be zero is if at least one of the terms is zero. Therefore, we have the following four cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. This gives us two lines: $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) = 0$, which implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us two more lines: $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8) = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$. This gives us two lines: $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8) = 0$, which implies $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us two more lines: $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$. The length of the rectangle is $16$ and the width is $16$, so the area of the rectangle is $16 \times 16 = 256$.
The answer is: 256

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_ 2= (-16,2).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that
\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as
\[\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1.\]Find $h + k + a + b.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.

The first term is zero when $|x+y| = 10$ or $|x-y| = 10$. These are the equations of two pairs of parallel lines, each pair being 20 units apart.

The second term is zero when $|x| = 8$ or $|y| = 8$. These are the equations of four lines, two vertical and two horizontal, each being 16 units apart from the x-axis or y-axis.

The intersection points of these lines form a rectangle with side lengths of 16 and 20. The area of this rectangle is $16 \times 20 = 320$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 320 square units.

Here is a Python code to calculate the area:

    side_length_1 = 16
    side_length_2 = 20

The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.

The first expression is zero when either $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x - y| - 10 = 0$, which means $|x + y| = 10$ or $|x - y| = 10$. These are the equations of two lines in the plane.

The second expression is zero when either $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$, which means $|x| = 8$ or $|y| = 8$. These are the equations of two lines in the plane.

The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
