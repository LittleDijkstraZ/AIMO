**Problem:** 
"Let $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_ 2= (-16,2).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that
\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as
\[\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1.\]Find $h + k + a + b.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


This problem requires a mathematical analysis and is not easily solved by writing a program. However, we can solve it manually.

The expression $A \cdot B = 0$ implies that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. So we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of a square with side length 20.

For the second case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of a square with side length 16.

The intersection of these two cases is the intersection of the two squares, which is another square with side length 8.

The area of a square with side length $s$ is $s^2$. So the area of the convex polygon is $(20)^2 - (8)^2 = 400 - 64 = 336$.

The answer is: $336$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The equation is satisfied if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The first two equations are satisfied if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two lines passing through the origin making an angle of 45 degrees with the x and y axes respectively.
The last two equations are satisfied if $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two lines parallel to the y and x axes respectively, at a distance of 8 units from the origin.
The intersection of these lines form a square with side length 16 units. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$ square units.
So, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
For the first expression to be zero, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(8,2)$, $(8,-2)$, $(-8,2)$, and $(-8,-2)$.
For the second expression to be zero, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.
The points $(8,2)$, $(8,-2)$, $(-8,2)$, and $(-8,-2)$ form a square with side length 8, so its area is $8^2 = 64$. The points $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$ form a square with side length 16, so its area is $16^2 = 256$. The total area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of these two squares, which is $64 + 256 = 320$. The answer is: $320$

To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


This problem involves understanding the absolute value function and how it interacts with the algebraic expressions given. The key is to consider the definition of absolute value, which is $|x| = x$ if $x \geq 0$ and $|x| = -x$ if $x < 0$. This means that the expression $|x| - a$ is zero if $x = a$ or $x = -a$.

So, the given equation is satisfied if either of the following conditions hold:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8) = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8) = 0$.
2. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8) = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8) \neq 0$.
3. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8) \neq 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8) = 0$.
4. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8) \neq 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8) \neq 0$.
5. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) \neq 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8) = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8) = 0$.
6. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) \neq 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8) = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8) \neq 0$.
7. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) \neq 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8) \neq 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8) = 0$.
8. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) \neq 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8) \neq 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8) \neq 0$.
9. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) \neq 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8) = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8) = 0$.
10. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) \neq 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8) = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8) \neq 0$.
11. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) \neq 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8) \neq 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8) = 0$.
12. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) \neq 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8) \neq 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8) \neq 0$.
13. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) \neq 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) \neq 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8) = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8) = 0$.
14. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) \neq 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) \neq 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8) = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8) \neq 0$.
15. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) \neq 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) \neq 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8) \neq 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8) = 0$.
16. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) \neq 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) \neq 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8) \neq 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8) \neq 0$.

These conditions define the vertices of the polygon:
1. $(8, 8)$
2. $(-8, 8)$
3. $(8, -8)$
4. $(-8, -8)$
5. $(10, 0)$
6. $(-10, 0)$
7. $(0, 10)$
8. $(0, -10)$

The polygon is a square with side length $16$. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. 

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, and it equals zero if and only if both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0)$.

The second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$, and it equals zero if and only if both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$.

So, the polygon is a square with side length 10 (the distance between the points $(0, 10)$ and $(0, -10)$ or between the points $(10, 0)$ and $(-10, 0)$). The area of a square is the square of the length of its side, so the area of the polygon is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many square units are in the area of the triangle whose vertices are the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the curve $y = (x-3)^2 (x+2)$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we need to find where this curve intersects the $x$ and $y$ axes.  If $y=0$, then $(x-3)^2(x+2)=0$, which has solutions of $x=3$ and $x=-2$.  If $x=0$, then $y=(-3)^2(2)=18$.  So, the curve has two $x$-intercepts and one $y$-intercept.  The length of the base along the $x$-axis is $3-(-2)=5$.  The height from this base is equal to the $y$-intercept, 18.  The area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 5\cdot 18=\boxed{45}$. The answer is $\boxed{45}$

```
The area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{328}$.
However, it seems there was a mistake in the solution. 

The first equation $(|x + y| - 10)^2 + (|x - y| - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$. 

This gives us four equations: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the square as $(5, 5)$, $(5, -5)$, $(-5, 5)$, and $(-5, -5)$.

The second equation $(|x| - 8)^2 + (|y| - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. This gives us four more equations: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the square as $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The area of the polygon formed by the union of these two squares is the sum of the areas of the two squares. The side length of the first square is 10 (since $|x + y| = 10$), so its area is $10^2 = 100$. The side length of the second square is 8 (since $|x| = 8$), so its area is $8^2 = 64$. Therefore, the total area of the polygon is $100 + 64 = 164$.

However, the problem statement seems to have a mistake. It seems that the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ should be interpreted as an "or" condition, not an "and" condition. In other words, the points that satisfy the equation are those that satisfy either of the two conditions: $(|x + y| - 10)^2 + (|x - y| - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(|x| - 8)^2 + (|y| - 8)^2 = 0$.

If we interpret the equation as an "or" condition, then the area of the polygon is simply the sum of the areas of the two squares formed by the vertices that satisfy each condition separately. The area of the polygon is then $100 + 64 = 164$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 164. The mistake in the original solution was interpreting the equation as an "and" condition, which led to an incorrect result of 328. The corrected answer is 164.
The answer is $\boxed{164}$.

\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as
\[\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1.\]Find $h + k + a + b.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



The equation in the problem is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.

The first expression is zero when $|\pm x \pm y - 10| = 0$ and the second expression is zero when $|\pm x| - 8 = 0$ or $|\pm y| - 8 = 0$.

The solutions to $|\pm x \pm y - 10| = 0$ are the lines $x + y = 10$, $x - y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, and $x - y = -10$.
The solutions to $|\pm x| - 8 = 0$ are the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.
The solutions to $|\pm y| - 8 = 0$ are the lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

The eight lines divide the plane into 16 regions. However, some of these regions are not part of the polygon because they do not satisfy the original equation.

The polygon is a square with side length 16 units. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units.
The answer is: $256$
