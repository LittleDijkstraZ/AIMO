**Problem:** 
"We define a function $f(x)$ such that $f(14)=7$, and if there exists an integer $a$ such that $f(a)=b$, then $f(b)$ is defined and

$f(b)=3b+1$ if $b$ is odd

$f(b)=\frac{b}{2}$ if $b$ is even.

What is the smallest possible number of integers in the domain of $f$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Since $f(14)=7$, we know that $f(7)$ is defined, and it must equal $22$.  Similarly, we know that $f(22)$ is defined, and it must equal $11$.  Continuing on this way,  \begin{align*}
f(11)&=34\\
f(34)&=17\\
f(17)&=52\\
f(52)&=26\\
f(26)&=13\\
f(13)&=40\\
f(40)&=20\\
f(20)&=10\\
f(10)&=5\\
f(5)&=16\\
f(16)&=8\\
f(8)&=4\\
f(4)&=2\\
f(2)&=1\\
f(1)&=4
\end{align*}We are now in a cycle $1$, $4$, $2$, $1$, and so on.  Thus there are no more values which need to be defined, as there is no $a$ currently defined for which $f(a)$ is a $b$ not already defined.  Thus the minimum number of integers we can define is the number we have already defined, which is $\boxed{18}$. The answer is $\boxed{18}$

**Problem**
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


To solve this problem, we can start by plugging in $n=1$ into the second equation to get $f(2)=2f(1)+1$. Since $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$, we have $f(1)=1$. Then we can substitute $f(1)=1$ into the equation $f(2)=2f(1)+1$ to get $f(2)=3$.

Now we can use the second equation to find $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2*3+1=7$. Similarly, we can find $f(8)=2f(4)+1=2*7+1=15$. Continuing this process, we find $f(16)=31$, $f(32)=63$, and $f(64)=127$.

We notice that $f(2^k)=2^k-1$ for $k=1,2,3,4$. We can hypothesize that $f(2^k)=2^k-1$ for all positive integers $k$. To prove this by induction, we assume that $f(2^k)=2^k-1$ for some positive integer $k$. Then
\[f(2^{k+1})=f(2*2^k)=2f(2^k)+1=2(2^k-1)+1=2^{k+1}-1.\]
So the hypothesis holds for all positive integers $k$.

Now we can find $f(100)$. Since $100=2^2*5^2$, we can write $100$ as $2^2*5^2=2^2*(5^2)$. Then
\[f(100)=f(2^2*(5^2))=f((2^2)*(5^2))=f(2^2)*f(5^2).\]
We know that $f(2^2)=2^2-1=3$ and $f(5^2)=5^2-1=24$. So
\[f(100)=f(2^2)*f(5^2)=3*24=72.\]
Therefore, $f(100)=72$.

    # Calculate f(2^k) = 2^k - 1 for k = 2, 4
    f_2_squared = 2**2 - 1

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"The function $f$ is defined on the set of integers and satisfies \[f(n)= \begin{cases}  n-3 & \mbox{if }n\ge 1000 \\  f(f(n+5)) & \mbox{if }n<1000. \end{cases}\]Find $f(84)$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Denote by (1) and (2) the two parts of the definition of $f$, respectively. If we begin to use the definition of $f$ to compute $f(84)$, we use (2) until the argument is at least $1000$: \[f(84) = f(f(89)) = f(f(f(94))) = \dots = f^N(1004)\](where $f^N$ denotes composing $f$ with itself $N$ times, for some $N$). The numbers $84, 89, 94, \dots, 1004$ form an arithmetic sequence with common difference $5$; since $1004 - 84 = 920 = 184 \cdot 5$, this sequence has $184 + 1 = 185$ terms, so $N = 185$.

At this point, (1) and (2) are both used: we compute \[\begin{aligned} f^N(1004) &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-1}(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-1}(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(1000) \\ &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(997) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1002) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(999) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1004). \end{aligned}\]Repeating this process, we see that \[f^N(1004) = f^{N-2}(1004) = f^{N-4}(1004) = \dots = f^3(1004).\](The pattern breaks down for $f^k(1004)$ when $k$ is small, so it is not true that $f^3(1004) = f(1004)$.) Now, we have \[f^3(1004) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^2(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^2(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(1000) \stackrel{(1)}{=} \boxed{997}.\] The answer is $\boxed{997}$

To solve this problem, we will first set up the function $f$ using the Sympy library and then use the given conditions to find the value of $f(100)$.

    # Define the equation f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. Let's set $n=1$, then we have $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$. So $f(f(1))=1$.
2. We also know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Let's set $n=1$, then we have $f(2)=2f(1)+1$. Since $f(f(1))=1$, we can substitute $f(1)$ with 1, then we have $f(2)=2*1+1=3$.
3. Now let's set $n=2$ in the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we have $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2*3+1=7$.
4. Now let's set $n=4$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we have $f(f(f(4)))=8*4-7=27$. Since $f(f(4))=7$, we can substitute $f(f(4))$ with 7, then we have $7=27$, which is a contradiction.
5. So we need to modify our approach. Let's set $n=1$ in the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we have $f(2)=2f(1)+1=2*1+1=3$.
6. Now let's set $n=3$ in the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we have $f(6)=2f(3)+1$. Since $f(3)=\frac{f(6)-1}{2}$, we can substitute $f(3)$ with $\frac{f(6)-1}{2}$, then we have $f(6)=2*\frac{f(6)-1}{2}+1=f(6)-1+1=f(6)$. So we have $f(6)=f(6)$.
7. Now let's set $n=6$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we have $f(f(f(6)))=8*6-7=41$. Since $f(f(6))=f(6)$, we can substitute $f(f(6))$ with $f(6)$, then we have $f(6)=41$.
8. Now let's set $n=f(6)$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we have $f(f(f(f(6))))=8*f(6)-7=8*41-7=328-7=321$. Since $f(f(f(f(6))))=f(f(f(6)))$, we can substitute $f(f(f(f(6))))$ with $f(f(f(6)))$, then we have $f(f(f(6)))=321$.
9. Since $f(f(f(6)))=321$ and $f(f(6))=f(6)=41$, we can substitute $f(f(f(6)))$ with 321 and $f(f(6))$ with 41, then we have $321=f(41)$.
10. Now let's set $n=41$ in the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we have $f(82)=2f(41)+1=2*321+1=642+1=643$.
11. Now let's set $n=82$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we have $f(f(f(82)))=8*82-7=656-7=649$. Since $f(f(f(82)))=f(f(82))$, we can substitute $f(f(f(82)))$ with $f(f(82))$, then we have $f(f(82))=649$.
12. Since $f(f(82))=649$ and $f(82)=643$, we can substitute $f(f(82))$ with 649 and $f(82)$ with 643, then we have $649=f(643)$.
13. Now let's set $n=643$ in the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we have $f(1286)=2f(643)+1=2*649+1=1298+1=1299$.
14. Now let's set $n=1286$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we have $f(f(f(1286)))=8*1286-7=10288-7=10281$. Since $f(f(f(1286)))=f(f(1286))$, we can substitute $f(f(f(1286)))$ with $f(f(1286))$, then we have $f(f(1286))=10281$.
15. Since $f(f(1286))=10281$ and $f(1286)=1299$, we can substitute $f(f(1286))$ with 10281 and $f(1286)$ with 1299, then we have $10281=f(1299)$.
16. Now let's set $n=1299$ in the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we have $f(2598)=2f(1299)+1=2*10281+1=20562+1=20563$.
17. Now let's set $n=2598$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we have $f(f(f(2598)))=8*2598-7=20784-7=20777$. Since $f(f(f(2598)))=f(f(2598))$, we can substitute $f(f(f(2598)))$ with $f(f(2598))$, then we have $f(f(2598))=20777$.
18. Since $f(f(2598))=20777$ and $f(2598)=20563$, we can substitute $f(f(2598))$ with 20777 and $f(2598)$ with 20563, then we have $20777=f(20563)$.
19. Now let's set $n=20563$ in the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we have $f(41126)=2f(20563)+1=2*20777+1=41554+1=41555$.
20. Now let's set $n=41126$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we have $f(f(f(41126)))=8*41126-7=328992-7=328985$. Since $f(

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $f$ be a function taking the nonnegative integers to the positive integers such that $f(0) = f(1) = 1$ and
\[\frac{f(n) f(m + 1)}{f(m)} + \frac{f(n) f(n - m)}{f(n - m - 1)} = f(n + 1)\]for all nonnegative integers $n$ and $m,$ where $n \ge m + 1.$

Find the smallest nonnegative integer $n$ such that $f(n) > 10^6.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Setting $m = n - 1$ in the given functional equation, we get
\[\frac{f(n) \cdot f(n)}{f(n - 1)} + f(n) = f(n + 1),\]for all $n \ge 1.$  Then
\[\frac{f(n)}{f(n - 1)} + 1 = \frac{f(n + 1)}{f(n)}.\]Let $g(n) = \frac{f(n)}{f(n - 1)}$ for $n \ge 1.$  Then $g(1) = \frac{f(1)}{f(0)} = 1,$ and
\[g(n) + 1 = g(n + 1).\]Then $g(n) = n$ for all $n \ge 1.$  Hence,
\[g(n) g(n - 1) \dotsm g(2) g(1) = \frac{f(n)}{f(n - 1)} \cdot \frac{f(n - 1)}{f(n - 2)} \dotsm \frac{f(2)}{f(1)} \cdot \frac{f(1)}{f(0)},\]which simplifies to
\[n(n - 1) \dotsm (2)(1) = \frac{f(n)}{f(0)}.\]Therefore, $f(n) = n!$ for all $n \ge 1.$

Since $f(9) = 9! = 326880$ and $f(10) = 10! = 3628800,$ the smallest such $n$ is $\boxed{10}.$ The answer is $\boxed{10}$

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


To solve this problem, we can start by plugging in $n=1$ into the second equation to get $f(2)=2f(1)+1$. Since $f(f(f(1)))=f(1)=8*1-7=1$, we know that $f(1)$ is the only positive integer that makes $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ true. Therefore, $f(1)=1$.

Now we can substitute $f(1)=1$ into the second equation to get $f(2)=2*1+1=3$.

Next, we can substitute $f(2)=3$ into the second equation to get $f(4)=2*3+1=7$.

Continuing this process, we can find that $f(8)=15$, $f(16)=31$, and so on. We can see that $f(2^k)=2^k+1$ for all positive integers $k$.

Now we can use this pattern to find $f(100)$. Since $100=2^2*5^2$, we can write $f(100)=f(2^2*5^2)=f(2^2)*f(5^2)$.

We know that $f(2^2)=2^2+1=5$ and $f(5^2)=5^2+1=26$.

Therefore, $f(100)=f(2^2)*f(5^2)=5*26=130$.

So, $f(100)=130$. The answer is: $130$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"The function $f(n)$ is defined on the positive integers such that $f(f(n)) = 2n$ and $f(4n + 1) = 4n + 3$ for all positive integers $n.$  Find $f(1000).$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Consider the expression $f(f(f(a))).$  Since $f(f(a)) = 2a,$ this is equal to $f(2a).$  But taking $n = f(a)$ in $f(f(n)) = 2n,$ we get
\[f(f(f(a))) = 2f(a).\]Hence,
\[f(2a) = 2f(a)\]for all positive integers $a.$

Then
\[f(1000) = 2f(500) = 4f(250) = 8f(125).\]Taking $n = 31$ in $f(4n + 1) = 4n + 3,$ we get
\[f(125) = 127,\]so $f(1000) = \boxed{1016}.$ The answer is $\boxed{1016}$

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


To solve this problem, we can start by applying the second condition to the first condition in the problem statement. We have $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. Applying the second condition to $f(f(f(n)))$, we get $f(f(2f(f(n)))+1)=8n-7$. Now, applying the second condition again, we get $f(2(2f(f(n))+1)+1)=8n-7$, which simplifies to $f(4f(f(n))+3)=8n-7$.

Now, let's set $f(n)=m$. Then the equation becomes $f(4m+3)=8n-7$. But from the problem statement, we know that $f(4n+1)=4n+3$. So we can set $4n+1=4m+3$, which simplifies to $n=m$.

So we have $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(n)=n$. This means that the function $f(n)$ is the identity function, i.e., $f(n)=n$ for all $n$. Therefore, $f(100)=100$.
The answer is: $100$

1. We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. Let's set $n=1$, then we have $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$. So $f(f(1))=1$.
2. We also know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Let's set $n=1$, then we have $f(2)=2f(1)+1$. Since $f(f(1))=1$, we have $f(2)=2*1+1=3$.
3. Now let's set $n=2$ in the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we have $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2*3+1=7$.
4. Now let's set $n=4$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we have $f(f(f(4)))=8*4-7=25$. Since $f(f(4))=7$, we have $f(7)=25$.
5. Now let's set $n=7$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we have $f(f(f(7)))=8*7-7=51$. Since $f(f(7))=25$, we have $f(25)=51$.
6. Now let's set $n=25$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we have $f(f(f(25)))=8*25-7=193$. Since $f(f(25))=51$, we have $f(51)=193$.
7. Now let's set $n=51$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we have $f(f(f(51)))=8*51-7=401$. Since $f(f(51))=193$, we have $f(193)=401$.
8. Now let's set $n=193$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we have $f(f(f(193)))=8*193-7=1531$. Since $f(f(193))=401$, we have $f(401)=1531$.
9. Now let's set $n=401$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we have $f(f(f(401)))=8*401-7=3201$. Since $f(f(401))=1531$, we have $f(1531)=3201$.
10. Now let's set $n=1531$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we have $f(f(f(1531)))=8*1531-7=12239$. Since $f(f(1531))=3201$, we have $f(3201)=12239$.
11. Now let's set $n=3201$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we have $f(f(f(3201)))=8*3201-7=25601$. Since $f(f(3201))=12239$, we have $f(12239)=25601$.
12. Now let's set $n=12239$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we have $f(f(f(12239)))=8*12239-7=97911$. Since $f(f(12239))=25601$, we have $f(25601)=97911$.
13. Now let's set $n=25601$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we have $f(f(f(25601)))=8*25601-7=204801$. Since $f(f(25601))=97911$, we have $f(97911)=204801$.
14. Now let's set $n=97911$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we have $f(f(f(97911)))=8*97911-7=783281$. Since $f(f(97911))=204801$, we have $f(204801)=783281$.
15. Now let's set $n=204801$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we have $f(f(f(204801)))=8*204801-7=1638401$. Since $f(f(204801))=783281$, we have $f(783281)=1638401$.
16. Now let's set $n=783281$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we have $f(f(f(783281)))=8*783281-7=6266241$. Since $f(f(783281))=1638401$, we have $f(1638401)=6266241$.
17. Now let's set $n=1638401$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we have $f(f(f(1638401)))=8*1638401-7=13107201$. Since $f(f(1638401))=6266241$, we have $f(6266241)=13107201$.
18. Now let's set $n=6266241$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we have $f(f(f(6266241)))=8*6266241-7=50120961$. Since $f(f(6266241))=13107201$, we have $f(13107201)=50120961$.
19. Now let's set $n=13107201$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we have $f(f(f(13107201)))=8*13107201-7=104857601$. Since $f(f(13107201))=50120961$, we have $f(50120961)=104857601$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"We define a function $f(x)$ such that $f(14)=7$, and if there exists an integer $a$ such that $f(a)=b$, then $f(b)$ is defined and

$f(b)=3b+1$ if $b$ is odd

$f(b)=\frac{b}{2}$ if $b$ is even.

What is the smallest possible number of integers in the domain of $f$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Since $f(14)=7$, we know that $f(7)$ is defined, and it must equal $22$.  Similarly, we know that $f(22)$ is defined, and it must equal $11$.  Continuing on this way,  \begin{align*}

\end{align*}We are now in a cycle $1$, $4$, $2$, $1$, and so on.  Thus there are no more values which need to be defined, as there is no $a$ currently defined for which $f(a)$ is a $b$ not already defined.  Thus the minimum number of integers we can define is the number we have already defined, which is $\boxed{18}$. The answer is $\boxed{18}$

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we can start by calculating the value of $f(1)$ using the second condition $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. By setting $n = 1$, we get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. Since we don't know the value of $f(1)$, we can't directly calculate $f(2)$. However, we can use the first condition $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$ to find $f(1)$. By setting $n = 1$, we get $f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = 1$. Since $f(f(f(1))) = 1$, we know that $f(1)$ must be an integer such that $f(f(1)) = 1$. By trying different values, we find that $f(1) = 1$ satisfies this condition because $f(1) = 1$ implies $f(f(1)) = f(1) = 1$. Now we can calculate $f(2)$ using the second condition: $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2*1 + 1 = 3$.

Next, we can calculate $f(3)$ using the second condition: $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2*3 + 1 = 7$. Then, we can calculate $f(7)$ using the first condition: $f(f(f(7))) = 8*7 - 7 = 56 - 7 = 49$. Since $f(f(f(7))) = 49$, we know that $f(f(7)) = 7$ because $f(f(7)) = 7$ implies $f(f(f(7))) = f(7) = 49$. Now we can calculate $f(7)$ using the second condition: $f(7) = 2f(3) + 1 = 2*7 + 1 = 15$.

Finally, we can calculate $f(100)$ using the second condition: $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$. We know that $f(200) = f(f(f(100))) = 8*100 - 7 = 793$. So we have the equation $2f(100) + 1 = 793$, which simplifies to $2f(100) = 792$, and further simplifies to $f(100) = 396$.

So the value of $f(100)$ is 396. The answer is: $396$

**Problem**
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


To solve this problem, we can use the second equation to simplify the first equation.

If we substitute $f(n)$ into the second equation, we get $f(f(n)) = 2f(n) + 1$.

Then, substituting $f(f(n))$ into the first equation, we get $f(2f(n) + 1) = 8n - 7$.

Now, we can use the second equation again to simplify this equation. If we substitute $2f(n) + 1$ into the second equation, we get $f(2f(n) + 1) = 2f(2f(n) + 1) + 1$.

Setting this equal to $8n - 7$, we have $2f(2f(n) + 1) + 1 = 8n - 7$.

Simplifying this equation, we get $2f(2f(n) + 1) = 8n - 8$, so $f(2f(n) + 1) = 4n - 4$.

Now, we can substitute $n = f(n)$ into this equation to get $f(2f(f(n)) + 1) = 4f(n) - 4$.

Using the second equation again, we have $f(2f(f(n)) + 1) = 2f(2f(f(n)) + 1) + 1$.

Setting this equal to $4f(n) - 4$, we get $2f(2f(f(n)) + 1) + 1 = 4f(n) - 4$.

Simplifying this equation, we get $2f(2f(f(n)) + 1) = 4f(n) - 5$, so $f(2f(f(n)) + 1) = 2f(n) - \frac{5}{2}$.

But this equation contradicts the fact that $f(n)$ is a function from $\mathbb N$ to $\mathbb N$. Therefore, our assumption that $f(n)$ exists for all positive integers $n$ must be incorrect.

However, we can still find $f(100)$ by using the second equation repeatedly.

We start with $f(2 \cdot 100) = 2f(100) + 1$.

Then, we can find $f(2f(100) + 1) = 4 \cdot 100 - 4 = 396$.

And, we can find $f(2f(f(100)) + 1) = 2f(2f(100) + 1) + 1 = 2 \cdot 396 + 1 = 793$.

But this value does not equal $8 \cdot 100 - 7 = 793$.

Therefore, our assumption that $f(n)$ exists for all positive integers $n$ must be incorrect.

However, we can still find $f(100)$ by using the second equation repeatedly.

We start with $f(2 \cdot 100) = 2f(100) + 1$.

**Problem:** 
"The function $f(n)$ is defined on the positive integers such that $f(f(n)) = 2n$ and $f(4n + 1) = 4n + 3$ for all positive integers $n.$  Find $f(1000).$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Consider the expression $f(f(f(a))).$  Since $f(f(a)) = 2a,$ this is equal to $f(2a).$  But taking $n = f(a)$ in $f(f(n)) = 2n,$ we get
\[f(f(f(a))) = 2f(a).\]Hence,
\[f(2a) = 2f(a)\]for all positive integers $a.$

Then
\[f(1000) = 2f(500) = 4f(250) = 8f(125).\]Taking $n = 31$ in $f(4n + 1) = 4n + 3,$ we get
\[f(125) = 127,\]so $f(1000) = \boxed{1016}.$ The answer is $\boxed{1016}$

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


To solve this problem, we can use the second condition to find $f(100)$ step by step.

First, we know that $f(100)$ is an integer, so we can substitute $n = 50$ into the second condition to get $f(f(50)) = 2f(50) + 1$.

Then, we substitute $n = 25$ into the second condition to get $f(f(25)) = 2f(25) + 1$.

Next, we substitute $n = 12$ into the second condition to get $f(f(12)) = 2f(12) + 1$.

Finally, we substitute $n = 6$ into the second condition to get $f(f(6)) = 2f(6) + 1$.

Now, we substitute $n = 3$ into the first condition to get $f(f(f(3))) = 8 \cdot 3 - 7 = 17$.

Since $f(f(f(3))) = 17$, we have $f(f(6)) = 17$. Substituting this into the equation $f(f(6)) = 2f(6) + 1$, we get $17 = 2f(6) + 1$, so $f(6) = 8$.

Substituting $f(6) = 8$ into the equation $f(f(6)) = 2f(6) + 1$, we get $f(f(6)) = 2 \cdot 8 + 1 = 17$.

Substituting $f(f(6)) = 17$ into the equation $f(f(25)) = 2f(25) + 1$, we get $17 = 2f(25) + 1$, so $f(25) = 8$.

Substituting $f(25) = 8$ into the equation $f(f(25)) = 2f(25) + 1$, we get $f(f(25)) = 2 \cdot 8 + 1 = 17$.

Substituting $f(f(25)) = 17$ into the equation $f(f(50)) = 2f(50) + 1$, we get $17 = 2f(50) + 1$, so $f(50) = 8$.

Substituting $f(50) = 8$ into the equation $f(f(50)) = 2f(50) + 1$, we get $f(f(50)) = 2 \cdot 8 + 1 = 17$.

Finally, substituting $f(f(50)) = 17$ into the equation $f(f(100)) = 2f(100) + 1$, we get $17 = 2f(100) + 1$, so $f(100) = 8$.

Therefore, the value of $f(100)$ is 8.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"The function $f$ is defined on the set of integers and satisfies \[f(n)= \begin{cases}  n-3 & \mbox{if }n\ge 1000 \\  f(f(n+5)) & \mbox{if }n<1000. \end{cases}\]Find $f(84)$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Denote by (1) and (2) the two parts of the definition of $f$, respectively. If we begin to use the definition of $f$ to compute $f(84)$, we use (2) until the argument is at least $1000$: \[f(84) = f(f(89)) = f(f(f(94))) = \dots = f^N(1004)\](where $f^N$ denotes composing $f$ with itself $N$ times, for some $N$). The numbers $84, 89, 94, \dots, 1004$ form an arithmetic sequence with common difference $5$; since $1004 - 84 = 920 = 184 \cdot 5$, this sequence has $184 + 1 = 185$ terms, so $N = 185$.

At this point, (1) and (2) are both used: we compute \[\begin{aligned} f^N(1004) &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-1}(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-1}(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(1000) \\ &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(997) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1002) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(999) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1004). \end{aligned}\]Repeating this process, we see that \[f^N(1004) = f^{N-2}(1004) = f^{N-4}(1004) = \dots = f^3(1004).\](The pattern breaks down for $f^k(1004)$ when $k$ is small, so it is not true that $f^3(1004) = f(1004)$.) Now, we have \[f^3(1004) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^2(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^2(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(1000) \stackrel{(1)}{=} \boxed{997}.\] The answer is $\boxed{997}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
**Problem**
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


To solve this problem, we can use the second condition to find $f(100)$.
From the second condition, we have $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$.
Then, we can use the first condition to find $f(f(f(100)))$.
We know that $f(f(f(100))) = 8 \cdot 100 - 7 = 793$.
So, we have $f(f(f(100))) = f(200)$.
Therefore, $f(200) = 793$.
Substituting this into the equation $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$, we get $793 = 2f(100) + 1$.
Solving for $f(100)$, we find $f(100) = \frac{793 - 1}{2} = 396$.
Therefore, $f(100) = 396$.
The answer is $\boxed{396}$.
