Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.
2. Each term is a square of a difference, so the only way for each term to be zero is if the difference itself is zero.
3. Therefore, we have four equations to solve: $|x+y| - 10 = 0$, $|x-y| - 10 = 0$, $|x| - 8 = 0$, and $|y| - 8 = 0$.
4. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.
5. These points form a square with side length 16.
6. The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of the polygon is $16^2 = 256$.

Now let's write a Python script to calculate the area:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def square_area():
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = square_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.

2. Let's consider the first term: $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us four equations: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These equations represent the lines forming the sides of the square.

3. Now let's consider the second term: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us four more equations: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These equations represent the lines forming the sides of the square.

4. Combining the four sets of lines, we find that the points satisfying the original equation form a square with side length 10.

5. The area of a square is given by the square of the side length, so the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many square units are in the area of the triangle whose vertices are the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the curve $y = (x-3)^2 (x+2)$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we need to find where this curve intersects the $x$ and $y$ axes.  If $y=0$, then $(x-3)^2(x+2)=0$, which has solutions of $x=3$ and $x=-2$.  If $x=0$, then $y=(-3)^2(2)=18$.  So, the curve has two $x$-intercepts and one $y$-intercept.  The length of the base along the $x$-axis is $3-(-2)=5$.  The height from this base is equal to the $y$-intercept, 18.  The area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 5\cdot 18=\boxed{45}$. The answer is $\boxed{45}$

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The expression $A \cdot B = 0$ is true if and only if $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the given equation is satisfied if either of the following two conditions is met:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first condition to be true, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we find that the points that satisfy this condition are $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, and $(-5,-5)$.

For the second condition to be true, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations, we find that the points that satisfy this condition are $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

The convex polygon formed by these points is a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100.

The answer is: $100$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

The first term is zero when $|\pm x \pm y| - 10 = 0$, which simplifies to $|\pm x \pm y| = 10$. This gives us four equations: $|x + y| = 10$, $|x - y| = 10$, $|x| = 8$, and $|y| = 8$. 

The second term is zero when $|\pm x| - 8 = 0$ or $|\pm y| - 8 = 0$, which simplifies to $|x| = 8$ or $|y| = 8$.

The solutions to $|x + y| = 10$, $|x - y| = 10$, $|x| = 8$, and $|y| = 8$ are the vertices of a square with side length 10.

The area of a square with side length $s$ is $s^2$. Therefore, the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 100.
