Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The expression $A = ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ equals to zero if and only if at least one of the factors equals to zero.

2. The factor $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$ equals to zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This is only possible if $x = y = \pm 10$ or $x = -y = \pm 10$. So we have four lines: $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.

3. The factor $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ equals to zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This is only possible if $x = y = \pm 8$ or $x = -y = \pm 8$. So we have four lines: $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

4. The intersection of these lines form a square with side length 16.

5. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256.

    # This is only possible if x = y = ±10 or x = -y = ±10. So we have four lines: x + y = ±10 and x - y = ±10.
    # The factor (|x| - 8)^2 + (|y| - 8)^2 equals to zero if and only if |x| = 8 and |y| = 8.
    # This is only possible if x = y = ±8 or x = -y = ±8. So we have four lines: x = ±8 and y = ±8.
    # The intersection of these lines form a square with side length 16.

Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Let $w$ be the width of each of the identical rectangles. Since $PQ=3w$, $RS=2x$ and $PQ=RS$ (because $PQRS$ is a rectangle), then $2x = 3w$, or $$w=\frac{2}{3}x.$$ Therefore, the area of each of the five identical rectangles is $$x\left(\frac{2}{3}x\right)=\frac{2}{3}x^2.$$ Since the area of $PQRS$ is 4000 and it is made up of five of these identical smaller rectangles, then $$5\left(\frac{2}{3}x^2\right)=4000$$ or $$\frac{10}{3}x^2 = 4000$$ or $x^2 = 1200$ or $x \approx 34.6$ which, when rounded off to the nearest integer, is $\boxed{35}.$ The answer is $\boxed{35}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The equation $AB = 0$ is satisfied if and only if $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Thus the given equation is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ we get $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
From $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ we get $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
From $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ we get $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
From $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ we get $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

The solution set is the intersection of all sets described by these equations. The intersection of all these lines and lines formed by the combinations of these equations is a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many square units are in the area of the triangle whose vertices are the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the curve $y = (x-3)^2 (x+2)$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we need to find where this curve intersects the $x$ and $y$ axes.  If $y=0$, then $(x-3)^2(x+2)=0$, which has solutions of $x=3$ and $x=-2$.  If $x=0$, then $y=(-3)^2(2)=18$.  So, the curve has two $x$-intercepts and one $y$-intercept.  The length of the base along the $x$-axis is $3-(-2)=5$.  The height from this base is equal to the $y$-intercept, 18.  The area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 5\cdot 18=\boxed{45}$. The answer is $\boxed{45}$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. 

Let's consider the first expression: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This expression is equal to zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ must lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

Now let's consider the second expression: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This expression is equal to zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ must lie on the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$ or $x = -8$ and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

However, the intersection of the two squares is the set of points satisfying both conditions, which is the set of points enclosed by the smaller square with side length 10. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of the smaller square, which is 100.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

**Solution:** 


The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

Let's consider the first term: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This equation is satisfied only when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(8, 6)$, $(8, -6)$, $(-8, 6)$, and $(-8, -6)$.

Now, let's consider the second term: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This equation is satisfied only when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So, we have the same vertices as before.

So, the vertices of the polygon are $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(8, 6)$, $(8, -6)$, $(-8, 6)$, and $(-8, -6)$.

The polygon is a square with side length 10 units. The area of the square is $10^2 = 100$ square units. The answer is: $100$

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$ and the second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$.

For the first expression to be zero, both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)$ must be zero. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only way this can happen is if $x = y = \pm 10$ or $x = -y = \pm 10$. This gives us a square with side length 20, so its area is $20^2 = 400$.

For the second expression to be zero, both $(\vert x \vert - 8)$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)$ must be zero. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The only way this can happen is if $x = y = \pm 8$ or $x = -y = \pm 8$. This gives us a square with side length 16, so its area is $16^2 = 256$.

The area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of these two squares, so the area is $400 + 256 = 656$.

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. These four equations represent four lines in the plane. The intersection points of these lines are $(-10, 0)$, $(10, 0)$, $(0, -10)$, and $(0, 10)$.

Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. These four lines also intersect at the same four points: $(-10, 0)$, $(10, 0)$, $(0, -10)$, and $(0, 10)$.

Therefore, the points that satisfy the given equation are exactly the four points $(-10, 0)$, $(10, 0)$, $(0, -10)$, and $(0, 10)$. These four points form a square with side length 20. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.
The answer is: $\boxed{400}$
