Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.

The first term is zero when $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these equations are all the points in a square with side length 20 centered at the origin.

The second term is zero when $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are all the points in a square with side length 16 centered at the origin.

The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for. The side length of this square is the smaller of the two side lengths, which is 16. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, and it equals to zero if and only if both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these two equations are all points on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, or $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$. These four lines form a square with side length 10.

The second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$, and it equals to zero if and only if both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these two equations are all points on the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These four lines form a square with side length 16.

The convex polygon enclosed by the points satisfying the given equation is the intersection of the two squares, which is also a square. The side length of this square is the smaller of the two side lengths, which is 10. Therefore, the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Find the number of 10-tuples $(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{10})$ of real numbers such that
\[(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2 = \frac{1}{11}.\]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,
\begin{align*}
&[(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + \dots + 1^2 + 1^2)][(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2] \\
&\ge [(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + (x_2 - x_3) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10}]^2 = 1.
\end{align*}From the given condition, we have equality, so by the equality condition for Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[\frac{1 - x_1}{1} = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{1} = \frac{x_2 - x_3}{1} = \dots = \frac{x_9 - x_{10}}{1} = \frac{x_{10}}{1}.\]Let
\[d = 1 - x_1 = x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_3 = \dots = x_9 - x_{10} = x_{10}.\]Then
\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so
\[(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_{10}) = \left( \frac{10}{11}, \frac{9}{11}, \frac{8}{11}, \dots, \frac{1}{11} \right).\]In particular, there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. Let's consider each case separately.

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$. These are the equations of two parallel lines.

Case 2: $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$. These are the equations of two more parallel lines.

Case 3: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = 8$ or $x = -8$. These are the equations of two vertical lines.

Case 4: $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. These are the equations of two horizontal lines.

The intersection points of these lines form a rectangle with side lengths 16 and 20. The area of this rectangle is $16 \times 20 = 320$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 320. The answer is: $320$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many square units are in the area of the triangle whose vertices are the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the curve $y = (x-3)^2 (x+2)$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we need to find where this curve intersects the $x$ and $y$ axes.  If $y=0$, then $(x-3)^2(x+2)=0$, which has solutions of $x=3$ and $x=-2$.  If $x=0$, then $y=(-3)^2(2)=18$.  So, the curve has two $x$-intercepts and one $y$-intercept.  The length of the base along the $x$-axis is $3-(-2)=5$.  The height from this base is equal to the $y$-intercept, 18.  The area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 5\cdot 18=\boxed{45}$. The answer is $\boxed{45}$

**Problem:** 
"Find the number of 10-tuples $(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{10})$ of real numbers such that
\[(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2 = \frac{1}{11}.\]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,
\begin{align*}
&[(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + \dots + 1^2 + 1^2)][(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2] \\
&\ge [(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + (x_2 - x_3) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10}]^2 = 1.
\end{align*}From the given condition, we have equality, so by the equality condition for Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[\frac{1 - x_1}{1} = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{1} = \frac{x_2 - x_3}{1} = \dots = \frac{x_9 - x_{10}}{1} = \frac{x_{10}}{1}.\]Let
\[d = 1 - x_1 = x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_3 = \dots = x_9 - x_{10} = x_{10}.\]Then
\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so
\[(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_{10}) = \left( \frac{10}{11}, \frac{9}{11}, \frac{8}{11}, \dots, \frac{1}{11} \right).\]In particular, there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. Let's consider each case separately.

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these equations are all points on the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, $(-10, 0)$, and $(0, -10)$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are all points on the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, $(-8, 0)$, and $(0, -8)$.

The intersection of the two rectangles is a square with side length 10 (the maximum of 8 and 10). The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

**Solution:**


The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

The first term is zero when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two circles with radius 10 centered at $(0,0)$ and $(0,0)$ respectively.

The second term is zero when $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two circles with radius 8 centered at $(0,0)$ and $(0,0)$ respectively.

The intersection of these four circles forms a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256.

"Let $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_ 2= (-16,2).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that
\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as

Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Abs, solve, simplify

def area_of_polygon():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # The given equation is satisfied if either of the following two equations is satisfied:
    # 1) (|x + y| - 10)^2 + (|x - y| - 10)^2 = 0
    # 2) (|x| - 8)^2 + (|y| - 8)^2 = 0

    # For equation 1 to be satisfied, |x + y| = 10 and |x - y| = 10, which implies x = 0 and y = 0.
    # For equation 2 to be satisfied, |x| = 8 and |y| = 8, which implies -8 <= x <= 8 and -8 <= y <= 8.

    # The solution set of the given equation is the intersection of the solution sets of the above two equations.
    # Therefore, the polygon is a square with side length 16.

    side_length = 16
    area = side_length**2

    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256
