**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Find the number of 10-tuples $(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{10})$ of real numbers such that
\[(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2 = \frac{1}{11}.\]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,
\begin{align*}
&[(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + \dots + 1^2 + 1^2)][(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2] \\
&\ge [(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + (x_2 - x_3) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10}]^2 = 1.
\end{align*}From the given condition, we have equality, so by the equality condition for Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[\frac{1 - x_1}{1} = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{1} = \frac{x_2 - x_3}{1} = \dots = \frac{x_9 - x_{10}}{1} = \frac{x_{10}}{1}.\]Let
\[d = 1 - x_1 = x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_3 = \dots = x_9 - x_{10} = x_{10}.\]Then
\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so
\[(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_{10}) = \left( \frac{10}{11}, \frac{9}{11}, \frac{8}{11}, \dots, \frac{1}{11} \right).\]In particular, there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



This problem involves the concept of absolute value and the properties of absolute value to simplify the equations. The absolute value $|x|$ is defined as $x$ if $x \geq 0$, and $-x$ if $x < 0$. Thus, we can split the absolute value terms into two cases based on the sign of the expressions inside the absolute value. 

The equation to solve is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. This equation is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. 

Solving these four equations, we get the following points:
- $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \implies x + y = \pm 10$
- $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \implies x - y = \pm 10$
- $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \implies x = \pm 8$
- $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \implies y = \pm 8$

Solving these equations, we get the points:
- $(8, 2), (8, -2), (-8, 2), (-8, -2), (2, 8), (2, -8), (-2, 8), (-2, -8)$

These points form a square with side length $16$, so the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. 

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we first need to understand the given equation and the conditions that make it equal to zero. The equation is:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$
For the product of two terms to be zero, either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. So we have two cases:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This case implies that both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations gives us the vertices of a square with side length 20.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This case implies that both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these four equations gives us the vertices of a square with side length 16.

Now we have two squares, one with side length 20 and the other with side length 16. The area of a square is given by the square of its side length, so the area of the larger square is $20^2 = 400$ and the area of the smaller square is $16^2 = 256$. The convex polygon formed by the union of these two squares is the entire region where the equation is satisfied. Therefore, the area of this convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares, which is $400 + 256 = 656$.

So the area of the convex polygon is $656$. The answer is: $\boxed{656}$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The equation $AB = 0$ implies that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the given equation is satisfied if either of the following two conditions hold:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first condition to hold, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us four lines in the coordinate plane: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle with side lengths $20$ and $10\sqrt{2}$.

For the second condition to hold, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us four lines in the coordinate plane: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length $16$.

The intersection of the two sets of lines is the set of points that satisfy both conditions, which is the set of vertices of the polygon. The polygon is a rectangle with a smaller square inside it. To find the area of the polygon, we can find the area of the rectangle and subtract the area of the square.

The area of the rectangle is $20 \times 10\sqrt{2} = 200\sqrt{2}$. The area of the square is $16 \times 16 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the polygon is $200\sqrt{2} - 256$.

```python

    area_rectangle = 20 * 10 * sqrt(2)
    area_square = 16 * 16
    area_polygon = area_rectangle - area_square

    return area_polygon

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
-256 + 200*sqrt(2)
```
The area of the polygon is $-256 + 200\sqrt{2}$. However, the area cannot be negative. Let's re-evaluate the expression:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import simplify

def simplify_expression():
    """Simplify the expression: -256 + 200*sqrt(2)"""
    expr = -256 + 200*sqrt(2)
    simplified_expr = simplify(expr)

    return simplified_expr

result = simplify_expression()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS -256 + 200*sqrt(2)

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
-256 + 200*sqrt(2)
```
The simplified expression is still the same. This indicates that there might be a mistake in our calculations. Let's re-examine the problem and our solution.

Upon closer inspection, we realize that the second condition $(\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8)$ cannot be true simultaneously, because if $\vert x \vert = 8$, then $x$ must be $8$ or $-8$, and similarly for $y$. But if $x = 8$ and $y = 8$, then $x + y = 16 \neq 10$, and if $x = 8$ and $y = -8$, then $x - y = 16 \neq 10$. Therefore, the second condition cannot hold, and the only points that satisfy the given equation are those that satisfy the first condition.

So the polygon is a rectangle with side lengths $20$ and $10\sqrt{2}$. The area of the polygon is therefore $20 \times 10\sqrt{2} = 200\sqrt{2}$.

Let's correct our code:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import sqrt

def area_of_polygon():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    area_rectangle = 20 * 10 * sqrt(2)

    return area_rectangle

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
``````output

CODE RESULTS 200*sqrt(2)

INTERMEDIATE OUT :

200*sqrt(2)
```
The area of the polygon is $200\sqrt{2}$. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{200\sqrt{2}}$. However, this is not the final answer because we need to find the numerical value of this expression.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import N

def numerical_area():
    """Find the numerical value of the area of the polygon."""
    area = 200 * sqrt(2)
    numerical_area = N(area)

    return numerical_area

result = numerical_area()
print(result)
``````output

CODE RESULTS 282.842712474619

INTERMEDIATE OUT :

282.842712474619
```
The numerical value of the area of the polygon is approximately $282.84$. However, this value doesn't make sense in the context of the problem, as it's not a natural number. Let's re-examine our calculations.

Upon closer inspection, we realize that we made a mistake in our calculations. The area of the rectangle is $20 \times 10\sqrt{2} = 200\sqrt{2}$, but we need to find the area of the polygon, which is a square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$. The area of the square is $(10\sqrt{2})^2 = 200$.

Let's correct our code:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import sqrt

def area_of_polygon():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    side_length = 10 * sqrt(2)
    area_square = side_length**2

    return area_square

result = area_of_polygon()

The area of the polygon is $200$. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{200}$.

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


The problem is asking for the area of the convex polygon formed by the points that satisfy the equation. The equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, which means either of the expressions must be zero.

The first expression is $(|x + y| - 10)^2 + (|x - y| - 10)^2 = 0$. This expression is zero if and only if $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$. This forms a square with side length 20, centered at the origin, with vertices at $(\pm 10, 0)$ and $(0, \pm 10)$.

The second expression is $(|x| - 8)^2 + (|y| - 8)^2 = 0$. This expression is zero if and only if $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. This forms a square with side length 16, centered at the origin, with vertices at $(\pm 8, 0)$ and $(0, \pm 8)$.

The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for. This polygon is a square with side length 16, since the smaller square is completely contained within the larger square.

The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side, so the area of the convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Rational, simplify

def area_of_polygon():

    return area

result = area_of_polygon()

The area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$

Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Let $w$ be the width of each of the identical rectangles. Since $PQ=3w$, $RS=2x$ and $PQ=RS$ (because $PQRS$ is a rectangle), then $2x = 3w$, or $$w=\frac{2}{3}x.$$ Therefore, the area of each of the five identical rectangles is $$x\left(\frac{2}{3}x\right)=\frac{2}{3}x^2.$$ Since the area of $PQRS$ is 4000 and it is made up of five of these identical smaller rectangles, then $$5\left(\frac{2}{3}x^2\right)=4000$$ or $$\frac{10}{3}x^2 = 4000$$ or $x^2 = 1200$ or $x \approx 34.6$ which, when rounded off to the nearest integer, is $\boxed{35}.$ The answer is $\boxed{35}$

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The equation $AB=0$ is equivalent to $A=0$ or $B=0$. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The first two equations imply $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us four lines: $y = -x \pm 10$ and $y = x \pm 10$.
The last two equations imply $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us four lines: $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
The four lines $y = -x \pm 10$, $y = x \pm 10$, $x = \pm 8$, and $y = \pm 8$ enclose a rectangle with side lengths 16 and 20. Therefore, the area of the rectangle is $16 \times 20 = 320$. The answer is: $320$

\end{align*}From the given condition, we have equality, so by the equality condition for Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[\frac{1 - x_1}{1} = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{1} = \frac{x_2 - x_3}{1} = \dots = \frac{x_9 - x_{10}}{1} = \frac{x_{10}}{1}.\]Let
\[d = 1 - x_1 = x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_3 = \dots = x_9 - x_{10} = x_{10}.\]Then
\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so
\[(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_{10}) = \left( \frac{10}{11}, \frac{9}{11}, \frac{8}{11}, \dots, \frac{1}{11} \right).\]In particular, there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if at least one of the factors is zero. This happens if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$. These conditions describe four squares on the coordinate plane: one with side length 20 centered at the origin, and three with side length 16. The intersection of these squares is a convex octagon. The area of this octagon is the sum of the areas of the four squares minus the areas of the two overlapping squares (the ones with side length 16). The area of a square with side length $a$ is $a^2$, so the area of the large square is $20^2 = 400$, and the area of each of the smaller squares is $16^2 = 256$. The area of the overlap of two squares with side length 16 is the area of a square with side length 8 (since the center of each square is also the center of the other square), which is $8^2 = 64$. Therefore, the area of the octagon is $400 + 3 \cdot 256 - 2 \cdot 64 = 400 + 768 - 128 = 1040$. The answer is: $1040$

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either one of the expressions must be zero for the entire equation to be zero. This means that we can consider each expression separately and find the points that satisfy them.

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

By solving these equations, we find that the points that satisfy the equation are $(8,8)$, $(-8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, and $(-8,-8)$. These points form a square with side length $16$. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. So the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$
