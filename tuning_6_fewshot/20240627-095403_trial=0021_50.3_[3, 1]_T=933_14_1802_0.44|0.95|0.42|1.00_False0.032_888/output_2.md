**Problem:** 
"How many solutions does the equation \[\frac{(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)\dotsm(x-100)}{(x-1^2)(x-2^2)(x-3^2)\dotsm(x-100^2)} = 0\]have for $x$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Any solution to this equation must make the numerator of the left-hand side zero, while keeping the denominator non-zero. The numerator is zero when $x$ is one of the numbers $1, 2, 3, \dots, 100.$ However, for any value in this list that is a perfect square, the denominator will also be zero, so that value of $x$ will not be a root. Therefore, we want to find the number of integers in the list $1, 2, \dots, 100$ which are not perfect squares. The perfect squares in the list are $1^2, 2^2, \dots, 10^2,$ so there are $10$ perfect squares, and \[100 - 10 = \boxed{90}\]integers which are not perfect squares. The answer is $\boxed{90}$

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $1$. Therefore, $m = 100$.

However, we need to check if this value of $m$ actually gives us $4$ distinct solutions. Substituting $m = 100$ into the equation, we get $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=1$. This equation has $4$ distinct solutions: $x = 3$, $x = 1$, $x = -1$, and $x = -3$.

Therefore, the only value of $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $m = 100$.
The answer is: $100$

**Solution:** 



To solve this problem, we need to find the value of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

We start by considering the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. This equation can have at most $4$ distinct solutions.

We know that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=k$ (where $k$ is a positive constant) has $4$ distinct solutions when $0<k<1$. Therefore, we need to find the value of $m$ such that $\frac{m}{100}=k$ with $0<k<1$.

This implies that $0<\frac{m}{100}<1$, which simplifies to $0<m<100$.

Therefore, the value of $m$ that we are looking for is $m=100k$, where $0<k<1$. Since $k$ must be a positive constant less than $1$, the only value that satisfies this condition is $k=0.5$.

So, $m=100(0.5)=50$.

Thus, the value of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $50$. The answer is: $50$

## QUESTION 2 - 4

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"For certain ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ of real numbers, the system of equations
\[\begin{aligned} ax+by&=1 \\ x^2 + y^2 &= 50  \end{aligned}\]has at least one solution, and each solution is an ordered pair $(x,y)\,$ of integers. How many such ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ are there?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The graph of $ax+by=1$ is a line, while the graph of $x^2+y^2=50$ is a circle centered at the origin. Therefore, $(a, b)$ satisfies the conditions if and only if the line and circle intersect at least once, and they intersect only at lattice points (points with integer coordinates).

Knowing this, it makes sense to look for lattice points on the circle whose equation is $x^2+y^2=50$. Testing cases, we find that there are twelve lattice points on the circle: $(\pm 1, \pm 7)$, $(\pm 7, \pm 1)$, and $(\pm 5, \pm 5)$ (where the two $\pm$ signs in each pair are independent of each other).

There are $\tbinom{12}{2} = 66$ pairs of these points, and each pair determines a line. However, the graph of $ax+by=1$ can never pass through the origin $(0, 0)$, since if $x=y=0$, then $ax+by=0 \neq 1$. Therefore, the six pairs which consist of diametrically opposed points are invalid, since the line through them passes through the origin. This corrects our count to $66 - 6 = 60$.

In addition, for each of the twelve points, there is a line tangent to the circle at that point, so that the only solution to the system is that one point. This brings the final total to $60 + 12 = \boxed{72}$. The answer is $\boxed{72}$

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


This problem is a challenging problem in mathematics that requires a deep understanding of absolute value functions and their properties. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $0$ and $3$. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ takes on the values $0$, $1$, $2$, and $3$ exactly once as $x$ varies over the real numbers. Therefore, we have $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 3$, which implies $0 < m < 300$. The number of positive integers $m$ in this range is $299$.

So the answer is: $\boxed{299}$.

However, this problem is a bit tricky, and the solution provided above may not be completely correct. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $0$ and $3$. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ takes on the values $0$, $1$, $2$, and $3$ exactly once as $x$ varies over the real numbers. Therefore, we have $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 3$, which implies $0 < m < 300$. However, this argument assumes that the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is continuous, which is not the case. In fact, the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a jump discontinuity at $x=1$. This means that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can have four distinct solutions even if $\frac{m}{100}$ equals $0$, $1$, $2$, or $3$. Therefore, the correct solution to the problem is that the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions is equal to the number of positive integers from $1$ to $300$. This number is $300$.

So the correct answer is: $\boxed{300}$.
The answer is $\boxed{300}$.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, we need to understand the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. This equation has 4 distinct solutions, which means that the right side $\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal to 2. 

So we have $\frac{m}{100}=2$, then $m=200$.

Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions, which is 200.

So the answer is $1$.
The answer is: $1$

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, we need to understand the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. This equation has 4 distinct solutions.
2. We know that the absolute value function $\vert x \vert$ makes any negative number positive. So, we can split the equation into two cases: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.
3. For each of these cases, we can further split them into two sub-cases: $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
4. For each of these sub-cases, we can split them into two more sub-cases: $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 = -(2 + \frac{m}{100})$ and $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 = -(2 - \frac{m}{100})$.
5. Solving these equations for $x$, we get four solutions for $x$ in terms of $m$.
6. We need to find the value of $m$ for which these four solutions are distinct.

Now, let's write the python code to find the value of $m$:

```python

def find_m():
    m = symbols('m')
    # Solve the equations for x
    x1 = solve(m/100 + 2 + 1, m)

    x3 = solve(m/100 - 2 + 1, m)
    x4 = solve(-(m/100 - 2) + 1, m)
    
    # Check if the solutions are distinct

The output is $m$ which is not the expected result. This is because we are not checking the conditions for the solutions to be distinct. Let's modify the code to do that:

The perfect squares in the list are $1^2, 2^2, \dots, 10^2,$ so there are $10$ perfect squares, and \[100 - 10 = \boxed{90}\]integers which are not perfect squares. The answer is $\boxed{90}$

**Problem:** 
"For certain ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ of real numbers, the system of equations
\[\begin{aligned} ax+by&=1 \\ x^2 + y^2 &= 50  \end{aligned}\]has at least one solution, and each solution is an ordered pair $(x,y)\,$ of integers. How many such ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ are there?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The graph of $ax+by=1$ is a line, while the graph of $x^2+y^2=50$ is a circle centered at the origin. Therefore, $(a, b)$ satisfies the conditions if and only if the line and circle intersect at least once, and they intersect only at lattice points (points with integer coordinates).

Knowing this, it makes sense to look for lattice points on the circle whose equation is $x^2+y^2=50$. Testing cases, we find that there are twelve lattice points on the circle: $(\pm 1, \pm 7)$, $(\pm 7, \pm 1)$, and $(\pm 5, \pm 5)$ (where the two $\pm$ signs in each pair are independent of each other).

There are $\tbinom{12}{2} = 66$ pairs of these points, and each pair determines a line. However, the graph of $ax+by=1$ can never pass through the origin $(0, 0)$, since if $x=y=0$, then $ax+by=0 \neq 1$. Therefore, the six pairs which consist of diametrically opposed points are invalid, since the line through them passes through the origin. This corrects our count to $66 - 6 = 60$.

In addition, for each of the twelve points, there is a line tangent to the circle at that point, so that the only solution to the system is that one point. This brings the final total to $60 + 12 = \boxed{72}$. The answer is $\boxed{72}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solve, Abs

def count_solutions():
    """For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"""
    x = symbols('x')
    m = symbols('m', integer=True)
    count = 0

    for m_value in range(1, 101):  # m is a positive integer and less than or equal to 100
        equation = Abs(Abs(x - 1) - 2) - m_value / 100
        solutions = solve(equation, x)
        if len(solutions) == 4:  # count the number of solutions
            count += 1

    return count

result = count_solutions()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 100

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
100
```
The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $100$. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{100}$.
