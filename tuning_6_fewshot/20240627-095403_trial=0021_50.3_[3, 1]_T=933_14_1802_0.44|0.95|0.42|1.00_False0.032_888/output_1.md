**Problem:** 
"What is the minimum value of the expression $2x^2+3y^2+8x-24y+62$ for real $x$ and $y$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Rearranging the expression, we have  \[2x^2+8x+3y^2-24y+62\]We first complete the square in $x$. Factoring a 2 from the first two terms of the expression, we get  \[2(x^2+4x)+3y^2-24y+62\]In order for the expression inside the parenthesis to be a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(4/2)^2=4$ inside the parenthesis. Doing this, we have \[2(x^2+4x+4-4)+3y^2-24y+62 \Rightarrow 2(x+2)^2+3y^2-24y+54\]Now we complete the square in $y$. Factoring a 3 from the $y$ terms in the expression, we get \[2(x+2)^2+3(y^2-8y)+54\]In order for the expression inside the second parenthesis to be a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(8/2)^2=16$ inside the parenthesis. Doing this, we have \[2(x+2)^2+3(y^2-8y+16-16)+54 \Rightarrow 2(x+2)^2+3(y-4)^2+6\]Since the minimum value of $2(x+2)^2$ and $3(y-4)^2$ is $0$ (perfect squares can never be negative), the minimum value of the entire expression is $\boxed{6}$, and is achieved when $x=-2$ and $y=4$. The answer is $\boxed{6}$

**Problem**
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


This problem is a bit more complex than the previous ones, and it requires a bit more mathematical insight to solve it. However, it can be solved using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.

The given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$, which simplifies to $2|x-2y| = 40$. Therefore, $|x-2y| = 20$.

Now, let's consider the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite this as $5(x^2-2xy+y^2)+5y^2-13xy = 5(x-y)^2+5y^2-13xy$.

By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have $(1+4)(x-y)^2 \geq (1*x-2*y)^2 = (x-2y)^2$. Since we know that $|x-2y| = 20$, we have $(x-y)^2 \leq 400/5 = 80$.

Now, let's substitute this back into our expression: $5(x-y)^2+5y^2-13xy \geq 5*80+5y^2-13xy = 400+5y^2-13xy$.

We want to minimize this expression. To do this, we can use the fact that $5y^2-13xy = -13xy + 13xy + 5y^2 = 13(y^2 - \frac{13}{5}xy) + 5y^2 = 13(y - \frac{13}{10}x)^2 + \frac{111}{10}y^2$.

Since $(y - \frac{13}{10}x)^2 \geq 0$, the minimum value of $13(y - \frac{13}{10}x)^2 + \frac{111}{10}y^2$ is 0, which occurs when $y = \frac{13}{10}x$.

Substituting this back into our expression, we get $400+5y^2-13xy = 400+5(\frac{13}{10}x)^2-13x(\frac{13}{10}x) = 400+ \frac{91}{4}x^2 - \frac{169}{10}x^2 = 400 - \frac{78}{10}x^2$.

Since $x^2 \geq 0$, the minimum value of this expression is $400$, which occurs when $x=0$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $400$, given the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. The answer is: $400$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"What is the minimum value of the expression $x^2+y^2+2x-4y+8$ for real $x$ and $y$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Rearranging the expression, we have  \[x^2+2x+y^2-4y+8\]Completing the square in $x$, we need to add and subtract $(2/2)^2=1$. Completing the square in $y$, we need to add and subtract $(4/2)^2=4$. Thus, we have \[(x^2+2x+1)-1+(y^2-4y+4)-4+8 \Rightarrow (x+1)^2+(y-2)^2+3\]Since the minimum value of $(x+1)^2$ and $(y-2)^2$ is $0$ (perfect squares can never be negative), the minimum value of the entire expression is $\boxed{3}$, and is achieved when $x=-1$ and $y=2$. The answer is $\boxed{3}$

To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


```python

Rearranging the expression, we have  \[2x^2+8x+3y^2-24y+62\]We first complete the square in $x$. Factoring a 2 from the first two terms of the expression, we get  \[2(x^2+4x)+3y^2-24y+62\]In order for the expression inside the parenthesis to be a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(4/2)^2=4$ inside the parenthesis. Doing this, we have \[2(x^2+4x+4-4)+3y^2-24y+62 \Rightarrow 2(x+2)^2+3y^2-24y+54\]Now we complete the square in $y$. Factoring a 3 from the $y$ terms in the expression, we get \[2(x+2)^2+3(y^2-8y)+54\]In order for the expression inside the second parenthesis to be a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(8/2)^2=16$ inside the parenthesis. Doing this, we have \[2(x+2)^2+3(y^2-8y+16-16)+54 \Rightarrow 2(x+2)^2+3(y-4)^2+6\]Since the minimum value of $2(x+2)^2$ and $3(y-4)^2$ is $0$ (perfect squares can never be negative), the minimum value of the entire expression is $\boxed{6}$, and is achieved when $x=-2$ and $y=4$. The answer is $\boxed{6}$
