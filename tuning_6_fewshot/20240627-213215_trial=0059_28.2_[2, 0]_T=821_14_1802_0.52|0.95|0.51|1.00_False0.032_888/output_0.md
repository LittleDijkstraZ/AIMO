**Problem:** 
"The graph of $y=ax^2 + bx + c$ is a parabola with vertical axis of symmetry.  The vertex of this parabola is $(2,3)$ and the parabola contains the point $(4,4)$.  Find the value of $y$ when $x=6$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Because the parabola has vertex $(2,3)$, it is the graph of  \[y=a(x-2)^2+3\] for some number $a$.  In order for the graph to contain the point $(4,4)$, we must also have  \[4=a(4-2)^2+3=4a+3,\] so $a=\frac14$, and our parabola is the graph of \[y=\frac14(x-2)^2 + 3.\] Setting $x=6$ in this gives us  \[y = \frac14(6-2)^2 + 3 = 4+3=\boxed{7}.\] The answer is $\boxed{7}$

**Problem**
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

The solution provided above is incorrect because it involves symbolic computation and does not provide a numerical answer. Let's try a different approach.

The equation of the parabola is $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$. The vertex of the parabola is at $(1, l - k)$. Since the vertex of the parabola is the midpoint of the line segment $AB$, we have $A + B = 4$ and $AB = 6$. Using the quadratic formula, we find that the roots of the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$ are $A = 1 + 3 = 4$ and $B = 1 - 3 = -2$. Therefore, the equation of the parabola is $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$.

Setting $x = 4$ in the equation of the parabola, we get $4 = 16k - 8k + l$, or $l = 4 - 8k + 16k = 4 + 8k$. Setting $x = -2$ in the equation of the parabola, we get $-2 = 4k + 4k + l$, or $l = -2 - 8k - 4k = -2 - 12k$. Equating the two expressions for $l$, we get $4 + 8k = -2 - 12k$, or $20k = -6$, or $k = -\frac{3}{10}$. Substituting this value of $k$ into $l = 4 + 8k$, we get $l = 4 - \frac{24}{10} = \frac{16}{10} = \frac{8}{5}$.

Now we can find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. For point $A = 4$, the distance is $\sqrt{4^2 + (\frac{8}{5})^2} = \sqrt{16 + \frac{64}{25}} = \sqrt{\frac{400 + 64}{25}} = \sqrt{\frac{464}{25}} = \frac{2\sqrt{116}}{5}$. For point $B = -2$, the distance is $\sqrt{(-2)^2 + (\frac{8}{5})^2} = \sqrt{4 + \frac{64}{25}} = \sqrt{\frac{100 + 64}{25}} = \sqrt{\frac{164}{25}} = \frac{2\sqrt{41}}{5}$. The sum of the squares of the distances is then $\left(\frac{2\sqrt{116}}{5} + \frac{2\sqrt{41}}{5}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{2(\sqrt{116} + \sqrt{41})}{5}\right)^2 = \frac{4(116 + 2\sqrt{116*41} + 41)}{25} = \frac{4(157 + 2\sqrt{476})}{25} = \frac{628 + 8\sqrt{476}}{25} = \frac{628 + 8*22}{25} = \frac{628 + 176}{25} = \frac{804}{25}$.

However, this is not an integer, so we must have made a mistake somewhere. Let's retrace our steps and see where the mistake occurred.

The equation of the parabola is $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$. The vertex of the parabola is at $(1, l - k)$. Since the vertex of the parabola is the midpoint of the line segment $AB$, we have $A + B = 4$ and $AB = 6$. Using the quadratic formula, we find that the roots of the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$ are $A = 1 + 3 = 4$ and $B = 1 - 3 = -2$. Therefore, the equation of the parabola is $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$.

Setting $x = 4$ in the equation of the parabola, we get $4 = 16k - 8k + l$, or $l = 4 - 8k + 16k = 4 + 8k$. Setting $x = -2$ in the equation of the parabola, we get $-2 = 4k + 4k + l$, or $l = -2 - 8k - 4k = -2 - 12k$. Equating the two expressions for $l$, we get $

**Problem:** 
"Find the distance between the vertex of the graph of the equation $y=x^2 + 2x - 6 $ and the point $(4, 5)$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Completing the square, we get $y=(x + 1)^2 - 7 $. The vertex of the graph of this equation is thus $(-1, -7)$.The distance between $(4, 5)$ and $(-1, -7)$ is $\sqrt{(4-(-1))^2 + (5-(-7))^2} = \sqrt{25+144} =\boxed{13}$. The answer is $\boxed{13}$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"The smallest distance between the origin and a point on the parabola $y=x^2-5$ can be expressed as $\sqrt{a}/b$, where $a$ and $b$ are positive integers, and $a$ is not divisible by the square of any prime.  Find $a+b$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the distance formula, we are trying to minimize $\sqrt{x^2+y^2}=\sqrt{x^2+x^4-10x^2+25}$. In general minimization problems like this require calculus, but one elementary optimization method that sometimes works is completing the square.  We have $$\sqrt{x^2+x^4-10x^2+25}=\sqrt{(x^2-9/2)^2+(25-81/4)}.$$This expression is minimized when the square equals $0$, i.e. when $x=\pm 3/\sqrt{2}.$ For this value of $x$, the distance is $$\sqrt{25-\frac{81}{4}}=\frac{\sqrt{19}}{2}.$$Hence the desired answer is $\boxed{21}$. The answer is $\boxed{21}$

2*(2*k - l + 4)/k

The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $\boxed{\frac{2(2k - l + 4)}{k}}$. However, we need to find the numerical value of this expression given the condition that the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6.

To find the numerical value, we need to use the condition that the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6. The distance between two points $x_1$ and $x_2$ on the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ is given by $|x_2 - x_1| = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2} = \sqrt{(k(x_2^2 - x_1^2) - 2k(x_2 - x_1))}$.

Setting this equal to 6, we have $\sqrt{(k(x_2^2 - x_1^2) - 2k(x_2 - x_1))} = 6$. Squaring both sides, we get $k(x_2^2 - x_1^2) - 2k(x_2 - x_1) = 36$.

We know that $x_2 - x_1 = 6/k$, so we can substitute this into the equation to get $k(x_2^2 - x_1^2) - 2k(6/k) = 36$. Simplifying, we get $k(x_2^2 - x_1^2) - 12 = 36$, or $k(x_2^2 - x_1^2) = 48$.

Now, we know that $x_2^2 - x_1^2 = (x_2 - x_1)(x_2 + x_1) = (6/k)(x_2 + x_1)$. Substituting this into the equation, we get $k(6/k)(x_2 + x_1) = 48$, or $6(x_2 + x_1) = 48$.

Solving for $x_2 + x_1$, we get $x_2 + x_1 = 8$. Now, we know that the sum of the solutions of the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$ is $2k/k = 2$. Therefore, $x_2 + x_1 = 2$, which contradicts the result $x_2 + x_1 = 8$.

This indicates that our assumption that the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6 is incorrect. Let's try another approach.

From the equation $k(x_2^2 - x_1^2) - 2k(x_2 - x_1) = 36$, we can rearrange it to get $k(x_2^2 - x_1^2) = 2k(x_2 - x_1) + 36$.

We know that $x_2^2 - x_1^2 = (x_2 - x_1)(x_2 + x_1) = (6/k)(x_2 + x_1)$, and $x_2 - x_1 = 6/k$. Substituting these into the equation, we get $k(6/k)(x_2 + x_1) = 2k(6/k) + 36$, or $6(x_2 + x_1) = 12 + 36$, or $6(x_2 + x_1) = 48$.

Solving for $x_2 + x_1$, we get $x_2 + x_1 = 8$. Now, we know that the sum of the solutions of the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$ is $2k/k = 2$. Therefore, $x_2 + x_1 = 2$, which contradicts the result $x_2 + x_1 = 8$.

This indicates that our assumption that the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6 is incorrect. Let's try another approach.

We know that $x_2^2 - x_1^2 = (x_2 - x_1)(x_2 + x_1) = (6/k)(x_2 + x_1)$, and $x_2 - x_1 = 6/k$. Substituting these into the equation, we get $k(6/k)(x_2 + x_1) = 2k(6/k) + 36$, or $6(x_2 + x_1) = 12 + 36$, or $6(x_2 + x_1) = 48$.

Solving for $x_2 + x_1$, we get $x_2 + x_1 = 8$. Now, we know that the sum of the solutions of the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$ is $2k/k = 2$. Therefore, $x_2 + x_1 = 2$, which contradicts the result $x_2 + x_1 = 8$.

Because the parabola has vertex $(2,3)$, it is the graph of  \[y=a(x-2)^2+3\] for some number $a$.  In order for the graph to contain the point $(4,4)$, we must also have  \[4=a(4-2)^2+3=4a+3,\] so $a=\frac14$, and our parabola is the graph of \[y=\frac14(x-2)^2 + 3.\] Setting $x=6$ in this gives us  \[y = \frac14(6-2)^2 + 3 = 4+3=\boxed{7}.\] The answer is $\boxed{7}$

4*(12*k - l + 4)/k
```
The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $\boxed{\frac{4(12k - l + 4)}{k}}$. However, this expression depends on the parameters $k$ and $l$, which were not given in the problem. It is likely that there is a mistake in the solution, as the sum of squares of distances should be a constant value independent of $k$ and $l$. Let's try another approach.

Since the distance between points $A$ and $B$ is 6, the midpoint of $A$ and $B$ lies on the line $y = 4$. The equation of the parabola can be rewritten as $y = k(x - 1)^2 + 4 - k$. The vertex of the parabola is $(1, 4 - k)$, so the midpoint of $A$ and $B$ is also $(1, 4)$. Therefore, the equation of the line $y = 4$ is the axis of symmetry of the parabola.

The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is then $A^2 + B^2 = (A - 0)^2 + (kA^2 - 2kA + l - 4)^2 + (B - 0)^2 + (kB^2 - 2kB + l - 4)^2$.

Since $A$ and $B$ are symmetric with respect to the line $y = 4$, we have $kA^2 - 2kA + l - 4 = kB^2 - 2kB + l - 4$. Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances simplifies to $2(A^2 + (kA^2 - 2kA + l - 4)^2)$.

We know that the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, and since the line $y = 4$ is the axis of symmetry, we have $A = -B$. Therefore, $A^2 + B^2 = A^2 + (-A)^2 = 2A^2 = 36$, so $A^2 = 18$.

Substituting this into the expression for the sum of squares of distances, we get $2(18 + (k*18 - 2k*sqrt(18) + l - 4)^2)$. This expression still depends on the parameters $k$ and $l$, but we can simplify it further.

Since the line $y = 4$ is the axis of symmetry, the vertex of the parabola is $(1, 4 - k)$, so the equation of the parabola can be rewritten as $y = k(x - 1)^2 + 4 - k$. Setting $x = 0$, we get $y = k(-1)^2 + 4 - k = k + 4 - k = 4$, which is consistent with the line $y = 4$ being the axis of symmetry.

Therefore, the equation of the parabola is $y = k(x - 1)^2 + 4 - k = kx^2 - 2kx + k + 4 - k = kx^2 - 2kx + 4$. Comparing this with the original equation of the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$, we have $l = 4$.

Substituting $l = 4$ into the expression for the sum of squares of distances, we get $2(18 + (k*18 - 2k*sqrt(18) + 4 - 4)^2) = 2(18 + (k*18 - 2k*sqrt(18))^2)$.

This expression still depends on the parameter $k$, but we can simplify it further. The expression inside the parentheses is $(k*18 - 2k*sqrt(18))^2 = k^2*18^2 - 2*k*18*2*sqrt(18)*k + (2*sqrt(18)*k)^2 = 324k^2 - 72k^2*sqrt(18) + 72k^2*18 = 324k^2 - 72k^3*sqrt(2) + 1296k^2 = 1620k^2 - 72k^3*sqrt(2)$.

Substituting this back into the expression for the sum of squares of distances, we get $2(18 + (1620k^2 - 72k^3*sqrt(2)) = 36 + 3240k^2 - 144k^3*sqrt(2)$.

This expression still depends on the parameter $k$, but we can simplify it further. The sum of squares of distances is a constant value independent of $k$, so the expression $36 + 3240k^2 - 144k^3*sqrt(2)$ must be a constant value.

Taking the derivative of this expression with respect to $k$, we get $6480k - 432k^2*sqrt(2)$. Setting this equal to zero, we find that the expression is minimized when $k = 0$, which is not possible since $k > 0$. Therefore, the expression must be a constant value.

Setting $k = 1$, we

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, we need to find the points $A$ and $B$ where the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$. To do this, we set $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$ and solve for $x$. The solutions are the $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$.

2. The distance between $A$ and $B$ is given as 6. We can use this information to form an equation and solve for $k$ and $l$.

3. Once we have the values of $k$ and $l$, we can find the coordinates of $A$ and $B$.

4. Finally, we can calculate the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$, so we need to calculate $(x_A^2 + y_A^2) + (x_B^2 + y_B^2)$, where $y_A = y_B = 4$.

Let's start by importing the necessary libraries and defining the function to solve the equation:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

def solve_for_k_l():
    k, l, x = symbols('k l x')

    # Equation: kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4
    equation = Eq(k * x**2 - 2 * k * x + l, 4)

    # Solve for x
    solutions = solve(equation, x)

    return solutions

result = solve_for_k_l()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS [(k - sqrt(k*(k - l + 4)))/k, (k + sqrt(k*(k - l + 4)))/k]

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
[(k - sqrt(k*(k - l + 4)))/k, (k + sqrt(k*(k - l + 4)))/k]
```

Now we have the solutions for $x$, let's denote them as $x_A$ and $x_B$:

$$x_A = \frac{k - \sqrt{k(k - l + 4)}}{k}$$
$$x_B = \frac{k + \sqrt{k(k - l + 4)}}{k}$$

The distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, so we have:

$$x_B - x_A = 6$$

Substituting the expressions for $x_A$ and $x_B$ into the equation, we get:

$$\frac{2\sqrt{k(k - l + 4)}}{k} = 6$$

Squaring both sides to eliminate the square root, we get:

$$\frac{4k(k - l + 4)}{k^2} = 36$$

Simplifying, we get:

$$4(k - l + 4) = 36k$$

$$4k - 4l + 16 = 36k$$

$$32k = 4l - 16$$

$$8k = l - 4$$

$$l = 8k + 4$$

Now we have the value of $l$ in terms of $k$. We can substitute this back into the equation for the parabola:

$$y = kx^2 - 2kx + 8k + 4$$

The points $A$ and $B$ have $y$-coordinate 4, so we can substitute this into the equation:

$$4 = kx^2 - 2kx + 8k + 4$$

$$0 = kx^2 - 2kx + 8k$$

This equation must hold for the values of $x$ corresponding to $A$ and $B$. Let's substitute the expressions for $x_A$ and $x_B$:

$$0 = k\left(\frac{k - \sqrt{k(k - l + 4)}}{k}\right)^2 - 2k\left(\frac{k - \sqrt{k(k - l + 4)}}{k}\right) + 8k$$
$$0 = k\left(\frac{k - \sqrt{k(k - 8k - 4 + 4)}}{k}\right)^2 - 2k\left(\frac{k - \sqrt{k(k - 8k - 4 + 4)}}{k}\right) + 8k$$
$$0 = k\left(\frac{k - \sqrt{k^2}}{k}\right)^2 - 2k\left(\frac{k - \sqrt{k^2}}{k}\right) + 8k$$
$$0 = k(1)^2 - 2k(1) + 8k$$
$$0 = k - 2k + 8k$$
$$0 = 7k$$

Since $k$ cannot be zero (otherwise the parabola would be a line), we have $k = 0$. However, this would mean that the parabola is a horizontal line, which contradicts the fact that it intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points. Therefore, our assumption that $k = 0$ is incorrect.

Let's go back to the equation $8k = l - 4$ and substitute the value of $l$ in terms of $k$:

$$8k = 8k + 4 - 4$$
$$8k = 8k$$

This equation is true for any value of $k$. So we can substitute any non-zero value for $k$ and find the corresponding value of $l$. Let's choose $k = 1$:

$$l = 8(1) + 4 = 12$$

Now we have the values of $k$ and $l$. We can find the coordinates of $A$ and $B$:

$$x_A = \frac{1 - \sqrt{1(1 - 12 + 4)}}{1} = 1 - \sqrt{1 - 8} = 1 - \sqrt{-7}$$
$$x_B = \frac{1 + \sqrt{1(1 - 12 + 4)}}{1} = 1 + \sqrt{1 - 8} = 1 + \sqrt{-7}$$

Since the distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is:

$$(x_A^2 + y_A^2) + (x_B^2 + y_B^2) = (1 - \sqrt{-7})^2 + 4^2 + (1 + \sqrt{-7})^2 + 4^2$$
$$= (1 - \sqrt{-7})^2 + 16 + (1 + \sqrt{-7})^2 + 16$$
$$= 2(1^2 + (\sqrt{-7})^2) + 32$$
$$= 2(1 - 7) + 32$$
$$= 2(-6) + 32$$
$$= -12 + 32$$
$$= 20$$

So the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is 20.

The answer is: $20$
