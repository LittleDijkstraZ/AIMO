**Problem:** 
"How many integers are solutions to the equation $$(x-2)^{(25-x^2)}=1?$$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
We need some basic facts from number theory: $a^0 = 1$ for any $a,$ $1^b = 1$ for any $b,$ and $(-1)^c = 1$ if $c$ is an even integer. Unless the base is a complex number (which is excluded since we are looking for integer solutions), there are no other ways to get an RHS of $1.$ Thus, either the exponent is zero $($giving the equation $25 - x^2 = 0),$ the base is $1$ $($giving $x -2 = 1),$ or the base is $-1$ and the exponent is even $($giving the simultaneous equations $x - 2 = -1$ and $25 - x^2 = 2n$ for some integer $n).$ Solving the first equation gives $x = \pm 5,$ and solving the second gives $x = 3.$ The third equation implies that $x = 1,$ in which case $25 - x^2 = 24$ is indeed even, so $x = 1$ is a valid solution. In all, there are $\boxed{4}$ integer solutions. The answer is $\boxed{4}$

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


The problem asks for how many positive integers $m$ the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

To solve this problem, we can use the property of absolute value function that it splits into two cases based on the value inside the absolute value being positive or negative. We can then solve the equation for each case and count the number of distinct solutions.

Here is a Python script to solve this problem:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

def count_solutions(m):
    x = symbols('x')
    equation = Eq(abs(abs(x - 1) - 2), m/100)
    solutions = solve(equation, x)
    return len(set(solutions))

count = 0
for m in range(1, 101):  # m is a positive integer from 1 to 100
    if count_solutions(m) == 4:
        count += 1

print(count)
```

CODE RESULTS 100

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
100
```
The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $100$. However, we need to find the number of such $m$ for which the equation has exactly $4$ distinct solutions.

We can manually check the values of $m$ to find the ones that give exactly $4$ distinct solutions. After checking, we find that the values of $m$ that give exactly $4$ distinct solutions are $1, 2, 3, ..., 100$. Therefore, the number of such positive integers $m$ is $100$.

The answer is: $100$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many solutions does the equation \[\frac{(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)\dotsm(x-100)}{(x-1^2)(x-2^2)(x-3^2)\dotsm(x-100^2)} = 0\]have for $x$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Any solution to this equation must make the numerator of the left-hand side zero, while keeping the denominator non-zero. The numerator is zero when $x$ is one of the numbers $1, 2, 3, \dots, 100.$ However, for any value in this list that is a perfect square, the denominator will also be zero, so that value of $x$ will not be a root. Therefore, we want to find the number of integers in the list $1, 2, \dots, 100$ which are not perfect squares. The perfect squares in the list are $1^2, 2^2, \dots, 10^2,$ so there are $10$ perfect squares, and \[100 - 10 = \boxed{90}\]integers which are not perfect squares. The answer is $\boxed{90}$

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we need to find the value of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. 

We can start by analyzing the equation. The expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is equal to a constant value $\frac{m}{100}$. This constant value must be positive, as the absolute value function always returns a non-negative value. 

Let's denote the constant value as $k = \frac{m}{100}$, so the equation becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = k$. 

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = k$ has four distinct solutions when $k = 1$. 

To see why this is the case, let's consider the graph of $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. The graph is a V-shape with the vertex at $(1, 2)$. The graph of $y = k$ intersects the graph of $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ at four distinct points when $k = 1$. 

Therefore, the value of $m$ that satisfies the condition is $m = 100 \times 1 = 100$.

So, the only positive integer value of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $100$. The answer is: $100$

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we need to find the value of $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions.

First, let's rewrite the equation as $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $1$ or $2$.

If $\frac{m}{100}=1$, then $m=100$.
If $\frac{m}{100}=2$, then $m=200$.

So, the value of $m$ that makes the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have four distinct solutions is either $100$ or $200$.

However, since we are asked for the number of positive integers $m$, the value of $m$ must be a positive integer. Therefore, the value of $m$ that satisfies the condition is $200$.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions is $1$.
The answer is: $1$

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"

Assistant:

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $2$. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a shape of a "V" with the "valleys" at $x=1-2=\boxed{-1}$ and $x=1+2=3$, and the distance between the valleys is $3-(-1)=4$. Therefore, for the equation to have four distinct solutions, the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be strictly between $1$ and $2$.

This gives us the inequality $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Multiplying all sides of the inequality by $100$ gives $100 < m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from $101$ to $199$, inclusive. To find the number of such integers, we subtract the smallest integer in the range from the largest integer in the range and add $1$. This gives us $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions is $99$. The answer is: $99$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many distinct solutions are there to the equation $|x-7| = |x+1|$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
If $|x-7| = |x+1|$, then either $x-7 = x+1$ or $x-7 = -(x+1)$.  Simplifying $x-7=x+1$ gives $0=8$, which has no solutions, so no values of $x$ satisfy $x-7 = x+1$.  If $x-7 = -(x+1)$, then $x-7 = -x-1$, so $2x = 6$, which gives $x=3$.  So, there is $\boxed{1}$ solution.

Challenge: See if you can find a quick solution to this problem by simply thinking about the graphs of $y=|x-7|$ and $y=|x+1|$. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Solution:** 



To solve this problem, we can use the fact that the equation $| |x-1|-2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 1 and 2. This is because the expression $| |x-1|-2|$ can take on exactly 4 distinct values (1, 2, and the two values in the interval (0, 1)) when the right side of the equation is in the interval (1, 2). Therefore, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be in this interval, which gives $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Multiplying all sides of the inequalities by 100 yields $100 < m < 200$. The positive integers in this range are the possible values of $m$.

To find the number of such integers, we can simply subtract the smallest integer larger than 100 from the largest integer smaller than 200, which is $200 - 101 = 99$. Therefore, there are 99 positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions.

The answer is: $99$
