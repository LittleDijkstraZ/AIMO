**Example**

**Problem:** 
"The graph of $y=ax^2 + bx + c$ is a parabola with vertical axis of symmetry.  The vertex of this parabola is $(2,3)$ and the parabola contains the point $(4,4)$.  Find the value of $y$ when $x=6$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Because the parabola has vertex $(2,3)$, it is the graph of  \[y=a(x-2)^2+3\] for some number $a$.  In order for the graph to contain the point $(4,4)$, we must also have  \[4=a(4-2)^2+3=4a+3,\] so $a=\frac14$, and our parabola is the graph of \[y=\frac14(x-2)^2 + 3.\] Setting $x=6$ in this gives us  \[y = \frac14(6-2)^2 + 3 = 4+3=\boxed{7}.\] The answer is $\boxed{7}$

CODE RESULTS 2*(18*k - l + 4)/k

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
2*(18*k - l + 4)/k
```
The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $\boxed{\frac{2(18k - l + 4)}{k}}$.

However, we also know that the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6. Using the distance formula, we have:
\[(x_2 - x_1)^2 = (6)^2 = 36.\]
Expanding and simplifying, we get:
\[((x_2 + x_1)^2 - 4*x_1*x_2) = 36.\]
Since $x_1$ and $x_2$ are the roots of the parabola, we know that $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1*x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$. Substituting these into the equation above, we get:
\[(2^2 - 4*\frac{l - 4}{k}) = 36.\]
Simplifying, we have:
\[4 - \frac{4(l - 4)}{k} = 36.\]
Multiplying through by $k$, we get:
\[4k - 4(l - 4) = 36k.\]
Expanding and simplifying, we have:
\[4k - 4l + 16 = 36k.\]
Rearranging, we get:
\[32k = 4l - 16.\]
Dividing by 4, we have:
\[8k = l - 4.\]
Adding 4 to both sides, we get:
\[l = 8k + 4.\]
Substituting this into the expression for the sum of squares of distances, we have:
\[sum\_of\_squares = \frac{2(18k - (8k + 4) + 4)}{k} = \frac{2(10k)}{k} = 20.\]
So the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is 20. The answer is $\boxed{20}$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"The graph of the quadratic $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ is a parabola that passes through the points $(-1,7)$, $(5,7)$, and $(6,10)$.  What is the $x$-coordinate of the vertex of the parabola?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
We could substitute the points into the equation $y = ax^2 + bx + c$, solve for $a$, $b$, and $c$, and then complete the square to find the coordinates of the vertex.

However, a much faster way is to recognize that two of the points, namely $(-1,7)$ and $(5,7)$, have the same $y$-coordinate.  Therefore, these two points are symmetric about the parabola's axis of symmetry.  The axis must pass through the midpoint of the segment connecting these two symmetric points, so the axis must pass through $\left(\frac{-1+5}{2},\frac{7+7}{2}\right)$, which is $(2,7)$.  Therefore, the axis of symmetry is a vertical line through $(2,7)$.  This line is the graph of the equation $x=2$.  The axis of symmetry also passes through the vertex of the parabola, so the $x$-coordinate of the vertex is $\boxed{2}$. The answer is $\boxed{2}$

The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $4 - 2k$. However, we know that $k > 0$ (since it's a parameter), and $k$ cannot be negative because it's a distance. Therefore, we must have $k = 1$. Substituting $k = 1$ into the expression for the sum of squares, we get $4 - 2*1 = 2$. So the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $2$. The answer is: $2$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $\mathcal{P}$ be the parabola in the plane determined by the equation $y = x^2.$  Suppose a circle $\mathcal{C}$ intersects $\mathcal{P}$ at four distinct points.  If three of these points are $(-28,784),$ $(-2,4),$ and $(13,169),$ find the sum of the distances from the focus of $\mathcal{P}$ to all four of the intersection points."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Let the four intersection points be $(a,a^2),$ $(b,b^2),$ $(c,c^2),$ and $(d,d^2).$  Let the equation of the circle be
\[(x - k)^2 + (y - h)^2 = r^2.\]Substituting $y = x^2,$ we get
\[(x - k)^2 + (x^2 - h)^2 = r^2.\]Expanding this equation, we get a fourth degree polynomial whose roots are $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ and $d.$  Furthermore, the coefficient of $x^3$ is 0, so by Vieta's formulas, $a + b + c + d = 0.$

We are given that three intersection points are $(-28,784),$ $(-2,4),$ and $(13,196),$ so the fourth root is $-((-28) + (-2) + 13) = 17.$

The distance from the focus to a point on the parabola is equal to the distance from the point to the directrix, which is $y = -\frac{1}{4}.$  Thus, the sum of the distances is
\[784 + \frac{1}{4} + 4 + \frac{1}{4} + 169 + \frac{1}{4} + 17^2 + \frac{1}{4} = \boxed{1247}.\] The answer is $\boxed{1247}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step.

**Problem:** 
"The graph of $y=ax^2 + bx + c$ is a parabola with vertical axis of symmetry.  The vertex of this parabola is $(2,3)$ and the parabola contains the point $(4,4)$.  Find the value of $y$ when $x=6$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Because the parabola has vertex $(2,3)$, it is the graph of  \[y=a(x-2)^2+3\] for some number $a$.  In order for the graph to contain the point $(4,4)$, we must also have  \[4=a(4-2)^2+3=4a+3,\] so $a=\frac14$, and our parabola is the graph of \[y=\frac14(x-2)^2 + 3.\] Setting $x=6$ in this gives us  \[y = \frac14(6-2)^2 + 3 = 4+3=\boxed{7}.\] The answer is $\boxed{7}$

The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is given by the expression:
\[Abs\left(\frac{k - \sqrt{k(k - l + 4)}}{k}\right)^2 + Abs\left(\frac{k + \sqrt{k(k - l + 4)}}{k}\right)^2.\]
However, we know that the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, which is given by the difference of the roots:
\[Abs\left(\frac{k + \sqrt{k(k - l + 4)}}{k} - \frac{k - \sqrt{k(k - l + 4)}}{k}\right) = 6.\]
Simplifying this equation gives:
\[2*\frac{\sqrt{k(k - l + 4)}}{k} = 6.\]
Solving for $l$ in terms of $k$ gives:
\[l = k - \frac{9k^2}{4}.\]
Substituting this into the expression for the sum of the squares of the distances gives:
\[Abs\left(\frac{k - \sqrt{k(k - k + \frac{9k^2}{4} + 4)}}{k}\right)^2 + Abs\left(\frac{k + \sqrt{k(k - k + \frac{9k^2}{4} + 4)}}{k}\right)^2.\]

\[Abs\left(\frac{k - \sqrt{\frac{9k^2}{4}}}{k}\right)^2 + Abs\left(\frac{k + \sqrt{\frac{9k^2}{4}}}{k}\right)^2 = 2.\]
Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is 2. The answer is: $2$

**Problem:** 
"Find the distance between the vertex of the graph of the equation $y=x^2 + 2x - 6 $ and the point $(4, 5)$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Completing the square, we get $y=(x + 1)^2 - 7 $. The vertex of the graph of this equation is thus $(-1, -7)$.The distance between $(4, 5)$ and $(-1, -7)$ is $\sqrt{(4-(-1))^2 + (5-(-7))^2} = \sqrt{25+144} =\boxed{13}$. The answer is $\boxed{13}$

    # Since y1 = y2 = 4, the sum is x1^2 + 16 + x2^2 + 16 = x1^2 + x2^2 + 32
    # The distance between A and B is 6, so (x2 - x1)^2 = 36
    # Expanding and simplifying, we get x1^2 - 2*x1*x2 + x2^2 = 36
    # Substituting x1^2 + x2^2 = x1^2 + (6 + x1)^2 = 2x1^2 + 12x1 + 36
    # We get 2x1^2 + 12x1 + 36 - 2x1*(6 + x1) + 36 = 36
    # Simplifying, we get 2x1^2 + 12x1 + 36 - 12x1 - 2x1^2 + 36 = 36
    # Simplifying further, we get 72 = 36, which is a contradiction
    # So we must have made a mistake somewhere. Let's try again.

    # The distance between A and B is 6, so (x2 - x1)^2 = 36
    # Expanding and simplifying, we get x1^2 - 2*x1*x2 + x2^2 = 36
    # Substituting x2 = x1 + 6, we get x1^2 - 2*x1*(x1 + 6) + (x1 + 6)^2 = 36
    # Simplifying, we get x1^2 - 2x1^2 - 12x1 + x1^2 + 12x1 + 36 = 36
    # Simplifying further, we get 0 = 0, which is true but doesn't help us.
    # Let's try another approach.

    # (sqrt(x1^2 + 16))^2 + (sqrt((x1 + 6)^2 + 16))^2 = x1^2 + 16 + (x1 + 6)^2 + 16
    # Simplifying, we get x1^2 + 16 + x1^2 + 12x1 + 36 + 16 = 2x1^2 + 12x1 + 68
    # Since the sum of the squares of the distances is the same for both A and B,
    # we can take the average of the sum of the squares of the distances for A and B.
    # The average is (2x1^2 + 12x1 + 68)/2 = x1^2 + 6x1 + 34
    # To find the value of x1 that minimizes the sum of the squares of the distances,
    # we can take the derivative of x1^2 + 6x1 + 34 with respect to x1 and set it equal to 0.
    # The derivative is 2x1 + 6, so setting it equal to 0 gives x1 = -3.
    # However, x1 cannot be negative since it represents a distance, so we must have made a mistake.
