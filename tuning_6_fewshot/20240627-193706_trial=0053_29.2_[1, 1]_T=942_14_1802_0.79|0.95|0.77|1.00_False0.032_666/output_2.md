**Problem:** 
"How many distinct solutions are there to the equation $|x-7| = |x+1|$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
If $|x-7| = |x+1|$, then either $x-7 = x+1$ or $x-7 = -(x+1)$.  Simplifying $x-7=x+1$ gives $0=8$, which has no solutions, so no values of $x$ satisfy $x-7 = x+1$.  If $x-7 = -(x+1)$, then $x-7 = -x-1$, so $2x = 6$, which gives $x=3$.  So, there is $\boxed{1}$ solution.

Challenge: See if you can find a quick solution to this problem by simply thinking about the graphs of $y=|x-7|$ and $y=|x+1|$. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**



We need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has $4$ distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ represents a family of piecewise linear functions, where the number of pieces is determined by the number of times the absolute value function is applied. The equation has $4$ distinct solutions when the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, is equal to the difference between the slopes of the two lines in the piecewise function.

The slopes of the two lines are $1$ and $-1$, so the difference between the slopes is $2$. Therefore, we need $\frac{m}{100}=2$, which gives $m=200$.

def count_m():
    """For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"""
    # The value of m for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions
    m = 200

    # The number of positive integers less than or equal to m
    num_m = int(m // 1)

    return num_m

The number of positive integers less than or equal to $200$ is $200$. Therefore, there are $200$ positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. The answer is: $200$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many integers are solutions to the equation $$(x-2)^{(25-x^2)}=1?$$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
We need some basic facts from number theory: $a^0 = 1$ for any $a,$ $1^b = 1$ for any $b,$ and $(-1)^c = 1$ if $c$ is an even integer. Unless the base is a complex number (which is excluded since we are looking for integer solutions), there are no other ways to get an RHS of $1.$ Thus, either the exponent is zero $($giving the equation $25 - x^2 = 0),$ the base is $1$ $($giving $x -2 = 1),$ or the base is $-1$ and the exponent is even $($giving the simultaneous equations $x - 2 = -1$ and $25 - x^2 = 2n$ for some integer $n).$ Solving the first equation gives $x = \pm 5,$ and solving the second gives $x = 3.$ The third equation implies that $x = 1,$ in which case $25 - x^2 = 24$ is indeed even, so $x = 1$ is a valid solution. In all, there are $\boxed{4}$ integer solutions. The answer is $\boxed{4}$

The value of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is a positive integer. However, the question asks for the number of such positive integers $m$. From the above computation, it seems that there are $100$ positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions. So the number of such positive integers $m$ is $100$. The answer is: $100$

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**



This problem is a bit complex and requires a careful analysis of the absolute value function and its properties. Let's break down the problem:

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. The expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ represents a function that has a "V" shape with the vertex at $x=1$. The height of the "V" is 2, and the value of the function is 0 when $x=1\pm2$, i.e., $x=3$ or $x=-1$.

For the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be strictly less than 2 and strictly greater than 0. Thus, $0<\frac{m}{100}<2$, which implies $0<m<200$. The only positive integer $m$ in this range is $1$.

Therefore, the only value of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is $m=1$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def find_m():
    """Find the value of m for which the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has 4 distinct solutions."""

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



To solve this problem, we need to understand that the equation $| |x-1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 1 and 2. This is because the expression on the left side of the equation, $| |x-1| - 2|$, can take on values between 1 and 2 only. Therefore, $\frac{m}{100}$ should be strictly greater than 1 and strictly less than 2.

This means that $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which implies $100 < m < 200$.

Now we need to find how many positive integers $m$ are there in the range (100, 200). We can find the number of these integers by subtracting the smallest integer in the range from the largest integer in the range and then subtract 1.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def find_m():
    lower_bound = 100
    upper_bound = 200

    # Find the number of integers in the range (lower_bound, upper_bound)
    number_of_m = upper_bound - lower_bound - 1

    return number_of_m

number_of_m = find_m()
print(number_of_m)
```

**Solution:** 


The first step to solve this problem is to understand the structure of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. 

This equation has four distinct solutions when the right-hand side $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $2$. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a graph that is a 'V' shape with the 'valleys' at $x=3$ and $x=-1$. When $\frac{m}{100}=2$, there are four distinct solutions to the equation. 

Therefore, we need to find the value of $m$ such that $\frac{m}{100}=2$. 

Multiplying both sides by $100$ gives $m=200$.

So the only positive integer value of $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is $200$.

The answer is: $200$

**Solution:** 



This problem involves understanding the behavior of the absolute value function and finding the number of solutions to an equation. To solve the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, we first need to consider the possible values of $\vert x-1 \vert$. The absolute value function $\vert x-1 \vert$ can take on any value greater than or equal to 0. So, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ can take on any value greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 2. This means that $\frac{m}{100}$ must be in the interval $[0, 2]$. Therefore, the possible values for $m$ are in the interval $[0, 200]$.

Now, we need to find the number of solutions to the equation for each value of $m$. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is in the interval $(0, 2)$. This means that $m$ must be in the interval $(0, 200)$.

So, we need to count the number of positive integers $m$ in the interval $(0, 200)$. This is simply the number of positive integers from 1 to 200. The number of such integers is 200. However, we are asked for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation has 4 distinct solutions. From the above analysis, we know that this occurs when $m$ is in the interval $(0, 200)$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 200.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def count_positive_integers():
    """For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"""
    lower_bound = 1
    upper_bound = 200
    count = upper_bound - lower_bound + 1
    return count
