**Problem:** 
"Let $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_ 2= (-16,2).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that
\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as
\[\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1.\]Find $h + k + a + b.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


The equation is given as:
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0\]
For this equation to hold, either one of the factors must be zero. Therefore, we have two sets of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

Solving the first set of equations:

- $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which gives us two lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.
- $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us two lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$, and two lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

Solving the second set of equations:

- $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which gives us two lines $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.
- $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us two lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$, and two lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

These lines enclose a square with side length 16. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $\boxed{256}$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many square units are in the area of the triangle whose vertices are the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the curve $y = (x-3)^2 (x+2)$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we need to find where this curve intersects the $x$ and $y$ axes.  If $y=0$, then $(x-3)^2(x+2)=0$, which has solutions of $x=3$ and $x=-2$.  If $x=0$, then $y=(-3)^2(2)=18$.  So, the curve has two $x$-intercepts and one $y$-intercept.  The length of the base along the $x$-axis is $3-(-2)=5$.  The height from this base is equal to the $y$-intercept, 18.  The area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 5\cdot 18=\boxed{45}$. The answer is $\boxed{45}$

**Solution:** 



To solve this problem, we first need to understand the properties of absolute value functions and the conditions under which their product is zero. 

The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is zero if and only if both terms are zero. 

For the first term, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, this can only happen if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. 

For the second term, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, this can only happen if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. 

These conditions define a square with side length 20, since $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ defines a square with side length 20 centered at the origin, and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ defines a square with side length 16 centered at the origin. 

The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.

```python

def area_of_polygon():
    # The side length of the square is 20

    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 400

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output

The area of the convex polygon is $400$. The answer is $\boxed{400}$.

**Problem:** 
"Five identical rectangles are arranged to form a larger rectangle $PQRS$, as shown.  The area of $PQRS$ is $4000$.  What is the length, $x$, rounded off to the nearest integer? [asy]
real x = 1; real w = 2/3;

draw(left--right);
label("$x$", (x/2, -0.1), S);

[/asy]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Let $w$ be the width of each of the identical rectangles. Since $PQ=3w$, $RS=2x$ and $PQ=RS$ (because $PQRS$ is a rectangle), then $2x = 3w$, or $$w=\frac{2}{3}x.$$ Therefore, the area of each of the five identical rectangles is $$x\left(\frac{2}{3}x\right)=\frac{2}{3}x^2.$$ Since the area of $PQRS$ is 4000 and it is made up of five of these identical smaller rectangles, then $$5\left(\frac{2}{3}x^2\right)=4000$$ or $$\frac{10}{3}x^2 = 4000$$ or $x^2 = 1200$ or $x \approx 34.6$ which, when rounded off to the nearest integer, is $\boxed{35}.$ The answer is $\boxed{35}$

**Solution:** 


The problem is asking for the area of a polygon formed by the set of points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the given equation. The equation is a product of two terms, each of which is a square of the absolute value of a difference minus a constant. 

The value of a square is zero if and only if the value inside the square is zero. Therefore, the given equation is satisfied if and only if one of the following conditions holds:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8) = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8) = 0$.
2. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8) = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8) \neq 0$.
3. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8) \neq 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8) = 0$.
4. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8) \neq 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8) \neq 0$.
5. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) \neq 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8) = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8) = 0$.
6. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) \neq 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8) = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8) \neq 0$.
7. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) \neq 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8) \neq 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8) = 0$.
8. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) \neq 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8) \neq 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8) \neq 0$.
9. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8) = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) \neq 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8) = 0$.
10. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8) = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) \neq 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8) \neq 0$.
11. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8) \neq 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) \neq 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8) = 0$.
12. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8) \neq 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) \neq 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8) \neq 0$.
13. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) \neq 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8) = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) \neq 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8) = 0$.
14. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) \neq 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8) = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) \neq 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8) \neq 0$.
15. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) \neq 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8) \neq 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) \neq 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8) = 0$.
16. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) \neq 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8) \neq 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) \neq 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8) \neq 0$.

By solving each of these conditions, we find that the set of points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the given equation are the points satisfying either $|x| = 8$ or $|y| = 8$ or $|x + y| = 10$. These are the equations of four squares whose vertices are at $(\pm 8, 0)$, $(0, \pm 8)$, and $(\pm 5, \pm 5)$. The area of the convex polygon formed by the intersection of these squares is the sum of the areas of these squares minus the areas of the four overlapping triangles.

The side length of each square is 16, so the area of each square is $16^2 = 256$. Since there are four squares, the total area of the squares is $4 \times 256 = 1024$.

Each overlapping triangle is a right triangle with legs of length 8, so its area is $\frac{1}{2} \times 8 \times 8 = 32$. Since there are four overlapping triangles, their total area is $4 \times 32 = 128$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $1024 - 128 = 896$. The answer is: 896

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. If a product is zero, one of the terms must be zero. So we have two cases to consider: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

2. If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.

3. If $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.

4. If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$, which implies $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.

5. If $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

6. By analyzing all the combinations, we can plot these points on a coordinate plane and connect them to form a polygon.

7. The resulting polygon is a square with side length 20, so its area is $20^2 = 400$.

The area of the convex polygon is 400. The answer is: $400$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The given equation is a product of two terms equals zero, which means either of the terms must be zero. This gives us two systems of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
2. One of the terms $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2$ is not zero.

For the first system of equations, we have:

- $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$
- This gives us the points $(8, 0), (0, 8), (-8, 0), (0, -8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (8, 8), (-8, -8)$.

For the second system of equations, one of the terms must be non-zero. However, this is not possible because if any of the terms are non-zero, the product of the terms would not be zero.

So the only possible solutions are the points we found from the first system of equations. These points form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if both factors are zero.
The first factor is zero when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.
The second factor is zero when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
By solving these equations, we find that the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equation are the vertices of a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256.
