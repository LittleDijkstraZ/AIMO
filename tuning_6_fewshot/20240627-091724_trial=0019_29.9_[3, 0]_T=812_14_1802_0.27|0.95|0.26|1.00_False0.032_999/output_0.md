**Problem:** 
"Let $\mathcal{P}$ be the parabola in the plane determined by the equation $y = x^2.$  Suppose a circle $\mathcal{C}$ intersects $\mathcal{P}$ at four distinct points.  If three of these points are $(-28,784),$ $(-2,4),$ and $(13,169),$ find the sum of the distances from the focus of $\mathcal{P}$ to all four of the intersection points."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Let the four intersection points be $(a,a^2),$ $(b,b^2),$ $(c,c^2),$ and $(d,d^2).$  Let the equation of the circle be
\[(x - k)^2 + (y - h)^2 = r^2.\]Substituting $y = x^2,$ we get
\[(x - k)^2 + (x^2 - h)^2 = r^2.\]Expanding this equation, we get a fourth degree polynomial whose roots are $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ and $d.$  Furthermore, the coefficient of $x^3$ is 0, so by Vieta's formulas, $a + b + c + d = 0.$

We are given that three intersection points are $(-28,784),$ $(-2,4),$ and $(13,196),$ so the fourth root is $-((-28) + (-2) + 13) = 17.$

The distance from the focus to a point on the parabola is equal to the distance from the point to the directrix, which is $y = -\frac{1}{4}.$  Thus, the sum of the distances is
\[784 + \frac{1}{4} + 4 + \frac{1}{4} + 169 + \frac{1}{4} + 17^2 + \frac{1}{4} = \boxed{1247}.\] The answer is $\boxed{1247}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, we need to find the intersection points of the parabola and the line $y = 4$. This means we set $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$ and solve for $x$.

2. We know that the points $A$ and $B$ are distance 6 apart, so we can use the distance formula to set up an equation. The distance between two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is $\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$. Here, $y_1 = y_2 = 4$, so the equation simplifies to $\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2} = 6$, or $(x_2 - x_1) = 6$.

3. Now, we need to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. So, we need to find $(x_1^2 + y_1^2) + (x_2^2 + y_2^2)$. Since $y_1 = y_2 = 4$, this simplifies to $x_1^2 + 16 + x_2^2 + 16 = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32$.

4. Now, we need to substitute the solutions of the intersection points into the equation from step 3.

5. To solve this problem, we can use sympy. The steps are as follows:

   a. Define the variables $k$, $l$, $x_1$, and $x_2$.
   
   b. Set up the equation for the intersection points and solve for $x_1$ and $x_2$.
   
   c. Substitute the solutions of $x_1$ and $x_2$ into the equation from step 3.
   
   d. Simplify the expression and evaluate it numerically.

Here is the entire script:

```python

def calculate_distance_sum():
    k, l, x1, x2 = symbols('k l x1 x2')

    equation_2 = Eq(k*x2**2 - 2*k*x2 + l, 4)

    # Solve for x1 and x2
    solutions = solve((equation, equation_2), (x1, x2))

    # Substitute the solutions into the equation from step 3
    distance_sum = (solutions[0][0]**2 + 16) + (solutions[1][0]**2 + 16)

    # Simplify the expression and evaluate it numerically

**Problem:** 
"The graph of $y=ax^2 + bx + c$ is a parabola with vertical axis of symmetry.  The vertex of this parabola is $(2,3)$ and the parabola contains the point $(4,4)$.  Find the value of $y$ when $x=6$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Because the parabola has vertex $(2,3)$, it is the graph of  \[y=a(x-2)^2+3\] for some number $a$.  In order for the graph to contain the point $(4,4)$, we must also have  \[4=a(4-2)^2+3=4a+3,\] so $a=\frac14$, and our parabola is the graph of \[y=\frac14(x-2)^2 + 3.\] Setting $x=6$ in this gives us  \[y = \frac14(6-2)^2 + 3 = 4+3=\boxed{7}.\] The answer is $\boxed{7}$

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, we need to find the points of intersection between the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ and the line $y = 4$. To do this, we set the two equations equal to each other and solve for $x$:

$$4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l.$$

Rearranging the equation gives us:

$$kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0.$$

This is a quadratic equation, and we know that the solutions to this equation are the x-coordinates of the points of intersection. Let's denote these solutions as $x_1$ and $x_2$. We are given that the distance between these two points is 6, so we have:

$$|x_2 - x_1| = 6.$$

From the quadratic formula, we know that:

$$x_{1,2} = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{(2k)^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k} = 1 \pm \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k} = 1 \pm \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}}{2k}.$$

So, we have:

$$x_2 - x_1 = \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}}{k} = 6.$$

Squaring both sides gives:

$$36 = \frac{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}{k^2}.$$

Multiplying through by $k^2$ gives:

$$36k^2 = 4k^2 - 4kl + 16k.$$

Rearranging terms gives:

$$32k^2 + 4kl - 16k = 0.$$

Now, we need to solve this equation for $l$. We can use the quadratic formula again:

$$l = \frac{-32k \pm \sqrt{(32k)^2 - 4*4*(-16k)}}{8} = \frac{-32k \pm \sqrt{1024k^2 + 256k}}{8} = \frac{-32k \pm \sqrt{1024k^2 + 256k}}{8}.$$

Since $l > 0$, we take the positive root:

$$l = \frac{-32k + \sqrt{1024k^2 + 256k}}{8}.$$

Now that we have the value of $l$, we can find the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The coordinates of $A$ and $B$ are $(x_1, 4)$ and $(x_2, 4)$, respectively. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is given by $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. So, the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin are $\sqrt{x_1^2 + 4^2}$ and $\sqrt{x_2^2 + 4^2}$, respectively.

The sum of the squares of these distances is:

$$(\sqrt{x_1^2 + 4^2})^2 + (\sqrt{x_2^2 + 4^2})^2 = x_1^2 + 16 + x_2^2 + 16 = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32.$$

We know that $x_2 - x_1 = 6$, so $(x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 + (x_1)^2 = 36$. Adding $2x_1x_2$ to both sides gives:

$$(x_1)^2 + 2x_1x_2 + (x_2)^2 = 36 + 2x_1x_2.$$

We also know that $(x_1 + x_2)^2 = (x_1)^2 + 2x_1x_2 + (x_2)^2$. So, we have:

$$(x_1 + x_2)^2 = 36 + 2x_1x_2.$$

But from the quadratic formula, we know that $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{-(-2k)}{k} = 2$. So, we have:

$$4 = 36 + 2x_1x_2.$$

Solving for $2x_1x_2$ gives:

$$2x_1x_2 = -32.$$

Substituting this into the expression for the sum of the squares of the distances gives:

$$x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32 = -16 + 32 = 16.$$

So, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is 16. The answer is: $16$

    # (sqrt(x1^2 + y1^2))^2 + (sqrt(x2^2 + y2^2))^2 = x1^2 + y1^2 + x2^2 + y2^2
    # Since y1 = y2 = 4, the sum is x1^2 + 16 + x2^2 + 16 = x1^2 + x2^2 + 32
    # The difference of the squares of two numbers a and b is (a - b)^2 = (a + b)^2 - 4ab
    # Here, a = x1 and b = x2, and |x1 - x2| = 6
    # So, (x1 + x2)^2 = (x1 - x2)^2 + 4x1*x2 = 36 + 4x1*x2
    # Therefore, x1*x2 = ((x1 + x2)^2 - 36) / 4
    # The sum of the squares of the distances is then x1^2 + x2^2 + 32 = (x1 + x2)^2 - 2x1*x2 + 32
    # Substituting x1 + x2 = -b/a and x1*x2 = c/a from the quadratic equation, we get

    # Simplifying this equation gives l = 10k
    # Substituting l = 10k into the equation of the parabola, we get

    # Substituting l = 10k into the equation of the parabola, we get

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Find the distance between the vertex of the graph of the equation $y=x^2 + 2x - 6 $ and the point $(4, 5)$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Completing the square, we get $y=(x + 1)^2 - 7 $. The vertex of the graph of this equation is thus $(-1, -7)$.The distance between $(4, 5)$ and $(-1, -7)$ is $\sqrt{(4-(-1))^2 + (5-(-7))^2} = \sqrt{25+144} =\boxed{13}$. The answer is $\boxed{13}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


```python
