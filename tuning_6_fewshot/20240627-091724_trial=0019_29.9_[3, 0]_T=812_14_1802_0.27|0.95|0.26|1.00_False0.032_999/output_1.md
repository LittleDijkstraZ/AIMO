**Problem:** 
"If $x + 2y= 4$ and $xy = -8$, what is the value of $x^2 + 4y^2$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
We see that $(x + 2y)^2 = (x^2 + 4y^2) + 4xy = 4^2 = 16$. We want to find $x^2 + 4y^2$ and are given $xy = -8$. So, $x^2 + 4y^2 + 4xy = x^2 + 4y^2 + 4(-8) = 16$. It follows that $x^2 + 4y^2 = \boxed{48}$. The answer is $\boxed{48}$

**Problem**
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


This problem is a bit complex and requires a bit of algebraic manipulation to solve. However, we can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to solve it.

The given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$, which simplifies to $2|x-2y| = 40$, or $|x-2y| = 20$.

Now, let's consider the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite this as $5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x-2y)^2 + 4xy] - 8xy = 5(x-2y)^2 + 12xy$.

By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have $(1^2 + (-2)^2)(x^2 + y^2) \geq (x - 2y)^2$, or $5(x^2 + y^2) \geq (x - 2y)^2$.

Since $|x - 2y| = 20$, we have $(x - 2y)^2 = 400$. Therefore, $5(x^2 + y^2) \geq 400$, or $x^2 + y^2 \geq 80$.

Substituting this into the expression $5(x-2y)^2 + 12xy$, we get $5(400) + 12xy = 2000 + 12xy$.

To minimize this expression, we need to minimize $12xy$. Since $x^2 + y^2 \geq 80$, by the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality again, we have $(1^2 + 1^2)(x^2 + y^2) \geq (x + y)^2$, or $2(x^2 + y^2) \geq (x + y)^2$.

Therefore, $x^2 + y^2 \geq \frac{(x + y)^2}{2}$. By the triangle inequality, we have $|x + y| \leq |x| + |y|$, so $(x + y)^2 \leq (|x| + |y|)^2 \leq (x^2 + y^2) + 2|xy|$.

Substituting this into the inequality $x^2 + y^2 \geq \frac{(x + y)^2}{2}$, we get $x^2 + y^2 \geq \frac{(x^2 + y^2) + 2|xy|}{2}$, or $x^2 + y^2 \geq 2|xy|$.

Since $x^2 + y^2 \geq 80$, we have $80 \geq 2|xy|$, or $|xy| \leq 40$. Therefore, $-40 \leq xy \leq 40$.

To minimize $12xy$, we should minimize $xy$. Since $-40 \leq xy \leq 40$, the minimum value of $xy$ is $-40$.

Substituting this into the expression $2000 + 12xy$, we get $2000 + 12(-40) = 2000 - 480 = 1520$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $1520$. The answer is: $1520$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, we need to find the relationship between $x$ and $y$ from the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. This is a bit tricky, but we can use the property of absolute value to simplify it. We know that $|a - b| = |b - a|$, so we can rewrite the equation as $|x-2y| + |2x-y| = 40$.

2. Now, we can use the property of absolute value again to split the absolute values into two cases:
   - Case 1: $x - 2y + 2x - y = 40$, which simplifies to $3x - 3y = 40$.
   - Case 2: $x - 2y - (2x - y) = 40$, which simplifies to $-x + y = 40$.

3. We can solve these two cases to find the relationship between $x$ and $y$. For Case 1, we have $3x - 3y = 40$, which simplifies to $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$. For Case 2, we have $-x + y = 40$, which simplifies to $x - y = -40$.

4. From these two cases, we can see that the only possible solution is the one from Case 1, because the relationship $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$ is consistent with the original equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.

5. Now, we can substitute $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to simplify it. We get $5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x - y)^2 + 2xy] - 8xy = 5[(\frac{40}{3})^2 + 2xy] - 8xy$.

6. To find the minimum value of this expression, we can take the derivative with respect to $xy$ and set it to zero. The derivative of $5[(\frac{40}{3})^2 + 2xy] - 8xy$ with respect to $xy$ is $10 - 8 = 2$. Since the derivative is not zero, this expression does not have a minimum or maximum value.

7. However, we can use the fact that $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$ to express $xy$ in terms of $x$ and $y$. From $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$, we have $y = x - \frac{40}{3}$. Substituting this into $xy$, we get $x(x - \frac{40}{3}) = x^2 - \frac{40}{3}x$.

8. Now, we can substitute $x^2 - \frac{40}{3}x$ into the expression $5[(\frac{40}{3})^2 + 2xy] - 8xy$ to get a function of $x$ only. This simplifies to $5[(\frac{40}{3})^2 + 2(x^2 - \frac{40}{3}x)] - 8(x^2 - \frac{40}{3}x)$.

9. To find the minimum value of this function, we can take the derivative with respect to $x$ and set it to zero. The derivative of $5[(\frac{40}{3})^2 + 2(x^2 - \frac{40}{3}x)] - 8(x^2 - \frac{40}{3}x)$ with respect to $x$ is $20x - \frac{800}{3}$. Setting this to zero gives $x = \frac{40}{3}$.

10. Substituting $x = \frac{40}{3}$ into $y = x - \frac{40}{3}$, we get $y = 0$.

11. Finally, we can substitute $x = \frac{40}{3}$ and $y = 0$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to find the minimum value. This gives $5(\frac{40}{3})^2 = \frac{8000}{9}$.

So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $\frac{8000}{9}$. However, this is not a positive integer, so we must have made a mistake somewhere.

Let's go back and re-examine our steps. We made a mistake in step 7 when we expressed $xy$ in terms of $x$ and $y$. The correct expression is $xy = x(x - \frac{40}{3}) = x^2 - \frac{40}{3}x$.

Now, let's correct this and re-evaluate the problem.

1. First, we need to find the relationship between $x$ and $y$ from the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. This is a bit tricky, but we can use the property of absolute value to simplify it. We know that $|a - b| = |b - a|$, so we can rewrite the equation as $|x-2y| + |2x-y| = 40$.

2. Now, we can use the property of absolute value again to split the absolute values into two cases:
   - Case 1: $x - 2y + 2x - y = 40$, which simplifies to $3x - 3y = 40$.
   - Case 2: $x - 2y - (2x - y) = 40$, which simplifies to $-x + y = 40$.

3. We can solve these two cases to find the relationship between $x$ and $y$. For Case 1, we have $3x - 3y = 40$, which simplifies to $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$. For Case 2, we have $-x + y = 40$, which simplifies to $x - y = -40$.

4. From these two cases, we can see that the only possible solution is the one from Case 1, because the relationship $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$ is consistent with the original equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.

5. Now, we can substitute $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to simplify it. We get $5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x - y)^2 + 2xy] - 8xy = 5[(\frac{40}{3})^2 + 2xy] - 8xy$.

6. To find the minimum value of this expression, we can take the derivative with respect to $xy$ and set it to zero. The derivative of $5[(\frac{40}{3})^2 + 2xy] - 8xy$ with respect to $xy$ is $10 - 8 = 2$. Since the derivative is not zero, this expression does not have a minimum or maximum value.

7. However, we can use the fact that $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$ to express $xy$ in terms of $x$ and $y$. From $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$, we have $y = x - \frac{40}{3}$. Substituting this into $xy$, we get $x(x - \frac{40}{3}) = x^2 - \frac{40}{3}x$.

**Problem**
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we can use the method of completing the square. First, let's rewrite the given expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $(5x^2-8xy+5y^2)$. Then we can complete the square for the $x$ and $y$ terms:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, simplify

def minimum_value():
    x, y = symbols('x y')
    expr = 5*x**2 - 8*x*y + 5*y**2
    completed_square = simplify((x - y)**2 + 4*y**2)

    return completed_square

result = minimum_value()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 4*y**2 + (x - y)**2

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
4*y**2 + (x - y)**2
```
The completed square form of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $4y^2 + (x - y)^2$. Now, we need to find the minimum value of this expression under the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.

The condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$, which simplifies to $|x-2y| + |x-2y| = 40$, or $2|x-2y| = 40$. Therefore, $|x-2y| = 20$.

Since the absolute value of a real number is always non-negative, we have $x - 2y = \pm 20$. We can solve this equation for $x$ to get $x = 2y \pm 20$.

Now, substitute $x = 2y \pm 20$ into the completed square form of the expression:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, simplify

def minimum_value():
    y = symbols('y')
    expr = 4*y**2 + ((2*y + 20) - y)**2
    simplified_expr = simplify(expr)

    return simplified_expr

result = minimum_value()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 4*y**2 + (y + 20)**2

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
4*y**2 + (y + 20)**2
```
The expression $4y^2 + (y + 20)^2$ represents the value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. To find the minimum value of this expression, we can take the derivative with respect to $y$ and set it equal to zero:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, diff, solve

def minimum_value():
    y = symbols('y')
    expr = 4*y**2 + (y + 20)**2
    derivative = diff(expr, y)
    critical_points = solve(derivative, y)

    return critical_points

result = minimum_value()
print(result)
``````output

CODE RESULTS [-4]

INTERMEDIATE OUT :

[-4]
```
The critical point is $y = -4$. Substitute $y = -4$ into the expression $4y^2 + (y + 20)^2$ to find the minimum value:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols

def minimum_value():
    y = symbols('y')
    expr = 4*y**2 + (y + 20)**2
    min_value = expr.subs(y, -4)

    return min_value

result = minimum_value()
print(result)
``````output

CODE RESULTS 320

INTERMEDIATE OUT :

320
```
The minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $320$.
The answer is $\boxed{320}$.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, we need to solve the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. This equation is equivalent to $|x-2y| = 20 - |y-2x|$. 

2. We can split this into two cases: 
   a. If $x - 2y \geq 0$ and $y - 2x \geq 0$, then $x - 2y = 20 - (y - 2x)$.
   b. If $x - 2y < 0$ or $y - 2x < 0$, then $-(x - 2y) = 20 - (y - 2x)$.

3. Solving these two cases, we get two equations:
   a. $x - 2y = 20 - y + 2x \Rightarrow y = -20$.
   b. $-x + 2y = 20 - y + 2x \Rightarrow 3y = 20 \Rightarrow y = \frac{20}{3}$.

4. Substituting these values of $y$ into the equation $|x - 2y| = 20 - |y - 2x|$, we get two values of $x$:
   a. For $y = -20$, $x = 40$.
   b. For $y = \frac{20}{3}$, $x = \frac{40}{3}$.

5. Now, we substitute these values of $x$ and $y$ into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ to find the minimum value:
   a. For $x = 40$ and $y = -20$, $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = 5(40)^2 + 5(-20)^2 - 8(40)(-20) = 8000$.
   b. For $x = \frac{40}{3}$ and $y = \frac{20}{3}$, $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = 5\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 + 5\left(\frac{20}{3}\right)^2 - 8\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)\left(\frac{20}{3}\right) = \frac{8000}{9}$.

6. Comparing these two values, we see that the minimum value is $\frac{8000}{9}$. However, this is not a positive integer.

7. Let's go back and check our work. We made a mistake in step 3 when solving the cases. The correct equations should be:
   a. $x - 2y = 20 + y - 2x \Rightarrow 3x = 3y + 20 \Rightarrow x = y + \frac{20}{3}$.
   b. $-x + 2y = 20 + y - 2x \Rightarrow x = y - 20$.

8. Substituting these values of $x$ into the equation $|x - 2y| = 20 - |y - 2x|$, we get two values of $y$:
   a. For $x = y + \frac{20}{3}$, $y = -\frac{20}{3}$.
   b. For $x = y - 20$, $y = 20$.

9. Substituting these values of $y$ into the equation $x = y + \frac{20}{3}$ or $x = y - 20$, we get the corresponding values of $x$:
   a. For $y = -\frac{20}{3}$, $x = -\frac{20}{3}$.
   b. For $y = 20$, $x = 0$.

10. Substituting these values of $x$ and $y$ into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$, we get the minimum value:
   a. For $x = -\frac{20}{3}$ and $y = -\frac{20}{3}$, $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = 5\left(-\frac{20}{3}\right)^2 + 5\left(-\frac{20}{3}\right)^2 - 8\left(-\frac{20}{3}\right)\left(-\frac{20}{3}\right) = \frac{8000}{9}$.
   b. For $x = 0$ and $y = 20$, $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = 5(0)^2 + 5(20)^2 - 8(0)(20) = 2000$.

11. Comparing these two values, we see that the minimum value is $2000$. This is a positive integer.

So, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $2000$.

The answer is: $2000$

**Problem:** 
"What is the minimum value of the expression $x^2+y^2-6x+4y+18$ for real $x$ and $y$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Rearranging the expression, we have  \[x^2-6x+y^2+4y+18\]Completing the square in $x$, we need to add and subtract $(6/2)^2=9$. Completing the square in $y$, we need to add and subtract $(4/2)^2=4$. Thus, we have \[(x^2-6x+9)-9+(y^2+4y+4)-4+18 \Rightarrow (x-3)^2+(y+2)^2+5\]Since the minimum value of $(x-3)^2$ and $(y+2)^2$ is $0$ (perfect squares can never be negative), the minimum value of the entire expression is $\boxed{5}$, and is achieved when $x=3$ and $y=-2$. The answer is $\boxed{5}$

**Problem**
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


This problem is a bit tricky to solve directly, but we can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to solve it.

The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states that for any real numbers $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$ and $b_1, b_2, ..., b_n$, we have
\[(a_1^2 + a_2^2 + ... + a_n^2)(b_1^2 + b_2^2 + ... + b_n^2) \geq (a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 + ... + a_nb_n)^2.\]

Let's apply this inequality to our problem. Let $a_1 = x$, $a_2 = y$, $b_1 = 1$, and $b_2 = -2$. Then we have
\[(x^2 + y^2)(1^2 + (-2)^2) \geq (x - 2y)^2.\]
Simplifying the left side gives
\[(x^2 + y^2)(1 + 4) \geq (x - 2y)^2 \Rightarrow 5(x^2 + y^2) \geq (x - 2y)^2.\]
Similarly, let $a_1 = y$, $a_2 = x$, $b_1 = -2$, and $b_2 = 1$. Then we have
\[(y^2 + x^2)((-2)^2 + 1^2) \geq (y - 2x)^2.\]
Simplifying the left side gives
\[(y^2 + x^2)(4 + 1) \geq (y - 2x)^2 \Rightarrow 5(y^2 + x^2) \geq (y - 2x)^2.\]
Adding these two inequalities together gives
\[10(x^2 + y^2) \geq (x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2.\]
We are given that $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$, so we can substitute this into the inequality to get
\[10(x^2 + y^2) \geq 40^2 = 1600.\]
Dividing both sides by 10 gives
\[x^2 + y^2 \geq 160.\]
Now we want to minimize $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$. We can rewrite this as
\[5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy = 5(x^2 + y^2) - 4(2xy) = 5(x^2 + y^2) - 4[(x + y)^2 - (x^2 + y^2)] = 9(x^2 + y^2) - 4(x + y)^2.\]
Since $x^2 + y^2 \geq 160$, we want to minimize $9(x^2 + y^2) - 4(x + y)^2$.
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we know that $(x + y)^2 \leq 2(x^2 + y^2)$, so
\[9(x^2 + y^2) - 4(x + y)^2 \geq 9(x^2 + y^2) - 4(2)(x^2 + y^2) = 1(x^2 + y^2).\]
Since $x^2 + y^2 \geq 160$, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is $160$. The answer is: $160$

**Problem:** 
"What is the minimum value of the expression $2x^2+3y^2+8x-24y+62$ for real $x$ and $y$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Rearranging the expression, we have  \[2x^2+8x+3y^2-24y+62\]We first complete the square in $x$. Factoring a 2 from the first two terms of the expression, we get  \[2(x^2+4x)+3y^2-24y+62\]In order for the expression inside the parenthesis to be a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(4/2)^2=4$ inside the parenthesis. Doing this, we have \[2(x^2+4x+4-4)+3y^2-24y+62 \Rightarrow 2(x+2)^2+3y^2-24y+54\]Now we complete the square in $y$. Factoring a 3 from the $y$ terms in the expression, we get \[2(x+2)^2+3(y^2-8y)+54\]In order for the expression inside the second parenthesis to be a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(8/2)^2=16$ inside the parenthesis. Doing this, we have \[2(x+2)^2+3(y^2-8y+16-16)+54 \Rightarrow 2(x+2)^2+3(y-4)^2+6\]Since the minimum value of $2(x+2)^2$ and $3(y-4)^2$ is $0$ (perfect squares can never be negative), the minimum value of the entire expression is $\boxed{6}$, and is achieved when $x=-2$ and $y=4$. The answer is $\boxed{6}$

**Problem**
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we can use the method of completing the square. First, let's rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2$. Now, we know that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, so $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2 \geq \frac{(|x-2y| + |y-2x|)^2}{4} = \frac{40^2}{4} = 400$. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 400. The answer is $\boxed{400}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Step 1: We know that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. We can rewrite this as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$. By the triangle inequality, we have $|x-2y| + |2y-x| \geq |(x-2y) + (2y-x)| = |0| = 0$. But we know that $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$, so the only way this can happen is if $|x-2y| = |2y-x| = 20$.

Step 2: From $|x-2y| = 20$, we have two cases: $x-2y = 20$ or $x-2y = -20$. Similarly, from $|2y-x| = 20$, we have two cases: $2y-x = 20$ or $2y-x = -20$.

Step 3: By solving these four cases, we find that the only solution that satisfies both $|x-2y| = 20$ and $|2y-x| = 20$ is $x = 20$ and $y = 0$.

Step 4: Now we substitute $x = 20$ and $y = 0$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to get $5(20)^2 + 5(0)^2 - 8(20)(0) = 2000$.

So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 2000. The answer is: $2000$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, we need to solve the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ for $x$ and $y$. This equation is a bit tricky to solve directly, so we can use the fact that $|a-b| = |b-a|$ to simplify it to $|x-2y| = |2x-y|$. Then we can split it into two cases:

1. $x - 2y = 2x - y$, which simplifies to $x = 2y$.
2. $x - 2y = -(2x - y)$, which simplifies to $3x = 3y$, or $x = y$.

Now we can substitute these solutions back into the original equation to find the corresponding $y$ values:

1. If $x = 2y$, then $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = |2y - 2y| + |y - 4y| = 0 + |-3y| = 3|y|$. So we have $3|y| = 40$, which gives $|y| = \frac{40}{3}$. Since $y$ can be positive or negative, we have two solutions: $y = \frac{40}{3}$ and $y = -\frac{40}{3}$.
2. If $x = y$, then $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = |x - 2x| + |x - 2x| = |-x| + |-x| = 2|-x| = 2|x|$. So we have $2|x| = 40$, which gives $|x| = 20$. Again, $x$ can be positive or negative, so we have two solutions: $x = 20$ and $x = -20$.

Now we substitute these solutions into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ to find its minimum value:

1. If $x = 2y$ and $y = \frac{40}{3}$, then $x = \frac{80}{3}$, and the expression becomes $5\left(\frac{80}{3}\right)^2 + 5\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 - 8\left(\frac{80}{3}\right)\left(\frac{40}{3}\right) = \frac{6400}{9} + \frac{6400}{9} - \frac{6400}{3} = -\frac{6400}{9}$.
2. If $x = 2y$ and $y = -\frac{40}{3}$, then $x = -\frac{80}{3}$, and the expression becomes $5\left(-\frac{80}{3}\right)^2 + 5\left(-\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 - 8\left(-\frac{80}{3}\right)\left(-\frac{40}{3}\right) = \frac{6400}{9} + \frac{6400}{9} - \frac{6400}{3} = -\frac{6400}{9}$.
3. If $x = y$ and $x = 20$, then $y = 20$, and the expression becomes $5(20)^2 + 5(20)^2 - 8(20)(20) = 2000 + 2000 - 3200 = 800$.
4. If $x = y$ and $x = -20$, then $y = -20$, and the expression becomes $5(-20)^2 + 5(-20)^2 - 8(-20)(-20) = 2000 + 2000 - 3200 = 800$.

So the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is $-6400/9$ when $x = \pm \frac{80}{3}$ and $y = \pm \frac{40}{3}$, but this value is negative. The minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is $800$ when $x = y = 20$ or $x = y = -20$. Since we are asked for the minimum positive value, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is $800$.

So the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $800$. The answer is: $800$

"What is the minimum value of the expression $2x^2+3y^2+8x-24y+62$ for real $x$ and $y$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Rearranging the expression, we have  \[2x^2+8x+3y^2-24y+62\]We first complete the square in $x$. Factoring a 2 from the first two terms of the expression, we get  \[2(x^2+4x)+3y^2-24y+62\]In order for the expression inside the parenthesis to be a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(4/2)^2=4$ inside the parenthesis. Doing this, we have \[2(x^2+4x+4-4)+3y^2-24y+62 \Rightarrow 2(x+2)^2+3y^2-24y+54\]Now we complete the square in $y$. Factoring a 3 from the $y$ terms in the expression, we get \[2(x+2)^2+3(y^2-8y)+54\]In order for the expression inside the second parenthesis to be a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(8/2)^2=16$ inside the parenthesis. Doing this, we have \[2(x+2)^2+3(y^2-8y+16-16)+54 \Rightarrow 2(x+2)^2+3(y-4)^2+6\]Since the minimum value of $2(x+2)^2$ and $3(y-4)^2$ is $0$ (perfect squares can never be negative), the minimum value of the entire expression is $\boxed{6}$, and is achieved when $x=-2$ and $y=4$. The answer is $\boxed{6}$
