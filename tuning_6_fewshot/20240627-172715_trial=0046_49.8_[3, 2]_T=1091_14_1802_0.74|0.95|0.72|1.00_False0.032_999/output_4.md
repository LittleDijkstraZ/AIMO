**Problem:** 
"The function $f(n)$ is defined on the positive integers such that $f(f(n)) = 2n$ and $f(4n + 1) = 4n + 3$ for all positive integers $n.$  Find $f(1000).$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Consider the expression $f(f(f(a))).$  Since $f(f(a)) = 2a,$ this is equal to $f(2a).$  But taking $n = f(a)$ in $f(f(n)) = 2n,$ we get
\[f(f(f(a))) = 2f(a).\]Hence,
\[f(2a) = 2f(a)\]for all positive integers $a.$

Then
\[f(1000) = 2f(500) = 4f(250) = 8f(125).\]Taking $n = 31$ in $f(4n + 1) = 4n + 3,$ we get
\[f(125) = 127,\]so $f(1000) = \boxed{1016}.$ The answer is $\boxed{1016}$

**Problem**
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**



This is a problem that requires us to use the given conditions to find the value of $f(100)$. Let's use Python to find the value.

First, we need to find the value of $f(100)$ using the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We can start by calculating the value of $f(50)$, then $f(25)$, and so on.

```python

    def f_of_n():
        if n in f:
            return f[n]
        elif n % 2 == 0:
            f[n] = 2 * f_of_n(n // 2) + 1
            return f[n]
        else:
            return n + 1

    f_100 = f_of_n(100)
    return f_100

result = find_f_of_100()
print(result)
```

```

Oops! It seems like we have a problem with our function `f_of_n`. The function is trying to calculate $f(n)$ by recursively calling itself with the value of $n$ divided by 2. However, this approach doesn't work because we have no way to handle the case when $n$ is odd.

Let's try a different approach. We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. If we set $n=1$, we get $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$. So $f(1)=1$.

Now, let's use the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Since $f(1)=1$, we can find $f(2)$, $f(4)$, and so on.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def find_f_of_100():
    f = {1: 1}

    def f_of_n():

            return f[n]
        else:
            return 1  # for odd n

    f_100 = f_of_n(100)
    return f_100

result = find_f_of_100()
print(result)

Oops! It seems like we still have a problem with our function `f_of_n`. The function is trying to calculate $f(n)$ by recursively calling itself with the value of $n$ divided by 2. However, this approach doesn't work because we have no way to handle the case when $n$ is odd.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"The function $f$ is defined on the set of integers and satisfies \[f(n)= \begin{cases}  n-3 & \mbox{if }n\ge 1000 \\  f(f(n+5)) & \mbox{if }n<1000. \end{cases}\]Find $f(84)$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Denote by (1) and (2) the two parts of the definition of $f$, respectively. If we begin to use the definition of $f$ to compute $f(84)$, we use (2) until the argument is at least $1000$: \[f(84) = f(f(89)) = f(f(f(94))) = \dots = f^N(1004)\](where $f^N$ denotes composing $f$ with itself $N$ times, for some $N$). The numbers $84, 89, 94, \dots, 1004$ form an arithmetic sequence with common difference $5$; since $1004 - 84 = 920 = 184 \cdot 5$, this sequence has $184 + 1 = 185$ terms, so $N = 185$.

At this point, (1) and (2) are both used: we compute \[\begin{aligned} f^N(1004) &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-1}(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-1}(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(1000) \\ &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(997) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1002) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(999) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1004). \end{aligned}\]Repeating this process, we see that \[f^N(1004) = f^{N-2}(1004) = f^{N-4}(1004) = \dots = f^3(1004).\](The pattern breaks down for $f^k(1004)$ when $k$ is small, so it is not true that $f^3(1004) = f(1004)$.) Now, we have \[f^3(1004) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^2(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^2(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(1000) \stackrel{(1)}{=} \boxed{997}.\] The answer is $\boxed{997}$

**Problem**
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


To find $f(100)$, we can use the second condition of the function $f$ to repeatedly apply the function to $100$ until we can directly compute the value.

Let's start with $f(100)$. We know that $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. So we can substitute $n = 50$ into this equation to get $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$. Now we need to find the value of $f(50)$.

We can apply the same equation to $f(50)$ by substituting $n = 25$: $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$. Now we need to find the value of $f(25)$.

We can apply the equation one more time to $f(25)$ by substituting $n = 12.5$. However, this is not a valid input for the function $f$ since it is not a natural number. Therefore, we need to look at the first condition of the function $f$: $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$.

If we substitute $n = 13$ into this equation, we get $f(f(f(13))) = 8 \cdot 13 - 7 = 97$. Now we need to find the value of $f(13)$.

Again, we can use the second condition of the function $f$: $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. By substituting $n = 6.5$, we get $f(13) = 2f(6.5) + 1$. However, this is not a valid input for the function $f$ since it is not a natural number. Therefore, we need to look at the first condition of the function $f$ again: $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$.

If we substitute $n = 7$ into this equation, we get $f(f(f(7))) = 8 \cdot 7 - 7 = 56 - 7 = 49$. Now we need to find the value of $f(7)$.

Again, we can use the second condition of the function $f$: $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. By substituting $n = 3.5$, we get $f(7) = 2f(3.5) + 1$. However, this is not a valid input for the function $f$ since it is not a natural number. Therefore, we need to look at the first condition of the function $f$ again: $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$.

If we substitute $n = 4$ into this equation, we get $f(f(f(4))) = 8 \cdot 4 - 7 = 32 - 7 = 25$. Now we need to find the value of $f(4)$.

Again, we can use the second condition of the function $f$: $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. By substituting $n = 2$, we get $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$. Now we need to find the value of $f(2)$.

Again, we can use the second condition of the function $f$: $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. By substituting $n = 1$, we get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. Now we need to find the value of $f(1)$.

The function $f$ is defined recursively, and we can't continue this process indefinitely. However, we can guess and check some values to find that $f(1) = 1$ and $f(2) = 3$. Then we can use these values to find $f(4) = 2 \cdot 3 + 1 = 7$, $f(7) = 2 \cdot 1 + 1 = 3$, $f(13) = 2 \cdot 3 + 1 = 7$, and finally $f(50) = 2 \cdot 7 + 1 = 15$.

Now we can substitute these values back into the equation $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$ to get $f(100) = 2 \cdot 15 + 1 = 31$. Therefore, $f(100) = 31$.

The answer is:
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def f(n):
    """A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."""

However, this result is incorrect as it does not match the given conditions. The error might be due to the recursive nature of the function, which might cause the program to run indefinitely or encounter other issues. Let's try a different approach to solve the problem.

Notice that the function $f$ is defined in such a way that it maps an input to a value that is either half or double the input, plus or minus a constant. This suggests that the function might be related to the binary representation of the input.

Let's analyze the first condition $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. If we plug in $n = 1$, we get $f(f(f(1))) = 8 \cdot 1 - 7 = -1$. However, this is not a valid output for the function $f$ since it is not a natural number. Therefore, we need to look at the second condition $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. If we plug in $n = 1$, we get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2 \cdot 1 + 1 = 3$.

Now let's try to find the value of $f(2)$ using the second condition. We know that $f(2) = 3$. Then we can find $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2 \cdot 3 + 1 = 7$.

Continuing this process, we find that $f(8) = 2f(4) + 1 = 2 \cdot 7 + 1 = 15$, $f(16) = 2f(8) + 1 = 2 \cdot 15 + 1 = 31$, and so on. We can see that the function $f$ seems to be related to the binary representation of the input: it doubles the value of the least significant bit and subtracts one if the next bit is one, and so on.

Using this observation, we can calculate $f(100)$ directly. The binary representation of $100$ is $1100100$. Applying the rule, we get $f(100) = 2 \cdot 0 + 1 + 2 \cdot 1 + 2 \cdot 0 + 1 + 2 \cdot 1 + 2 \cdot 0 + 1 =

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"We define a function $f(x)$ such that $f(14)=7$, and if there exists an integer $a$ such that $f(a)=b$, then $f(b)$ is defined and

$f(b)=3b+1$ if $b$ is odd

$f(b)=\frac{b}{2}$ if $b$ is even.

What is the smallest possible number of integers in the domain of $f$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Since $f(14)=7$, we know that $f(7)$ is defined, and it must equal $22$.  Similarly, we know that $f(22)$ is defined, and it must equal $11$.  Continuing on this way,  \begin{align*}
f(11)&=34\\
f(34)&=17\\
f(17)&=52\\
f(52)&=26\\
f(26)&=13\\
f(13)&=40\\
f(40)&=20\\
f(20)&=10\\
f(10)&=5\\
f(5)&=16\\
f(16)&=8\\
f(8)&=4\\
f(4)&=2\\
f(2)&=1\\
f(1)&=4
\end{align*}We are now in a cycle $1$, $4$, $2$, $1$, and so on.  Thus there are no more values which need to be defined, as there is no $a$ currently defined for which $f(a)$ is a $b$ not already defined.  Thus the minimum number of integers we can define is the number we have already defined, which is $\boxed{18}$. The answer is $\boxed{18}$

## QUESTION 4 - 4 
- TIME_SPENT : 866 secs

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $
f(n) =
\begin{cases}
n^2+1 & \text{if }n\text{ is odd} \\
\dfrac{n}{2} & \text{if }n\text{ is even}
\end{cases}.
$

For how many integers $n$ from 1 to 100, inclusive, does $f ( f (\dotsb f (n) \dotsb )) = 1$ for some number of applications of $f$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we note that if $n$ is a positive integer, then $f(n)$ is also a positive integer.  We claim that $f ( f (\dotsb f (n) \dotsb )) = 1$ for some number of applications of $f$ only for $n = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32,$ and $64.$  (In other words, $n$ must be a power of 2.)

Note that $f(1) = 2,$ so $f(f(1)) = f(2) = 1.$  If $n > 1$ is a power of 2, it is easy to see that repeated applications of $f$ on $n$ eventually reach 1.

Suppose $n$ is an odd positive integer, where $n > 1.$  Write $n = 2k + 1,$ where $k$ is a positive integer.  Since $n$ is odd,
\[f(n) = n^2 + 1 = (2k + 1)^2 + 1 = 4k^2 + 4k + 2 = 2(2k^2 + 2k + 1).\]Since $2k^2 + 2k$ is always even, $2k^2 + 2k + 1$ is always odd (and greater than 1), so $f(n)$ can never be a power of 2 when $n$ is odd and greater than 1.

Now, suppose $n$ is even.  For example, if $n = 2^3 \cdot 11,$ then
\[f(2^3 \cdot 11) = f(2^2 \cdot 11) = f(2 \cdot 11) = f(11),\]which we know is not a power of 2.

More generally, suppose $n = 2^e \cdot m,$ where $e$ is nonnegative and $m$ is odd.  Then
\[f(2^e \cdot m) = f(2^{e - 1} \cdot m) = f(2^{e - 2} \cdot m) = \dots = f(m).\]If $m = 1,$ then $n$ is a power of 2, and the sequence eventually reaches 1.  Otherwise, $f(m)$ is not a power of 2.  We also know that $f(m)$ is odd and greater than 1, $f(f(m))$ is not a power of 2 either, and so on.  Thus, the sequence can never reach 1.

Therefore, $n$ must be one of the $\boxed{7}$ values 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, or 64. The answer is $\boxed{7}$

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


We can start by plugging $n=1$ into the second equation to find $f(2)$. We get $f(2)=2f(1)+1$. But we also know that $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$, so $f(f(1))=1$ because $f(1)$ is the input to the function $f$ that gives an output of 1. Then from the second equation, $f(2)=2f(1)+1=2*1+1=3$. Then we can find $f(4)$ by plugging $n=2$ into the second equation: $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2*3+1=7$.

Now we can use the first equation to find $f(f(f(1)))$. We know that $f(f(1))=1$, so we need to find $f(1)$. We can use the second equation to find $f(1)$: $f(2)=2f(1)+1=3$, so $f(1)=1$.

Now we can plug $n=1$ into the first equation to find $f(f(f(1)))$: $f(f(f(1)))=f(f(1))=f(1)=1$. But we know that $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$, so we have verified that our solution is correct.

Now we can use the second equation to find $f(100)$: $f(200)=2f(100)+1$. But we also know that $f(200)=f(f(f(100)))$ from the first equation. So we have $f(f(f(100)))=2f(100)+1$. But we know that $f(f(f(100)))=8*100-7=793$. So we have $793=2f(100)+1$, and solving for $f(100)$ gives $f(100)=\frac{793-1}{2}=396$.

So $f(100)=396$. The answer is: $\boxed{396}$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $f$ be a function taking the nonnegative integers to the positive integers such that $f(0) = f(1) = 1$ and
\[\frac{f(n) f(m + 1)}{f(m)} + \frac{f(n) f(n - m)}{f(n - m - 1)} = f(n + 1)\]for all nonnegative integers $n$ and $m,$ where $n \ge m + 1.$

Find the smallest nonnegative integer $n$ such that $f(n) > 10^6.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Setting $m = n - 1$ in the given functional equation, we get
\[\frac{f(n) \cdot f(n)}{f(n - 1)} + f(n) = f(n + 1),\]for all $n \ge 1.$  Then
\[\frac{f(n)}{f(n - 1)} + 1 = \frac{f(n + 1)}{f(n)}.\]Let $g(n) = \frac{f(n)}{f(n - 1)}$ for $n \ge 1.$  Then $g(1) = \frac{f(1)}{f(0)} = 1,$ and
\[g(n) + 1 = g(n + 1).\]Then $g(n) = n$ for all $n \ge 1.$  Hence,
\[g(n) g(n - 1) \dotsm g(2) g(1) = \frac{f(n)}{f(n - 1)} \cdot \frac{f(n - 1)}{f(n - 2)} \dotsm \frac{f(2)}{f(1)} \cdot \frac{f(1)}{f(0)},\]which simplifies to
\[n(n - 1) \dotsm (2)(1) = \frac{f(n)}{f(0)}.\]Therefore, $f(n) = n!$ for all $n \ge 1.$

Since $f(9) = 9! = 326880$ and $f(10) = 10! = 3628800,$ the smallest such $n$ is $\boxed{10}.$ The answer is $\boxed{10}$

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


We can solve this problem by iterating the function $f$ three times to find $f(f(f(100)))$ and set it equal to $8 \cdot 100 - 7 = 793$. This gives us the equation $f(f(f(100))) = 793$. 

We then use the second equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to find $f(f(f(100)))$ and set it equal to 793. By substituting $n = f(100)$ into the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, we get $f(2f(100)) = 2f(f(100)) + 1$. 

By substituting $n = f(100)$ into the first equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, we get $f(f(f(f(100)))) = 8f(100) - 7$. 

So we have $f(2f(100)) = 2f(f(100)) + 1 = 8f(100) - 7$. 

We can solve this equation to find the value of $f(100)$. 

However, this is a difficult equation to solve directly. Instead, we can guess and check values of $f(100)$ to see if they satisfy the equation. 

By trying a few values, we find that $f(100) = 101$ is a solution to the equation because $f(2f(100)) = f(202) = 2f(101) + 1 = 2(101) + 1 = 203$, and $8f(100) - 7 = 8(101) - 7 = 808 - 7 = 793$. 

Therefore, $f(100) = 101$. 

Finally, we can use the second equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to find $f(100)$: $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$. 

By substituting $n = 50$ into the second equation, we get $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$. 

So we have $101 = 2f(50) + 1$. 

Solving for $f(50)$, we get $f(50) = \frac{101 - 1}{2} = 50$. 

We can continue this process to find $f(25)$, $f(12)$, $f(6)$, $f(3)$, and $f(1)$. 

By substituting $n = 25$ into the second equation, we get $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$, so $50 = 2f(25) + 1$, and $f(25) = \frac{50 - 1}{2} = 24.5$. 

This doesn't give us an integer value for $f(25)$, so we must have made a mistake. Let's go back and check our work. 

We found that $f(100) = 101$, so let's check if this value satisfies the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"We define a function $f(x)$ such that $f(14)=7$, and if there exists an integer $a$ such that $f(a)=b$, then $f(b)$ is defined and

$f(b)=3b+1$ if $b$ is odd

$f(b)=\frac{b}{2}$ if $b$ is even.

What is the smallest possible number of integers in the domain of $f$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Since $f(14)=7$, we know that $f(7)$ is defined, and it must equal $22$.  Similarly, we know that $f(22)$ is defined, and it must equal $11$.  Continuing on this way,  \begin{align*}
f(11)&=34\\
f(34)&=17\\
f(17)&=52\\
f(52)&=26\\
f(26)&=13\\
f(13)&=40\\
f(40)&=20\\
f(20)&=10\\
f(10)&=5\\
f(5)&=16\\
f(16)&=8\\
f(8)&=4\\
f(4)&=2\\
f(2)&=1\\
f(1)&=4
\end{align*}We are now in a cycle $1$, $4$, $2$, $1$, and so on.  Thus there are no more values which need to be defined, as there is no $a$ currently defined for which $f(a)$ is a $b$ not already defined.  Thus the minimum number of integers we can define is the number we have already defined, which is $\boxed{18}$. The answer is $\boxed{18}$

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


To find $f(100)$, we need to use the given conditions to compute the value step by step. 

First, we know that $f(f(f(100)))=8 \cdot 100 - 7 = 793$. 

Now, we need to find the value of $f(100)$ such that $f(f(f(100)))=793$. 

Let's start with $n=100$ in the second given condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We get $f(200)=2f(100)+1$.

We can keep applying the second condition until we get $f(100)$ on one side of the equation. After applying the second condition twice, we get $f(200)=2f(100)+1$, $f(100)=2f(50)+1$, and $f(50)=2f(25)+1$.

Now, we need to find the value of $f(25)$. We can use the first given condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ with $n=25$. We get $f(f(f(25)))=8 \cdot 25 - 7 = 193$.

Again, we need to find the value of $f(25)$ such that $f(f(f(25)))=193$. 

Let's start with $n=25$ in the second given condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We get $f(50)=2f(25)+1$.

We can keep applying the second condition until we get $f(25)$ on one side of the equation. After applying the second condition twice, we get $f(50)=2f(25)+1$, $f(25)=2f(12.5)+1$.

But $12.5$ is not a natural number, so we cannot continue with the second condition. Let's use the first given condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ with $n=25$. We get $f(f(f(25)))=8 \cdot 25 - 7 = 193$.

Now, we need to find the value of $f(25)$ such that $f(f(f(25)))=193$. 

Let's start with $n=25$ in the first given condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. We get $f(f(f(25)))=8 \cdot 25 - 7 = 193$.

We can keep applying the first condition until we get $f(25)$ on one side of the equation. After applying the first condition once, we get $f(f(f(25)))=193$, $f(f(25))=193$, and $f(25)=193$.

Now that we have $f(25)=193$, we can substitute this value into the equation $f(50)=2f(25)+1$ to get $f(50)=2 \cdot 193 + 1 = 387$.

Finally, we can substitute the values of $f(50)$ and $f(25)$ into the equation $f(100)=2f(50)+1$ to get $f(100)=2 \cdot 387 + 1 = 775$.

But $775$ is not equal to $793$, so we made a mistake somewhere. Let's try again.

Let's go back to the equation $f(f(f(100)))=793$ and try to find the value of $f(100)$ such that $f(f(f(100)))=793$.

We can keep applying the second condition until we get $f(100)$ on one side of the equation. After applying the second condition twice, we get $f(200)=2f(100)+1$, $f(100)=2f(50)+1$, and $f(50)=2f(25)+1$.

Now, we need to find the value of $f(25)$. We can use the first given condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ with $n=25$. We get $f(f(f(25)))=8 \cdot 25 - 7 = 193$.

Again, we need to find the value of $f(25)$ such that $f(f(f(25)))=193$. 

Let's start with $n=25$ in the second given condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We get $f(50)=2f(25)+1$.

Now, we need to find the value of $f(25)$ such that $f(f(f(25)))=193$. 

Let's start with $n=25$ in the first given condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. We get $f(f(f(25)))=8 \cdot 25 - 7 = 193$.

Now that we have $f(25)=193$, we can substitute this value into the equation $f(50)=2f(25)+1$ to get $f(50)=2 \cdot 193 + 1 = 387$.

Finally, we can substitute the values of $f(50)$ and $f(25)$ into the equation $f(100)=2f(50)-1$ to get $f(100)=2 \cdot 387 - 1 = 773$.

But $773$ is not equal to $793$, so we made another mistake. Let's try again.

Let's go back to the equation $f(f(f(100)))=793$ and try to find the value of $f(100)$ such that $f(f(f(100)))=793$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $f$ be a function taking the nonnegative integers to the positive integers such that $f(0) = f(1) = 1$ and
\[\frac{f(n) f(m + 1)}{f(m)} + \frac{f(n) f(n - m)}{f(n - m - 1)} = f(n + 1)\]for all nonnegative integers $n$ and $m,$ where $n \ge m + 1.$

Find the smallest nonnegative integer $n$ such that $f(n) > 10^6.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Setting $m = n - 1$ in the given functional equation, we get
\[\frac{f(n) \cdot f(n)}{f(n - 1)} + f(n) = f(n + 1),\]for all $n \ge 1.$  Then
\[\frac{f(n)}{f(n - 1)} + 1 = \frac{f(n + 1)}{f(n)}.\]Let $g(n) = \frac{f(n)}{f(n - 1)}$ for $n \ge 1.$  Then $g(1) = \frac{f(1)}{f(0)} = 1,$ and
\[g(n) + 1 = g(n + 1).\]Then $g(n) = n$ for all $n \ge 1.$  Hence,
\[g(n) g(n - 1) \dotsm g(2) g(1) = \frac{f(n)}{f(n - 1)} \cdot \frac{f(n - 1)}{f(n - 2)} \dotsm \frac{f(2)}{f(1)} \cdot \frac{f(1)}{f(0)},\]which simplifies to
\[n(n - 1) \dotsm (2)(1) = \frac{f(n)}{f(0)}.\]Therefore, $f(n) = n!$ for all $n \ge 1.$

Since $f(9) = 9! = 326880$ and $f(10) = 10! = 3628800,$ the smallest such $n$ is $\boxed{10}.$ The answer is $\boxed{10}$

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


To find $f(100)$, we first need to find a pattern in the function $f$. We are given two conditions:

1. $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$
2. $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$

Let's test the second condition with $n=1$:
$f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.

But from the first condition, $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$, so $f(f(1))=1$. Since $f(f(1))=1$, we have $f(1)=1$ (because $f$ maps only natural numbers).

Now we can substitute $n=1$ into the second condition:
$f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2*1 + 1 = 3$.

Now let's test the second condition with $n=2$:
$f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2*3 + 1 = 7$.

And from the first condition, $f(f(f(2)))=8*2-7=9$. But $f(f(2))=f(7)$, so $f(7)=9$.

We can continue this process to find more values of $f$. However, it seems that this method is not straightforward to find a general rule for $f$.

Another approach is to try to find a function that satisfies both conditions. It turns out that the function $f(n)=2n-1$ satisfies both conditions.

Now we can find $f(100)$ by substituting $n=100$ into the function:
$f(100) = 2*100 - 1 = 199$.

So the value of $f(100)$ is $199$. The answer is: $\boxed{199}$.

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we will use a recursive approach to calculate $f(100)$. We will start with the base case and then use the given conditions to calculate higher values of $f$.

Let's define a function `f()` that takes a positive integer `n` as input and returns the value of $f(n)$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def f(n):
    # Base case: f(1) = 1
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    # Use the given condition f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7
    # to calculate higher values of f
    elif n % 2 == 1:
        return 2 * f((n + 1) // 2) + 1
    else:
        return (8 * n - 7) // 2
```

Now we can calculate $f(100)$ by calling the function `f()`:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

result = f(100)
print(result)
```

    result = f(100)

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
Traceback: line 5, in <module>
    result = f(100)
NameError: name 'f' is not defined

FAIL

```

Oops, there seems to be a mistake in the code. The function `f()` was not defined. Let's correct this and try again.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def f(n):
    # Base case: f(1) = 1
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    # Use the given condition f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7
    # to calculate higher values of f
    elif n % 2 == 1:
        return 2 * f((n + 1) // 2) + 1
    else:
        return (8 * n - 7) // 2

result = f(100)
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 396

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
396
```
The value of $f(100)$ is $396$. However, this result contradicts the given condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. Let's recheck our code.

Upon closer inspection, we realize that the function `f()` is not defined correctly. The condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ should be used to calculate $f(n)$ when $n$ is a power of 2. But currently, the function `f()` only uses the condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ which is not sufficient to calculate $f(n)$ for all positive integers $n$.

Let's revise the function `f()` to handle both conditions.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def f(n):
    # Base case: f(1) = 1
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    # Use the given condition f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7
    # to calculate higher values of f when n is a power of 2
    elif n in [2**i for i in range(10)]: # only checking up to 2^10 for efficiency
        return (8 * n - 7) // 2
    # Use the given condition f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1
    # to calculate higher values of f when n is not a power of 2
    else:
        return 2 * f(n // 2) + 1

result = f(100)
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 127

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
127
```
The value of $f(100)$ using the revised function `f()` is $127$. Let's check if this result satisfies the condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def check_condition():
    # Check the condition for n = 100
    n = 100
    f_n = f(n)
    f_f_n = f(f_n)
    f_f_f_n = f(f_f_n)
    return f_f_f_n == 8*n - 7

satisfies_condition = check_condition()
print(satisfies_condition)
``````output

CODE RESULTS False

INTERMEDIATE OUT :

False
```
The result $f(100) = 127$ does not satisfy the condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$.

Let's reconsider the problem. The condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ seems to be more complex than the given condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. It seems that we need to use the former condition to calculate $f(n)$ for powers of 2 and the latter condition to calculate $f(n)$ for other values of $n$.

Let's revise the function `f()` again.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def f(n):
    # Base case: f(1) = 1
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    # Use the given condition f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1
    # to calculate higher values of f when n is not a power of 2
    elif n % 2 == 1:
        return 2 * f((n + 1) // 2) + 1
    # Use the given condition f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7
    # to calculate higher values of f when n is a power of 2
    elif n in [2**i for i in range(10)]: # only checking up to 2^10 for efficiency
        return (8 * n - 7) // 2

result = f(100)
print(result)
``````output

CODE RESULTS None

INTERMEDIATE OUT :

None
```
The revised function `f()` returns `None` for $n = 100$. This is because the condition for $n$ being a power of 2 is not handled correctly. The condition should be checked after the condition for $n$ being odd. Let's correct this.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def f(n):
    # Base case: f(1) = 1
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    # Use the given condition f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1
    # to calculate higher values of f when n is not a power of 2
    elif n % 2 == 1:
        return 2 * f((n + 1) // 2) + 1
    # Use the given condition f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7
    # to calculate higher values of f when n is a power of 2
    elif n in [2**i for i in range(10)]: # only checking up to 2^10 for efficiency
        return (8 * n - 7) // 2
    # If n is neither odd nor a power of 2, use the condition f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1
    else:
        return 2 * f(n // 2) + 1

result = f(100)
print(result)
``````output

CODE RESULTS 415

INTERMEDIATE OUT :

415
```
The value of $f(100)$ using the corrected function `f()` is $415$. This result also contradicts the given condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$.

Let's reconsider the problem once more. The function $f(n)$ is defined such that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ for all positive integers $n.$ We are asked to find $f(100).$

The function $f(n)$ is defined in such a way that

## QUESTION 4 - 11 
- TIME_SPENT : 866 secs

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"The function $f$ is defined on the set of integers and satisfies \[f(n)= \begin{cases}  n-3 & \mbox{if }n\ge 1000 \\  f(f(n+5)) & \mbox{if }n<1000. \end{cases}\]Find $f(84)$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Denote by (1) and (2) the two parts of the definition of $f$, respectively. If we begin to use the definition of $f$ to compute $f(84)$, we use (2) until the argument is at least $1000$: \[f(84) = f(f(89)) = f(f(f(94))) = \dots = f^N(1004)\](where $f^N$ denotes composing $f$ with itself $N$ times, for some $N$). The numbers $84, 89, 94, \dots, 1004$ form an arithmetic sequence with common difference $5$; since $1004 - 84 = 920 = 184 \cdot 5$, this sequence has $184 + 1 = 185$ terms, so $N = 185$.

At this point, (1) and (2) are both used: we compute \[\begin{aligned} f^N(1004) &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-1}(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-1}(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(1000) \\ &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(997) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1002) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(999) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1004). \end{aligned}\]Repeating this process, we see that \[f^N(1004) = f^{N-2}(1004) = f^{N-4}(1004) = \dots = f^3(1004).\](The pattern breaks down for $f^k(1004)$ when $k$ is small, so it is not true that $f^3(1004) = f(1004)$.) Now, we have \[f^3(1004) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^2(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^2(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(1000) \stackrel{(1)}{=} \boxed{997}.\] The answer is $\boxed{997}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
**Problem**
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


To solve this problem, we will use the two given equations to find a pattern in the function $f$. We start by evaluating the function for some small values of $n$.

For $n=1$, we have $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1$, so $f(f(1))=1$ and $f(1)=1$.

For $n=2$, we have $f(f(f(2)))=8(2)-7=9$, and since $f(f(1))=1$, we have $f(f(2))=9$, so $f(2)=3$.

For $n=3$, we have $f(f(f(3)))=8(3)-7=17$, and since $f(2)=3$, we have $f(f(3))=17$, so $f(3)=5$.

By continuing this process, we can find that $f(4)=7$, $f(5)=9$, $f(6)=11$, and so on. We observe that $f(n)=2n-1$ for all positive integers $n$.

Now, we can substitute $n=100$ into the function $f(n)=2n-1$ to find $f(100)$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def calculate_f():
    n = 100
    f_n = 2 * n - 1
    return f_n

result = calculate_f()
print(result)
```
