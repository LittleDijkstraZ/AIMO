**Problem:** 
"Find the number of 10-tuples $(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{10})$ of real numbers such that
\[(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2 = \frac{1}{11}.\]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,
\begin{align*}
&[(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + \dots + 1^2 + 1^2)][(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2] \\
&\ge [(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + (x_2 - x_3) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10}]^2 = 1.
\end{align*}From the given condition, we have equality, so by the equality condition for Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[\frac{1 - x_1}{1} = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{1} = \frac{x_2 - x_3}{1} = \dots = \frac{x_9 - x_{10}}{1} = \frac{x_{10}}{1}.\]Let
\[d = 1 - x_1 = x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_3 = \dots = x_9 - x_{10} = x_{10}.\]Then
\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so
\[(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_{10}) = \left( \frac{10}{11}, \frac{9}{11}, \frac{8}{11}, \dots, \frac{1}{11} \right).\]In particular, there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


First, we need to understand the given equation. The equation is of the form $A \cdot B = 0$, which means that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the points that satisfy the equation are either those that make $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. 

For $A = 0$, we have $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This means that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The absolute value equations can be split into two cases each: $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$, and $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of a square with side length 10.

For $B = 0$, we have $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This means that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. Again, the absolute value equations can be split into two cases each: $x = 8$ or $x = -8$, and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of a square with side length 16.

The convex polygon formed by the union of these two squares is a rectangle with length 16 and width 10. The area of this rectangle is $16 \times 10 = 160$. So, the area of the convex polygon is 160.
The answer is: $160$

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we first need to understand that the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. 
This means that the points that satisfy the equation are the points that satisfy each of these four conditions individually. 

The conditions $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ are equivalent to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$ respectively. 

These conditions represent four lines in the coordinate plane, and the intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 16. 

The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

```python

from sympy import symbols, solve

def area_of_polygon():

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



The problem involves finding the area of a polygon formed by the points that satisfy a given condition. The condition is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. The only way this equation can be zero is if either of the two products is zero. This means either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. 

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives the vertices of the polygon as $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, and $(-10, 0)$.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives the vertices of the polygon as $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The polygon formed by these vertices is a square with side length $10$. Therefore, the area of the polygon is $10^2 = 100$.

The answer is: $100$

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we first need to understand the given equation and the conditions that make it equal to zero. The equation is:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$
For the product of two terms to be zero, either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. So we have two cases:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This case implies that both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations gives us the vertices of a square with side length 20.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This case implies that both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these four equations gives us the vertices of a square with side length 16.

Now we have two squares, one with side length 20 and the other with side length 16. The area of a square is given by the square of its side length, so the area of the larger square is $20^2 = 400$ and the area of the smaller square is $16^2 = 256$. The convex polygon formed by the union of these two squares is the entire region where the equation is satisfied. Therefore, the area of this convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares, which is $400 + 256 = 656$.

So the area of the convex polygon is $656$. The answer is: $\boxed{656}$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_ 2= (-16,2).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that
\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as
\[\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1.\]Find $h + k + a + b.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if both of its factors are equal to zero. The factor $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ is zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The factor $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2$ is zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The solutions to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ are the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. The solutions to $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ are the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = \pm 10$.
If $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x - y = \pm 10$.
If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$, which implies $x = \pm 8$.
If $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $y = \pm 8$.

These conditions give us the vertices of the polygon: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The polygon is a square with side length $16$, so its area is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

**Problem:** 
"How many square units are in the area of the triangle whose vertices are the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the curve $y = (x-3)^2 (x+2)$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we need to find where this curve intersects the $x$ and $y$ axes.  If $y=0$, then $(x-3)^2(x+2)=0$, which has solutions of $x=3$ and $x=-2$.  If $x=0$, then $y=(-3)^2(2)=18$.  So, the curve has two $x$-intercepts and one $y$-intercept.  The length of the base along the $x$-axis is $3-(-2)=5$.  The height from this base is equal to the $y$-intercept, 18.  The area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 5\cdot 18=\boxed{45}$. The answer is $\boxed{45}$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"An ellipse is defined parametrically by
\[(x,y) = \left( \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t}, \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t} \right).\]Then the equation of the ellipse can be written in the form
\[Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0,\]where $A,$ $B,$ $C,$ $D,$ $E,$ and $F$ are integers, and $\gcd(|A|,|B|,|C|,|D|,|E|,|F|) = 1.$  Find $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F|.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
In the equation $y = \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\cos t$ to get
\[\cos t = \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3}.\]In the equation $x = \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\sin t$ to get
\[\sin t = \frac{1}{2} x (2 - \cos t) + 1 = \frac{1}{2} x \left( 2 - \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right) + 1 = 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)}.\]Since $\cos^2 t + \sin^2 t = 1,$
\[\left( \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right)^2 + \left( 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)} \right)^2 = 1.\]Multiplying both sides by $(2(y + 3))^2$ and expanding, it will simplify to
\[81x^2 - 36xy + 16y^2 - 108x + 240y + 900 = 0.\]Therefore, $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F| = 81 + 36 + 16 + 108 + 240 + 900 = \boxed{1381}.$ The answer is $\boxed{1381}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This means that the points that satisfy this equation are those where either $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$. These equations describe a square with side length $20$ centered at the origin, and four smaller squares each with side length $16$ centered at the points $(\pm8,0)$ and $(0,\pm8)$. The area of the large square is $20^2 = 400$, and the area of each small square is $16^2 = 256$. There are four small squares, so the total area of the small squares is $4 \times 256 = 1024$. The area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points that satisfy the given equation is the area of the large square minus the total area of the small squares, which is $400 - 1024 = -624$. However, the area of a polygon cannot be negative, so there must be a mistake in our reasoning.

Upon further analysis, we realize that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_ 2= (-16,2).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that
\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as
\[\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1.\]Find $h + k + a + b.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The given equation is satisfied if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The first two equations imply $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, respectively. These are the equations of two lines in the plane.

The last two equations imply $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, respectively. These are also the equations of two lines in the plane.

The intersection points of these lines form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So the area of the convex polygon is 256.
