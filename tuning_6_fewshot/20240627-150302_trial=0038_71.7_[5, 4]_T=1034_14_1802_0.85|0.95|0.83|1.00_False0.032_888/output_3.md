**Problem:** 
"How many square units are in the area of the triangle whose vertices are the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the curve $y = (x-3)^2 (x+2)$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we need to find where this curve intersects the $x$ and $y$ axes.  If $y=0$, then $(x-3)^2(x+2)=0$, which has solutions of $x=3$ and $x=-2$.  If $x=0$, then $y=(-3)^2(2)=18$.  So, the curve has two $x$-intercepts and one $y$-intercept.  The length of the base along the $x$-axis is $3-(-2)=5$.  The height from this base is equal to the $y$-intercept, 18.  The area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 5\cdot 18=\boxed{45}$. The answer is $\boxed{45}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

**Solution:** 


The problem asks us to find the area of the polygon enclosed by the points that satisfy the given equation. 

The equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. 

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. This expression is zero if and only if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This happens if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. 

The second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. This expression is zero if and only if both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This happens if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. 

The solutions to these equations are as follows:

1. For $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, the solutions are the points on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.
2. For $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, the solutions are the points on the lines $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.
3. For $\vert x \vert = 8$, the solutions are the points on the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.
4. For $\vert y \vert = 8$, the solutions are the points on the lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

The solutions to these equations form a square with side length 20. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$. 

So, the area of the polygon is 400. The answer is: $400$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

2. At least one of the factors is zero.

For the first case, we have:

$\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

This gives us the system of equations:

$x + y = \pm 10$, $x = \pm 8$, $x - y = \pm 10$, and $y = \pm 8$.

Solving this system, we find the vertices of the polygon: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(2, 8)$, $(-2, 8)$, $(2, -8)$, and $(-2, -8)$.

For the second case, at least one of the factors is zero. This gives us the system of equations:

$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

Solving this system, we find the same vertices as before.

Now we can calculate the area of the polygon. The vertices form a square with side length 16. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. So the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units.

The answer is: $256$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Find the number of 10-tuples $(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{10})$ of real numbers such that
\[(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2 = \frac{1}{11}.\]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,
\begin{align*}
&[(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + \dots + 1^2 + 1^2)][(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2] \\
&\ge [(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + (x_2 - x_3) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10}]^2 = 1.
\end{align*}From the given condition, we have equality, so by the equality condition for Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[\frac{1 - x_1}{1} = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{1} = \frac{x_2 - x_3}{1} = \dots = \frac{x_9 - x_{10}}{1} = \frac{x_{10}}{1}.\]Let
\[d = 1 - x_1 = x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_3 = \dots = x_9 - x_{10} = x_{10}.\]Then
\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so
\[(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_{10}) = \left( \frac{10}{11}, \frac{9}{11}, \frac{8}{11}, \dots, \frac{1}{11} \right).\]In particular, there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Solution:**


The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. Therefore, either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.

1. If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which implies that $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
2. If $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies that $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
3. If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$, which implies that $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
4. If $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

The solutions from the above equations form a square with side length 20. The area of the square is $20^2 = 400$. The answer is: $400$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Step 1: Understand the problem
The problem is asking for the area of a convex polygon enclosed by the set of points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

Step 2: Analyze the equation
The equation is the product of two terms. For the product to be zero, either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. So we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
This case implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This forms a square with side length 20.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
This case implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This forms a square with side length 16.

Step 3: Calculate the area of the convex polygon
The convex polygon is the union of the two squares formed in the two cases. The side length of the first square is 20, so its area is $20^2 = 400$. The side length of the second square is 16, so its area is $16^2 = 256$. The area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares, which is $400 + 256 = 656$.

The area of the convex polygon is 656. The answer is: $656$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $f(x,y) = ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied only when either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. These conditions translate to $x + y = \pm 10$, $x - y = \pm 10$, $x = \pm 8$, or $y = \pm 8$. These lines divide the plane into 16 regions.

Now let's plot these lines on the coordinate plane:
- $x + y = \pm 10$ are two parallel lines with slope $-1$, passing through $(0,10)$ and $(0,-10)$.
- $x - y = \pm 10$ are two parallel lines with slope $1$, passing through $(10,0)$ and $(-10,0)$.
- $x = \pm 8$ are two vertical lines at $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.
- $y = \pm 8$ are two horizontal lines at $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

These lines divide the coordinate plane into 16 regions, and the convex polygon is formed by the intersection of these regions. To find the area of this polygon, we can simply calculate the area of the rectangle formed by the intersections of the lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$, and subtract the areas of the four right triangles formed by the intersections of the lines $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$ with the rectangle.

The rectangle has side lengths 16 (from $-8$ to $8$ in both $x$ and $y$) and the four right triangles each have a base and height of 10 (from the intersections of $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$ with the lines $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$), so their combined area is $4 \times \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10 = 200$. The area of the rectangle is $16 \times 16 = 256$, so the area of the polygon is $256 - 200 = 56$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $56$.
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def calculate_area():
    # Calculate the side length of the rectangle
    side_length = 16

    # Calculate the area of the rectangle

    triangle_area = 4 * (0.5 * 10 * 10)

    # Calculate the area of the convex polygon

    return polygon_area

result = calculate_area()

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives $x = y = 5$ or $x = -y = -5$. Similarly, if $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

The points $(x, y)$ satisfying the equations are $(5, 5)$, $(5, -5)$, $(-5, 5)$, $(-5, -5)$, $(8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, and $(-8, -8)$. These points form a square with side length $10$. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So the area of the convex polygon is $100$. The answer is: $100$

"Find the number of 10-tuples $(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{10})$ of real numbers such that
\[(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2 = \frac{1}{11}.\]"

&\ge [(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + (x_2 - x_3) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10}]^2 = 1.
\end{align*}From the given condition, we have equality, so by the equality condition for Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[\frac{1 - x_1}{1} = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{1} = \frac{x_2 - x_3}{1} = \dots = \frac{x_9 - x_{10}}{1} = \frac{x_{10}}{1}.\]Let
\[d = 1 - x_1 = x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_3 = \dots = x_9 - x_{10} = x_{10}.\]Then
\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so
\[(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_{10}) = \left( \frac{10}{11}, \frac{9}{11}, \frac{8}{11}, \dots, \frac{1}{11} \right).\]In particular, there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we first observe that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to the union of the following two sets of points:

1. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$.
2. $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.

The first set of points represents a square with side length 20 centered at the origin. The second set of points also represents a square with side length 16 centered at the origin. Therefore, the convex polygon enclosed by the union of these two sets of points is a square with side length 20 (the larger of the two side lengths). The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$. The answer is: $400$

"How many square units are in the area of the triangle whose vertices are the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the curve $y = (x-3)^2 (x+2)$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we need to find where this curve intersects the $x$ and $y$ axes.  If $y=0$, then $(x-3)^2(x+2)=0$, which has solutions of $x=3$ and $x=-2$.  If $x=0$, then $y=(-3)^2(2)=18$.  So, the curve has two $x$-intercepts and one $y$-intercept.  The length of the base along the $x$-axis is $3-(-2)=5$.  The height from this base is equal to the $y$-intercept, 18.  The area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 5\cdot 18=\boxed{45}$. The answer is $\boxed{45}$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The expression equals zero if either the first term equals zero or the second term equals zero.
2. Each term is a product of two terms inside absolute values.
3. The absolute value of a real number is zero if and only if the number is zero.
4. Therefore, the equation is satisfied if any of the following four conditions hold:

   a) $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$.

5. From the first two equations we get $x = 10$ and $y = 0$. The third and fourth equations give $x = 0$ and $y = -10$. So the vertices of the polygon are at points $(10, 0)$, $(0, -10)$, $(-10, 0)$, and $(0, 10)$.
6. To find the area of the polygon, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle and subtract the areas of the four right triangles formed by the origin and the vertices of the rectangle.
7. The rectangle has length 20 and width 20, so its area is $20 * 20 = 400$.
8. Each of the right triangles has base and height equal to 10, so its area is $0.5 * 10 * 10 = 50$.
9. Since there are four right triangles, the total area of the triangles is $4 * 50 = 200$.
10. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $400 - 200 = 200$.

The area of the convex polygon is 200 square units. The answer is: $200$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

The first term is zero when either $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. These two equations imply that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these equations are four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, and $(0, -10)$.

The second term is zero when either $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. These two equations imply that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(8, -8)$.

The intersection of the rectangle and the square is the convex polygon we are interested in. The vertices of this polygon are the intersection points of the lines forming the rectangle and the square. These intersection points are $(8, 0)$, $(-8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, and $(0, -8)$.

The side length of the square is 16, so its area is $16^2 = 256$.

The rectangle has side lengths of 20, so its area is $20 \times 20 = 400$.

The intersection of the rectangle and the square forms a smaller square with side length 8, so its area is $8^2 = 64$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of the rectangle minus the area of the square, which is $400 - 256 = 144$. The answer is: 144

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many square units are in the area of the triangle whose vertices are the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the curve $y = (x-3)^2 (x+2)$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we need to find where this curve intersects the $x$ and $y$ axes.  If $y=0$, then $(x-3)^2(x+2)=0$, which has solutions of $x=3$ and $x=-2$.  If $x=0$, then $y=(-3)^2(2)=18$.  So, the curve has two $x$-intercepts and one $y$-intercept.  The length of the base along the $x$-axis is $3-(-2)=5$.  The height from this base is equal to the $y$-intercept, 18.  The area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 5\cdot 18=\boxed{45}$. The answer is $\boxed{45}$

**Solution:** 


The problem is asking for the area of a polygon formed by the intersection of the curves defined by the equations $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. 

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which results in the lines $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. These lines form a rectangle with side lengths 20 and 10.

The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which results in the lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. These lines form a square with side length 16.

The intersection of the two polygons is a smaller square with side length 8 (formed by the intersection of the rectangle and the square). The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$. So the area of the convex polygon is 64 square units. The answer is: $64$
