**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Find the number of 10-tuples $(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{10})$ of real numbers such that
\[(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2 = \frac{1}{11}.\]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,
\begin{align*}
&[(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + \dots + 1^2 + 1^2)][(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2] \\
&\ge [(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + (x_2 - x_3) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10}]^2 = 1.
\end{align*}From the given condition, we have equality, so by the equality condition for Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[\frac{1 - x_1}{1} = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{1} = \frac{x_2 - x_3}{1} = \dots = \frac{x_9 - x_{10}}{1} = \frac{x_{10}}{1}.\]Let
\[d = 1 - x_1 = x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_3 = \dots = x_9 - x_{10} = x_{10}.\]Then
\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so
\[(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_{10}) = \left( \frac{10}{11}, \frac{9}{11}, \frac{8}{11}, \dots, \frac{1}{11} \right).\]In particular, there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


The given equation is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. These four lines intersect at the points $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, and $(-10, 0)$.
The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. These four lines intersect at the points $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.
The convex polygon formed by the intersection of these lines is a square with side length $10$, so its area is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.

The first term is zero when either $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x-y| - 10 = 0$. These simplify to $|x+y| = 10$ and $|x-y| = 10$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x+y = 10$, $x+y = -10$, $x-y = 10$, and $x-y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle.

The second term is zero when either $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$. These simplify to $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square.

The intersection of the rectangle and the square is the convex polygon that encloses the points that satisfy the equation. This polygon is a square with side length 8.

The area of a square is the side length squared, so the area of this square is $8^2 = 64$. The answer is: $64$

**Problem:** 
"Find the number of 10-tuples $(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{10})$ of real numbers such that

Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,
\begin{align*}

&\ge [(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + (x_2 - x_3) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10}]^2 = 1.
\end{align*}From the given condition, we have equality, so by the equality condition for Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[\frac{1 - x_1}{1} = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{1} = \frac{x_2 - x_3}{1} = \dots = \frac{x_9 - x_{10}}{1} = \frac{x_{10}}{1}.\]Let
\[d = 1 - x_1 = x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_3 = \dots = x_9 - x_{10} = x_{10}.\]Then
\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so
\[(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_{10}) = \left( \frac{10}{11}, \frac{9}{11}, \frac{8}{11}, \dots, \frac{1}{11} \right).\]In particular, there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we first need to understand the given equation and the conditions that make the equation equal to zero. The equation is:
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]

The equation will be zero if either of the two factors is zero. This gives us two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first case, both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ must be zero. This means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This is the equation of a square with side length 10 and its center at the origin.

For the second case, both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2$ must be zero. This means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This is the equation of a square with side length 16 and its center at the origin.

The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for. The area of this polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares minus the area of their intersection. The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of the first square is $10^2 = 100$, the area of the second square is $16^2 = 256$, and the area of their intersection is $(8^2) = 64$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $100 + 256 - 64 = 302$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 302. The answer is: $302$

&\ge [(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + (x_2 - x_3) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10}]^2 = 1.
\end{align*}From the given condition, we have equality, so by the equality condition for Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[\frac{1 - x_1}{1} = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{1} = \frac{x_2 - x_3}{1} = \dots = \frac{x_9 - x_{10}}{1} = \frac{x_{10}}{1}.\]Let
\[d = 1 - x_1 = x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_3 = \dots = x_9 - x_{10} = x_{10}.\]Then
\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so
\[(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_{10}) = \left( \frac{10}{11}, \frac{9}{11}, \frac{8}{11}, \dots, \frac{1}{11} \right).\]In particular, there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we need to understand the properties of absolute value and how it affects the area of the polygon. The equation given is a product of two terms equal to zero, which means either of the terms must be zero. 

Let's consider each term separately:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. This is the equation of a square with side length 20 centered at the origin.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This is the equation of a square with side length 20 centered at the origin, but rotated 45 degrees.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x \vert = 8$, which is the equation of a line segment along the x-axis from -8 to 8.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert y \vert = 8$, which is the equation of a line segment along the y-axis from -8 to 8.

The intersection of these lines and squares gives us the vertices of the polygon. The polygon is a square with side length 16 (the maximum distance from the origin along the x or y axis within the limits set by the absolute value terms). 

To find the area of the square, we simply square the side length: $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

**Problem:** 
"Five identical rectangles are arranged to form a larger rectangle $PQRS$, as shown.  The area of $PQRS$ is $4000$.  What is the length, $x$, rounded off to the nearest integer? [asy]
real x = 1; real w = 2/3;

// Draw outer square and labels
pair s = (0, 0); pair r = (2 * x, 0); pair q = (3 * w, x + w); pair p = (0, x + w);
draw(s--r--q--p--cycle);
label("$S$", s, SW); label("$R$", r, SE); label("$Q$", q, NE); label("$P$", p, NW);

// Draw other segments
draw((x, 0)--(x, w));
draw((0, w)--(2 * x, w));
draw((w, x + w)--(w, w)); draw((2 * w, x + w)--(2 * w, w));

// length labels
pair upper = (-0.1, x + w);
pair lower = (-0.1, w);
draw(lower--upper);
draw((-0.1 - 0.03, x + w)--(-0.1 + 0.03, x + w));
draw((-0.1 - 0.03, w)--(-0.1 + 0.03, w));
label("$x$", midpoint((-0.1, w)--(-0.1, x + w)), W);

pair left = (0, -0.1); pair right = (x, -0.1);
draw((0, -0.1 + 0.03)--(0, -0.1 - 0.03));
draw((x, -0.1 - 0.03)--(x, -0.1 + 0.03));
draw(left--right);
label("$x$", (x/2, -0.1), S);

[/asy]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Let $w$ be the width of each of the identical rectangles. Since $PQ=3w$, $RS=2x$ and $PQ=RS$ (because $PQRS$ is a rectangle), then $2x = 3w$, or $$w=\frac{2}{3}x.$$ Therefore, the area of each of the five identical rectangles is $$x\left(\frac{2}{3}x\right)=\frac{2}{3}x^2.$$ Since the area of $PQRS$ is 4000 and it is made up of five of these identical smaller rectangles, then $$5\left(\frac{2}{3}x^2\right)=4000$$ or $$\frac{10}{3}x^2 = 4000$$ or $x^2 = 1200$ or $x \approx 34.6$ which, when rounded off to the nearest integer, is $\boxed{35}.$ The answer is $\boxed{35}$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The equation $A \cdot B = 0$ implies that $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The solutions to these equations are:
1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which gives $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
2. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which gives $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
3. $\vert x \vert = 8$, which gives $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
4. $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.
The solutions to these equations form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256.
The answer is: $\boxed{256}$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many square units are in the area of the triangle whose vertices are the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the curve $y = (x-3)^2 (x+2)$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we need to find where this curve intersects the $x$ and $y$ axes.  If $y=0$, then $(x-3)^2(x+2)=0$, which has solutions of $x=3$ and $x=-2$.  If $x=0$, then $y=(-3)^2(2)=18$.  So, the curve has two $x$-intercepts and one $y$-intercept.  The length of the base along the $x$-axis is $3-(-2)=5$.  The height from this base is equal to the $y$-intercept, 18.  The area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 5\cdot 18=\boxed{45}$. The answer is $\boxed{45}$
