**Problem:** 
"How many distinct solutions are there to the equation $|x-7| = |x+1|$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
If $|x-7| = |x+1|$, then either $x-7 = x+1$ or $x-7 = -(x+1)$.  Simplifying $x-7=x+1$ gives $0=8$, which has no solutions, so no values of $x$ satisfy $x-7 = x+1$.  If $x-7 = -(x+1)$, then $x-7 = -x-1$, so $2x = 6$, which gives $x=3$.  So, there is $\boxed{1}$ solution.

Challenge: See if you can find a quick solution to this problem by simply thinking about the graphs of $y=|x-7|$ and $y=|x+1|$. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we will use a sympy-based approach to find the value of $m$ such that the equation $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

1. We know that the expression $| |x-1| - 2 |$ can take a value from $0$ to $3$ only, because $|x|$ is always non-negative and $| |x-1| - 2 |$ is always less than or equal to $2$.
2. If $| |x-1| - 2 | = 0$, then $|x-1| = 2$, which gives $x = 3$ or $x = -1$.
3. If $| |x-1| - 2 | = 1$, then $|x-1| = 3$ or $|x-1| = 1$. The first equation gives $x = 4$ or $x = -2$, and the second equation gives $x = 2$ or $x = 0$.
4. If $| |x-1| - 2 | = 2$, then $|x-1| = 4$ or $|x-1| = 0$. The first equation gives $x = 5$ or $x = -3$, and the second equation gives $x = 1$.
5. If $| |x-1| - 2 | = 3$, then $|x-1| = 5$, which gives $x = 6$ or $x = -4$.
6. So, the equation $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100} = 1$. Thus, $m = 100$.

The value of $m$ is $100$. The answer is: $100$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many solutions does the equation \[\frac{(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)\dotsm(x-100)}{(x-1^2)(x-2^2)(x-3^2)\dotsm(x-100^2)} = 0\]have for $x$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Any solution to this equation must make the numerator of the left-hand side zero, while keeping the denominator non-zero. The numerator is zero when $x$ is one of the numbers $1, 2, 3, \dots, 100.$ However, for any value in this list that is a perfect square, the denominator will also be zero, so that value of $x$ will not be a root. Therefore, we want to find the number of integers in the list $1, 2, \dots, 100$ which are not perfect squares. The perfect squares in the list are $1^2, 2^2, \dots, 10^2,$ so there are $10$ perfect squares, and \[100 - 10 = \boxed{90}\]integers which are not perfect squares. The answer is $\boxed{90}$

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The problem asks for how many positive integers $m$ the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

The number of distinct solutions of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is determined by the value of $\frac{m}{100}$. Specifically, the equation has $4$ distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $2$, inclusive. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a graph that consists of four line segments, and the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly four solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is in the interval $(0, 2]$. Therefore, we need to find how many positive integers $m$ satisfy $1 \leq \frac{m}{100} \leq 2$. Multiplying all sides of the inequalities by $100$ gives $100 \leq m \leq 200$. The number of integers in the interval $[100, 200]$ is $101$. Therefore, there are $101$ positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. The answer is: $101$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let \[f(x) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
-x + 3 & \text{if } x \le 0, \\
2x - 5 & \text{if } x > 0.
\end{array}
\right.\]How many solutions does the equation $f(f(x)) = 4$ have?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
To solve the equation $f(f(x)) = 4,$ we first find the values $x$ such that $f(x) = 4.$

Either $f(x) = -x + 3$ (for $x \le 0$) or $f(x) = 2x - 5$ (for $x > 0$). If $-x + 3 = 4,$ then $x = -1.$ Note that this value satisfies $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = 4,$ then $x = 9/2.$ Note that this value satisfies $x > 0.$ Therefore, the solutions to $f(x) = 4$ are $x = -1$ and $x = 9/2.$

Next, we solve for the values $x$ such that $f(x) = -1.$ If $-x + 3 = -1,$ then $x = 4.$ This value does not satisfy $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = -1,$ then $x = 2.$ This value satisfies $x > 0.$

Finally, we solve for the values $x$ such that $f(x) = 9/2.$ If $-x + 3 = 9/2,$ then $x = -3/2.$ This value satisfies $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = 9/2,$ then $x = 19/4.$ This value satisfies $x > 0.$

Therefore, the equation $f(f(x)) = 4$ has the solutions $x = 2,$ $-3/2,$ and $19/4,$ for a total of $\boxed{3}$ solutions. The answer is $\boxed{3}$

**Solution:** 



To solve this problem, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. 

We can start by setting $\frac{m}{100}$ to a variable, say $k$. Then we have the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=k$. 

This equation can be solved by analyzing the number of solutions for each value of $k$. 

For $k > 2$, the equation has $4$ distinct solutions. 

For $0 \leq k \leq 2$, the equation has $2$ distinct solutions. 

For $k < 0$, the equation has no solutions. 

Therefore, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=k$ has $4$ distinct solutions when $k = \frac{m}{100}$ is between $0$ and $2$. 

To find the number of such integers $m$, we can calculate the number of integers from $0 \times 100$ to $2 \times 100$, which is $200 + 1 - 0 = 201$. 

However, we need to exclude the case when $k = 0$, because this would give only $2$ distinct solutions. So we subtract $1$ from $201$, giving $200$. 

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $200$. The answer is: $\boxed{200}$

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. For the equation $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|=\frac{m}{100}$ to have 4 distinct solutions, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be in the interval $(0, 2)$. This is because the function $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|$ has a maximum of 2 and a minimum of 0, and we need to find when it equals $\frac{m}{100}$ exactly 4 times.

2. To find the values of $m$ that satisfy this condition, we need to multiply each part of the inequality by 100 to get rid of the fraction: $0 < m < 200$.

3. Now we need to find how many integer values of $m$ are in this interval. We can do this by subtracting the smallest value of $m$ from the largest value and adding 1. So the number of integer values of $m$ is $200 - 1 + 1 = 200$.

4. However, we need to exclude the values of $m$ for which the equation has less than 4 distinct solutions. This happens when $\frac{m}{100}$ is less than 0 or greater than 2.

5. For $\frac{m}{100} < 0$, we have $m < 0$, but there are no positive integers in this range, so we don't need to exclude any values.

6. For $\frac{m}{100} > 2$, we have $m > 200$, but again, there are no positive integers in this range, so we don't need to exclude any values.

7. Therefore, all the 200 values of $m$ are valid.

8. The problem asks for the number of these values, so the answer is 200.

Let's now write the Python code to check this:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def count_m():
    # The smallest value of m is 1 (m/100 = 0 is not possible)
    smallest_m = 1

    # The largest value of m is 200 (m/100 = 2)
    largest_m = 200

    # Count the number of integers from the smallest_m to the largest_m
    count = largest_m - smallest_m + 1

    return count

result = count_m()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 200

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
200
```
The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $200$. The answer is: $200$.
