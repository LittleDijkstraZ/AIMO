**Problem:** 
"Let $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_ 2= (-16,2).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that
\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as
\[\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1.\]Find $h + k + a + b.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

**Solution:** 



This problem can be solved by examining the conditions given in the equation. The equation is of the form $(A)(B) = 0$, which implies that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, we need to find the points that satisfy each of the following conditions:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For condition 1, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
For condition 2, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
For condition 3, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$, which implies $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
For condition 4, we have $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

The intersection of these conditions gives us the vertices of the polygon:

- Intersection of $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ gives us the vertex $(10, 0)$.
- Intersection of $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$ gives us the vertex $(0, 10)$.
- Intersection of $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$ gives us the vertex $(-10, -20)$.
- Intersection of $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$ gives us the vertex $(-20, -10)$.
- Intersection of $x + y = 10$ and $x = 8$ gives us the vertex $(8, 2)$.
- Intersection of $x + y = 10$ and $x = -8$ gives us the vertex $(-8, 18)$.
- Intersection of $x + y = -10$ and $x = 8$ gives us the vertex $(8, -18)$.
- Intersection of $x + y = -10$ and $x = -8$ gives us the vertex $(-8, -2)$.
- Intersection of $x - y = 10$ and $x = 8$ gives us the vertex $(8, -2)$.
- Intersection of $x - y = 10$ and $x = -8$ gives us the vertex $(-8, 2)$.
- Intersection of $x - y = -10$ and $x = 8$ gives us the vertex $(8, 18)$.
- Intersection of $x - y = -10$ and $x = -8$ gives us the vertex $(-8, -18)$.
- Intersection of $x = 8$ and $y = 8$ gives us the vertex $(8, 8)$.
- Intersection of $x = 8$ and $y = -8$ gives us the vertex $(8, -8)$.
- Intersection of $x = -8$ and $y = 8$ gives us the vertex $(-8, 8)$.
- Intersection of $x = -8$ and $y = -8$ gives us the vertex $(-8, -8)$.
- Intersection of $x = 8$ and $y = 0$ gives us the vertex $(8, 0)$.
- Intersection of $x = 8$ and $y = 10$ gives us the vertex $(8, 10)$.
- Intersection of $x = -8$ and $y = 0$ gives us the vertex $(-8, 0)$.
- Intersection of $x = -8$ and $y = -10$ gives us the vertex $(-8, -10)$.
- Intersection of $x = 0$ and $y = 8$ gives us the vertex $(0, 8)$.
- Intersection of $x = 0$ and $y = -8$ gives us the vertex $(0, -8)$.
- Intersection of $x = 10$ and $y = 0$ gives us the vertex $(10, 0)$.
- Intersection of $x = 10$ and $y = 10$ gives us the vertex $(10, 10)$.
- Intersection of $x = -10$ and $y = 0$ gives us the vertex $(-10, 0)$.
- Intersection of $x = -10$ and $y = -10$ gives us the vertex $(-10, -10)$.

The polygon is a square with side length 16. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"An ellipse is defined parametrically by
\[(x,y) = \left( \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t}, \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t} \right).\]Then the equation of the ellipse can be written in the form
\[Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0,\]where $A,$ $B,$ $C,$ $D,$ $E,$ and $F$ are integers, and $\gcd(|A|,|B|,|C|,|D|,|E|,|F|) = 1.$  Find $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F|.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
In the equation $y = \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\cos t$ to get
\[\cos t = \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3}.\]In the equation $x = \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\sin t$ to get
\[\sin t = \frac{1}{2} x (2 - \cos t) + 1 = \frac{1}{2} x \left( 2 - \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right) + 1 = 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)}.\]Since $\cos^2 t + \sin^2 t = 1,$
\[\left( \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right)^2 + \left( 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)} \right)^2 = 1.\]Multiplying both sides by $(2(y + 3))^2$ and expanding, it will simplify to
\[81x^2 - 36xy + 16y^2 - 108x + 240y + 900 = 0.\]Therefore, $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F| = 81 + 36 + 16 + 108 + 240 + 900 = \boxed{1381}.$ The answer is $\boxed{1381}$

**Solution:** 


The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

The first term is zero when $|\pm x \pm y - 10| = 0$ and the second term is zero when $|\pm x - 8| = 0$ or $|\pm y - 8| = 0$. 

The absolute value equations can be split into two separate cases:

1. For the first term, we have the following four cases:
   a. $x + y - 10 = 0$
   b. $x + y + 10 = 0$
   c. $x - y - 10 = 0$
   d. $x - y + 10 = 0$

2. For the second term, we have the following four cases:
   a. $x - 8 = 0$
   b. $x + 8 = 0$
   c. $y - 8 = 0$
   d. $y + 8 = 0$

Solving these equations, we get the following points:

1. For the first term:
   a. $(5, 5)$
   b. $(-5, -5)$
   c. $(10, -10)$
   d. $(-10, 10)$

2. For the second term:
   a. $(8, 0)$
   b. $(-8, 0)$
   c. $(0, 8)$
   d. $(0, -8)$

Plotting these points on a graph, we can see that they form a square with side length 20. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 400. The answer is $\boxed{400}$.

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



We are given the equation:

$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$

This equation is equal to zero if either of the two factors is equal to zero. So we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
This case implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. The intersection points of these lines are $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, and $(0, -10)$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
This case implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. The intersection points of these lines are $(8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The convex polygon formed by the intersection of the solutions from both cases is a square with side length 20. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 400.
The answer is: $400$

The problem is asking for the area of a polygon formed by the intersection of the solutions to two absolute value equations. We can solve each equation separately and then find the intersection points to determine the vertices of the polygon. Finally, we can calculate the area of the polygon using the Shoelace formula.

The area of the convex polygon is 0, but this is not possible because the area of a polygon cannot be 0. There must be a mistake in the calculation. Let's retrace our steps and find the error.

Upon reexamination, we realize that the intersection of the solutions to the two equations does not actually form a polygon. The first equation, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, implies that $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$. The second equation, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, implies that $x = 8$ and $y = 8$ or $x = -8$ and $y = -8$. The intersection of these solutions does not form a polygon, but rather a set of four points: $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, and $(0, -10)$. These points form a square with side length 20, so its area is $20^2 = 400$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 400.

The correct answer is $\boxed{400}$.

The given equation is satisfied only when both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, or both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The first pair of equations implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which are the equations of two lines passing through the origin with slopes 1 and -1.
The second pair of equations implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which are the equations of two lines passing through the origin with slopes 1 and -1.
