**Problem:** 
"How many distinct solutions are there to the equation $|x-7| = |x+1|$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
If $|x-7| = |x+1|$, then either $x-7 = x+1$ or $x-7 = -(x+1)$.  Simplifying $x-7=x+1$ gives $0=8$, which has no solutions, so no values of $x$ satisfy $x-7 = x+1$.  If $x-7 = -(x+1)$, then $x-7 = -x-1$, so $2x = 6$, which gives $x=3$.  So, there is $\boxed{1}$ solution.

Challenge: See if you can find a quick solution to this problem by simply thinking about the graphs of $y=|x-7|$ and $y=|x+1|$. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



To solve this problem, we need to understand that the equation $| |x-1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 1 and 2. This is because the expression on the left side of the equation, $| |x-1| - 2|$, can take on values between 1 and 2 only. Therefore, $\frac{m}{100}$ should be strictly greater than 1 and strictly less than 2.

This means that $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which implies $100 < m < 200$.

Now we need to find how many positive integers $m$ are there in the range (100, 200). We can find the number of these integers by subtracting the smallest integer in the range from the largest integer in the range and then subtract 1.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def find_m():
    lower_bound = 100
    upper_bound = 200

    # Find the number of integers in the range (lower_bound, upper_bound)
    number_of_m = upper_bound - lower_bound - 1

    return number_of_m

number_of_m = find_m()
print(number_of_m)
```

CODE RESULTS 99

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
99
```
The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $| |x-1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 99. The answer is: 99

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many solutions does the equation \[\frac{(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)\dotsm(x-100)}{(x-1^2)(x-2^2)(x-3^2)\dotsm(x-100^2)} = 0\]have for $x$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Any solution to this equation must make the numerator of the left-hand side zero, while keeping the denominator non-zero. The numerator is zero when $x$ is one of the numbers $1, 2, 3, \dots, 100.$ However, for any value in this list that is a perfect square, the denominator will also be zero, so that value of $x$ will not be a root. Therefore, we want to find the number of integers in the list $1, 2, \dots, 100$ which are not perfect squares. The perfect squares in the list are $1^2, 2^2, \dots, 10^2,$ so there are $10$ perfect squares, and \[100 - 10 = \boxed{90}\]integers which are not perfect squares. The answer is $\boxed{90}$

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**



First, let's analyze the given equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.

The number of distinct solutions of this equation depends on the value of $m$. For the equation to have four distinct solutions, the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be such that the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, changes its sign exactly three times. This occurs when $\frac{m}{100}=1$.

Therefore, $m=100$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def find_m():
    """For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"""
    m = 100
    return m

m = find_m()
print(m)
```

CODE RESULTS 100

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
100
```

The value of $m$ that makes the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have four distinct solutions is $100$. So, there is only one positive integer $m$ that satisfies this condition, namely $m = 100$. The answer is $\boxed{1}$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many integers are solutions to the equation $$(x-2)^{(25-x^2)}=1?$$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
We need some basic facts from number theory: $a^0 = 1$ for any $a,$ $1^b = 1$ for any $b,$ and $(-1)^c = 1$ if $c$ is an even integer. Unless the base is a complex number (which is excluded since we are looking for integer solutions), there are no other ways to get an RHS of $1.$ Thus, either the exponent is zero $($giving the equation $25 - x^2 = 0),$ the base is $1$ $($giving $x -2 = 1),$ or the base is $-1$ and the exponent is even $($giving the simultaneous equations $x - 2 = -1$ and $25 - x^2 = 2n$ for some integer $n).$ Solving the first equation gives $x = \pm 5,$ and solving the second gives $x = 3.$ The third equation implies that $x = 1,$ in which case $25 - x^2 = 24$ is indeed even, so $x = 1$ is a valid solution. In all, there are $\boxed{4}$ integer solutions. The answer is $\boxed{4}$

**Solution:**



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is a positive integer less than or equal to 2. Therefore, the only possible values for $m$ are 100, 200. So the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition is 2.

The number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition is 2. However, the problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation has exactly 4 distinct solutions. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{2}$.
The answer is $\boxed{2}$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let \[f(x) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
-x + 3 & \text{if } x \le 0, \\
2x - 5 & \text{if } x > 0.
\end{array}
\right.\]How many solutions does the equation $f(f(x)) = 4$ have?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
To solve the equation $f(f(x)) = 4,$ we first find the values $x$ such that $f(x) = 4.$

Either $f(x) = -x + 3$ (for $x \le 0$) or $f(x) = 2x - 5$ (for $x > 0$). If $-x + 3 = 4,$ then $x = -1.$ Note that this value satisfies $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = 4,$ then $x = 9/2.$ Note that this value satisfies $x > 0.$ Therefore, the solutions to $f(x) = 4$ are $x = -1$ and $x = 9/2.$

Next, we solve for the values $x$ such that $f(x) = -1.$ If $-x + 3 = -1,$ then $x = 4.$ This value does not satisfy $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = -1,$ then $x = 2.$ This value satisfies $x > 0.$

Finally, we solve for the values $x$ such that $f(x) = 9/2.$ If $-x + 3 = 9/2,$ then $x = -3/2.$ This value satisfies $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = 9/2,$ then $x = 19/4.$ This value satisfies $x > 0.$

Therefore, the equation $f(f(x)) = 4$ has the solutions $x = 2,$ $-3/2,$ and $19/4,$ for a total of $\boxed{3}$ solutions. The answer is $\boxed{3}$

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


First, we need to understand the structure of the equation. The equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $2 - |x - 1|$ exactly twice and $2 + |x - 1|$ exactly twice. This is because the function $| |x - 1| - 2|$ oscillates between $-2$ and $2$, and the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must cover this range exactly twice.

To find the value of $m$, we can set up an equation based on this observation. The equation is $2 * (2 - \frac{m}{100}) = 2 * (2 + \frac{m}{100})$, which simplifies to $4 - \frac{2m}{100} = 4 + \frac{2m}{100}$. 

Solving this equation gives $\frac{4m}{100} = 8$, so $m = 200$.

To confirm this, we can substitute $m = 200$ back into the equation and check that it has four distinct solutions. The equation becomes $| |x - 1| - 2| = 2$, which simplifies to $|x - 1| = 4$ or $|x - 1| = 0$. The solutions to $|x - 1| = 4$ are $x = 5$ and $x = -3$, and the solution to $|x - 1| = 0$ is $x = 1$. So indeed, the equation has four distinct solutions when $m = 200$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is $1$. The answer is $\boxed{1}$.

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The equation $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when $m$ is an integer between 1 and 100. The number of solutions depends on the value of $\frac{m}{100}$, specifically when it equals to 1 or 2. When $\frac{m}{100} = 1$, the equation becomes $| |x-1| - 2 | = 1$, which has 4 solutions. When $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, the equation becomes $| |x-1| - 2 | = 2$, which also has 4 solutions. Therefore, there are $\boxed{2}$ possible values of $m$.

The value of $m$ is 100 or 200. However, since $m$ must be a positive integer less than or equal to 100, the only possible value for $m$ is 100.

The code above is incorrect because it only checks for the case when $\frac{m}{100} = 1$ and does not consider the case when $\frac{m}{100} = 2$.

```python

Let's think step by step:
If $|x-7| = |x+1|$, then either $x-7 = x+1$ or $x-7 = -(x+1)$.  Simplifying $x-7=x+1$ gives $0=8$, which has no solutions, so no values of $x$ satisfy $x-7 = x+1$.  If $x-7 = -(x+1)$, then $x-7 = -x-1$, so $2x = 6$, which gives $x=3$.  So, there is $\boxed{1}$ solution.

        solutions = solve(equation, x)
        if len(solutions) == 4:
            solutions_count += 1

    return solutions_count

result = number_of_solutions()
print(result)
```
