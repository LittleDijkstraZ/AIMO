**Problem:** 
"The graph of $y=ax^2 + bx + c$ is a parabola with vertical axis of symmetry.  The vertex of this parabola is $(2,3)$ and the parabola contains the point $(4,4)$.  Find the value of $y$ when $x=6$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Because the parabola has vertex $(2,3)$, it is the graph of  \[y=a(x-2)^2+3\] for some number $a$.  In order for the graph to contain the point $(4,4)$, we must also have  \[4=a(4-2)^2+3=4a+3,\] so $a=\frac14$, and our parabola is the graph of \[y=\frac14(x-2)^2 + 3.\] Setting $x=6$ in this gives us  \[y = \frac14(6-2)^2 + 3 = 4+3=\boxed{7}.\] The answer is $\boxed{7}$

```

The above code is not working as expected because the `solve` function is not able to solve the equation when the argument is not real or imaginary. This is because the `solve` function is not designed to handle absolute value equations. We need to use a different approach to solve this problem.

Let's try a different approach:

The equation of the parabola is $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$. When $y = 4$, we have $4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l$. Rearranging, we get $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$. This is a quadratic equation in $x$. The solutions of this equation are given by the quadratic formula $x = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{(2k)^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k} = 1 \pm \sqrt{1 - \frac{l - 4}{k}}$.

The distance between the two points of intersection is $6$, so $|x_2 - x_1| = 6$. We have $|1 + \sqrt{1 - \frac{l - 4}{k} } - (1 - \sqrt{1 - \frac{l - 4}{k} })| = 6$, which simplifies to $2\sqrt{1 - \frac{l - 4}{k} } = 6$. Dividing both sides by $2$, we get $\sqrt{1 - \frac{l - 4}{k} } = 3$. Squaring both sides, we get $1 - \frac{l - 4}{k} = 9$. Simplifying, we get $\frac{l - 4}{k} = -8$. Multiplying both sides by $k$, we get $l - 4 = -8k$. Rearranging, we get $l = 4 - 8k$.

Now, we want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The coordinates of $A$ are $(x_1, 4)$ and the coordinates of $B$ are $(x_2, 4)$. The distance from $A$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x_1^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{(1 - \sqrt{1 - \frac{l - 4}{k} })^2 + 16} = \sqrt{(1 - \sqrt{1 - \frac{4 - 8k - 4}{k}})^2 + 16} = \sqrt{(1 - \sqrt{1 + 8k/k})^2 + 16} = \sqrt{(1 - \sqrt{1 + 8})^2 + 16} = \sqrt{(1 - 3)^2 + 16} = \sqrt{4 + 16} = \sqrt{20}$.

Similarly, the distance from $B$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x_2^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{(1 + \sqrt{1 - \frac{l - 4}{k} })^2 + 16} = \sqrt{(1 + \sqrt{1 + 8})^2 + 16} = \sqrt{20}$.

Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $\sqrt{20}^2 + \sqrt{20}^2 = 20 + 20 = 40$.

So the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $40$.

The answer is: $40$

The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $\boxed{21.160493827160494}$. However, this is not a valid answer because it is not a positive integer. Let's re-examine our calculations.

2*(18*k - l + 4)/k
```
The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $2\left(\frac{18k - l + 4}{k}\right)$. However, we know that $k$ and $l$ are parameters such that the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$ that are distance 6 apart. This means that the discriminant of the parabola must be positive, i.e., $(2k)^2 - 4k(l - 4) > 0$, which simplifies to $4k^2 - 4kl + 16k > 0$. Dividing through by 4 gives $k^2 - kl + 4k > 0$. We also know that the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, which means $|A - B| = 6$. But $|A - B| = \sqrt{(B - A)^2} = \sqrt{(2k)^2} = 2k$, so $2k = 6$ and $k = 3$. Substituting $k = 3$ into the equation $k^2 - kl + 4k > 0$ gives $9 - 3l + 12 > 0$, which simplifies to $21 - 3l > 0$. Solving for $l$ gives $l < 7$. But since $l > 0$, the smallest possible value of $l$ is 1. Substituting $k = 3$ and $l = 1$ into the sum of squares of distances gives $2\left(\frac{18*3 - 1 + 4}{3}\right) = 2\left(\frac{53}{3}\right) = \frac{106}{3}$. However, this is not an integer, which is a contradiction. Therefore, we must have made an error in our calculations.

Upon revisiting our calculations, we realize that we made an error in our substitution of the condition that the distance between A and B is 6. The correct substitution should be $sqrt((B - A)^2) = 6$, which simplifies to $|2k| = 6$. This gives two possible solutions: $k = 3$ and $k = -3$. However, since $k > 0$, we must have $k = 3$. Substituting $k = 3$ into the equation $k^2 - kl + 4k > 0$ gives $9 - 3l + 12 > 0$, which simplifies to $21 - 3l > 0$. Solving for $l$ gives $l < 7$. But since $l > 0$, the smallest possible value of $l$ is 1. Substituting $k = 3$ and $l = 1$ into the sum of squares of distances gives $2\left(\frac{18*3 - 1 + 4}{3}\right) = 2\left(\frac{53}{3}\right) = \frac{106}{3}$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"The graph of $y=ax^2 + bx + c$ is a parabola with vertical axis of symmetry.  The vertex of this parabola is $(2,3)$ and the parabola contains the point $(4,4)$.  Find the value of $y$ when $x=6$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Because the parabola has vertex $(2,3)$, it is the graph of  \[y=a(x-2)^2+3\] for some number $a$.  In order for the graph to contain the point $(4,4)$, we must also have  \[4=a(4-2)^2+3=4a+3,\] so $a=\frac14$, and our parabola is the graph of \[y=\frac14(x-2)^2 + 3.\] Setting $x=6$ in this gives us  \[y = \frac14(6-2)^2 + 3 = 4+3=\boxed{7}.\] The answer is $\boxed{7}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



1. First, we need to find the x-coordinates of points A and B by setting $y = 4$ in the equation of the parabola: $4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l$.
2. Rearrange the equation to get a quadratic equation: $kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0$.
3. Let's denote the roots of this quadratic equation as $x_1$ and $x_2$, which represent the x-coordinates of points A and B.
4. According to the properties of quadratic equations, the sum of the roots $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$, and the product of the roots $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$.
5. Given that the distance between A and B is 6, we have $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 6^2 = 36$.
6. By the formula for the difference of squares, $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = (x_2 + x_1)^2 - 4x_1x_2$, we can substitute the values we found earlier: $36 = (2)^2 - 4(\frac{l - 4}{k}) = 4 - \frac{4l - 16}{k}$.
7. Simplifying the equation gives $36 = \frac{16 - 4l}{k}$, and further simplification gives $4lk - 16k = 36k - 144$.
8. Rearranging terms gives $4lk = 52k$, and further simplification gives $l = \frac{52}{4} = 13$.
9. Now we can find the sum of the squares of the distances from A and B to the origin. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. Since the points are on the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$, the distance from a point with x-coordinate $x$ is $\sqrt{x^2 + (kx^2 - 2kx + 13)^2}$.
10. We want to find the sum of the squares of the distances for points A and B, which are represented by $x_1$ and $x_2$. This is given by $\left(\sqrt{x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + 13)^2}\right)^2 + \left(\sqrt{x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + 13)^2}\right)^2$.
11. However, since the parabola is symmetric about the line $x = 1$, the distances from A and B to the origin are equal. Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances is twice the square of the distance from either A or B to the origin.
12. The distance from a point with x-coordinate $x$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + (kx^2 - 2kx + 13)^2}$. For point A with x-coordinate $x_1$, this is $\sqrt{x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + 13)^2}$.
13. Substituting $x_1 = 1$ (since the parabola is symmetric about the line $x = 1$), we get the distance from A to the origin as $\sqrt{1^2 + (k - 2k + 13)^2} = \sqrt{1 + (13 - k)^2}$.
14. The sum of the squares of the distances from A and B to the origin is then $2\left(\sqrt{1 + (13 - k)^2}\right)^2 = 2(1 + (13 - k)^2)$.
15. Finally, we substitute $k = 1$ (from the equation $4lk - 16k = 36k - 144$), to get the sum of the squares of the distances as $2(1 + (13 - 1)^2) = 2(1 + 144) = 2(145) = 290$.

So the sum of the squares of the distances from A and B to the origin is 290. The answer is: $290$

2*(6*k - l + 4)/k
```
The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $\boxed{\frac{2(6k - l + 4)}{k}}$.

However, we know that $k$ and $l$ are parameters that satisfy the conditions of the problem. We can use the condition that the parabola intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$ that are distance 6 apart to find a relationship between $k$ and $l$.

From the equation of the parabola, we have $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$. Setting $y = 4$, we get $4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l$. Rearranging the terms, we have $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$. This is a quadratic equation in $x$, and its solutions are given by the quadratic formula $x = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{(2k)^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k} = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k} = 1 \pm \sqrt{1 - \frac{l - 4}{k}}$.

The distance between the two solutions is given by the difference between the two solutions, which is $2\sqrt{1 - \frac{l - 4}{k}}$. Setting this equal to 6, we get $2\sqrt{1 - \frac{l - 4}{k}} = 6$. Squaring both sides, we have $4\left(1 - \frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = 36$. Simplifying, we get $4 - \frac{4(l - 4)}{k} = 9$. Multiplying both sides by $k$, we get $4k - 4(l - 4) = 9k$. Expanding, we have $4k - 4l + 16 = 9k$. Rearranging, we get $5k = 4l - 16$.

Now, we can substitute this relationship into the expression for the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. We have $\frac{2(6k - l + 4)}{k} = \frac{2(6(4l - 16)/5 - l + 4)}{(4l - 16)/5}$. Simplifying, we get $\frac{2(24l - 96 - 5l + 20)}{4l - 16} = \frac{2(19l - 76)}{4l - 16}$.

This simplifies to $\frac{38l - 152}{4l - 16}$. We can simplify this further by factoring the numerator and the denominator. The numerator $38l - 152$ can be factored as $2(19l - 76)$, and the denominator $4l - 16$ can be factored as $4(l - 4)$. So, we have $\frac{2(19l - 76)}{4(l - 4)} = \frac{19l - 76}{2(l - 4)}$.

This simplifies to $\frac{19(l - 4)}{2(l - 4)} = \frac{19}{2}$. So, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $\frac{19}{2}$.

Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $\boxed{\frac{19}{2}}$.
The answer is $\boxed{\frac{19}{2}}$.

The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $\boxed{64 + \frac{2(k - \sqrt{k(k - l + 4)})(k + \sqrt{k(k - l + 4)})}{k^2}}$. However, we know that $k$ and $l$ are positive parameters, and the expression under the square root in the solution for $x$ must be non-negative. This implies that $k(k - l + 4) \geq 0$, which simplifies to $l \leq k + 4$. 

We also know that the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, which implies that $|x_1 - x_2| = 6$. This means that $(x_1 - x_2)^2 = 36$, which simplifies to $4k^2 - 4k(k - l + 4) = 36$, or $k^2 - (k - l + 4)k + 9 = 0$. 

This is a quadratic equation in $k$, and its discriminant must be non-negative, which implies that $(k - l + 4)^2 - 4*9 \geq 0$, or $(k - l + 4)^2 \geq 36$. This simplifies to $k - l + 4 \geq 6$, or $l \leq k - 2$. 

Combining the two inequalities, we have $l \leq k + 4$ and $l \leq k - 2$, which implies that $l \leq k - 2$.
