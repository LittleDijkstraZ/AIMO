**Example**

**Problem:** 
"For certain ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ of real numbers, the system of equations
\[\begin{aligned} ax+by&=1 \\ x^2 + y^2 &= 50  \end{aligned}\]has at least one solution, and each solution is an ordered pair $(x,y)\,$ of integers. How many such ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ are there?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The graph of $ax+by=1$ is a line, while the graph of $x^2+y^2=50$ is a circle centered at the origin. Therefore, $(a, b)$ satisfies the conditions if and only if the line and circle intersect at least once, and they intersect only at lattice points (points with integer coordinates).

Knowing this, it makes sense to look for lattice points on the circle whose equation is $x^2+y^2=50$. Testing cases, we find that there are twelve lattice points on the circle: $(\pm 1, \pm 7)$, $(\pm 7, \pm 1)$, and $(\pm 5, \pm 5)$ (where the two $\pm$ signs in each pair are independent of each other).

There are $\tbinom{12}{2} = 66$ pairs of these points, and each pair determines a line. However, the graph of $ax+by=1$ can never pass through the origin $(0, 0)$, since if $x=y=0$, then $ax+by=0 \neq 1$. Therefore, the six pairs which consist of diametrically opposed points are invalid, since the line through them passes through the origin. This corrects our count to $66 - 6 = 60$.

In addition, for each of the twelve points, there is a line tangent to the circle at that point, so that the only solution to the system is that one point. This brings the final total to $60 + 12 = \boxed{72}$. The answer is $\boxed{72}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



To solve the problem, we need to find the value of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. We can start by considering the possible values of $\vert x-1 \vert -2$.

1. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, then $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. This gives two equations: $x - 1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x - 1 = -2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
2. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$, then $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. This gives two equations: $x - 1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x - 1 = -2 + \frac{m}{100}$.

For each of the four equations above, we can solve for $x$ and count the number of distinct solutions. If there are 4 distinct solutions, then that value of $m$ is the one we are looking for.

The above code is incorrect because it is trying to use `is_finite` method on a list, which is not applicable here. The problem is that `is_finite` method checks if the solution is a finite number or not. But here, we are actually interested in the number of distinct solutions, not whether each solution is finite or not.

We need to modify the code to count the number of distinct solutions.

The above code is incorrect because it is trying to use `set` function on a list of `sympy` equations, which is not applicable here. The problem is that `set` function creates a set of unique elements, but here we need to count the number of unique solutions, not the number of unique equations.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many distinct solutions are there to the equation $|x-7| = |x+1|$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
If $|x-7| = |x+1|$, then either $x-7 = x+1$ or $x-7 = -(x+1)$.  Simplifying $x-7=x+1$ gives $0=8$, which has no solutions, so no values of $x$ satisfy $x-7 = x+1$.  If $x-7 = -(x+1)$, then $x-7 = -x-1$, so $2x = 6$, which gives $x=3$.  So, there is $\boxed{1}$ solution.

Challenge: See if you can find a quick solution to this problem by simply thinking about the graphs of $y=|x-7|$ and $y=|x+1|$. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Step 1: Understand the problem

The problem asks us to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

Step 2: Recognize the equation as a piecewise function

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is a piecewise function, and its graph is made up of four line segments. The number of solutions of the equation is equal to the number of times the graph of $\frac{m}{100}$ intersects the graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$.

Step 3: Analyze the graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$

The graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a "V" shape with its lowest point at $(1, 2)$ and its two arms extending upwards.

Step 4: Find the values of $m$ for which the graph of $\frac{m}{100}$ intersects the graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ exactly 4 times.

We can see that the graph of $\frac{m}{100}$ intersects the graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ exactly 4 times when $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 1$. This implies that $0 < m < 100$. The only positive integer in this range is $m = 1$.

So, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

The answer is: $1$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. We know that the absolute value function $\vert x \vert$ is a piecewise function that equals $x$ if $x \geq 0$ and $-x$ if $x < 0$. So the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have 4 distinct solutions when the right side $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to the difference of two piecewise functions.

This means we need to find the value of $m$ such that the right side of the equation is equal to the difference of two piecewise functions and has 4 distinct solutions.

To solve this problem, we can use Python and the sympy library to help us with the calculations.

First, let's define the piecewise functions:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import Piecewise, Symbol, Eq, solve

def piecewise_functions():
    x = Symbol('x')
    f1 = x - 1
    f2 = -x + 1

    # Define the piecewise functions
    g1 = Piecewise((f1 - 2, f1 - 2 >= 0), (-f1 + 2, f1 - 2 < 0))
    g2 = Piecewise((-f2 - 2, -f2 - 2 >= 0), (f2 + 2, -f2 - 2 < 0))

    return g1, g2

g1, g2 = piecewise_functions()

The piecewise functions are: $g_1(x) = \begin{cases} x - 3, & x \geq 3 \\ 3 - x, & x < 3 \end{cases}$ and $g_2(x) = \begin{cases} x - 3, & x \geq 3 \\ 3 - x, & x < 3 \end{cases}$. Notice that $g_1(x)$ and $g_2(x)$ are the same function.

Now, we need to find the value of $m$ such that $\frac{m}{100}$ equals the difference of $g_1(x)$ and $g_2(x)$:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def find_m():
    m = Symbol('m')

This means that the equation $\frac{m}{100} = g_1(x) - g_2(x)$ has only one solution, $m = 0$. This does not satisfy our requirement that the equation has 4 distinct solutions.

However, we can rewrite the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ as $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ and $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=-\frac{m}{100}$. The second equation does not have 4 distinct solutions because the absolute value function is always nonnegative, so the right side of the equation cannot be negative.

Therefore, we only need to consider the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. We know that the absolute value function $\vert x \vert$ is a piecewise function that equals $x$ if $x \geq 0$ and $-x$ if $x < 0$. So the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have 4 distinct solutions when the right side $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to the difference of two piecewise functions and has 4 distinct solutions.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many distinct solutions are there to the equation $|x-7| = |x+1|$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
If $|x-7| = |x+1|$, then either $x-7 = x+1$ or $x-7 = -(x+1)$.  Simplifying $x-7=x+1$ gives $0=8$, which has no solutions, so no values of $x$ satisfy $x-7 = x+1$.  If $x-7 = -(x+1)$, then $x-7 = -x-1$, so $2x = 6$, which gives $x=3$.  So, there is $\boxed{1}$ solution.

Challenge: See if you can find a quick solution to this problem by simply thinking about the graphs of $y=|x-7|$ and $y=|x+1|$. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions for a specific value of $m$, which means that the expression on the left side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, can take the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ four times. 

This equation is equivalent to the following four equations:
1. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$
2. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$
3. $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = \frac{m}{100}$
4. $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = -\frac{m}{100}$

Each of these equations represents a different scenario where the absolute value of an expression is equal to a certain value. The solutions to these equations will give us the values of $x$ for each scenario. The number of solutions for each equation will determine the value of $m$.

Let's now write a Python function to find the value of $m$.

The empty list returned indicates that there are no values of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. This seems to contradict the problem statement. Let's re-examine the setup of the equations.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions for a specific value of $m$, which means that the expression on the left side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, can take the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ four times. 

This equation is equivalent to the following four equations:
1. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$
2. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$
3. $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = \frac{m}{100}$
4. $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = -\frac{m}{100}$

Each of these equations represents a different scenario where the absolute value of an expression is equal to a certain value. The solutions to these equations will give us the values of $x$ for each scenario. The number of solutions for each equation will determine the value of $m$.

However, the setup of the equations is incorrect. The correct setup should be:
1. $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$
2. $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = -\frac{m}{100}$
3. $-\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$
4. $-\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = -\frac{m}{100}$

Let's re-write the Python function with the correct setup of equations.

The numerator is zero when $x$ is one of the numbers $1, 2, 3, \dots, 100.$ However, for any value in this list that is a perfect square, the denominator will also be zero, so that value of $x$ will not be a root. Therefore, we want to find the number of integers in the list $1, 2, \dots, 100$ which are not perfect squares. The perfect squares in the list are $1^2, 2^2, \dots, 10^2,$ so there are $10$ perfect squares, and \[100 - 10 = \boxed{90}\]integers which are not perfect squares. The answer is $\boxed{90}$

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step.

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


This problem involves the absolute value function, which is not a straightforward operation in sympy. However, we can solve it by considering the different cases for the absolute value. The absolute value function can be split into two cases:

1. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 > 0$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\vert x-1 \vert -2$.
2. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 \le 0$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=-\vert x-1 \vert +2$.

Now, we need to solve the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ for $4$ distinct solutions. We can solve this by considering the different cases for the absolute value function.

Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 > 0$. In this case, the equation becomes $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$. Solving this equation gives us:
- $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$,
- $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 = -(2 + \frac{m}{100})$.
Solving these equations gives us:
- $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Case 2: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 \le 0$. In this case, the equation becomes $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = \frac{m}{100}$. Solving this equation gives us:
- $-\vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100} - 2$,
- $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
Solving this equation gives us:
- $x = 1 + 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ or $x = 1 - (2 - \frac{m}{100})$.
Simplifying these equations gives us:
- $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ or $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Comparing the solutions from both cases, we see that the distinct solutions are $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$, $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$, and $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$. For these solutions to be distinct, we need $\frac{m}{100}$ to be different from $2$. Therefore, $m$ must not be a multiple of $100$.

Now, we need to find the value of $m$ for which the equation has exactly $4$ distinct solutions. The equation has $4$ distinct solutions when the distance between any two consecutive solutions is greater than $2$. The distance between consecutive solutions in the $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ is $\frac{2m}{100}$, and the distance between consecutive solutions in the $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$ is $\frac{2m}{100}$. Therefore, we need $\frac{2m}{100} > 2$, which gives $m > 100$. The smallest integer $m$ that satisfies this condition is $m = 101$.

Therefore, the only value of $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $m = 101$. The answer is $\boxed{1}$.

**Solution:** 


First, let's note that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $1$. This is because the expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ can take on values from $0$ to $3$, and it takes on each of these values exactly once. Therefore, we need to solve the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = 1$.

To solve this equation, we first solve $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 1$ and $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -1$. The solutions to these two equations are $x = 4$ and $x = 0$, respectively. This means that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = 1$ is equivalent to $\vert x-1 \vert = 3$ or $\vert x-1 \vert = 1$. The solutions to these two equations are $x = 4$ and $x = 0$, as well as $x = 2$ and $x = 0$, respectively. The solutions $x = 0$ and $x = 4$ are the intersection of all these cases, and the solutions $x = 2$ are the solutions to $\vert x-1 \vert = 1$ that do not intersect with any of the other cases. Therefore, the 4 distinct solutions to the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$ are $x = 0$, $x = 2$, and $x = 4$.

To find the value of $m$, we need to set $\frac{m}{100} = 1$, so $m = 100$. Therefore, the value of $m$ is $100$.
The answer is $\boxed{100}$.

**Solution:** 



To find out for how many positive integers $m$ the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions, we can use the property of absolute values. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have four distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is less than $2$ but greater than $0$. This is because the graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ will have a "V" shape with the maximum value being $2$, and the number of solutions to the equation will be $4$ when $\frac{m}{100}$ is between $0$ and $2$. Therefore, we need to find the values of $m$ that satisfy $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. This is equivalent to $0 < m < 200$. The number of positive integers in this range is $199$. So the value of unknown variable $m$ is $199$.

## QUESTION 2 - 9

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"For certain ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ of real numbers, the system of equations
\[\begin{aligned} ax+by&=1 \\ x^2 + y^2 &= 50  \end{aligned}\]has at least one solution, and each solution is an ordered pair $(x,y)\,$ of integers. How many such ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ are there?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The graph of $ax+by=1$ is a line, while the graph of $x^2+y^2=50$ is a circle centered at the origin. Therefore, $(a, b)$ satisfies the conditions if and only if the line and circle intersect at least once, and they intersect only at lattice points (points with integer coordinates).

Knowing this, it makes sense to look for lattice points on the circle whose equation is $x^2+y^2=50$. Testing cases, we find that there are twelve lattice points on the circle: $(\pm 1, \pm 7)$, $(\pm 7, \pm 1)$, and $(\pm 5, \pm 5)$ (where the two $\pm$ signs in each pair are independent of each other).

There are $\tbinom{12}{2} = 66$ pairs of these points, and each pair determines a line. However, the graph of $ax+by=1$ can never pass through the origin $(0, 0)$, since if $x=y=0$, then $ax+by=0 \neq 1$. Therefore, the six pairs which consist of diametrically opposed points are invalid, since the line through them passes through the origin. This corrects our count to $66 - 6 = 60$.

In addition, for each of the twelve points, there is a line tangent to the circle at that point, so that the only solution to the system is that one point. This brings the final total to $60 + 12 = \boxed{72}$. The answer is $\boxed{72}$

**Solution:** 


To solve the problem, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

First, we need to understand the behavior of the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. The function $f(x)$ is a "modified" absolute value function, which takes on the value $0$ at $x=1$, decreases linearly to $-1$ as $x$ decreases to $0$, then increases linearly to $1$ as $x$ increases to $2$, and then decreases linearly to $0$ as $x$ increases to $3$. Thus, $f(x)$ is $0$ for $x \in [1,2]$ and $1$ for $x \in [0,1] \cup [3,\infty)$.

Setting $f(x) = \frac{m}{100}$, we see that $\frac{m}{100}$ must be in the interval $[0,1]$ for the equation to have four distinct solutions. This means $0 \leq \frac{m}{100} \leq 1$, or $0 \leq m \leq 100$.

To have exactly four distinct solutions, $\frac{m}{100}$ must equal the value of $f(x)$ at the points of transition from $0$ to $1$, which are $x=1$ and $x=2$. Thus, $\frac{m}{100}$ must equal $f(1) = 0$ or $f(2) = 1$.

If $\frac{m}{100} = 0$, then $m=0$, which is not positive. If $\frac{m}{100} = 1$, then $m=100$. Thus, the only value of $m$ that works is $m=100$.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $1$. The answer is: $1$

If $\vert x-1 \vert -2$ is positive, then we have the equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$. Solving this equation gives us two cases:
1. If $x-1 \geq 0$, then $x-1 -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = 1 + 2 + \frac{m}{100} = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.
2. If $x-1 < 0$, then $-(x-1) -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = 1 - 2 + \frac{m}{100} = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

If $\vert x-1 \vert -2$ is negative, then we have the equation $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = \frac{m}{100}$. Solving this equation gives us two cases:
1. If $x-1 \geq 0$, then $-(x-1) +2 = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = 1 - 2 + \frac{m}{100} = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.
2. If $x-1 < 0$, then $x-1 +2 = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = 1 - 2 + \frac{m}{100} = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

From the above analysis, we can see that the equation has four distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, which gives $m = 200$.

Therefore, the only value of $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is $m = 200$. The answer is: $1$
