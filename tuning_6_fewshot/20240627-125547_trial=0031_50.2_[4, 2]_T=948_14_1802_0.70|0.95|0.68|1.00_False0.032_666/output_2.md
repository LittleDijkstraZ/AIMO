**Problem:** 
"For certain ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ of real numbers, the system of equations
\[\begin{aligned} ax+by&=1 \\ x^2 + y^2 &= 50  \end{aligned}\]has at least one solution, and each solution is an ordered pair $(x,y)\,$ of integers. How many such ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ are there?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The graph of $ax+by=1$ is a line, while the graph of $x^2+y^2=50$ is a circle centered at the origin. Therefore, $(a, b)$ satisfies the conditions if and only if the line and circle intersect at least once, and they intersect only at lattice points (points with integer coordinates).

Knowing this, it makes sense to look for lattice points on the circle whose equation is $x^2+y^2=50$. Testing cases, we find that there are twelve lattice points on the circle: $(\pm 1, \pm 7)$, $(\pm 7, \pm 1)$, and $(\pm 5, \pm 5)$ (where the two $\pm$ signs in each pair are independent of each other).

There are $\tbinom{12}{2} = 66$ pairs of these points, and each pair determines a line. However, the graph of $ax+by=1$ can never pass through the origin $(0, 0)$, since if $x=y=0$, then $ax+by=0 \neq 1$. Therefore, the six pairs which consist of diametrically opposed points are invalid, since the line through them passes through the origin. This corrects our count to $66 - 6 = 60$.

In addition, for each of the twelve points, there is a line tangent to the circle at that point, so that the only solution to the system is that one point. This brings the final total to $60 + 12 = \boxed{72}$. The answer is $\boxed{72}$

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The equation $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 1 and 2. This is because the function $| |x-1| - 2 |$ has a shape of a "V" with the vertex at $(1, 2)$, and it takes on all values between 0 and 2 exactly once as $x$ varies over the real numbers. Therefore, if $\frac{m}{100}$ is less than 1, the equation has 2 distinct solutions. If $\frac{m}{100}$ is greater than 2, the equation has 0 distinct solutions. And if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 1 and 2, the equation has 4 distinct solutions.

So we want to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Multiplying all sides of the inequalities by 100 gives $100 < m < 200$. The number of positive integers in this range is $200 - 100 - 1 = 99$. So there are 99 positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def count_m():
    """For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"""
    lower_bound = 100
    upper_bound = 200
    count = upper_bound - lower_bound - 1
    return count

result = count_m()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 99

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
99
```
The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 99. The answer is: $99$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many distinct solutions are there to the equation $|x-7| = |x+1|$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
If $|x-7| = |x+1|$, then either $x-7 = x+1$ or $x-7 = -(x+1)$.  Simplifying $x-7=x+1$ gives $0=8$, which has no solutions, so no values of $x$ satisfy $x-7 = x+1$.  If $x-7 = -(x+1)$, then $x-7 = -x-1$, so $2x = 6$, which gives $x=3$.  So, there is $\boxed{1}$ solution.

Challenge: See if you can find a quick solution to this problem by simply thinking about the graphs of $y=|x-7|$ and $y=|x+1|$. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Solution:**



To solve this problem, we need to analyze the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ and find the values of $m$ that give it four distinct solutions.

First, let's consider the case where $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. In this case, the equation becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=2$. Solving this equation gives us four solutions: $x = -3, 5, 3, -1$.

Next, let's consider the case where $\frac{m}{100} = 1$. In this case, the equation becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=1$. Solving this equation gives us four solutions: $x = 0, 2, 4, -2$.

Finally, let's consider the case where $\frac{m}{100} < 1$. In this case, the equation does not have four distinct solutions.

From the above analysis, we can see that the values of $m$ that give the equation four distinct solutions are $m = 200$ and $m = 100$. Therefore, there are $2$ positive integers $m$ that satisfy the given condition. The answer is: $\boxed{2}$

**Solution:** 



To solve this problem, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly four distinct solutions.

We can start by considering the range of possible values for $m$. Since the right side of the equation is nonnegative, $m/100$ must be nonnegative, which means $m$ must be nonnegative. Also, since the absolute value of a number is always nonnegative, the left side of the equation is nonnegative, which means $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ must be nonnegative. This implies that $\vert x-1 \vert -2$ must be either zero or nonnegative.

If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 0$, then $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$. This gives us two cases: $x-1 = 2$ or $x-1 = -2$. The solutions to these equations are $x = 3$ and $x = -1$, respectively. So, when $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 0$, we have two solutions.

If $\vert x-1 \vert -2$ is nonnegative, then $\vert x-1 \vert \geq 2$. This gives us two cases: $x-1 \geq 2$ or $x-1 \leq -2$. The solutions to these inequalities are $x \geq 3$ and $x \leq -1$, respectively. So, when $\vert x-1 \vert -2$ is nonnegative, we have two more solutions (one for $x \geq 3$ and one for $x \leq -1$).

So, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly four distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to the difference between the left and right sides of the equation at $x = 3$, $x = 0$, and $x = -1$.

At $x = 3$, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \vert \vert 3-1 \vert -2 \vert = \vert 2-2 \vert = 0$. So, $m = 0 \times 100 = 0$, but $m$ must be a positive integer, so $m = 0$ is not a valid solution.

At $x = 0$, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \vert \vert 0-1 \vert -2 \vert = \vert -1-2 \vert = 3$. So, $m = 3 \times 100 = 300$.

At $x = -1$, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \vert \vert -1-1 \vert -2 \vert = \vert -2-2 \vert = 4$. So, $m = 4 \times 100 = 400$.

So, the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions is $m = 300$ or $m = 400$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is 2. The answer is: 2
