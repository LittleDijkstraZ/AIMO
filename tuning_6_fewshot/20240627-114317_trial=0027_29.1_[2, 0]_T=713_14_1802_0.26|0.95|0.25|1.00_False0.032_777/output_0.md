Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, we need to find the x-coordinates of points A and B by setting the equation of the parabola equal to the equation of the line and solving for x.

2. Then, we use the distance formula to find the distances from A and B to the origin.

3. Finally, we square these distances and sum them up.

Now, let's implement this in Python using Sympy:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve, sqrt

def sum_of_squares_of_distances():
    # Define the symbols
    x, k, l = symbols('x k l')

    # Define the equations
    parabola = k*x**2 - 2*k*x + l
    line = 4

    # Solve for x
    solutions = solve(Eq(parabola, line), x)
    A, B = solutions[0], solutions[1]

    # Calculate the distances from A and B to the origin
    distance_A = sqrt(A**2 + 0**2)
    distance_B = sqrt(B**2 + 0**2)

    # Square the distances and sum them up
    sum_of_squares = distance_A**2 + distance_B**2

    return sum_of_squares

result = sum_of_squares_of_distances()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS (k - sqrt(k*(k - l + 4)))**2/k**2 + (k + sqrt(k*(k - l + 4)))**2/k**2

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
(k - sqrt(k*(k - l + 4)))**2/k**2 + (k + sqrt(k*(k - l + 4)))**2/k**2
```

The output is not what we expected. Let's try another approach.

1. We know that the distance between A and B is 6. So, we can write the equation $(B - A)^2 = 6^2$.

2. Substitute the x-coordinates of A and B into the equation of the parabola and simplify.

3. Solve the equation for l in terms of k.

4. Substitute the value of l back into the equation of the sum of squares of distances and simplify.

Let's implement this in Python using Sympy:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve, sqrt

def sum_of_squares_of_distances():
    # Define the symbols
    k = symbols('k')

    # Define the equation for the distance between A and B
    distance_equation = Eq((2*sqrt(k*(k - 4))**2), 6**2)

    # Solve for k
    k_value = solve(distance_equation, k)[1]  # We only want the positive solution

    # Substitute the value of k into the equation for l
    l_value = k_value - 4

    # Calculate the sum of squares of distances
    sum_of_squares = (k_value - sqrt(k_value*(k_value - l_value + 4)))**2/k_value**2 + (k_value + sqrt(k_value*(k_value - l_value + 4)))**2/k_value**2

    return sum_of_squares

result = sum_of_squares_of_distances()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS (-sqrt(16 + 8*sqrt(22)) + 2 + sqrt(22))**2/(2 + sqrt(22))**2 + (2 + sqrt(22) + sqrt(16 + 8*sqrt(22)))**2/(2 + sqrt(22))**2

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
(-sqrt(16 + 8*sqrt(22)) + 2 + sqrt(22))**2/(2 + sqrt(22))**2 + (2 + sqrt(22) + sqrt(16 + 8*sqrt(22)))**2/(2 + sqrt(22))**2
```

The output is still not what we expected. Let's try another approach.

2. Substitute the x-coordinates of A and B into the equation of the parabola and simplify.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"The smallest distance between the origin and a point on the parabola $y=x^2-5$ can be expressed as $\sqrt{a}/b$, where $a$ and $b$ are positive integers, and $a$ is not divisible by the square of any prime.  Find $a+b$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the distance formula, we are trying to minimize $\sqrt{x^2+y^2}=\sqrt{x^2+x^4-10x^2+25}$. In general minimization problems like this require calculus, but one elementary optimization method that sometimes works is completing the square.  We have $$\sqrt{x^2+x^4-10x^2+25}=\sqrt{(x^2-9/2)^2+(25-81/4)}.$$This expression is minimized when the square equals $0$, i.e. when $x=\pm 3/\sqrt{2}.$ For this value of $x$, the distance is $$\sqrt{25-\frac{81}{4}}=\frac{\sqrt{19}}{2}.$$Hence the desired answer is $\boxed{21}$. The answer is $\boxed{21}$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"The graph of $y=ax^2 + bx + c$ is a parabola with vertical axis of symmetry.  The vertex of this parabola is $(2,3)$ and the parabola contains the point $(4,4)$.  Find the value of $y$ when $x=6$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Because the parabola has vertex $(2,3)$, it is the graph of  \[y=a(x-2)^2+3\] for some number $a$.  In order for the graph to contain the point $(4,4)$, we must also have  \[4=a(4-2)^2+3=4a+3,\] so $a=\frac14$, and our parabola is the graph of \[y=\frac14(x-2)^2 + 3.\] Setting $x=6$ in this gives us  \[y = \frac14(6-2)^2 + 3 = 4+3=\boxed{7}.\] The answer is $\boxed{7}$
