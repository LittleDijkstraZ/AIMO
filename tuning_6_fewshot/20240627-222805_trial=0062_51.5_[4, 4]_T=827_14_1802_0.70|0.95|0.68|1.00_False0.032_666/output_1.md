**Problem:** 
"What is the minimum value of the expression $x^2+y^2-6x+4y+18$ for real $x$ and $y$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Rearranging the expression, we have  \[x^2-6x+y^2+4y+18\]Completing the square in $x$, we need to add and subtract $(6/2)^2=9$. Completing the square in $y$, we need to add and subtract $(4/2)^2=4$. Thus, we have \[(x^2-6x+9)-9+(y^2+4y+4)-4+18 \Rightarrow (x-3)^2+(y+2)^2+5\]Since the minimum value of $(x-3)^2$ and $(y+2)^2$ is $0$ (perfect squares can never be negative), the minimum value of the entire expression is $\boxed{5}$, and is achieved when $x=3$ and $y=-2$. The answer is $\boxed{5}$

**Problem**
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


To solve this problem, we need to use the fact that $|a| + |b| = |a+b|$ if and only if $ab \geq 0$. This gives us the inequality $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |x-2y| + |2y-x| = |-(x-2y)| + |2y-x| = |-1 \cdot (x-2y) + (2y-x)| = |(-1+1) \cdot (x-2y)| = 0 \cdot |x-2y| = 0$, which is a contradiction with the given condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. Therefore, the given condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ cannot hold for real $x$ and $y$.

This problem is a contradiction, so it is impossible to find real $x$ and $y$ that satisfy the given condition. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ cannot be determined for real $x$ and $y$ that satisfy the given condition.
The answer is: 
The problem is a contradiction, so it is impossible to find real $x$ and $y$ that satisfy the given condition. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ cannot be determined for real $x$ and $y$ that satisfy the given condition.
The answer cannot be determined for the given condition.
The answer is $\boxed{The answer cannot be determined for the given condition.}$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Find the minimum value of $2x^2 + 2y^2 + 5z^2 - 2xy - 4yz - 4x - 2z + 15$ over all real numbers $x,$ $y,$ $z.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
We can write the given expression as
\begin{align*}
&(x^2 - 4x + 4) + (x^2 - 2xy + y^2) + (y^2 - 4yz + 4z^2) + (z^2 - 2z + 1) + 10 \\
&= (x - 2)^2 + (x - y)^2 + (y - 2z)^2 + (z - 1)^2 + 10
\end{align*}The minimum value is then $\boxed{10},$ which occurs when $x = 2,$ $y = 2,$ and $z = 1.$ The answer is $\boxed{10}$

**Problem**
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



```python

from sympy import symbols, solve, simplify

def min_value():
    # Define the variables
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # Define the expression and the condition
    expression = 5*x**2 + 5*y**2 - 8*x*y
    condition = abs(x - 2*y) + abs(y - 2*x) - 40

    # Solve the condition for y in terms of x
    y_solution = solve(condition, y)[0]

    # Substitute y in the expression
    expression_subs = expression.subs(y, y_solution)

    # Differentiate the expression with respect to x

To solve this problem, we need to use the fact that $|a| + |b| = |a+b|$ if and only if $ab \geq 0$. This gives us the inequality $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |x-2y| + |2y-x| = |-(x-2y)| + |2y-x| = |-1 \cdot (x-2y) + (2y-x)| = |(-1+1) \cdot (x-2y)| = 0 \cdot |x-2y| = 0$, which is a contradiction with the given condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. Therefore, the given condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ cannot hold for real $x$ and $y$.
