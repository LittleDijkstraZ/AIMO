Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. In this problem, we are asked to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly $4$ distinct solutions. 

2. First, we need to realize that the right-hand side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, should be less than $2$ because the absolute value of a quantity cannot be negative and must be less than or equal to $2$ on the left-hand side. Thus, we have $0 \leq \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which gives $0 \leq m < 200$.

3. Now we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy this condition and make the equation have exactly $4$ distinct solutions. To do this, we can start by setting $\frac{m}{100} = k$ where $k$ is a non-negative integer less than $2$. This gives $m = 100k$.

4. Then we substitute $\frac{m}{100}$ back into the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, and it becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=k$.

5. The number of distinct solutions to this equation is $4$ when $k=1$.

6. Therefore, we need $m = 100 \cdot 1 = 100$. So, there is only one positive integer $m$ that makes the equation have exactly $4$ distinct solutions, and that is $100$.

The answer is: $1$

However, this doesn't seem right because we are asked to find the number of such $m$ and we found only one. We must have missed something.

Let's go back and look at the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=k$.

When $k=1$, the equation becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=1$.

This equation has $4$ distinct solutions when $0 \leq k < 2$.

So, the possible values of $m$ are those for which $0 \leq \frac{m}{100} < 2$. This gives $0 \leq m < 200$.

The positive integers $m$ in this range are $1, 2, ..., 199$.

But we need to find the number of these integers that make the equation have exactly $4$ distinct solutions.

As we found earlier, $m = 100$ makes it have $4$ distinct solutions when $k=1$.

But when $k=2$, the equation becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=2$, and this equation has $2$ distinct solutions.

So, the only value of $m$ that makes the equation have exactly $4$ distinct solutions is $m = 100$.

Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ that makes the equation have exactly $4$ distinct solutions.

So, the number of such $m$ is $1$. The answer is: $1$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many distinct solutions are there to the equation $|x-7| = |x+1|$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
If $|x-7| = |x+1|$, then either $x-7 = x+1$ or $x-7 = -(x+1)$.  Simplifying $x-7=x+1$ gives $0=8$, which has no solutions, so no values of $x$ satisfy $x-7 = x+1$.  If $x-7 = -(x+1)$, then $x-7 = -x-1$, so $2x = 6$, which gives $x=3$.  So, there is $\boxed{1}$ solution.

Challenge: See if you can find a quick solution to this problem by simply thinking about the graphs of $y=|x-7|$ and $y=|x+1|$. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


First, we know that the equation $|\vert x-1 \vert -2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions, which means that $\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal to $2$ because the function $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|$ will only be equal to $2$ four times.

Therefore, we can set $\frac{m}{100}$ equal to $2$ and solve for $m$:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

def find_m():
    m = symbols('m')
    equation = Eq(m / 100, 2)
    solution = solve(equation, m)

    return solution[0]

result = find_m()
print(result)
```

So the value of $m$ is $200$. The answer is: $\boxed{200}$.
