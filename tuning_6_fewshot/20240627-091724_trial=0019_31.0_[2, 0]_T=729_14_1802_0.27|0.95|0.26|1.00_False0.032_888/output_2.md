**Problem:** 
"How many distinct solutions are there to the equation $|x-7| = |x+1|$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
If $|x-7| = |x+1|$, then either $x-7 = x+1$ or $x-7 = -(x+1)$.  Simplifying $x-7=x+1$ gives $0=8$, which has no solutions, so no values of $x$ satisfy $x-7 = x+1$.  If $x-7 = -(x+1)$, then $x-7 = -x-1$, so $2x = 6$, which gives $x=3$.  So, there is $\boxed{1}$ solution.

Challenge: See if you can find a quick solution to this problem by simply thinking about the graphs of $y=|x-7|$ and $y=|x+1|$. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



To solve this problem, we need to find the value of $m$ for which the equation $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

First, let's consider the equation $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$. The right-hand side of this equation is always non-negative, so the left-hand side must also be non-negative. This means that $|x-1| - 2 \geq 0$, or $|x-1| \geq 2$. The absolute value inequality $|x-1| \geq 2$ can be split into two cases:

1. $x-1 \geq 2$, which gives $x \geq 3$.
2. $x-1 \leq -2$, which gives $x \leq -1$.

So, the solutions to the equation must lie in the intervals $(-\infty, -1]$ or $[3, \infty)$.

Now, let's consider the equation $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$. This equation has 4 distinct solutions if and only if the equation $|x-1| - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$ has 2 distinct solutions in each of the intervals $(-\infty, -1]$ and $[3, \infty)$.

The equation $|x-1| - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$ can be rewritten as $|x-1| = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. This equation has 2 distinct solutions if and only if the distance between the left-hand side and the right-hand side is equal to $\frac{m}{100}$.

In the interval $(-\infty, -1]$, the distance between $|x-1|$ and $2 + \frac{m}{100}$ is $3 - \frac{m}{100}$. In the interval $[3, \infty)$, the distance is $\frac{m}{100} - 1$.

For the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, we need these distances to be equal, so we must have $3 - \frac{m}{100} = \frac{m}{100} - 1$. Solving this equation gives $m = 150$.

Therefore, the value of $m$ for which the equation $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is $m = 150$. The answer is: $150$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 1 and 2. This is because the expression on the left side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, can take on any value from 0 to 3, and it is equal to $\frac{m}{100}$ exactly when it takes on these 4 distinct values.

So we want to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. This is equivalent to $100 < m < 200$. The number of positive integers in this range is $200 - 100 - 1 = 99$.

So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 99. The answer is: $99$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many integers are solutions to the equation $$(x-2)^{(25-x^2)}=1?$$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
We need some basic facts from number theory: $a^0 = 1$ for any $a,$ $1^b = 1$ for any $b,$ and $(-1)^c = 1$ if $c$ is an even integer. Unless the base is a complex number (which is excluded since we are looking for integer solutions), there are no other ways to get an RHS of $1.$ Thus, either the exponent is zero $($giving the equation $25 - x^2 = 0),$ the base is $1$ $($giving $x -2 = 1),$ or the base is $-1$ and the exponent is even $($giving the simultaneous equations $x - 2 = -1$ and $25 - x^2 = 2n$ for some integer $n).$ Solving the first equation gives $x = \pm 5,$ and solving the second gives $x = 3.$ The third equation implies that $x = 1,$ in which case $25 - x^2 = 24$ is indeed even, so $x = 1$ is a valid solution. In all, there are $\boxed{4}$ integer solutions. The answer is $\boxed{4}$

The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $100$. However, we are asked to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has exactly $4$ distinct solutions. This means we need to exclude the cases where the number of solutions is less than $4$. After analyzing the solutions, we find that the equation has exactly $4$ distinct solutions for $m = 1$ to $100$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has exactly $4$ distinct solutions is $100$. The answer is $\boxed{100}$.
