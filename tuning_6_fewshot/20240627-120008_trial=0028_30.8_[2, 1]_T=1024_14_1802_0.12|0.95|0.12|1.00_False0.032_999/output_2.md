**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let \[f(x) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
-x + 3 & \text{if } x \le 0, \\
2x - 5 & \text{if } x > 0.
\end{array}
\right.\]How many solutions does the equation $f(f(x)) = 4$ have?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
To solve the equation $f(f(x)) = 4,$ we first find the values $x$ such that $f(x) = 4.$

Either $f(x) = -x + 3$ (for $x \le 0$) or $f(x) = 2x - 5$ (for $x > 0$). If $-x + 3 = 4,$ then $x = -1.$ Note that this value satisfies $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = 4,$ then $x = 9/2.$ Note that this value satisfies $x > 0.$ Therefore, the solutions to $f(x) = 4$ are $x = -1$ and $x = 9/2.$

Next, we solve for the values $x$ such that $f(x) = -1.$ If $-x + 3 = -1,$ then $x = 4.$ This value does not satisfy $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = -1,$ then $x = 2.$ This value satisfies $x > 0.$

Finally, we solve for the values $x$ such that $f(x) = 9/2.$ If $-x + 3 = 9/2,$ then $x = -3/2.$ This value satisfies $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = 9/2,$ then $x = 19/4.$ This value satisfies $x > 0.$

Therefore, the equation $f(f(x)) = 4$ has the solutions $x = 2,$ $-3/2,$ and $19/4,$ for a total of $\boxed{3}$ solutions. The answer is $\boxed{3}$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We need to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

2. First, let's simplify the equation. The right side of the equation is always positive, so the absolute value of the left side must be equal to a positive number. This means that $\frac{m}{100}$ must be positive, so $m$ must be positive.

3. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to 2. This is because the graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a shape of a "V" with the vertex at $\frac{m}{100}=2$, and it has 4 distinct solutions when the vertex is at $\frac{m}{100}=2$.

4. To find the value of $m$, we can multiply both sides of the equation $\frac{m}{100}=2$ by 100 to get $m=200$.

5. So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 1, and the value of $m$ is 200.

The answer is: $1$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, we need to understand that the equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. This means that the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be equal to 2. This is because the absolute value function $|x|$ has two solutions, $x$ and $-x$. So, $| |x-1|-2|=2$ has 4 distinct solutions.

2. Therefore, we have $\frac{m}{100}=2$, which gives $m=200$.

So, the positive integer $m$ that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions is 200. The answer is: $200$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, we need to understand that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.
2. We know that the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, can be either positive or negative. So we have two cases to consider:
   a. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$
   b. $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = \frac{m}{100}$
3. For each case, we can solve the equation for $x$.
4. After solving the equations, we find that the number of solutions depends on the value of $\frac{m}{100}$.
5. We need to find the value of $m$ such that the equation has 4 distinct solutions.

Now, let's use Python to find the value of $m$.

```python

    # Case 1: |x - 1| - 2 = m/100

    solutions1 = solve(equation1, x)

    # Case 2: -|x - 1| + 2 = m/100
    equation2 = -abs(x - 1) + 2 - m/100
    solutions2 = solve(equation2, x)

    # Combine the solutions from both cases
    solutions = solutions1 + solutions2

    # Count the number of distinct solutions

    return num_solutions

m_value = 0
while True:
    num_solutions = find_m()
    if num_solutions == 4:
        m_value = m

The value of $m$ that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions is 0. However, this doesn't make sense in the context of the problem. Let's try a different approach.

We know that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. This means that the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, must be equal to $\frac{m}{100}$ and $-\frac{m}{100}$ four times each.

Let's analyze the cases:

1. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, then $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two sub-cases:
   a. $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.
   b. $x-1 = -(2 + \frac{m}{100})$, which simplifies to $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.
2. If $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = \frac{m}{100}$, then $-\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two sub-cases:
   a. $-x+1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.
   b. $-x+1 = -(2 - \frac{m}{100})$, which simplifies to $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.

From the analysis above, we can see that the solutions for both cases are the same: $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Now, we need to find the value of $m$ such that these solutions give us 4 distinct solutions. This means that the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, must be equal to $\frac{m}{100}$ and $-\frac{m}{100}$ four times each.

Let's substitute the solutions into the expression:

1. For $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$: $\vert -1 + \frac{m}{100} - 1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\vert -\frac{2}{100} + \frac{m}{100} \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$.
2. For $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$: $\vert 3 + \frac{m}{100} - 1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\vert \frac{2}{100} + \frac{m}{100} \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$.

Both expressions are equal to $\frac{m}{100}$. This means that the value of $m$ that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions is 200.

So, the value of $m$ that makes the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have 4 distinct solutions is 200.

The answer is: $200$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let \[f(x) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
-x + 3 & \text{if } x \le 0, \\
2x - 5 & \text{if } x > 0.
\end{array}
\right.\]How many solutions does the equation $f(f(x)) = 4$ have?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
To solve the equation $f(f(x)) = 4,$ we first find the values $x$ such that $f(x) = 4.$

Either $f(x) = -x + 3$ (for $x \le 0$) or $f(x) = 2x - 5$ (for $x > 0$). If $-x + 3 = 4,$ then $x = -1.$ Note that this value satisfies $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = 4,$ then $x = 9/2.$ Note that this value satisfies $x > 0.$ Therefore, the solutions to $f(x) = 4$ are $x = -1$ and $x = 9/2.$

Next, we solve for the values $x$ such that $f(x) = -1.$ If $-x + 3 = -1,$ then $x = 4.$ This value does not satisfy $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = -1,$ then $x = 2.$ This value satisfies $x > 0.$

Finally, we solve for the values $x$ such that $f(x) = 9/2.$ If $-x + 3 = 9/2,$ then $x = -3/2.$ This value satisfies $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = 9/2,$ then $x = 19/4.$ This value satisfies $x > 0.$

Therefore, the equation $f(f(x)) = 4$ has the solutions $x = 2,$ $-3/2,$ and $19/4,$ for a total of $\boxed{3}$ solutions. The answer is $\boxed{3}$
