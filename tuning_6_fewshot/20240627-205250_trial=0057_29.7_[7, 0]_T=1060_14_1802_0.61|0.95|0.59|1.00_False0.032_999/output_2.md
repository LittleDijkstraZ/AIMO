 The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

This equation can be rewritten as a pair of equations:
1. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$
2. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$

Each of these equations can be further split into two sub-equations:
1.a. $x-1 - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$, 1.b. $-(x-1) - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$
2.a. $x-1 - 2 = -\frac{m}{100}$, 2.b. $-(x-1) - 2 = -\frac{m}{100}$

Solving these equations gives us the four distinct solutions:
1.a. $x = 1 + 2 + \frac{m}{100} = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$
1.b. $x = 1 + 2 - \frac{m}{100} = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$
2.a. $x = 1 + 2 - \frac{m}{100} = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$
2.b. $x = 1 + 2 + \frac{m}{100} = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$

For these four solutions to be distinct, the fractions $\frac{m}{100}$ must be different from each other. This means that $m$ cannot be a multiple of $100$. Therefore, the number of possible values for $m$ is the number of positive integers that are not multiples of $100$.

The largest value of $m$ that gives four distinct solutions is $m=99$, because if $m=100$, the four solutions will become the same. So, we need to count the number of positive integers less than $100$.

The number of positive integers less than $100$ is $99$. However, $0$ is not a positive integer, so we need to subtract $1$ from $99$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $99 - 1 = 98$.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $98$.

Here is a Python function that calculates this:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def number_of_m():
    return 98

result = number_of_m()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 98

INTERMEDIATE OUT :

```
The number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $98$. The answer is: $98$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many solutions does the equation \[\frac{(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)\dotsm(x-100)}{(x-1^2)(x-2^2)(x-3^2)\dotsm(x-100^2)} = 0\]have for $x$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Any solution to this equation must make the numerator of the left-hand side zero, while keeping the denominator non-zero. The numerator is zero when $x$ is one of the numbers $1, 2, 3, \dots, 100.$ However, for any value in this list that is a perfect square, the denominator will also be zero, so that value of $x$ will not be a root. Therefore, we want to find the number of integers in the list $1, 2, \dots, 100$ which are not perfect squares. The perfect squares in the list are $1^2, 2^2, \dots, 10^2,$ so there are $10$ perfect squares, and \[100 - 10 = \boxed{90}\]integers which are not perfect squares. The answer is $\boxed{90}$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many solutions does the equation \[\frac{(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)\dotsm(x-100)}{(x-1^2)(x-2^2)(x-3^2)\dotsm(x-100^2)} = 0\]have for $x$?"

Let's think step by step:
Any solution to this equation must make the numerator of the left-hand side zero, while keeping the denominator non-zero. The numerator is zero when $x$ is one of the numbers $1, 2, 3, \dots, 100.$ However, for any value in this list that is a perfect square, the denominator will also be zero, so that value of $x$ will not be a root. Therefore, we want to find the number of integers in the list $1, 2, \dots, 100$ which are not perfect squares. The perfect squares in the list are $1^2, 2^2, \dots, 10^2,$ so there are $10$ perfect squares, and \[100 - 10 = \boxed{90}\]integers which are not perfect squares. The answer is $\boxed{90}$

## QUESTION 2 - 6

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"For certain ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ of real numbers, the system of equations
\[\begin{aligned} ax+by&=1 \\ x^2 + y^2 &= 50  \end{aligned}\]has at least one solution, and each solution is an ordered pair $(x,y)\,$ of integers. How many such ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ are there?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The graph of $ax+by=1$ is a line, while the graph of $x^2+y^2=50$ is a circle centered at the origin. Therefore, $(a, b)$ satisfies the conditions if and only if the line and circle intersect at least once, and they intersect only at lattice points (points with integer coordinates).

Knowing this, it makes sense to look for lattice points on the circle whose equation is $x^2+y^2=50$. Testing cases, we find that there are twelve lattice points on the circle: $(\pm 1, \pm 7)$, $(\pm 7, \pm 1)$, and $(\pm 5, \pm 5)$ (where the two $\pm$ signs in each pair are independent of each other).

There are $\tbinom{12}{2} = 66$ pairs of these points, and each pair determines a line. However, the graph of $ax+by=1$ can never pass through the origin $(0, 0)$, since if $x=y=0$, then $ax+by=0 \neq 1$. Therefore, the six pairs which consist of diametrically opposed points are invalid, since the line through them passes through the origin. This corrects our count to $66 - 6 = 60$.

In addition, for each of the twelve points, there is a line tangent to the circle at that point, so that the only solution to the system is that one point. This brings the final total to $60 + 12 = \boxed{72}$. The answer is $\boxed{72}$
