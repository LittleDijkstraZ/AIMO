Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, we need to understand that the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. This means that the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be equal to 2. So we have $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, which gives $m = 200$.

2. Now we need to check if this value of $m$ indeed gives 4 distinct solutions. Substituting $m = 200$ into the equation, we get $| |x - 1| - 2| = 2$.

3. Solving this equation, we get two cases: $|x - 1| - 2 = 2$ and $|x - 1| - 2 = -2$.

4. For the first case, $|x - 1| - 2 = 2$ gives $|x - 1| = 4$, which gives two equations $x - 1 = 4$ and $x - 1 = -4$. Solving these, we get $x = 5$ and $x = -3$.

5. For the second case, $|x - 1| - 2 = -2$ gives $|x - 1| = 0$, which gives the equation $x - 1 = 0$, and the solution $x = 1$.

6. So the 4 distinct solutions are $x = -3, 1, 5$.

Therefore, the value of $m$ that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions is $m = 200$. The answer is: $200$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"For certain ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ of real numbers, the system of equations
\[\begin{aligned} ax+by&=1 \\ x^2 + y^2 &= 50  \end{aligned}\]has at least one solution, and each solution is an ordered pair $(x,y)\,$ of integers. How many such ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ are there?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The graph of $ax+by=1$ is a line, while the graph of $x^2+y^2=50$ is a circle centered at the origin. Therefore, $(a, b)$ satisfies the conditions if and only if the line and circle intersect at least once, and they intersect only at lattice points (points with integer coordinates).

Knowing this, it makes sense to look for lattice points on the circle whose equation is $x^2+y^2=50$. Testing cases, we find that there are twelve lattice points on the circle: $(\pm 1, \pm 7)$, $(\pm 7, \pm 1)$, and $(\pm 5, \pm 5)$ (where the two $\pm$ signs in each pair are independent of each other).

There are $\tbinom{12}{2} = 66$ pairs of these points, and each pair determines a line. However, the graph of $ax+by=1$ can never pass through the origin $(0, 0)$, since if $x=y=0$, then $ax+by=0 \neq 1$. Therefore, the six pairs which consist of diametrically opposed points are invalid, since the line through them passes through the origin. This corrects our count to $66 - 6 = 60$.

In addition, for each of the twelve points, there is a line tangent to the circle at that point, so that the only solution to the system is that one point. This brings the final total to $60 + 12 = \boxed{72}$. The answer is $\boxed{72}$

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 1 and 2. This is because the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a graph that is a "V" shape with its peak at $y=1$, and it takes on all values between 0 and 2 exactly once. Therefore, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be strictly between 1 and 2. This gives us the inequality $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which simplifies to $100 < m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are precisely the integers from 101 to 199, inclusive. Therefore, there are $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$ such integers $m$. The answer is: 99

Assistant:

 To solve this problem, we need to analyze the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ and find for how many positive integers $m$ it has $4$ distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be rewritten as two separate cases:

Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$
Case 2: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$

For each of these cases, we can further break them down into two sub-cases:

Case 1a: $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$
Case 1b: $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$
Case 2a: $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$
Case 2b: $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$

For each of these sub-cases, we need to solve the absolute value equations and find the number of distinct solutions.

After analyzing the number of distinct solutions for each $m$, we find that the equation has $4$ distinct solutions when $m=200$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $1$. The answer is: $1$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many distinct solutions are there to the equation $|x-7| = |x+1|$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
If $|x-7| = |x+1|$, then either $x-7 = x+1$ or $x-7 = -(x+1)$.  Simplifying $x-7=x+1$ gives $0=8$, which has no solutions, so no values of $x$ satisfy $x-7 = x+1$.  If $x-7 = -(x+1)$, then $x-7 = -x-1$, so $2x = 6$, which gives $x=3$.  So, there is $\boxed{1}$ solution.

Challenge: See if you can find a quick solution to this problem by simply thinking about the graphs of $y=|x-7|$ and $y=|x+1|$. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many solutions does the equation \[\frac{(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)\dotsm(x-100)}{(x-1^2)(x-2^2)(x-3^2)\dotsm(x-100^2)} = 0\]have for $x$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Any solution to this equation must make the numerator of the left-hand side zero, while keeping the denominator non-zero. The numerator is zero when $x$ is one of the numbers $1, 2, 3, \dots, 100.$ However, for any value in this list that is a perfect square, the denominator will also be zero, so that value of $x$ will not be a root. Therefore, we want to find the number of integers in the list $1, 2, \dots, 100$ which are not perfect squares. The perfect squares in the list are $1^2, 2^2, \dots, 10^2,$ so there are $10$ perfect squares, and \[100 - 10 = \boxed{90}\]integers which are not perfect squares. The answer is $\boxed{90}$

**Solution:** 


The number of distinct solutions to the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $4$ if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 1$. This is because the expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ takes on the value of $1$ exactly $4$ times. Therefore, we need to solve the equation $\frac{m}{100} = 1$ for $m$. Multiplying both sides by $100$ gives $m = 100$. So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $1$. The answer is $\boxed{1}$.

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

Let's break down the problem:

1. We know that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. This means that the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, must be equal to $\frac{m}{100}$, $-\frac{m}{100}$, $\frac{m}{100}$ or $-\frac{m}{100}$.

2. Let's consider the case where $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$. This implies $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. This equation will have 2 solutions if $2 + \frac{m}{100} > 0$, i.e., $m > -200$.

3. Similarly, for the case where $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. This equation will have 2 solutions if $2 - \frac{m}{100} > 0$, i.e., $m < 200$.

4. Combining these two conditions, we find that $m$ must be an integer in the range $(-200, 200)$.

5. Now, we need to count the number of positive integers in this range. The number of positive integers in the range $(-200, 200)$ is $200 - 1 = 199$.

6. However, we need to subtract the cases where $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$ have no solutions. This happens when $2 + \frac{m}{100} < 0$ or $2 - \frac{m}{100} < 0$. The first case gives $m > 200$, and the second case gives $m < -200$. But $m$ must be positive, so we only need to consider the second case. This gives $m < -200$, but there are no positive integers in this range.

7. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 199.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def count_positive_integers():
