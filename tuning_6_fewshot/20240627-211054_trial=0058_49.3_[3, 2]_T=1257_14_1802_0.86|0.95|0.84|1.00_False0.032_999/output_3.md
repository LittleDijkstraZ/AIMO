Assistant:

 The problem statement mentions that the points $(x, y)$ satisfying the equation enclose a convex polygon. This polygon is actually a square with side length 16 units. 

The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side. So, the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$ square units.

The answer is: $\boxed{256}$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Find the number of 10-tuples $(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{10})$ of real numbers such that
\[(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2 = \frac{1}{11}.\]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,
\begin{align*}
&[(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + \dots + 1^2 + 1^2)][(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2] \\
&\ge [(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + (x_2 - x_3) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10}]^2 = 1.
\end{align*}From the given condition, we have equality, so by the equality condition for Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[\frac{1 - x_1}{1} = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{1} = \frac{x_2 - x_3}{1} = \dots = \frac{x_9 - x_{10}}{1} = \frac{x_{10}}{1}.\]Let
\[d = 1 - x_1 = x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_3 = \dots = x_9 - x_{10} = x_{10}.\]Then
\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so
\[(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_{10}) = \left( \frac{10}{11}, \frac{9}{11}, \frac{8}{11}, \dots, \frac{1}{11} \right).\]In particular, there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. This equation is satisfied if either of the two factors is zero. This translates to one of the following conditions:

1. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$
2. $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$

Let's analyze each condition:

For condition 1:
$\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, so $x + y = \pm 10$.
Similarly, $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$ implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, so $x - y = \pm 10$.

For condition 2:
$\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ implies $\vert x \vert = 8$, so $x = \pm 8$.
Similarly, $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$ implies $\vert y \vert = 8$, so $y = \pm 8$.

The solutions to these equations are as follows:

For condition 1, we have the four lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.
For condition 2, we have the four lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersection points of these lines are:

$(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(2, 8)$, $(2, -8)$, $(-2, 8)$, $(-2, -8)$.

These points form a square with side length $16$. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

The answer is: $256$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_ 2= (-16,2).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that
\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as
\[\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1.\]Find $h + k + a + b.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step.

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


The given equation is of the form $A \cdot B = 0$, where $A = ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$ and $B = ((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. This means that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$.

If $A = 0$, then $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This is only possible when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solution to these two equations is a square with side length $20$ centered at the origin.

If $B = 0$, then $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This is only possible when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solution to these two equations is a square with side length $16$ centered at the origin.

The intersection of these two squares forms a smaller square with side length $20 - 16 = 4$ centered at the origin. The area of this square is $4^2 = 16$.

However, the problem asks for the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points that satisfy the given equation. Since the origin is not included in the solution set, we must remove the area of the smaller square centered at the origin from the total area of the larger square.

The area of the larger square is $20^2 = 400$, and the area of the smaller square is $4^2 = 16$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $400 - 16 = 384$.

The answer is: $\boxed{384}$.

Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Let $w$ be the width of each of the identical rectangles. Since $PQ=3w$, $RS=2x$ and $PQ=RS$ (because $PQRS$ is a rectangle), then $2x = 3w$, or $$w=\frac{2}{3}x.$$ Therefore, the area of each of the five identical rectangles is $$x\left(\frac{2}{3}x\right)=\frac{2}{3}x^2.$$ Since the area of $PQRS$ is 4000 and it is made up of five of these identical smaller rectangles, then $$5\left(\frac{2}{3}x^2\right)=4000$$ or $$\frac{10}{3}x^2 = 4000$$ or $x^2 = 1200$ or $x \approx 34.6$ which, when rounded off to the nearest integer, is $\boxed{35}.$ The answer is $\boxed{35}$

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


The given equation is $0 = 0$, so we don't have to do anything special to solve it. The points that satisfy this equation are the points that satisfy either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The first two equations are satisfied when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which represent two pairs of parallel lines. The last two equations are satisfied when $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$, which represent two pairs of parallel lines.
The four lines form a rectangle, and the distance between the parallel lines in each pair is 10, and the sides of the rectangle are 16, so the area of the rectangle is $16 \times 16 = 256$. The answer is $\boxed{256}$.

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


The area of the convex polygon can be found by counting the number of lattice points (points with integer coordinates) inside the polygon and using Pick's theorem. Pick's theorem states that the area of a polygon with vertices on a grid of equal-distance points can be found by counting the number of interior points (I) and the number of boundary points (B), and then using the formula: Area = I + (B/2) - 1.

First, we need to find the vertices of the polygon. The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if and only if at least one of the factors is zero. So we have four cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) \neq 0$. This gives us the lines $x + y = \pm 10$.

2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) \neq 0$. This gives us the lines $x - y = \pm 10$.

3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) \neq 0$. This gives us the lines $x = \pm 8$.

4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) \neq 0$. This gives us the lines $y = \pm 8$.

The intersection points of these lines form a square with side length 16. The vertices of the square are $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

Now we need to count the number of lattice points inside the square and on its boundary. The lattice points are the points with integer coordinates. By observing the square, we can see that there are 25 lattice points inside the square (including the vertices) and 16 lattice points on the boundary.

Applying Pick's theorem, the area of the square is I + (B/2) - 1 = 25 + (16/2) - 1 = 25 + 8 - 1 = 32. So the area of the convex polygon is 32 square units.

The answer is: $\boxed{32}$.
