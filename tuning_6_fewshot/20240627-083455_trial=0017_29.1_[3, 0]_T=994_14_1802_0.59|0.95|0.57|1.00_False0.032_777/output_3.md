**Problem:** 
"Five identical rectangles are arranged to form a larger rectangle $PQRS$, as shown.  The area of $PQRS$ is $4000$.  What is the length, $x$, rounded off to the nearest integer? [asy]
real x = 1; real w = 2/3;

// Draw outer square and labels
pair s = (0, 0); pair r = (2 * x, 0); pair q = (3 * w, x + w); pair p = (0, x + w);
draw(s--r--q--p--cycle);
label("$S$", s, SW); label("$R$", r, SE); label("$Q$", q, NE); label("$P$", p, NW);

// Draw other segments
draw((x, 0)--(x, w));
draw((0, w)--(2 * x, w));
draw((w, x + w)--(w, w)); draw((2 * w, x + w)--(2 * w, w));

// length labels
pair upper = (-0.1, x + w);
pair lower = (-0.1, w);
draw(lower--upper);
draw((-0.1 - 0.03, x + w)--(-0.1 + 0.03, x + w));
draw((-0.1 - 0.03, w)--(-0.1 + 0.03, w));
label("$x$", midpoint((-0.1, w)--(-0.1, x + w)), W);

pair left = (0, -0.1); pair right = (x, -0.1);
draw((0, -0.1 + 0.03)--(0, -0.1 - 0.03));
draw((x, -0.1 - 0.03)--(x, -0.1 + 0.03));
draw(left--right);
label("$x$", (x/2, -0.1), S);

[/asy]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Let $w$ be the width of each of the identical rectangles. Since $PQ=3w$, $RS=2x$ and $PQ=RS$ (because $PQRS$ is a rectangle), then $2x = 3w$, or $$w=\frac{2}{3}x.$$ Therefore, the area of each of the five identical rectangles is $$x\left(\frac{2}{3}x\right)=\frac{2}{3}x^2.$$ Since the area of $PQRS$ is 4000 and it is made up of five of these identical smaller rectangles, then $$5\left(\frac{2}{3}x^2\right)=4000$$ or $$\frac{10}{3}x^2 = 4000$$ or $x^2 = 1200$ or $x \approx 34.6$ which, when rounded off to the nearest integer, is $\boxed{35}.$ The answer is $\boxed{35}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


This problem requires a mathematical analysis and is not suitable for direct computation using Python or other programming languages. However, the equation given is of the form $f(x, y) = 0$, and the points that satisfy this equation form a polygon. The area of this polygon can be found by analyzing the conditions under which the equation is satisfied.

The equation is satisfied when either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.

From $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.

From $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert x \vert = 8$, which implies $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.

From $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

By analyzing these conditions, we can see that the points satisfying the equation form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So, the area of the convex polygon is 256.
The answer is: $256$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_ 2= (-16,2).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that
\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as
\[\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1.\]Find $h + k + a + b.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

**Solution:**


This problem is a bit tricky. The equation involves absolute values, which make it look a bit complicated. However, we can simplify it by considering the cases when the absolute values are equal to zero. This happens when the expressions inside the absolute values are equal to zero. So we have four cases to consider:

1. $x + y = 0$, $x - y = 0$, $x = 8$, and $y = 8$.
2. $x + y = 0$, $x - y = 0$, $x = -8$, and $y = -8$.
3. $x + y = 10$, $x - y = 10$, $x = 8$, and $y = 8$.
4. $x + y = 10$, $x - y = 10$, $x = -8$, and $y = -8$.

The solutions to these systems of equations are:

1. $x = 0$, $y = 0$.
2. $x = 0$, $y = 0$.
3. $x = 8$, $y = 8$.
4. $x = -8$, $y = -8$.

These four points are the vertices of a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So the area of the convex polygon is 256.

```python

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



First, we need to understand the given equation and what it represents. The equation is a product of two terms set equal to zero. Therefore, either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. This gives us two separate conditions to consider.

For the first term to be zero, we have two absolute value expressions inside. The absolute value of a number is always nonnegative, so for the absolute value to be zero, the expression inside must be zero. This gives us two equations:
1. $x + y - 10 = 0$
2. $x - y - 10 = 0$

Solving these two equations, we get:
1. $y = 10 - x$
2. $y = x - 10$

For the second term to be zero, we again have two absolute value expressions inside. This gives us two more equations:
1. $x - 8 = 0$
2. $y - 8 = 0$

Solving these two equations, we get:
1. $x = 8$
2. $y = 8$

Now we plot these points on a graph and connect them to form the polygon. The points are:
1. $(0, 10)$ from $y = 10 - x$ when $x = 0$
2. $(10, 0)$ from $y = x - 10$ when $x = 10$
3. $(10, 0)$ from $y = x - 10$ when $x = 10$
4. $(0, -10)$ from $y = 10 - x$ when $x = 0$, but we only consider the positive part of the y-axis so this point is not relevant
5. $(8, 0)$ from $x = 8$ when $y = 0$
6. $(0, 8)$ from $y = 8$ when $x = 0$

Connecting these points, we get a rectangle with side lengths 10 and 8. The area of a rectangle is given by the product of its side lengths, so the area of the polygon is $10 \times 8 = 80$.

The answer is: $80$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

**Solution:**


The equation given in the problem is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

The first term being zero implies that either $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x-y| - 10 = 0$, which simplifies to $|x+y| = 10$ or $|x-y| = 10$. These are the equations of two lines passing through the origin making an angle of 45 degrees with the x and y axes respectively.

The second term being zero implies that either $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$, which simplifies to $|x| = 8$ or $|y| = 8$. These are the equations of two lines parallel to the y and x axes respectively, at a distance of 8 units from the origin.

The intersection of these lines form a square with side length 16 units. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon formed by the points satisfying the given equation is 256 square units.

Here is a Python code snippet to calculate the area:
```python

The area of the convex polygon is $256$ square units. The answer is $\boxed{256}$.
