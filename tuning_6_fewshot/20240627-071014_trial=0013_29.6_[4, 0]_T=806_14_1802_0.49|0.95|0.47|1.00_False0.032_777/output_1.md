**Problem:** 
"Find the minimum value of $2x^2 + 2y^2 + 5z^2 - 2xy - 4yz - 4x - 2z + 15$ over all real numbers $x,$ $y,$ $z.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
We can write the given expression as
\begin{align*}
&(x^2 - 4x + 4) + (x^2 - 2xy + y^2) + (y^2 - 4yz + 4z^2) + (z^2 - 2z + 1) + 10 \\
&= (x - 2)^2 + (x - y)^2 + (y - 2z)^2 + (z - 1)^2 + 10
\end{align*}The minimum value is then $\boxed{10},$ which occurs when $x = 2,$ $y = 2,$ and $z = 1.$ The answer is $\boxed{10}$

**Problem:** 
"What is the minimum value of the expression $x^2+y^2+2x-4y+8$ for real $x$ and $y$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Rearranging the expression, we have  \[x^2+2x+y^2-4y+8\]Completing the square in $x$, we need to add and subtract $(2/2)^2=1$. Completing the square in $y$, we need to add and subtract $(4/2)^2=4$. Thus, we have \[(x^2+2x+1)-1+(y^2-4y+4)-4+8 \Rightarrow (x+1)^2+(y-2)^2+3\]Since the minimum value of $(x+1)^2$ and $(y-2)^2$ is $0$ (perfect squares can never be negative), the minimum value of the entire expression is $\boxed{3}$, and is achieved when $x=-1$ and $y=2$. The answer is $\boxed{3}$

**Problem**
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


This problem involves a bit of algebra and some clever manipulations. Let's start by simplifying the given equation:

\[|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40.\]

We can rewrite this as:

\[|x-2y| = 40 - |y-2x|.\]

Now, let's square both sides:

\[|x-2y|^2 = (40 - |y-2x|)^2.\]

Expanding the left side and simplifying the right side gives:

\[(x-2y)^2 = 1600 - 80|y-2x| + (y-2x)^2.\]

Expanding the left side and simplifying gives:

\[x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2 = 1600 - 80|y-2x| + y^2 - 4xy + 4x^2.\]

Combining like terms gives:

\[5x^2 + 5y^2 = 1600 + 80|y-2x|.\]

Now, let's look at the expression we want to minimize:

\[5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy.\]

We can rewrite this as:

\[5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 4(2x)(y) = 5(x^2 + y^2 - \frac{4}{5}(2x)(y)).\]

Now, let's use the identity $(a-b)^2 \geq 0$, where $a = x$ and $b = \frac{2}{5}y$. This gives:

\[(x - \frac{2}{5}y)^2 \geq 0.\]

Expanding and simplifying gives:

\[x^2 - \frac{4}{5}xy + \frac{4}{25}y^2 \geq 0.\]

Multiplying through by 5 gives:

\[5x^2 - 4xy + \frac{4}{5}y^2 \geq 0.\]

Adding $5y^2$ to both sides gives:

\[5x^2 + 5y^2 - 4xy \geq 5y^2.\]

So, we have:

\[5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy \geq 5y^2.\]

Now, we know from the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ that $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = 1600 + 80|y-2x| - 5y^2$.

Combining this with our inequality gives:

\[1600 + 80|y-2x| - 5y^2 \geq 5y^2.\]

Simplifying gives:

\[1600 + 80|y-2x| \geq 10y^2.\]

Dividing through by 10 gives:

\[160 + 8|y-2x| \geq y^2.\]

Since $|y-2x|$ is nonnegative, the minimum value of $y^2$ is achieved when $|y-2x| = 0$, which means $y = 2x$. Substituting this into the inequality gives:

\[160 + 8(0) \geq y^2 \Rightarrow 160 \geq y^2.\]

So, the minimum value of $y^2$ is 160.

Substituting $y = 2x$ into the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ gives:

\[|x-4x| + |2x-4x| = 40 \Rightarrow |-3x| + |-2x| = 40 \Rightarrow 3x + 2x = 40 \Rightarrow 5x = 40 \Rightarrow x = 8.\]

So, $y = 2x = 16$.

Substituting $x = 8$ and $y = 16$ into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ gives:

\[5(8)^2 + 5(16)^2 - 8(8)(16) = 5(64) + 5(256) - 8(128) = 320 + 1280 - 1024 = 676.\]

So, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is 676. The answer is: $676$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"If $x + 2y= 4$ and $xy = -8$, what is the value of $x^2 + 4y^2$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
We see that $(x + 2y)^2 = (x^2 + 4y^2) + 4xy = 4^2 = 16$. We want to find $x^2 + 4y^2$ and are given $xy = -8$. So, $x^2 + 4y^2 + 4xy = x^2 + 4y^2 + 4(-8) = 16$. It follows that $x^2 + 4y^2 = \boxed{48}$. The answer is $\boxed{48}$

**Problem**
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


To solve this problem, we can use the fact that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ implies $x-2y$ and $y-2x$ have the same absolute value. This means either $x-2y = y-2x$ or $x-2y = -(y-2x)$. Solving these two equations, we get $x = 2y$ or $x = \frac{y}{2}$.
Now we can substitute these two cases into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
1. If $x = 2y$, then $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(2y)^2 + 5y^2 - 8(2y)y = 20y^2 + 5y^2 - 16y^2 = 9y^2$.
2. If $x = \frac{y}{2}$, then $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(\frac{y}{2})^2 + 5y^2 - 8(\frac{y}{2})y = \frac{5y^2}{4} + 5y^2 - 4y^2 = \frac{15y^2}{4}$.
Now we need to find the minimum value of these two expressions. Since $y^2$ is always nonnegative, the minimum value of $9y^2$ and $\frac{15y^2}{4}$ is 0. However, this would mean $y = 0$, and from the original equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we would have $x = 0$. But this would make the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 0$, which is not the minimum value we are looking for.
To find the minimum value, we need to consider the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. If we substitute $x = 2y$ into this equation, we get $|2y-2y| + |y-4y| = 40$, which simplifies to $0 + 3|y| = 40$. This implies $|y| = \frac{40}{3}$, and since $y^2$ is always nonnegative, the minimum value of $9y^2$ is achieved when $y = -\frac{40}{3}$, and substituting this into $x = 2y$ gives $x = -\frac{80}{3}$.
Similarly, if we substitute $x = \frac{y}{2}$ into the constraint, we get $ |\frac{y}{2}-2y| + |y- \frac{y}{2}| = 40$, which simplifies to $\frac{3|y|}{2} + \frac{|y|}{2} = 40$, and this also implies $|y| = \frac{40}{3}$. The minimum value of $\frac{15y^2}{4}$ is achieved when $y = \frac{40}{3}$, and substituting this into $x = \frac{y}{2}$ gives $x = \frac{20}{3}$.
Now we can substitute these values of $x$ and $y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
$$5(-\frac{80}{3})^2 + 5(-\frac{40}{3})^2 - 8(-\frac{80}{3})(-\frac{40}{3}) = \frac{6400}{9} + \frac{800}{9} - \frac{3200}{9} = \frac{3600}{9} = 400.$$
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 400.
