**Problem:** 
"If $x + 2y= 4$ and $xy = -8$, what is the value of $x^2 + 4y^2$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
We see that $(x + 2y)^2 = (x^2 + 4y^2) + 4xy = 4^2 = 16$. We want to find $x^2 + 4y^2$ and are given $xy = -8$. So, $x^2 + 4y^2 + 4xy = x^2 + 4y^2 + 4(-8) = 16$. It follows that $x^2 + 4y^2 = \boxed{48}$. The answer is $\boxed{48}$

**Problem**
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Find the minimum value of $2x^2 + 2y^2 + 5z^2 - 2xy - 4yz - 4x - 2z + 15$ over all real numbers $x,$ $y,$ $z.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
We can write the given expression as
\begin{align*}
&(x^2 - 4x + 4) + (x^2 - 2xy + y^2) + (y^2 - 4yz + 4z^2) + (z^2 - 2z + 1) + 10 \\
&= (x - 2)^2 + (x - y)^2 + (y - 2z)^2 + (z - 1)^2 + 10
\end{align*}The minimum value is then $\boxed{10},$ which occurs when $x = 2,$ $y = 2,$ and $z = 1.$ The answer is $\boxed{10}$

**Problem**
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step.

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we can use the method of completing the square. First, let's rewrite the given expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $(x^2-4xy+4y^2)+(y^2-4xy+4x^2) = (x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2$.

The condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ implies that $x-2y$ and $y-2x$ have the same absolute value, but opposite signs. Therefore, either $x-2y = y-2x$ and $x-2y = - (y-2x)$, or $x-2y = - (y-2x)$ and $x-2y = y-2x$. The first case gives $x = y = 0$, but this does not satisfy the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. The second case gives $x = 20$ and $y = -10$ or $x = -10$ and $y = 20$.

Now we substitute $x = 20$ and $y = -10$ into the expression $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2$ to get $(20+20)^2 + (-10-40)^2 = 1600 + 2500 = 4100$.

So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $4100$. The answer is: $4100$
