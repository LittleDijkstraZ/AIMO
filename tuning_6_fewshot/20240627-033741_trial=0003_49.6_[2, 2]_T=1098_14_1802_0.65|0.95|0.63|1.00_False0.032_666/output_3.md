**Problem:** 
"How many square units are in the area of the triangle whose vertices are the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the curve $y = (x-3)^2 (x+2)$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we need to find where this curve intersects the $x$ and $y$ axes.  If $y=0$, then $(x-3)^2(x+2)=0$, which has solutions of $x=3$ and $x=-2$.  If $x=0$, then $y=(-3)^2(2)=18$.  So, the curve has two $x$-intercepts and one $y$-intercept.  The length of the base along the $x$-axis is $3-(-2)=5$.  The height from this base is equal to the $y$-intercept, 18.  The area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 5\cdot 18=\boxed{45}$. The answer is $\boxed{45}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



1. The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. So, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

2. The first expression is equal to zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, and $(-10, 0)$.

3. The second expression is equal to zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

4. The vertices of the polygon are the points $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

5. To find the area of the polygon, we can divide it into four right triangles by drawing lines from the origin to each vertex. The area of each triangle is $\frac{1}{2} \times base \times height$. The base and height of each triangle are the distances from the origin to the vertices.

6. The distance from the origin to $(0, 10)$ is 10, the distance from the origin to $(0, -10)$ is 10, the distance from the origin to $(10, 0)$ is 10, and the distance from the origin to $(-10, 0)$ is 10. So, the area of each triangle is $\frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10 = 50$.

7. The distance from the origin to $(8, 8)$ is $\sqrt{8^2 + 8^2} = 8\sqrt{2}$, the distance from the origin to $(8, -8)$ is $8\sqrt{2}$, the distance from the origin to $(-8, 8)$ is $8\sqrt{2}$, and the distance from the origin to $(-8, -8)$ is $8\sqrt{2}$. So, the area of each triangle is $\frac{1}{2} \times 8\sqrt{2} \times 8\sqrt{2} = 64$.

8. The total area of the polygon is the sum of the areas of the four triangles, which is $4 \times 50 + 4 \times 64 = 200 + 256 = 456$.

9. However, this is not possible because the polygon is a square with side length 16 (the maximum distance from the origin to the vertices $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$), so its area should be $16^2 = 256$.

10. We must have made a mistake in our calculations. Let's go back and check our work.

11. After re-examining our work, we realize that we have counted the area of the square formed by the vertices $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$ twice. We should only count it once.

12. So, the total area of the polygon is the sum of the areas of the two triangles formed by the vertices $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, and $(-10, 0)$, which is $2 \times 50 = 100$, plus the area of the square formed by the vertices $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$, which is $256 - 100 = 156$.

13. However, this still does not match our previous calculation. Let's re-examine our work again.

14. After re-examining our work once more, we realize that we have made an error in our calculations of the areas of the triangles formed by the vertices $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, and $(-10, 0)$. The base and height of these triangles are not 10, but rather the distances from the origin to these vertices, which are $10\sqrt{2}$. So, the area of each triangle is $\frac{1}{2} \times 10\sqrt{2} \times 10\sqrt{2} = 100$.

15. Therefore, the total area of the polygon is the sum of the areas of the two triangles formed by the vertices $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, and $(-10, 0)$, which is $2 \times 100 = 200$, plus the area of the square formed by the vertices $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$, which is $256 - 200 = 56$.

16. However, this still does not match our previous calculation. Let's re-examine our work once more.

17. After re-examining our work yet again, we realize that we have made another error in our calculations of the areas of the triangles formed by the vertices $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, and $(-10, 0)$. The base and height of these triangles are not $10\sqrt{2}$, but rather the distances from the origin to these vertices, which are 10. So, the area of each triangle is $\frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10 = 50$.

18. Therefore, the total area of the polygon is the sum of the areas of the two triangles formed by the vertices $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, and $(-10, 0)$, which is $2 \times 50 = 100$, plus the area of the square formed by the vertices $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$, which is $256 - 100 = 156$.

19. This still does not match our previous calculation. Let's re-examine our work one last time.

20. After re-examining our work for the last time, we realize that we have made an error in our calculations of the area of the square formed by the vertices $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$. The side length of this square is the maximum distance from the origin to these vertices, which is $8\sqrt{2}$. So, the area of this square is $(8\sqrt{2})^2 = 128$.

21. Therefore, the total area of the polygon is the sum of the areas of the two triangles formed by the vertices $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, and $(-10, 0)$, which is $2 \times 50 = 100$, plus the area of the square formed by the vertices $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$,

## QUESTION 3 - 1 
- TIME_SPENT : 727 secs

1_
**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Find the number of 10-tuples $(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{10})$ of real numbers such that
\[(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2 = \frac{1}{11}.\]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,
\begin{align*}
&[(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + \dots + 1^2 + 1^2)][(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2] \\
&\ge [(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + (x_2 - x_3) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10}]^2 = 1.
\end{align*}From the given condition, we have equality, so by the equality condition for Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[\frac{1 - x_1}{1} = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{1} = \frac{x_2 - x_3}{1} = \dots = \frac{x_9 - x_{10}}{1} = \frac{x_{10}}{1}.\]Let
\[d = 1 - x_1 = x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_3 = \dots = x_9 - x_{10} = x_{10}.\]Then
\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so
\[(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_{10}) = \left( \frac{10}{11}, \frac{9}{11}, \frac{8}{11}, \dots, \frac{1}{11} \right).\]In particular, there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. This equation is satisfied if either of the two factors is zero. 

The first factor is zero when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two circles in the $xy$-plane. The second factor is zero when $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$, which are the equations of two more circles. 

The intersection of these four circles form a square with side length 16 (since the distance between the centers of the two circles $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ is $10\sqrt{2}$, and the distance between the centers of the two circles $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ is 16). 

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of the square, which is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"An ellipse is defined parametrically by
\[(x,y) = \left( \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t}, \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t} \right).\]Then the equation of the ellipse can be written in the form
\[Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0,\]where $A,$ $B,$ $C,$ $D,$ $E,$ and $F$ are integers, and $\gcd(|A|,|B|,|C|,|D|,|E|,|F|) = 1.$  Find $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F|.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
In the equation $y = \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\cos t$ to get
\[\cos t = \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3}.\]In the equation $x = \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\sin t$ to get
\[\sin t = \frac{1}{2} x (2 - \cos t) + 1 = \frac{1}{2} x \left( 2 - \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right) + 1 = 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)}.\]Since $\cos^2 t + \sin^2 t = 1,$
\[\left( \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right)^2 + \left( 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)} \right)^2 = 1.\]Multiplying both sides by $(2(y + 3))^2$ and expanding, it will simplify to
\[81x^2 - 36xy + 16y^2 - 108x + 240y + 900 = 0.\]Therefore, $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F| = 81 + 36 + 16 + 108 + 240 + 900 = \boxed{1381}.$ The answer is $\boxed{1381}$

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we first need to understand the given equation:
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]
This equation is equal to zero if either of the two factors is zero. Therefore, we have two sets of equations to solve:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
For the first set of equations, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us a square with side length 16 centered at the origin. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
For the second set of equations, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us a square with side length 16 centered at the point (10,0). The area of this square is also $16^2 = 256$.
Therefore, the points satisfying the given equation enclose a square with side length 16, and the area of this square is $256$. The answer is $\boxed{256}$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many square units are in the area of the triangle whose vertices are the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the curve $y = (x-3)^2 (x+2)$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we need to find where this curve intersects the $x$ and $y$ axes.  If $y=0$, then $(x-3)^2(x+2)=0$, which has solutions of $x=3$ and $x=-2$.  If $x=0$, then $y=(-3)^2(2)=18$.  So, the curve has two $x$-intercepts and one $y$-intercept.  The length of the base along the $x$-axis is $3-(-2)=5$.  The height from this base is equal to the $y$-intercept, 18.  The area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 5\cdot 18=\boxed{45}$. The answer is $\boxed{45}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The given equation is equal to zero if and only if at least one of the factors is equal to zero. This means we have four cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 \neq 0$.
3. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 \neq 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
4. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 \neq 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 \neq 0$.
5. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 \neq 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
6. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 \neq 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 \neq 0$.
7. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 \neq 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 \neq 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
8. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 \neq 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 \neq 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 \neq 0$.

The only case that gives a non-empty set of solutions is the first one, which corresponds to the points $\left(x, y\right)$ such that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This set of points forms a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

The answer is: $256$

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

2. For the first term to be zero, either $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x-y| - 10 = 0$. This simplifies to $|x+y| = 10$ or $|x-y| = 10$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x+y=10$, $x+y=-10$, $x-y=10$, and $x-y=-10$.

3. For the second term to be zero, either $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$. This simplifies to $|x| = 8$ or $|y| = 8$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x=8$, $x=-8$, $y=8$, and $y=-8$.

4. The intersection points of these lines are the vertices of the polygon. By plotting these lines on a graph, we can find the vertices of the polygon. They are $(8,8)$, $(-8,8)$, $(-8,-8)$, and $(8,-8)$.

5. To find the area of the polygon, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle and subtract the areas of the four right triangles that are formed by the lines. The rectangle has side lengths of 16 units (from $-8$ to $8$ in both the x and y directions) and the triangles each have a base and height of 8 units.

6. The area of the rectangle is $16 \times 16 = 256$ square units. The area of each triangle is $\frac{1}{2} \times 8 \times 8 = 32$ square units. Since there are four triangles, the total area of the triangles is $4 \times 32 = 128$ square units.

7. The area of the polygon is the area of the rectangle minus the area of the triangles, which is $256 - 128 = 128$ square units.

The script to compute this is very simple:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    # Area of rectangle
    area_rectangle = 16 * 16
    # Area of each triangle
    area_triangle = 0.5 * 8 * 8
    # Total area of triangles
    area_triangles = 4 * area_triangle
    # Area of polygon
    area_polygon = area_rectangle - area_triangles
    return area_polygon

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 128.0

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
128.0
```
The area of the convex polygon is $128$ square units. The answer is: $128$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"An ellipse is defined parametrically by
\[(x,y) = \left( \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t}, \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t} \right).\]Then the equation of the ellipse can be written in the form
\[Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0,\]where $A,$ $B,$ $C,$ $D,$ $E,$ and $F$ are integers, and $\gcd(|A|,|B|,|C|,|D|,|E|,|F|) = 1.$  Find $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F|.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
In the equation $y = \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\cos t$ to get
\[\cos t = \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3}.\]In the equation $x = \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\sin t$ to get
\[\sin t = \frac{1}{2} x (2 - \cos t) + 1 = \frac{1}{2} x \left( 2 - \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right) + 1 = 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)}.\]Since $\cos^2 t + \sin^2 t = 1,$
\[\left( \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right)^2 + \left( 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)} \right)^2 = 1.\]Multiplying both sides by $(2(y + 3))^2$ and expanding, it will simplify to
\[81x^2 - 36xy + 16y^2 - 108x + 240y + 900 = 0.\]Therefore, $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F| = 81 + 36 + 16 + 108 + 240 + 900 = \boxed{1381}.$ The answer is $\boxed{1381}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. These four equations intersect at the points $(8,2)$, $(8,-2)$, $(-8,2)$, and $(-8,-2)$.

Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. These four equations intersect at the points $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

The eight points $(8,2)$, $(8,-2)$, $(-8,2)$, $(-8,-2)$, $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$ form a rectangle with side lengths $16$ and $10$. Therefore, the area of the rectangle is $16 \times 10 = 160$.
The answer is $\boxed{160}$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"An ellipse is defined parametrically by
\[(x,y) = \left( \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t}, \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t} \right).\]Then the equation of the ellipse can be written in the form
\[Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0,\]where $A,$ $B,$ $C,$ $D,$ $E,$ and $F$ are integers, and $\gcd(|A|,|B|,|C|,|D|,|E|,|F|) = 1.$  Find $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F|.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
In the equation $y = \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\cos t$ to get
\[\cos t = \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3}.\]In the equation $x = \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\sin t$ to get
\[\sin t = \frac{1}{2} x (2 - \cos t) + 1 = \frac{1}{2} x \left( 2 - \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right) + 1 = 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)}.\]Since $\cos^2 t + \sin^2 t = 1,$
\[\left( \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right)^2 + \left( 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)} \right)^2 = 1.\]Multiplying both sides by $(2(y + 3))^2$ and expanding, it will simplify to
\[81x^2 - 36xy + 16y^2 - 108x + 240y + 900 = 0.\]Therefore, $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F| = 81 + 36 + 16 + 108 + 240 + 900 = \boxed{1381}.$ The answer is $\boxed{1381}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

Let's consider the first term $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This term is zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These conditions are satisfied only when $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$. So the first term gives us the vertices of a square with side length 20.

Now let's consider the second term $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This term is zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These conditions are satisfied only when $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So the second term gives us the vertices of a square with side length 16.

The two squares intersect at the origin (0,0), and the larger square contains the smaller square. Therefore, the convex polygon formed by the intersection of the two squares is also a square. The side length of this square is the distance from the origin to the vertices of the larger square, which is 10. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

Let's think step by step:
In the equation $y = \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\cos t$ to get
\[\cos t = \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3}.\]In the equation $x = \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\sin t$ to get

\[\left( \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right)^2 + \left( 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)} \right)^2 = 1.\]Multiplying both sides by $(2(y + 3))^2$ and expanding, it will simplify to
\[81x^2 - 36xy + 16y^2 - 108x + 240y + 900 = 0.\]Therefore, $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F| = 81 + 36 + 16 + 108 + 240 + 900 = \boxed{1381}.$ The answer is $\boxed{1381}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if and only if at least one of the factors is zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. 

The first equation is satisfied if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of a square with side length 10 and diagonal $10\sqrt{2}$. The area of this square is $(10\sqrt{2})^2/2 = 100$.

The second equation is satisfied if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of a square with side length 16 and diagonal $16\sqrt{2}$. The area of this square is $(16\sqrt{2})^2/2 = 256$.

The points that satisfy the original equation are the union of the points that satisfy either of the two factors being zero. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares, which is $100 + 256 = 356$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{356}$.

Note: The problem might have a simpler solution, but this one is more straightforward and doesn't require advanced mathematical knowledge.

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(8,2)$, $(8,-2)$, $(-8,2)$, and $(-8,-2)$.

Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us the vertices $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

Now we plot these points on a coordinate plane and connect them to form a square. The side length of the square is $16$, so its area is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $256$.
The answer is $\boxed{256}$.
