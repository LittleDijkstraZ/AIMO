**Problem:** 
"How many solutions does the equation \[\frac{(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)\dotsm(x-100)}{(x-1^2)(x-2^2)(x-3^2)\dotsm(x-100^2)} = 0\]have for $x$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Any solution to this equation must make the numerator of the left-hand side zero, while keeping the denominator non-zero. The numerator is zero when $x$ is one of the numbers $1, 2, 3, \dots, 100.$ However, for any value in this list that is a perfect square, the denominator will also be zero, so that value of $x$ will not be a root. Therefore, we want to find the number of integers in the list $1, 2, \dots, 100$ which are not perfect squares. The perfect squares in the list are $1^2, 2^2, \dots, 10^2,$ so there are $10$ perfect squares, and \[100 - 10 = \boxed{90}\]integers which are not perfect squares. The answer is $\boxed{90}$

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


This problem requires a detailed analysis of the equation and the number of solutions it can have. The equation is \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] and we want to find for how many positive integers $m$ does it have $4$ distinct solutions.

First, let's consider the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$. Since $m$ is a positive integer, $\frac{m}{100}$ is a positive fraction.

The left side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, is the absolute value of the absolute value of $x-1$ minus $2$. This function has a "V" shape, with the minimum value of $0$ when $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$, or $x = 3$ or $x = -1$. The function increases as $x$ moves away from these points.

For the equation to have $4$ distinct solutions, the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be equal to the height of the "V" shape of the left side of the equation, which is $2$. Therefore, $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, which gives $m = 200$.

So, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions, and that is $m = 200$. The answer is: $1$.

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


For the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ to have $4$ distinct solutions, the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal to $1$. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a graph with a shape of a "V" with $4$ branches, and the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ determines the distance between the branches. If $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $1$, then the branches will be exactly $1$ unit apart, resulting in $4$ distinct solutions.

Therefore, we need to find the value of $m$ that satisfies $\frac{m}{100} = 1$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def find_m():
    """For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"""
    m = 100  # The value of m that satisfies m/100 = 1
    return m

result = find_m()
print(result)
```

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
100
```
The value of $m$ that makes the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have $4$ distinct solutions is $100$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $1$. The answer is $\boxed{1}$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many integers are solutions to the equation $$(x-2)^{(25-x^2)}=1?$$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
We need some basic facts from number theory: $a^0 = 1$ for any $a,$ $1^b = 1$ for any $b,$ and $(-1)^c = 1$ if $c$ is an even integer. Unless the base is a complex number (which is excluded since we are looking for integer solutions), there are no other ways to get an RHS of $1.$ Thus, either the exponent is zero $($giving the equation $25 - x^2 = 0),$ the base is $1$ $($giving $x -2 = 1),$ or the base is $-1$ and the exponent is even $($giving the simultaneous equations $x - 2 = -1$ and $25 - x^2 = 2n$ for some integer $n).$ Solving the first equation gives $x = \pm 5,$ and solving the second gives $x = 3.$ The third equation implies that $x = 1,$ in which case $25 - x^2 = 24$ is indeed even, so $x = 1$ is a valid solution. In all, there are $\boxed{4}$ integer solutions. The answer is $\boxed{4}$

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


This problem is a bit too complex for simple Python code to solve directly. However, we can use Python to help us analyze the problem and make an educated guess about the solution.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is between $1$ and $2$. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a graph that oscillates between $1$ and $2$. Therefore, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be within this range for the equation to have 4 distinct solutions.

So, the possible values of $m$ are the multiples of $100$ between $100$ and $200$. There are $10$ such multiples.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $10$. The answer is: $10$

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



We will use a sympy-based approach to solve this problem. We will first set up the equation and then iterate over the possible values of $m$ to find the ones that give us 4 distinct solutions.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve, Abs, N

def find_m():
    x = symbols('x')
    m = symbols('m', integer=True)
    num_solutions = 0

    for possible_m in range(1, 101):
        equation = Eq(Abs(Abs(x - 1) - 2), possible_m / 100)
        solutions = solve(equation, x)
        
        # Check if the solutions are distinct
        if len(set(N(solutions))) == 4:
            num_solutions += 1
            if num_solutions == 1:
                m_value = possible_m
            elif num_solutions > 1:
                break

    return m_value

result = find_m()
print(result)
```

    return sympify(x, rational=True).evalf(n, **options)
AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'evalf'

```

It seems like the error in the code is due to the use of `N` function on a list of solutions. The `N` function is used to convert a sympy expression to a floating point number, but it doesn't work on a list of expressions.

Let's revise the code and use `set` to check for distinct solutions:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve, Abs

def find_m():
    x = symbols('x')
    m = symbols('m', integer=True)
    num_solutions = 0

    for possible_m in range(1, 101):
        equation = Eq(Abs(Abs(x - 1) - 2), possible_m / 100)
        solutions = solve(equation, x)
        
        # Check if the solutions are distinct
        if len(set(solutions)) == 4:
            num_solutions += 1
            if num_solutions == 1:
                m_value = possible_m
            elif num_solutions > 1:
                break

    return m_value

result = find_m()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 1

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
1
```
The value of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $1$. Thus, the value of $m$ is $1$. The answer is $\boxed{1}$.
