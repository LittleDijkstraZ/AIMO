**Problem:** 
"Let \[f(x) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
-x + 3 & \text{if } x \le 0, \\
2x - 5 & \text{if } x > 0.
\end{array}
\right.\]How many solutions does the equation $f(f(x)) = 4$ have?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
To solve the equation $f(f(x)) = 4,$ we first find the values $x$ such that $f(x) = 4.$

Either $f(x) = -x + 3$ (for $x \le 0$) or $f(x) = 2x - 5$ (for $x > 0$). If $-x + 3 = 4,$ then $x = -1.$ Note that this value satisfies $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = 4,$ then $x = 9/2.$ Note that this value satisfies $x > 0.$ Therefore, the solutions to $f(x) = 4$ are $x = -1$ and $x = 9/2.$

Next, we solve for the values $x$ such that $f(x) = -1.$ If $-x + 3 = -1,$ then $x = 4.$ This value does not satisfy $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = -1,$ then $x = 2.$ This value satisfies $x > 0.$

Finally, we solve for the values $x$ such that $f(x) = 9/2.$ If $-x + 3 = 9/2,$ then $x = -3/2.$ This value satisfies $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = 9/2,$ then $x = 19/4.$ This value satisfies $x > 0.$

Therefore, the equation $f(f(x)) = 4$ has the solutions $x = 2,$ $-3/2,$ and $19/4,$ for a total of $\boxed{3}$ solutions. The answer is $\boxed{3}$

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.
We know that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $1$. So we set $\frac{m}{100}$ equal to $1$ and solve for $m$:
\[m = 100.\]
Therefore, there is $1$ positive integer $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

The value of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions is $100$.
The answer is: $1$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many solutions does the equation \[\frac{(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)\dotsm(x-100)}{(x-1^2)(x-2^2)(x-3^2)\dotsm(x-100^2)} = 0\]have for $x$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Any solution to this equation must make the numerator of the left-hand side zero, while keeping the denominator non-zero. The numerator is zero when $x$ is one of the numbers $1, 2, 3, \dots, 100.$ However, for any value in this list that is a perfect square, the denominator will also be zero, so that value of $x$ will not be a root. Therefore, we want to find the number of integers in the list $1, 2, \dots, 100$ which are not perfect squares. The perfect squares in the list are $1^2, 2^2, \dots, 10^2,$ so there are $10$ perfect squares, and \[100 - 10 = \boxed{90}\]integers which are not perfect squares. The answer is $\boxed{90}$

**Solution:** 


First, let's understand the problem. We want to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has 4 distinct solutions. This equation is an absolute value equation with a fractional right-hand side. 

The absolute value equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=k$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $0<k<1$. In our case, $k=\frac{m}{100}$, so we need $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 1$, which is equivalent to $0 < m < 100$. Therefore, the problem boils down to finding the number of positive integers in this range.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def count_positive_integers():
    # Define the range of positive integers to consider
    lower_bound = 1
    upper_bound = 100

    # Count the number of integers in the range
    count = upper_bound - lower_bound

    return count

result = count_positive_integers()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 99

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
99
```
The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has 4 distinct solutions is 99. However, this result seems incorrect because we are not considering the condition $0 < m < 100$. We need to revise our approach to solve this problem.

Let's reconsider the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] with $0 < m < 100$. This equation has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 1$, which is equivalent to $0 < m < 100$. The number of positive integers in this range is exactly 99.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has 4 distinct solutions is 99. However, this problem actually asks for the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has exactly 4 distinct solutions. We have already established that the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] with $0 < m < 100$ always has 4 distinct solutions. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has exactly 4 distinct solutions is 99.

The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has exactly 4 distinct solutions is 99. The answer is: $99$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many integers are solutions to the equation $$(x-2)^{(25-x^2)}=1?$$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
We need some basic facts from number theory: $a^0 = 1$ for any $a,$ $1^b = 1$ for any $b,$ and $(-1)^c = 1$ if $c$ is an even integer. Unless the base is a complex number (which is excluded since we are looking for integer solutions), there are no other ways to get an RHS of $1.$ Thus, either the exponent is zero $($giving the equation $25 - x^2 = 0),$ the base is $1$ $($giving $x -2 = 1),$ or the base is $-1$ and the exponent is even $($giving the simultaneous equations $x - 2 = -1$ and $25 - x^2 = 2n$ for some integer $n).$ Solving the first equation gives $x = \pm 5,$ and solving the second gives $x = 3.$ The third equation implies that $x = 1,$ in which case $25 - x^2 = 24$ is indeed even, so $x = 1$ is a valid solution. In all, there are $\boxed{4}$ integer solutions. The answer is $\boxed{4}$

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**



To find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions, we can analyze the behavior of the function on the left hand side.

The function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a "hump" function that oscillates between $0$ and $4$. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have $4$ distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is in the range $(0,4)$. Multiplying through by $100$, we find that $0 < m < 400$. The number of positive integers $m$ in this range is $399$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $399$.

However, this script will not work as expected because it will try to solve the equation for every possible value of $m$ from $1$ to $100$, which is computationally expensive and unnecessary. We know that $m$ must be a positive integer and that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can have at most $4$ distinct solutions.
We can simplify the equation to $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ by setting $\frac{m}{100}$ to a fixed value (say, $1$) and then checking the number of solutions.
