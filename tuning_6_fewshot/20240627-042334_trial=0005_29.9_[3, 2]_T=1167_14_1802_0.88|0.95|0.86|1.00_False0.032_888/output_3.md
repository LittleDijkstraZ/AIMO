**Problem:** 
"Find the number of 10-tuples $(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{10})$ of real numbers such that
\[(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2 = \frac{1}{11}.\]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,
\begin{align*}
&[(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + \dots + 1^2 + 1^2)][(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2] \\
&\ge [(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + (x_2 - x_3) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10}]^2 = 1.
\end{align*}From the given condition, we have equality, so by the equality condition for Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[\frac{1 - x_1}{1} = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{1} = \frac{x_2 - x_3}{1} = \dots = \frac{x_9 - x_{10}}{1} = \frac{x_{10}}{1}.\]Let
\[d = 1 - x_1 = x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_3 = \dots = x_9 - x_{10} = x_{10}.\]Then
\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so
\[(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_{10}) = \left( \frac{10}{11}, \frac{9}{11}, \frac{8}{11}, \dots, \frac{1}{11} \right).\]In particular, there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if at least one of the factors is equal to zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. 

The first equation is satisfied if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This is the condition for a square with side length 10 and its center at the origin.

The second equation is satisfied if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This is the condition for a square with side length 16 and its center at the origin.

The intersection of these two squares is a square with side length 8 and its center at the origin. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $8^2 = 64$.

So the answer is $\boxed{64}$.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The given equation is
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$
For this equation to equal zero, either one of the two factors must equal zero.
The first factor is zero when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
The second factor is zero when $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
These conditions define a square with side length $16$ (since $\vert x \vert = 8$ means $x$ is between $-8$ and $8$).
The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
So the area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$

Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,
\begin{align*}

\end{align*}From the given condition, we have equality, so by the equality condition for Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[\frac{1 - x_1}{1} = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{1} = \frac{x_2 - x_3}{1} = \dots = \frac{x_9 - x_{10}}{1} = \frac{x_{10}}{1}.\]Let
\[d = 1 - x_1 = x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_3 = \dots = x_9 - x_{10} = x_{10}.\]Then
\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so
\[(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_{10}) = \left( \frac{10}{11}, \frac{9}{11}, \frac{8}{11}, \dots, \frac{1}{11} \right).\]In particular, there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we first observe that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to the union of the following two sets of points:

1. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$.
2. $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.

The first set of points represents a square with side length 20 centered at the origin. The second set of points also represents a square with side length 16 centered at the origin. Therefore, the convex polygon enclosed by the union of these two sets of points is a square with side length 20 (the larger of the two side lengths). The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$. The answer is: $400$

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if at least one of the factors is zero. This occurs if and only if either $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, or $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. 
The first condition represents a square with side length 20, while the second condition represents a square with side length 16. 
The intersection of these two squares is a smaller square with side length 8.
The area of the larger square is $20^2 = 400$, the area of the smaller square is $8^2 = 64$, and the area of the intersection is $16^2 = 256$.
To find the area of the convex polygon, we need to subtract the area of the intersection from the sum of the areas of the two squares: $400 + 400 - 256 = 544$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_ 2= (-16,2).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that
\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as
\[\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1.\]Find $h + k + a + b.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

**Solution:**


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ equals zero if and only if both of its factors equal zero. This gives us the following system of equations:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, or $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, or $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert y \vert = 8$, or $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

The solutions to the system of equations are the intersections of the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, $x - y = -10$, $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines enclose a rectangle with side lengths 20 and 16. The area of the rectangle is $20 \times 16 = 320$.
The answer is $\boxed{320}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is equal to zero if either of the two expressions are equal to zero.

2. The first expression is equal to zero when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This forms a square with side length 20.

3. The second expression is equal to zero when $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. This forms a square with side length 16.

4. The intersection of the two squares forms a smaller square inside the larger one.

5. The side length of the smaller square is the difference of the side lengths of the larger and smaller squares, which is $20 - 16 = 4$.

6. The area of a square is given by the square of its side length, so the area of the smaller square is $4^2 = 16$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 16. To compute this using Python:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, simplify

def area_of_polygon():
    # The side length of the smaller square

**Problem:** 
"How many square units are in the area of the triangle whose vertices are the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the curve $y = (x-3)^2 (x+2)$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we need to find where this curve intersects the $x$ and $y$ axes.  If $y=0$, then $(x-3)^2(x+2)=0$, which has solutions of $x=3$ and $x=-2$.  If $x=0$, then $y=(-3)^2(2)=18$.  So, the curve has two $x$-intercepts and one $y$-intercept.  The length of the base along the $x$-axis is $3-(-2)=5$.  The height from this base is equal to the $y$-intercept, 18.  The area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 5\cdot 18=\boxed{45}$. The answer is $\boxed{45}$

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



First, we need to understand the problem and the conditions given. The equation is equal to zero, which means either the first term or the second term is zero.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
If $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
If $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

Now, we can plot these lines on a graph and find the intersection points. The intersection points form a polygon, and we need to find the area of this polygon.

The polygon is a square with side length 20, so its area is $20^2 = 400$.

The answer is: $400$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The expression $A = ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ means that at least one of the factors must be zero for the product to be zero.

2. The factors are $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$ and $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. Each of these factors being zero implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

3. Solving each of these absolute value equations gives us a system of equations:
   - $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ implies $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
   - $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ implies $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
   - $\vert x \vert = 8$ implies $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
   - $\vert y \vert = 8$ implies $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

4. By solving this system of equations, we get the vertices of the polygon: $(8,8), (8,-8), (-8,8), (-8,-8), (10,0), (-10,0), (0,10), (0,-10)$.

5. Now we can plot these points on a coordinate plane to visualize the polygon.

6. The polygon is a square with side length 16. To find the area, we can use the formula for the area of a square, which is side length squared. So the area is $16^2 = 256$.

The area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Find the number of 10-tuples $(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{10})$ of real numbers such that
\[(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2 = \frac{1}{11}.\]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,
\begin{align*}
&[(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + \dots + 1^2 + 1^2)][(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2] \\
&\ge [(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + (x_2 - x_3) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10}]^2 = 1.
\end{align*}From the given condition, we have equality, so by the equality condition for Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[\frac{1 - x_1}{1} = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{1} = \frac{x_2 - x_3}{1} = \dots = \frac{x_9 - x_{10}}{1} = \frac{x_{10}}{1}.\]Let
\[d = 1 - x_1 = x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_3 = \dots = x_9 - x_{10} = x_{10}.\]Then
\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so
\[(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_{10}) = \left( \frac{10}{11}, \frac{9}{11}, \frac{8}{11}, \dots, \frac{1}{11} \right).\]In particular, there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if and only if at least one of the factors is zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. 
The first factor is zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These equations describe a square with side length 10 and vertices at $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,-5)$, and $(-5,5)$.
The second factor is zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which describes a square with side length 16 and vertices at $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,-8)$, and $(-8,8)$.
The intersection of these two squares is a square with side length 8 and vertices at $(4,4)$, $(4,-4)$, $(-4,-4)$, and $(-4,4)$.
The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$.
The answer is: $64$

Assistant:

 The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. For the product of two numbers to be zero, one of the numbers must be zero. Therefore, we have two cases:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(0,10), (0,-10), (10,0), (-10,0)$.

For the second case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(8,8), (8,-8), (-8,8), (-8,-8)$.

The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying the original equation form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100.
The answer is: $100$

It seems like there's been an error in the code. The `solveset()` function in sympy can't handle equations with absolute values like this. Let's try a different approach.

We can observe that the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ will be equal to 0 if either of the two factors is equal to 0.

The first factor $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$ will be true if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two lines, so they form a rectangle with side lengths of 20 units (since the absolute value of a quantity is the distance from zero to that quantity).

The second factor $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ will be true if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which are the equations of two circles with radius 8 units.

So, the points that satisfy the original equation are the intersections of these two shapes, which form a square with side length 16 units (since the square is contained within the rectangle).

The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: 256.

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**



The equation is given as $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

This equation is satisfied only when either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

This means that either $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The solutions to these equations are lines and squares. The lines are $x + y = \pm 10$, $x - y = \pm 10$, $x = \pm 8$, and $y = \pm 8$. The squares are formed by the intersections of these lines.

The square formed by the intersections of $x + y = 10$, $x - y = 10$, $x = -8$, and $y = -8$ has side length 16, so its area is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: 256
