**Problem:** 
"Find the distance between the vertex of the graph of the equation $y=x^2 + 2x - 6 $ and the point $(4, 5)$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Completing the square, we get $y=(x + 1)^2 - 7 $. The vertex of the graph of this equation is thus $(-1, -7)$.The distance between $(4, 5)$ and $(-1, -7)$ is $\sqrt{(4-(-1))^2 + (5-(-7))^2} = \sqrt{25+144} =\boxed{13}$. The answer is $\boxed{13}$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"The smallest distance between the origin and a point on the parabola $y=x^2-5$ can be expressed as $\sqrt{a}/b$, where $a$ and $b$ are positive integers, and $a$ is not divisible by the square of any prime.  Find $a+b$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the distance formula, we are trying to minimize $\sqrt{x^2+y^2}=\sqrt{x^2+x^4-10x^2+25}$. In general minimization problems like this require calculus, but one elementary optimization method that sometimes works is completing the square.  We have $$\sqrt{x^2+x^4-10x^2+25}=\sqrt{(x^2-9/2)^2+(25-81/4)}.$$This expression is minimized when the square equals $0$, i.e. when $x=\pm 3/\sqrt{2}.$ For this value of $x$, the distance is $$\sqrt{25-\frac{81}{4}}=\frac{\sqrt{19}}{2}.$$Hence the desired answer is $\boxed{21}$. The answer is $\boxed{21}$

**Problem**
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



1. First, we need to find the points $A$ and $B$ where the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$. This gives us the equation $4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l$. Rearranging, we get $kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0$.

2. We know that the points $A$ and $B$ are distance 6 apart, so we can use the fact that the distance between two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is $\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$. In this case, we have $y_1 = y_2 = 4$, so the distance simplifies to $\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2} = |x_2 - x_1|$.

3. The distance between $A$ and $B$ is given as 6, so $|x_2 - x_1| = 6$. The quadratic formula gives us the solutions for $x$ as $x = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k} = 1 \pm \sqrt{1 - (l - 4)}$.

4. Since the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, we have $6 = 2\sqrt{1 - (l - 4)}$, which simplifies to $9 = 1 - (l - 4)$, and further simplifies to $l = 4$.

5. Substituting $l = 4$ into the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0$, we get $kx^2 - 2kx = 0$, which simplifies to $x(kx - 2k) = 0$. This gives us $x = 0$ or $x = 2$.

6. The points $A$ and $B$ are then $(0, 4)$ and $(2, 4)$, respectively.

7. The distance from each point to the origin is given by $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. For point $A$, this is $\sqrt{0^2 + 4^2} = 4$, and for point $B$, this is $\sqrt{2^2 + 4^2} = 2\sqrt{5}$.

8. The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is then $4^2 + (2\sqrt{5})^2 = 16 + 20 = 36$.

The final answer is $\boxed{36}$.

The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $\left(\frac{36k - 2l + 8}{k}\right)$. However, we know that $k$ and $l$ are parameters, and we need to find a numerical value for the sum of the squares of the distances. To do this, we can use the fact that the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, which gives us the equation $k^2(A-B)^2 = 36$. We can solve this equation for $k$ and substitute the value of $k$ into the expression for the sum of squares of distances.

```
The error in the code is due to the fact that Sympy cannot solve the equation involving absolute values. To solve this problem, we can use a different approach. 

From the equation of the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$, we can find that the vertex of the parabola is at $(1, l - k)$. Since the line $y = 4$ intersects the parabola at two points $A$ and $B$, the vertex must be below the line $y = 4$, so we have $l - k < 4$. 

Also, the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, which is the length of the focal length of the parabola. The focal length of a parabola $y = ax^2$ is $1/4a$. So we have $1/4k = 3$, which gives $k = 1/12$.

Substituting $k = 1/12$ into the inequality $l - k < 4$, we get $l - 1/12 < 4$, which gives $l < 4 + 1/12 = 4 1/12 = 4.083333333333333$. Since $l > 0$, we can choose $l = 4$.

Now we can substitute $k = 1/12$ and $l = 4$ into the expression for the sum of squares of distances:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, simplify

def sum_of_squares_distances():
    """Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"""
    k, l = 1/12, 4

    # The sum of the squares of the distances from A and B to the origin
