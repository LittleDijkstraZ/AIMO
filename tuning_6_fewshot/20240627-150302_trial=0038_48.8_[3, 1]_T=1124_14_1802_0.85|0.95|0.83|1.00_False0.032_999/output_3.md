**Problem:** 
"How many square units are in the area of the triangle whose vertices are the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the curve $y = (x-3)^2 (x+2)$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we need to find where this curve intersects the $x$ and $y$ axes.  If $y=0$, then $(x-3)^2(x+2)=0$, which has solutions of $x=3$ and $x=-2$.  If $x=0$, then $y=(-3)^2(2)=18$.  So, the curve has two $x$-intercepts and one $y$-intercept.  The length of the base along the $x$-axis is $3-(-2)=5$.  The height from this base is equal to the $y$-intercept, 18.  The area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 5\cdot 18=\boxed{45}$. The answer is $\boxed{45}$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either one of the expressions is zero, or both are zero.

If either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two lines in the coordinate plane.

If either $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two lines in the coordinate plane.

The intersection of these lines form a square with side length 16 (since $\vert x \vert = 8$ means $x = \pm 8$, and the distance between these two points is 16). Therefore, the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we first need to understand the given equation. The equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, which means either of the expressions must be zero for the entire equation to be zero. 

Let's look at the first expression: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. For this expression to be zero, both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ must be zero. This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. Solving these absolute value equations gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These four lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(0, 10)$, $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, and $(0, -10)$.

Similarly, the second expression $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These four lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, $(0, -8)$, and $(-8, 0)$.

The intersection of the two rectangles gives us a square with side length 8 (the shorter side of the two rectangles). The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$. So the area of the convex polygon is 64. The answer is: $64$.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


First, let's define the function $f(x, y)$ as follows:
$$f(x, y) = ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2).$$
The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $f(x, y) = 0$ are the points where either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The solutions to $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ are the points where $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which are the points on the line $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.
Similarly, the solutions to $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ are the points on the lines $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.
The solutions to $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ are the points on the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.
And the solutions to $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ are the points on the lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.
Therefore, the points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $f(x, y) = 0$ are the vertices of a rectangle with sides parallel to the axes and vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.
The area of this rectangle is $(8 - (-8)) \times (8 - (-8)) = 16 \times 16 = 256$.
Thus, the area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The equation given in the problem, $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$, is satisfied if either of the two factors is zero.
The first factor is zero when $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
These equations represent two lines, $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.
The second factor is zero when $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
These equations represent four lines, $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
The intersection points of these lines form a square with side length 16.
The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
So, the area of the convex polygon is 256.
The answer is: $256$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_ 2= (-16,2).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that
\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as
\[\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1.\]Find $h + k + a + b.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we can first simplify the given equation and then find the vertices of the polygon. Finally, we can calculate the area of the polygon.

```python

from sympy import symbols, solve, Abs

def calculate_area():
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # Simplify the given equation
    equation = (Abs(x + y) - 10)**2 + (Abs(x - y) - 10)**2 + (Abs(x) - 8)**2 + (Abs(y) - 8)**2

    # Solve for the vertices of the polygon
    solutions = solve(equation, (x, y))

    # Calculate the area of the polygon
    area = 0

        for j in range(i + 1, len(solutions)):
            # Calculate the distance between two points
            distance = ((solutions[i][0] - solutions[j][0])**2 + (solutions[i][1] - solutions[j][1])**2)**0.5
            # Add the area of the triangle formed by two points to the total area

The code is not running correctly because it's not possible to directly calculate the area of a polygon from the given equation without further information. The equation provided is not in standard form for a geometric shape like a rectangle or a circle. It's more likely to represent a system of inequalities that define a region in the plane, but we can't directly calculate the area of that region without more information.

However, if we assume that the equation represents a square with side length 16 (as the absolute value terms imply a square with vertices at (8,8), (8,-8), (-8,8), and (-8,-8)), then the area would be 256. But this is just an assumption, and the actual area might be different.

If you have any more information or if you can provide a more standard form of the equation, we can try to solve the problem further.

Unfortunately, we cannot provide a numerical answer without further information or additional context. The area of the convex polygon cannot be determined based on the given equation alone.

If you have more information or the equation can be rewritten in a standard form that represents a known geometric shape, please provide that information so we can proceed with the calculation.
The answer is $\boxed{256}$.
