**Problem:** 
"How many square units are in the area of the triangle whose vertices are the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the curve $y = (x-3)^2 (x+2)$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we need to find where this curve intersects the $x$ and $y$ axes.  If $y=0$, then $(x-3)^2(x+2)=0$, which has solutions of $x=3$ and $x=-2$.  If $x=0$, then $y=(-3)^2(2)=18$.  So, the curve has two $x$-intercepts and one $y$-intercept.  The length of the base along the $x$-axis is $3-(-2)=5$.  The height from this base is equal to the $y$-intercept, 18.  The area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 5\cdot 18=\boxed{45}$. The answer is $\boxed{45}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The expression will be equal to zero if either of the terms in the product are zero. So we have four cases to consider:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
3. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
4. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$

For case 1, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8, \vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us a square with side length 16.

For case 2, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$. This gives us a rectangle with length 16 and width 2.

For case 3, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us a rectangle with length 16 and width 2.

For case 4, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us a square with side length 10.

The area of the square with side length 16 is $16^2 = 256$. The areas of the rectangles with length 16 and width 2 are both $16 \times 2 = 32$. The area of the square with side length 10 is $10^2 = 100$.

The total area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the four shapes, which is $256 + 32 + 32 + 100 = 420$.
The answer is $\boxed{420}$.

## QUESTION 3 - 1 
- TIME_SPENT : 652 secs

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"An ellipse is defined parametrically by
\[(x,y) = \left( \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t}, \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t} \right).\]Then the equation of the ellipse can be written in the form
\[Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0,\]where $A,$ $B,$ $C,$ $D,$ $E,$ and $F$ are integers, and $\gcd(|A|,|B|,|C|,|D|,|E|,|F|) = 1.$  Find $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F|.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
In the equation $y = \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\cos t$ to get
\[\cos t = \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3}.\]In the equation $x = \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\sin t$ to get
\[\sin t = \frac{1}{2} x (2 - \cos t) + 1 = \frac{1}{2} x \left( 2 - \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right) + 1 = 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)}.\]Since $\cos^2 t + \sin^2 t = 1,$
\[\left( \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right)^2 + \left( 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)} \right)^2 = 1.\]Multiplying both sides by $(2(y + 3))^2$ and expanding, it will simplify to
\[81x^2 - 36xy + 16y^2 - 108x + 240y + 900 = 0.\]Therefore, $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F| = 81 + 36 + 16 + 108 + 240 + 900 = \boxed{1381}.$ The answer is $\boxed{1381}$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


```python

```
The code above attempts to integrate a boolean expression which is not possible. We need to convert the boolean expression into a numerical expression. We can do this by using the sympy's ifelse function. The ifelse function takes three arguments, condition, value_if_true, and value_if_false. If the condition is true, it returns the value_if_true, otherwise it returns the value_if_false.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Abs, If, simplify

def area_of_polygon():

    # Define the condition for the points to satisfy
    condition = ((Abs(x + y) - 10)**2 + (Abs(x - y) - 10)**2) * ((Abs(x) - 8)**2 + (Abs(y) - 8)**2)

    # If the point satisfies the condition, it will be inside the polygon
    inside_polygon = If(condition == 0, 1, 0)

The sympy library does not have an If function. However, we can use Python's built-in if-else statement.

```python

def area_of_polygon():
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # If the point satisfies the condition, it will be inside the polygon
    inside_polygon = 1 if condition == 0 else 0

    # The area of the polygon is the integral of the characteristic function of the polygon

The area of the convex polygon is 0, but this is not correct. The area should be non-zero because the conditions are not mutually exclusive. The conditions are that either both $x$ and $y$ are in the range of 8 to 10, or both $x+y$ and $x-y$ are in the range of -10 to 10. These two conditions can be satisfied simultaneously, so the area of the polygon is non-zero. Let's modify the code to handle this case.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Abs, integrate, simplify

def area_of_polygon():
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # Define the condition for the points to satisfy
    condition1 = (8 <= Abs(x) <= 10) & (8 <= Abs(y) <= 10)
    condition2 = (8 <= Abs(x + y) <= 10) & (8 <= Abs(x - y) <= 10)

    # If the point satisfies the condition, it will be inside the polygon
    inside_polygon1 = condition1.is_true()
    inside_polygon2 = condition2.is_true()

    # The area of the polygon is the integral of the characteristic function of the polygon
    # over the entire plane
    area = integrate(integrate(inside_polygon1 + inside_polygon2, (y, -100, 100)), (x, -100, 100))

    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)

# Simplify the result
result = simplify(result)

The error in the code above is due to the incorrect usage of the `is_true()` function. The `is_true()` function is not applicable to Sympy expressions. Instead, we should use the `bool()` function to convert the Sympy expressions to booleans.

```python

    # If the point satisfies the condition, it will be inside the polygon

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Find the number of 10-tuples $(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{10})$ of real numbers such that
\[(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2 = \frac{1}{11}.\]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,
\begin{align*}
&[(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + \dots + 1^2 + 1^2)][(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2] \\
&\ge [(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + (x_2 - x_3) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10}]^2 = 1.
\end{align*}From the given condition, we have equality, so by the equality condition for Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[\frac{1 - x_1}{1} = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{1} = \frac{x_2 - x_3}{1} = \dots = \frac{x_9 - x_{10}}{1} = \frac{x_{10}}{1}.\]Let
\[d = 1 - x_1 = x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_3 = \dots = x_9 - x_{10} = x_{10}.\]Then
\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so
\[(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_{10}) = \left( \frac{10}{11}, \frac{9}{11}, \frac{8}{11}, \dots, \frac{1}{11} \right).\]In particular, there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

**Solution:** 


To find the area of the convex polygon formed by the points that satisfy the given equation, we first need to analyze the equation. The equation is of the form $f(x, y) \cdot g(x, y) = 0$. This means that either $f(x, y) = 0$ or $g(x, y) = 0$.

The functions $f(x, y) = (\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ and $g(x, y) = (\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2$ are both equal to zero only when the absolute values inside them are equal to their respective right-hand sides, i.e., when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The solutions of $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ are the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length 10.

The solutions of $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ are the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines also form a square with side length 16.

The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon we are interested in. The area of the square formed by the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$ is $10^2 = 100$. The area of the square formed by the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$ is $16^2 = 256$. The intersection of these two squares is another square with side length 8. The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon formed by the points that satisfy the given equation is 64. The answer is: $64$

Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Let $w$ be the width of each of the identical rectangles. Since $PQ=3w$, $RS=2x$ and $PQ=RS$ (because $PQRS$ is a rectangle), then $2x = 3w$, or $$w=\frac{2}{3}x.$$ Therefore, the area of each of the five identical rectangles is $$x\left(\frac{2}{3}x\right)=\frac{2}{3}x^2.$$ Since the area of $PQRS$ is 4000 and it is made up of five of these identical smaller rectangles, then $$5\left(\frac{2}{3}x^2\right)=4000$$ or $$\frac{10}{3}x^2 = 4000$$ or $x^2 = 1200$ or $x \approx 34.6$ which, when rounded off to the nearest integer, is $\boxed{35}.$ The answer is $\boxed{35}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


The given equation is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

In the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$, $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $-8 \leq x, y \leq 8$. The second case gives us the same result.

So, the points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying the given equation are those for which $-8 \leq x, y \leq 8$. This describes a square with side length $16$. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon formed by these points is 256.

The answer is: $\boxed{256}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if either of the following two conditions are met:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first condition to be true, both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies that $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$. These four equations represent the lines $y = 10 - x$, $y = x - 10$, $y = -10 - x$, and $y = x + 10$, respectively.

For the second condition to be true, both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies that $x = 8$ and $y = 8$ or $x = -8$ and $y = -8$. These four equations represent the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$, and $y = 8$ and $y = -8$, respectively.

Combining these results, the points $\left(x, y\right)$ that satisfy the equation are the intersections of these lines. These lines form a square with vertices at $\left(8, 8\right)$, $\left(8, -8\right)$, $\left(-8, -8\right)$, and $\left(-8, 8\right)$, and the side length of the square is $16$. The area of the square is therefore $16^2 = 256$.

[/asy]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Let $w$ be the width of each of the identical rectangles. Since $PQ=3w$, $RS=2x$ and $PQ=RS$ (because $PQRS$ is a rectangle), then $2x = 3w$, or $$w=\frac{2}{3}x.$$ Therefore, the area of each of the five identical rectangles is $$x\left(\frac{2}{3}x\right)=\frac{2}{3}x^2.$$ Since the area of $PQRS$ is 4000 and it is made up of five of these identical smaller rectangles, then $$5\left(\frac{2}{3}x^2\right)=4000$$ or $$\frac{10}{3}x^2 = 4000$$ or $x^2 = 1200$ or $x \approx 34.6$ which, when rounded off to the nearest integer, is $\boxed{35}.$ The answer is $\boxed{35}$

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


This problem is a bit tricky to solve directly. One way to simplify it is to analyze the terms separately.
The term $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ equals to $0$ when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which forms a square with side length $20$. The term $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ equals to $0$ when $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which forms another square with side length $20$. The term $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ equals to $0$ when $\vert x \vert = 8$, which forms a line segment along the x-axis with length $16$. The term $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2$ equals to $0$ when $\vert y \vert = 8$, which forms a line segment along the y-axis with length $16$. The intersection of these four lines forms a square with side length $16$. So, the area of the convex polygon is the area of the $20 \times 20$ square minus the area of the $16 \times 16$ square.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"An ellipse is defined parametrically by
\[(x,y) = \left( \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t}, \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t} \right).\]Then the equation of the ellipse can be written in the form
\[Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0,\]where $A,$ $B,$ $C,$ $D,$ $E,$ and $F$ are integers, and $\gcd(|A|,|B|,|C|,|D|,|E|,|F|) = 1.$  Find $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F|.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
In the equation $y = \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\cos t$ to get
\[\cos t = \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3}.\]In the equation $x = \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\sin t$ to get
\[\sin t = \frac{1}{2} x (2 - \cos t) + 1 = \frac{1}{2} x \left( 2 - \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right) + 1 = 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)}.\]Since $\cos^2 t + \sin^2 t = 1,$
\[\left( \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right)^2 + \left( 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)} \right)^2 = 1.\]Multiplying both sides by $(2(y + 3))^2$ and expanding, it will simplify to
\[81x^2 - 36xy + 16y^2 - 108x + 240y + 900 = 0.\]Therefore, $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F| = 81 + 36 + 16 + 108 + 240 + 900 = \boxed{1381}.$ The answer is $\boxed{1381}$

To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we can use the fact that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if and only if at least one of the following equations is satisfied:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$,
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first equation, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which imply that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of a square with side length 20: $(10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, $(-10, 0)$, and $(0, -10)$.

For the second equation, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which imply that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of a square with side length 16: $(8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, $(-8, 0)$, and $(0, -8)$.

Therefore, the points that satisfy the original equation enclose a convex polygon formed by the union of two squares: one with side length 20 and one with side length 16. The area of the square with side length 20 is $20^2 = 400$, and the area of the square with side length 16 is $16^2 = 256$. So, the total area of the convex polygon is $400 + 256 = 656$. The answer is: $656$

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We are given a math problem and we need to solve it.
2. The problem is to find the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points (x, y) that satisfy the equation: $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
3. If the product of two numbers is zero, then at least one of the numbers must be zero. So either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
4. If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length 10.
5. If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This forms a square with side length 16.
6. The convex polygon enclosed by the points (x, y) that satisfy the equation is the union of these two squares. The area of a square is the square of the length of its side, so the area of the first square is $10^2 = 100$ and the area of the second square is $16^2 = 256$.
7. The area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of these two squares: $100 + 256 = 356$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 356 square units.
The answer is: $356$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"An ellipse is defined parametrically by
\[(x,y) = \left( \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t}, \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t} \right).\]Then the equation of the ellipse can be written in the form

Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
In the equation $y = \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\cos t$ to get
\[\cos t = \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3}.\]In the equation $x = \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\sin t$ to get
\[\sin t = \frac{1}{2} x (2 - \cos t) + 1 = \frac{1}{2} x \left( 2 - \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right) + 1 = 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)}.\]Since $\cos^2 t + \sin^2 t = 1,$
\[\left( \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right)^2 + \left( 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)} \right)^2 = 1.\]Multiplying both sides by $(2(y + 3))^2$ and expanding, it will simplify to
\[81x^2 - 36xy + 16y^2 - 108x + 240y + 900 = 0.\]Therefore, $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F| = 81 + 36 + 16 + 108 + 240 + 900 = \boxed{1381}.$ The answer is $\boxed{1381}$

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


First, we need to analyze the given equation and the condition that the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy this equation enclose a convex polygon. The equation involves absolute values, so we need to consider the different cases for the absolute values. The absolute value $|a|$ is equal to $a$ if $a \geq 0$, and $-a$ if $a < 0$. Therefore, we can rewrite the absolute value expressions in the equation as follows:

- $\vert x + y \vert = x + y$ if $x + y \geq 0$, and $-x - y$ if $x + y < 0$.
- $\vert x - y \vert = x - y$ if $x - y \geq 0$, and $-x + y$ if $x - y < 0$.
- $\vert x \vert = x$ if $x \geq 0$, and $-x$ if $x < 0$.
- $\vert y \vert = y$ if $y \geq 0$, and $-y$ if $y < 0$.

The equation is satisfied if either of the following two conditions is true:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first condition, if $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which implies either $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$. Similarly, if $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies either $x = 8$ or $x = -8$, and either $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. Therefore, the points that satisfy this condition are the vertices of a square with side length $10$, centered at the origin $(0, 0)$. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

For the second condition, if $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies either $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$. Therefore, the points that satisfy this condition form a square with side length $10$, centered at the origin $(0, 0)$, which is the same square as in the first condition.

Therefore, the points that satisfy the given equation enclose a square with side length $10$. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_ 2= (-16,2).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that
\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as
\[\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1.\]Find $h + k + a + b.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$
