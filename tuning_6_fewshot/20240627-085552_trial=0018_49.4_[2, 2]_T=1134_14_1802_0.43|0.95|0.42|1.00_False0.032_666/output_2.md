Assistant:

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $2$. This is because the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a graph that is a series of V-shapes, with the $i$-th "valley" of the graph having a depth of $i$. Therefore, for $f(x) = \frac{m}{100}$, to have four distinct solutions, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be strictly between $1$ and $2$. This means $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which simplifies to $100 < m < 200$. The number of positive integers $m$ in this range is $200 - 100 - 1 = 99$. Therefore, there are $99$ positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions. The answer is: $99$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions, which means that $\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal to 2. So, we have $m = 200$.

However, we need to check if this value of $m$ actually gives us 4 distinct solutions. If we substitute $m = 200$ into the equation, we get $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{200}{100}=2$.

This equation simplifies to $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=2$.

Let's solve this step by step:

1. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 \geq 0$, then the equation becomes $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 2$, which simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = 4$. This gives us two solutions: $x = 5$ and $x = -3$.

2. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0$, then the equation becomes $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = 2$, which simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = 0$. This gives us one solution: $x = 1$.

So, for $m = 200$, we have 4 distinct solutions: $x = -3$, $x = 1$, $x = 5$.

Therefore, the value of $m$ that makes the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have 4 distinct solutions is $m = 200$. The answer is: $200$

Assistant:

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 1 and 2. This is because the expression on the left side of the equation is always between 1 and 3, and it equals 1 or 3 only at the endpoints of its range, and it equals 2 at exactly 4 points within its range. Therefore, we have $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which implies $100 < m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from 101 to 199, inclusive. To find the number of these integers, we subtract the smallest integer from the largest and add 1. So the number of positive integers $m$ is $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$. The answer is: $99$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"For certain ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ of real numbers, the system of equations
\[\begin{aligned} ax+by&=1 \\ x^2 + y^2 &= 50  \end{aligned}\]has at least one solution, and each solution is an ordered pair $(x,y)\,$ of integers. How many such ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ are there?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The graph of $ax+by=1$ is a line, while the graph of $x^2+y^2=50$ is a circle centered at the origin. Therefore, $(a, b)$ satisfies the conditions if and only if the line and circle intersect at least once, and they intersect only at lattice points (points with integer coordinates).

Knowing this, it makes sense to look for lattice points on the circle whose equation is $x^2+y^2=50$. Testing cases, we find that there are twelve lattice points on the circle: $(\pm 1, \pm 7)$, $(\pm 7, \pm 1)$, and $(\pm 5, \pm 5)$ (where the two $\pm$ signs in each pair are independent of each other).

There are $\tbinom{12}{2} = 66$ pairs of these points, and each pair determines a line. However, the graph of $ax+by=1$ can never pass through the origin $(0, 0)$, since if $x=y=0$, then $ax+by=0 \neq 1$. Therefore, the six pairs which consist of diametrically opposed points are invalid, since the line through them passes through the origin. This corrects our count to $66 - 6 = 60$.

In addition, for each of the twelve points, there is a line tangent to the circle at that point, so that the only solution to the system is that one point. This brings the final total to $60 + 12 = \boxed{72}$. The answer is $\boxed{72}$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many distinct solutions are there to the equation $|x-7| = |x+1|$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
If $|x-7| = |x+1|$, then either $x-7 = x+1$ or $x-7 = -(x+1)$.  Simplifying $x-7=x+1$ gives $0=8$, which has no solutions, so no values of $x$ satisfy $x-7 = x+1$.  If $x-7 = -(x+1)$, then $x-7 = -x-1$, so $2x = 6$, which gives $x=3$.  So, there is $\boxed{1}$ solution.

Challenge: See if you can find a quick solution to this problem by simply thinking about the graphs of $y=|x-7|$ and $y=|x+1|$. The answer is $\boxed{1}$
