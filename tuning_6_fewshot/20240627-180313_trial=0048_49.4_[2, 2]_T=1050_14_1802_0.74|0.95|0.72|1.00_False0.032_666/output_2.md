**Problem:** 
"For certain ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ of real numbers, the system of equations
\[\begin{aligned} ax+by&=1 \\ x^2 + y^2 &= 50  \end{aligned}\]has at least one solution, and each solution is an ordered pair $(x,y)\,$ of integers. How many such ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ are there?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The graph of $ax+by=1$ is a line, while the graph of $x^2+y^2=50$ is a circle centered at the origin. Therefore, $(a, b)$ satisfies the conditions if and only if the line and circle intersect at least once, and they intersect only at lattice points (points with integer coordinates).

Knowing this, it makes sense to look for lattice points on the circle whose equation is $x^2+y^2=50$. Testing cases, we find that there are twelve lattice points on the circle: $(\pm 1, \pm 7)$, $(\pm 7, \pm 1)$, and $(\pm 5, \pm 5)$ (where the two $\pm$ signs in each pair are independent of each other).

There are $\tbinom{12}{2} = 66$ pairs of these points, and each pair determines a line. However, the graph of $ax+by=1$ can never pass through the origin $(0, 0)$, since if $x=y=0$, then $ax+by=0 \neq 1$. Therefore, the six pairs which consist of diametrically opposed points are invalid, since the line through them passes through the origin. This corrects our count to $66 - 6 = 60$.

In addition, for each of the twelve points, there is a line tangent to the circle at that point, so that the only solution to the system is that one point. This brings the final total to $60 + 12 = \boxed{72}$. The answer is $\boxed{72}$

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. This is because the expression on the left side of the equation is a "V" shaped graph that intersects the x-axis at x=1 and x=3, and has a maximum value of 2. So for the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, the right side of the equation must equal 2. 

Therefore, we need to find the value of $m$ that makes $\frac{m}{100} = 2$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

def find_m():
    m = symbols('m')
    equation = Eq(m/100, 2)
    solution = solve(equation, m)
    return solution[0]

result = find_m()
print(result)
```

The value of $m$ that makes the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have 4 distinct solutions is 200. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{200}$.
The value of $m$ that makes the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have 4 distinct solutions is 200. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{200}$. The answer is $\boxed{200}$.

## QUESTION 2 - 5 
- TIME_SPENT : 481 secs

5_
**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many integers are solutions to the equation $$(x-2)^{(25-x^2)}=1?$$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
We need some basic facts from number theory: $a^0 = 1$ for any $a,$ $1^b = 1$ for any $b,$ and $(-1)^c = 1$ if $c$ is an even integer. Unless the base is a complex number (which is excluded since we are looking for integer solutions), there are no other ways to get an RHS of $1.$ Thus, either the exponent is zero $($giving the equation $25 - x^2 = 0),$ the base is $1$ $($giving $x -2 = 1),$ or the base is $-1$ and the exponent is even $($giving the simultaneous equations $x - 2 = -1$ and $25 - x^2 = 2n$ for some integer $n).$ Solving the first equation gives $x = \pm 5,$ and solving the second gives $x = 3.$ The third equation implies that $x = 1,$ in which case $25 - x^2 = 24$ is indeed even, so $x = 1$ is a valid solution. In all, there are $\boxed{4}$ integer solutions. The answer is $\boxed{4}$

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


For each $m$, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly four distinct solutions if and only if $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 3$. This is because the expression on the left side of the equation is always between $0$ and $3$ inclusive. So we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 3$. Multiplying all parts of the inequality by $100$ gives $0 < m < 300$. The number of positive integers in this range is $300 - 1 = 299$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has exactly four distinct solutions is $299$.

However, this answer is incorrect. The number of positive integers $m$ such that $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 3$ is the number of positive integers in the set $\{1, 2, ..., 299\}$. So the number of such integers is $299$.

**Note:** The condition $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 3$ is equivalent to $0 < m < 300$. However, the number of positive integers in the range $(0, 300)$ is $300 - 1 = 299$. The condition $0 < m \leq 299$ would be correct if we were considering the number of positive integers in the half-open interval $(0, 300]$. But since we are considering the number of positive integers in the open interval $(0, 300)$, the correct condition is $0 < m < 300$, and the number of positive integers in this range is $300 - 1 = 299$.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, we need to understand that the absolute value equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.
2. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be rewritten as two cases: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ or $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.
3. For each case, we need to solve the equation $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ respectively.
4. The absolute value equation $\vert x-1 \vert = a$ has two solutions: $x = 1 + a$ and $x = 1 - a$.
5. So, we need to solve the equations $1 + a = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, $1 + a = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, $1 - a = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, and $1 - a = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
6. Simplify these equations and we get $a = \frac{m}{100}$, $a = -\frac{m}{100}$, $a = 1 + \frac{m}{100}$, and $a = 1 - \frac{m}{100}$.
7. The only way for the absolute value equation $\vert x-1 \vert = a$ to have two distinct solutions is if $a > 0$.
8. Therefore, we have $\frac{m}{100} > 0$, $-\frac{m}{100} < 0$, $1 + \frac{m}{100} > 1$, and $1 - \frac{m}{100} < 1$.
9. Solving these inequalities, we get $m > 0$, $m < 0$, $m > -100$, and $m < 100$.
10. Combining these results, we find that $0 < m < 100$.
11. Now we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.
12. This is equivalent to finding the number of positive integers $m$ in the range $(0, 100)$.
13. The number of positive integers in this range is $100$.

So the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 100.
The answer is: $100$

The solutions for $x$ are $-1.01$, $-0.99$, $2.99$, and $3.01$. These are $4$ distinct solutions. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $1$. The answer is: $1$.

However, we need to check if the value of $m$ that we found actually gives us $4$ distinct solutions. Let's substitute $m=1$ into the equation and solve for $x$:

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let \[f(x) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
-x + 3 & \text{if } x \le 0, \\
2x - 5 & \text{if } x > 0.
\end{array}
\right.\]How many solutions does the equation $f(f(x)) = 4$ have?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
To solve the equation $f(f(x)) = 4,$ we first find the values $x$ such that $f(x) = 4.$

Either $f(x) = -x + 3$ (for $x \le 0$) or $f(x) = 2x - 5$ (for $x > 0$). If $-x + 3 = 4,$ then $x = -1.$ Note that this value satisfies $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = 4,$ then $x = 9/2.$ Note that this value satisfies $x > 0.$ Therefore, the solutions to $f(x) = 4$ are $x = -1$ and $x = 9/2.$

Next, we solve for the values $x$ such that $f(x) = -1.$ If $-x + 3 = -1,$ then $x = 4.$ This value does not satisfy $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = -1,$ then $x = 2.$ This value satisfies $x > 0.$

Finally, we solve for the values $x$ such that $f(x) = 9/2.$ If $-x + 3 = 9/2,$ then $x = -3/2.$ This value satisfies $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = 9/2,$ then $x = 19/4.$ This value satisfies $x > 0.$

Therefore, the equation $f(f(x)) = 4$ has the solutions $x = 2,$ $-3/2,$ and $19/4,$ for a total of $\boxed{3}$ solutions. The answer is $\boxed{3}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The equation $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. This is because the expression $| |x-1| - 2 |$ equals 2 twice: once when $|x-1| - 2 = 2$, which gives $|x-1| = 4$, or $x-1 = 4$ or $x-1 = -4$, or $x = 5$ or $x = -3$; and once when $-(|x-1| - 2) = 2$, which gives $|x-1| = 0$, or $x-1 = 0$, or $x = 1$. So, we want $m$ such that $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, or $m = 200$. The only positive integer satisfying this condition is $200$.
The answer is: $200$

**Problem:** 
"How many solutions does the equation \[\frac{(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)\dotsm(x-100)}{(x-1^2)(x-2^2)(x-3^2)\dotsm(x-100^2)} = 0\]have for $x$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Any solution to this equation must make the numerator of the left-hand side zero, while keeping the denominator non-zero. The numerator is zero when $x$ is one of the numbers $1, 2, 3, \dots, 100.$ However, for any value in this list that is a perfect square, the denominator will also be zero, so that value of $x$ will not be a root. Therefore, we want to find the number of integers in the list $1, 2, \dots, 100$ which are not perfect squares. The perfect squares in the list are $1^2, 2^2, \dots, 10^2,$ so there are $10$ perfect squares, and \[100 - 10 = \boxed{90}\]integers which are not perfect squares. The answer is $\boxed{90}$

## QUESTION 2 - 10 
- TIME_SPENT : 481 secs

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"For certain ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ of real numbers, the system of equations
\[\begin{aligned} ax+by&=1 \\ x^2 + y^2 &= 50  \end{aligned}\]has at least one solution, and each solution is an ordered pair $(x,y)\,$ of integers. How many such ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ are there?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The graph of $ax+by=1$ is a line, while the graph of $x^2+y^2=50$ is a circle centered at the origin. Therefore, $(a, b)$ satisfies the conditions if and only if the line and circle intersect at least once, and they intersect only at lattice points (points with integer coordinates).

Knowing this, it makes sense to look for lattice points on the circle whose equation is $x^2+y^2=50$. Testing cases, we find that there are twelve lattice points on the circle: $(\pm 1, \pm 7)$, $(\pm 7, \pm 1)$, and $(\pm 5, \pm 5)$ (where the two $\pm$ signs in each pair are independent of each other).

There are $\tbinom{12}{2} = 66$ pairs of these points, and each pair determines a line. However, the graph of $ax+by=1$ can never pass through the origin $(0, 0)$, since if $x=y=0$, then $ax+by=0 \neq 1$. Therefore, the six pairs which consist of diametrically opposed points are invalid, since the line through them passes through the origin. This corrects our count to $66 - 6 = 60$.

In addition, for each of the twelve points, there is a line tangent to the circle at that point, so that the only solution to the system is that one point. This brings the final total to $60 + 12 = \boxed{72}$. The answer is $\boxed{72}$

**Solution:** 



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 1$. This is because the expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ takes on the values 0, 1, 2 in a repeating pattern, and we want it to be equal to 1.

So we need to solve the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = 1$.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = 1$ is equivalent to two cases:

1. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 1$, which simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = 3$. This gives two equations: $x-1 = 3$ and $x-1 = -3$. Solving these gives $x = 4$ and $x = -2$.
2. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -1$, which simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = 1$. This gives two equations: $x-1 = 1$ and $x-1 = -1$. Solving these gives $x = 2$ and $x = 0$.

So the four distinct solutions are $-2, 0, 2, 4$. 

Therefore, the value of $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is $m = 100$.
The answer is: $1$

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**



The equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $0$ and $2$. This is because the function $| |x-1|-2|$ has a graph with a shape of a "V" with the vertex at $(1,2)$. The distance between the two "arms" of the "V" is $2$, and the "V" opens upwards. So, for the equation to have $4$ distinct solutions, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be strictly between $0$ and $2$.

This means $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, and multiplying all sides of the inequalities by $100$ gives $0 < m < 200$.

The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are exactly the integers from $1$ to $199$. However, we need to exclude the values of $m$ that make the equation have only $3$ distinct solutions.

The equation has $3$ distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ equals either $0$ or $2$. This happens when $m=0$ or $m=200$. But $m$ cannot be $0$, so $m=200$ is the only invalid value of $m$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that make the equation have $4$ distinct solutions is $199 - 1 = 198$. The answer is: $198$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many distinct solutions are there to the equation $|x-7| = |x+1|$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
If $|x-7| = |x+1|$, then either $x-7 = x+1$ or $x-7 = -(x+1)$.  Simplifying $x-7=x+1$ gives $0=8$, which has no solutions, so no values of $x$ satisfy $x-7 = x+1$.  If $x-7 = -(x+1)$, then $x-7 = -x-1$, so $2x = 6$, which gives $x=3$.  So, there is $\boxed{1}$ solution.

Challenge: See if you can find a quick solution to this problem by simply thinking about the graphs of $y=|x-7|$ and $y=|x+1|$. The answer is $\boxed{1}$
