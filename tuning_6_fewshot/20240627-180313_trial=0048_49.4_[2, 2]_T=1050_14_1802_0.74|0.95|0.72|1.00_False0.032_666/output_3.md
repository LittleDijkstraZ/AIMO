**Problem:** 
"Let $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_ 2= (-16,2).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that
\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as
\[\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1.\]Find $h + k + a + b.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Find the number of 10-tuples $(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{10})$ of real numbers such that
\[(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2 = \frac{1}{11}.\]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,
\begin{align*}
&[(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + \dots + 1^2 + 1^2)][(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2] \\
&\ge [(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + (x_2 - x_3) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10}]^2 = 1.
\end{align*}From the given condition, we have equality, so by the equality condition for Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[\frac{1 - x_1}{1} = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{1} = \frac{x_2 - x_3}{1} = \dots = \frac{x_9 - x_{10}}{1} = \frac{x_{10}}{1}.\]Let
\[d = 1 - x_1 = x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_3 = \dots = x_9 - x_{10} = x_{10}.\]Then
\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so
\[(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_{10}) = \left( \frac{10}{11}, \frac{9}{11}, \frac{8}{11}, \dots, \frac{1}{11} \right).\]In particular, there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.

The first expression is zero when $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. These equations simplify to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two lines that pass through the origin and have slopes $+1$ and $-1$. The region enclosed by these lines is a square with side length 20.

The second expression is zero when $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. These equations simplify to $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two lines that pass through the origin and have slopes $+1$ and $-1$. The region enclosed by these lines is a square with side length 16.

The intersection of the two regions is the square with side length 8, which is the smaller square. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of the larger square minus the area of the smaller square.

The area of a square is the square of the length of its side. Therefore, the area of the larger square is $20^2 = 400$, and the area of the smaller square is $8^2 = 64$. So the area of the convex polygon is $400 - 64 = 336$.

**Solution:** 



First, we need to understand the problem. The equation given is a product of two expressions squared, which means that either of the expressions must be zero for the entire equation to be zero. This gives us four conditions to consider:

1. $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x - y| - 10 = 0$.
2. $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x| - 8 = 0$.
3. $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ and $|y| - 8 = 0$.
4. $|x - y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x| - 8 = 0$.
5. $|x - y| - 10 = 0$ and $|y| - 8 = 0$.
6. $|x| - 8 = 0$ and $|y| - 8 = 0$.

For each condition, we can solve the absolute value equations to find the possible values of $x$ and $y$. Then, we can plot these points on a coordinate plane and connect them to form the polygon.

After plotting the points and connecting them, we find that the polygon is a square with side length 16. The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side, so the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

**Problem:** 
"Five identical rectangles are arranged to form a larger rectangle $PQRS$, as shown.  The area of $PQRS$ is $4000$.  What is the length, $x$, rounded off to the nearest integer? [asy]
real x = 1; real w = 2/3;

// Draw outer square and labels

draw((-0.1 - 0.03, w)--(-0.1 + 0.03, w));

pair left = (0, -0.1); pair right = (x, -0.1);
draw((0, -0.1 + 0.03)--(0, -0.1 - 0.03));
draw((x, -0.1 - 0.03)--(x, -0.1 + 0.03));
draw(left--right);
label("$x$", (x/2, -0.1), S);

[/asy]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Let $w$ be the width of each of the identical rectangles. Since $PQ=3w$, $RS=2x$ and $PQ=RS$ (because $PQRS$ is a rectangle), then $2x = 3w$, or $$w=\frac{2}{3}x.$$ Therefore, the area of each of the five identical rectangles is $$x\left(\frac{2}{3}x\right)=\frac{2}{3}x^2.$$ Since the area of $PQRS$ is 4000 and it is made up of five of these identical smaller rectangles, then $$5\left(\frac{2}{3}x^2\right)=4000$$ or $$\frac{10}{3}x^2 = 4000$$ or $x^2 = 1200$ or $x \approx 34.6$ which, when rounded off to the nearest integer, is $\boxed{35}.$ The answer is $\boxed{35}$

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These equations are satisfied only if $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$. The first system of equations gives $x = 10$ and $y = 0$, and the second system gives $x = -10$ and $y = 0$.

Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = 8$ or $x = -8$ and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

So the points that satisfy the equation are $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$. These points form a square with side length 20. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 400.
The answer is: $400$

**Solution:** 



First, let's understand the problem. The equation is given as $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. We are asked to find the area of the polygon enclosed by the points that satisfy this equation.

The equation equals to zero when either of the two factors equals to zero. The first factor equals to zero when $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, and the second factor equals to zero when $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.

Let's solve these equations step by step:

1. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
2. $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$ implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
3. $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ implies $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
4. $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$ implies $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

The eight lines above define the boundaries of the polygon. By graphing these lines, we can find the vertices of the polygon. The vertices are the points where the lines intersect. There are 8 vertices in total: (8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8), (10, 0), (-10, 0), (0, 10), and (0, -10).

The polygon is a square with side length 16 units. The area of a square is the side length squared, so the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $\boxed{256}$
