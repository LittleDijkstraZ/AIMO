Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.

The first term is zero when either $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x-y| - 10 = 0$, which simplifies to $|x+y| = 10$ or $|x-y| = 10$. These are the equations of two lines passing through the origin with slopes 1 and -1.

The second term is zero when either $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$, which simplifies to $|x| = 8$ or $|y| = 8$. These are the equations of two lines parallel to the y-axis at x = 8 and x = -8, and two lines parallel to the x-axis at y = 8 and y = -8.

The intersection points of these lines are the vertices of the polygon: (8,8), (8,-8), (-8,8), and (-8,-8).

The polygon is a square with side length 16, so its area is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many square units are in the area of the triangle whose vertices are the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the curve $y = (x-3)^2 (x+2)$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we need to find where this curve intersects the $x$ and $y$ axes.  If $y=0$, then $(x-3)^2(x+2)=0$, which has solutions of $x=3$ and $x=-2$.  If $x=0$, then $y=(-3)^2(2)=18$.  So, the curve has two $x$-intercepts and one $y$-intercept.  The length of the base along the $x$-axis is $3-(-2)=5$.  The height from this base is equal to the $y$-intercept, 18.  The area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 5\cdot 18=\boxed{45}$. The answer is $\boxed{45}$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.

2. Let's denote the first term as $A = ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$ and the second term as $B = ((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$.

3. If $A = 0$, then $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle.

4. If $B = 0$, then $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines also form a rectangle.

5. The intersection of the two rectangles is the convex polygon we are looking for. The vertices of this polygon are the points where the lines intersect. There are 4 vertices: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

6. To find the area of the rectangle, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle, which is length times width. The length of the rectangle is the distance between the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$, which is 16. The width of the rectangle is the distance between the lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$, which is also 16. So the area of the rectangle is $16 \times 16 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. This gives us two systems of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

2. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first system, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us the vertices of the square with side length 10, centered at $(0, 0)$.

For the second system, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us the vertices of the square with side length 10, centered at $(0, 0)$.

So the points satisfying the equation enclose a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

The answer is: $100$
