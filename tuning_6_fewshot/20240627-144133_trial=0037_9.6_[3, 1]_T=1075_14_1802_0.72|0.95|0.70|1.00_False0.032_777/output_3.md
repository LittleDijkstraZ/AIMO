**Problem:** 
"Let $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_ 2= (-16,2).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that
\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as
\[\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1.\]Find $h + k + a + b.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The equation given in the problem, $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$, is satisfied only when either of the two factors is zero. This happens when either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The first equation is satisfied only when both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of a square with side length 10 and diagonals of length $10\sqrt{2}$.

The second equation is satisfied only when both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of a square with side length 8 and diagonals of length $8\sqrt{2}$.

The two squares intersect at the origin $(0,0)$ and at the points $(\pm 6, \pm 6)$. The area of the convex polygon formed by the union of these two squares is the sum of the areas of the two squares minus the area of the square formed by the intersection.

The area of a square with side length $a$ is $a^2$. Therefore, the area of the larger square is $(10)^2 = 100$, and the area of the smaller square is $(8)^2 = 64$. The area of the intersection square is $(6)^2 = 36$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $100 + 64 - 36 = 128$.

The answer is $\boxed{128}$.

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


This problem seems to be a bit complicated to solve directly. However, we can simplify it by breaking it down into smaller steps.

First, we need to understand that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

Each of these equations implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$. The last two equations imply that $x = \pm 8$ or $y = \pm 8$.

The first two equations can be rewritten as $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations for $x$ and $y$, we get the following four pairs of $(x, y)$: $(1, 9)$, $(1, -9)$, $(-1, 9)$, and $(-1, -9)$.

Similarly, the equation $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ can be rewritten as $x + y = \pm 10$. Solving for $y$, we get $y = \pm 10 - x$. Substituting $x = 8$ or $x = -8$ into these equations, we get the following four pairs of $(x, y)$: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -18)$, $(-8, 18)$, and $(-8, -2)$.

Plotting these points on a coordinate plane, we can see that they form a square with side length $20$. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $400$.

```python

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The equation $AB=0$ implies that either $A=0$ or $B=0$. Therefore, the given equation is satisfied if either of the following two conditions holds:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first condition to hold, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us four lines in the coordinate plane: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

For the second condition to hold, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us four lines in the coordinate plane: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The points satisfying the given equation are the intersections of these lines. These lines enclose a rectangle with side lengths 16 and 20. The area of this rectangle is $16 \times 20 = 320$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 320 square units. The answer is: $320$

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We are given the equation: $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
2. For the product of two factors to be zero, either one or both factors must be zero. So, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
3. If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. These equations give us the lines $y = -x \pm 10$ and $y = x \pm 10$.
4. If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. These equations give us the lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
5. The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 16.
6. To find the area of this square, we simply square the length of one of its sides: $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

**Solution:** 



The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, which means either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. So we need to solve the equations:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From the first two equations, we get $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
From the third and fourth equations, we get $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The solutions to these equations are:

1. For $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, we have $x + y = \pm 10$.
2. For $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, we have $x - y = \pm 10$.
3. For $\vert x \vert = 8$, we have $x = \pm 8$.
4. For $\vert y \vert = 8$, we have $y = \pm 8$.

Now we can plot these points and lines on a coordinate plane and find the vertices of the polygon. The polygon is a square with side length 16. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256.

The answer is: $256$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Find the number of 10-tuples $(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{10})$ of real numbers such that
\[(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2 = \frac{1}{11}.\]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,
\begin{align*}
&[(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + \dots + 1^2 + 1^2)][(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2] \\
&\ge [(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + (x_2 - x_3) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10}]^2 = 1.
\end{align*}From the given condition, we have equality, so by the equality condition for Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[\frac{1 - x_1}{1} = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{1} = \frac{x_2 - x_3}{1} = \dots = \frac{x_9 - x_{10}}{1} = \frac{x_{10}}{1}.\]Let
\[d = 1 - x_1 = x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_3 = \dots = x_9 - x_{10} = x_{10}.\]Then
\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so
\[(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_{10}) = \left( \frac{10}{11}, \frac{9}{11}, \frac{8}{11}, \dots, \frac{1}{11} \right).\]In particular, there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Solution:** 


The area of the convex polygon formed by the set of points $(x, y)$ satisfying the given equation can be found by calculating the area of the two rectangles that are formed by the intersection of the four lines defined by the absolute value expressions.

The absolute value expressions $|x+y| = 10$, $|x-y| = 10$, $|x| = 8$, and $|y| = 8$ define the lines $x+y = \pm10$, $x-y = \pm10$, $x = \pm8$, and $y = \pm8$. These lines intersect to form four right triangles, and the convex polygon is the union of the interiors of these triangles.

The lines $x+y = 10$ and $x+y = -10$ are parallel, and they are each 20 units apart (since the difference of their $y$-intercepts is 20). Similarly, the lines $x-y = 10$ and $x-y = -10$ are parallel and are each 20 units apart. The lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$ are parallel, and they are each 16 units apart. Similarly, the lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$ are parallel and are each 16 units apart.

The intersection points of the lines can be found by solving the equations:
- For the lines $x+y = 10$ and $x-y = 10$, we have $x = 5$ and $y = 5$.
- For the lines $x+y = 10$ and $x-y = -10$, we have $x = -5$ and $y = -5$.
- For the lines $x+y = -10$ and $x-y = 10$, we have $x = -5$ and $y = 5$.
- For the lines $x+y = -10$ and $x-y = -10$, we have $x = 5$ and $y = -5$.

The four right triangles formed by the lines have vertices at the intersection points. The side lengths of the triangles are the distances between the lines, so the side lengths are 20 units, 16 units, and $\sqrt{16^2 + 20^2} = 24$ units (by the Pythagorean theorem).

The area of a right triangle is $\frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}$. The area of each triangle is $\frac{1}{2} \times 16 \times 20 = 160$ square units. Since there are four triangles, the total area of the convex polygon is $4 \times 160 = 640$ square units.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 640 square units. The answer is: $640$

Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The expression equals zero if and only if both factors equal zero. So we have two sets of equations to solve: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

2. From $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, so $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.

3. From $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert x \vert = 8$, so $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.

4. Similarly, we get $y = 10 - x$ or $y = -10 - x$ from $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$, and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$ from $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.

5. Plot these equations in a coordinate plane, and we find that they form a square with side length 16.

6. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256.

    eq2 = Eq(Abs(x) - 8, 0)

    # Solve the equations
    solutions1 = solve(eq1, y)
    solutions2 = solve(eq2, x)

    # Calculate the side length of the square
    side_length = max(solutions2[0] - solutions1[0].subs(x, solutions2[0]), solutions2[1] - solutions1[1].subs(x, solutions2[1]))

    # Calculate the area of the square
    area = side_length**2

    return area

result = find_area_of_polygon()
print(result)

It seems there was a mistake in my previous approach. Let's try a different approach.

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on a square with side length 20. The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means that the square is centered at the origin and has side length 16 (since the side length of the square is 20 - 2 * 8 = 16).

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$
