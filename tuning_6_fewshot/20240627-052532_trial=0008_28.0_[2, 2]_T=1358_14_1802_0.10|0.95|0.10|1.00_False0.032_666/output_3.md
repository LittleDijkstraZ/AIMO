Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The expression $A = ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ equals to zero if and only if at least one of the following conditions is met:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

From the first condition, we have four cases to consider:

1. $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$. Solving this system of equations gives $x = 10$ and $y = 0$.
2. $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$. Solving this system of equations gives $x = 0$ and $y = 10$.
3. $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$. Solving this system of equations gives $x = 0$ and $y = -10$.
4. $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$. Solving this system of equations gives $x = -10$ and $y = 0$.

From the second condition, we have four more cases to consider:

5. $x = 8$ and $y = 8$.
6. $x = 8$ and $y = -8$.
7. $x = -8$ and $y = 8$.
8. $x = -8$ and $y = -8$.

So, the eight points that satisfy the equation are $(10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$. These points form a square with side length $20$. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $400$.

The entire script to solve this problem is as follows:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solve

def area_of_polygon():
    # Define the variables
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # The expression A equals to zero if and only if at least one of the following conditions is met:
    # 1. (|x + y| - 10)^2 = 0 or (|x - y| - 10)^2 = 0. This implies that |x + y| = 10 and |x - y| = 10.
    # 2. (|x| - 8)^2 = 0 or (|y| - 8)^2 = 0. This implies that |x| = 8 and |y| = 8.

    # From the first condition, we have four cases to consider:
    # 1. x + y = 10 and x - y = 10. Solving this system of equations gives x = 10 and y = 0.
    # 2. x + y = 10 and x - y = -10. Solving this system of equations gives x = 0 and y = 10.
    # 3. x + y = -10 and x - y = 10. Solving this system of equations gives x = 0 and y = -10.
    # 4. x + y = -10 and x - y = -10. Solving this system of equations gives x = -10 and y = 0.

    # From the second condition, we have four more cases to consider:
    # 5. x = 8 and y = 8.
    # 6. x = 8 and y = -8.
    # 7. x = -8 and y = 8.
    # 8. x = -8 and y = -8.

    # The eight points that satisfy the equation are (10, 0), (0, 10), (0, -10), (-10, 0), (8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), and (-8, -8).
    # These points form a square with side length 20. The area of this square is 20^2 = 400.

    return 400

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.

2. Each term is a square of a difference of absolute values. This means that each term will be zero if and only if the difference of absolute values is zero.

3. The difference of absolute values is zero if and only if the absolute values are equal. This means that we have four systems of equations to solve:

   a) $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$.
   
   b) $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$.
   
   c) $|x - y| = 10$ and $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$.
   
   d) $|x - y| = 10$ and $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$.

4. Each of these systems of equations can be solved using the properties of absolute values. For example, in system a), $|x + y| = 10$ implies that $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$. Similarly, $|x| = 8$ implies that $x = 8$ or $x = -8$, and $|y| = 8$ implies that $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. By solving these systems of equations, we find the vertices of the polygon.

5. Once we have the vertices of the polygon, we can calculate its area using the shoelace formula or other methods.

Now, let's write a Python script to solve this problem:

```python

from sympy import symbols, Abs, solveset, S

def calculate_area():
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # Solve the systems of equations
    solutions = []
    solutions.extend(solveset(Abs(x + y) - 10, (x, y), domain=S.Reals))
    solutions.extend(solveset(Abs(x + y) - 10, (x, y), domain=S.Reals))
    solutions.extend(solveset(Abs(x - y) - 10, (x, y), domain=S.Reals))
    solutions.extend(solveset(Abs(x - y) - 10, (x, y), domain=S.Reals))

    # Calculate the area of the polygon
    area = 0
    for i in range(len(solutions)):
        for j in range(len(solutions)):
            if i != j:
                area += (solutions[i][0] * solutions[j][1] - solutions[j][0] * solutions[i][1]) / 2

    return abs(area)

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Find the number of 10-tuples $(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{10})$ of real numbers such that
\[(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2 = \frac{1}{11}.\]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,
\begin{align*}
&[(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + \dots + 1^2 + 1^2)][(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2] \\
&\ge [(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + (x_2 - x_3) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10}]^2 = 1.
\end{align*}From the given condition, we have equality, so by the equality condition for Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[\frac{1 - x_1}{1} = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{1} = \frac{x_2 - x_3}{1} = \dots = \frac{x_9 - x_{10}}{1} = \frac{x_{10}}{1}.\]Let
\[d = 1 - x_1 = x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_3 = \dots = x_9 - x_{10} = x_{10}.\]Then
\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so
\[(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_{10}) = \left( \frac{10}{11}, \frac{9}{11}, \frac{8}{11}, \dots, \frac{1}{11} \right).\]In particular, there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. 

Let's consider the first expression: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This expression is equal to zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ or their opposites $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length 10.

Now let's consider the second expression: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This expression is equal to zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$ or their opposites $y = 8$ and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length 16.

The intersection of the two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for. The side length of this square is the smaller of the two side lengths, which is 10. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $10^2 = 100$.

The answer is: $100$

The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

The first term is zero when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two circles with radius 10 centered at $(0,0)$ and $(0,0)$ respectively.

The second term is zero when $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two circles with radius 8 centered at $(0,0)$ and $(0,0)$ respectively.

The intersection of these four circles forms a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

Let's consider the first term:
\[(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \implies \vert x + y \vert = 10 \implies x + y = \pm 10.\]
Similarly, for the second term:
\[(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \implies \vert x - y \vert = 10 \implies x - y = \pm 10.\]
These four equations represent the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. The intersection points of these lines are the vertices of the polygon.

The vertices are $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$. These points form a square with side length 16. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, which means that either of the terms must be zero. This gives us two sets of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first set of equations, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the first set of lines: $(5,5), (5,-5), (-5,5), (-5,-5)$.

For the second set of equations, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the second set of lines: $(8,0), (-8,0), (0,8), (0,-8)$.

The points that satisfy both sets of equations are the vertices of the convex polygon. These vertices are the intersections of the lines $x + y = \pm 10$, $x - y = \pm 10$, $x = \pm 8$, and $y = \pm 8$. By plotting these lines on a graph, we can see that the convex polygon is a square with side length 10.

The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side, so the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Find the number of 10-tuples $(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{10})$ of real numbers such that
\[(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2 = \frac{1}{11}.\]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,
\begin{align*}
&[(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + \dots + 1^2 + 1^2)][(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2] \\
&\ge [(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + (x_2 - x_3) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10}]^2 = 1.
\end{align*}From the given condition, we have equality, so by the equality condition for Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[\frac{1 - x_1}{1} = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{1} = \frac{x_2 - x_3}{1} = \dots = \frac{x_9 - x_{10}}{1} = \frac{x_{10}}{1}.\]Let
\[d = 1 - x_1 = x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_3 = \dots = x_9 - x_{10} = x_{10}.\]Then
\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so
\[(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_{10}) = \left( \frac{10}{11}, \frac{9}{11}, \frac{8}{11}, \dots, \frac{1}{11} \right).\]In particular, there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

The first term is zero when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These two equations represent two lines in the plane, and their intersection forms a square with side length 20.

The second term is zero when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These two equations also represent two lines in the plane, and their intersection forms a square with side length 16.

The convex polygon formed by the intersection of these two squares is the union of the two squares. To find its area, we simply add the areas of the two squares.

The area of a square is given by the square of its side length. So the area of the first square is $20^2 = 400$, and the area of the second square is $16^2 = 256$. Adding these two areas gives the total area of the convex polygon: $400 + 256 = 656$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 656. The answer is: $656$

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, which means that either of the terms must be zero for the entire expression to be zero. Therefore, we have two sets of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first set of equations, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, and $(-10, 0)$.

For the second set of equations, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The polygon formed by these vertices is a square with side length 10. The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side, so the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100.
