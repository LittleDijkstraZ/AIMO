**Problem:** 
"How many square units are in the area of the triangle whose vertices are the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the curve $y = (x-3)^2 (x+2)$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we need to find where this curve intersects the $x$ and $y$ axes.  If $y=0$, then $(x-3)^2(x+2)=0$, which has solutions of $x=3$ and $x=-2$.  If $x=0$, then $y=(-3)^2(2)=18$.  So, the curve has two $x$-intercepts and one $y$-intercept.  The length of the base along the $x$-axis is $3-(-2)=5$.  The height from this base is equal to the $y$-intercept, 18.  The area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 5\cdot 18=\boxed{45}$. The answer is $\boxed{45}$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Find the number of 10-tuples $(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{10})$ of real numbers such that
\[(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2 = \frac{1}{11}.\]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,
\begin{align*}
&[(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + \dots + 1^2 + 1^2)][(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2] \\
&\ge [(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + (x_2 - x_3) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10}]^2 = 1.
\end{align*}From the given condition, we have equality, so by the equality condition for Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[\frac{1 - x_1}{1} = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{1} = \frac{x_2 - x_3}{1} = \dots = \frac{x_9 - x_{10}}{1} = \frac{x_{10}}{1}.\]Let
\[d = 1 - x_1 = x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_3 = \dots = x_9 - x_{10} = x_{10}.\]Then
\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so
\[(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_{10}) = \left( \frac{10}{11}, \frac{9}{11}, \frac{8}{11}, \dots, \frac{1}{11} \right).\]In particular, there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. For the product of two numbers to be zero, one of the numbers must be zero. Therefore, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives the vertices of a square with side length $20$.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So we get another square with side length $16$.

The total area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of these two squares. The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of the larger square is $20^2 = 400$ and the area of the smaller square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the total area of the convex polygon is $400 + 256 = 656$.
The answer is: $656$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_ 2= (-16,2).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that
\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as
\[\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1.\]Find $h + k + a + b.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. 

The first expression is zero when either $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x-y| - 10 = 0$. This implies that either $|x+y| = 10$ or $|x-y| = 10$. The absolute value equations $|x+y| = 10$ and $|x-y| = 10$ represent lines in the coordinate plane. The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 20. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.

The second expression is zero when either $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$. This implies that either $|x| = 8$ or $|y| = 8$. The absolute value equations $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$ represent lines in the coordinate plane. The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

Since the two squares overlap, the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points that satisfy the equation is the sum of the areas of the two squares minus the area of the overlapping region. The overlapping region is also a square, but with side length 8 (the intersection of the two squares with side lengths 20 and 16). The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$.

So the area of the convex polygon is $(400 + 256 - 64) = 592$.

    # Area of the first square
    area_square1 = 20**2

    # Area of the second square
    area_square2 = 16**2

    # Area of the overlapping square
    area_overlap = 8**2

    # Area of the convex polygon
    area_polygon = area_square1 + area_square2 - area_overlap

## QUESTION 3 - 6

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"An ellipse is defined parametrically by
\[(x,y) = \left( \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t}, \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t} \right).\]Then the equation of the ellipse can be written in the form
\[Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0,\]where $A,$ $B,$ $C,$ $D,$ $E,$ and $F$ are integers, and $\gcd(|A|,|B|,|C|,|D|,|E|,|F|) = 1.$  Find $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F|.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
In the equation $y = \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\cos t$ to get
\[\cos t = \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3}.\]In the equation $x = \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\sin t$ to get
\[\sin t = \frac{1}{2} x (2 - \cos t) + 1 = \frac{1}{2} x \left( 2 - \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right) + 1 = 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)}.\]Since $\cos^2 t + \sin^2 t = 1,$
\[\left( \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right)^2 + \left( 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)} \right)^2 = 1.\]Multiplying both sides by $(2(y + 3))^2$ and expanding, it will simplify to
\[81x^2 - 36xy + 16y^2 - 108x + 240y + 900 = 0.\]Therefore, $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F| = 81 + 36 + 16 + 108 + 240 + 900 = \boxed{1381}.$ The answer is $\boxed{1381}$

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is true if and only if at least one of the factors is zero.
The factor $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ is true if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$, which gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.
The factor $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ is true if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$, giving us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.
The intersection of these lines is a square with side length 16, so the area of the convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is $\boxed{256}$.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

The first term is zero when $|\pm x \pm y - 10| = 0$ and $|\pm x| - 8 = 0$ and $|\pm y| - 8 = 0$. This gives us the four lines $x + y = 10$, $x - y = 10$, $x = \pm 8$, and $y = \pm 8$. The intersections of these lines form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

The second term is zero when $|\pm x + y - 10| = 0$ and $|\pm x - y - 10| = 0$ and $|\pm x| - 8 = 0$ and $|\pm y| - 8 = 0$. This gives us the same four lines as before. The intersections of these lines also form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is also $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares, which is $100 + 100 = 200$.
