**Example**

**Problem:** 
"For certain ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ of real numbers, the system of equations
\[\begin{aligned} ax+by&=1 \\ x^2 + y^2 &= 50  \end{aligned}\]has at least one solution, and each solution is an ordered pair $(x,y)\,$ of integers. How many such ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ are there?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The graph of $ax+by=1$ is a line, while the graph of $x^2+y^2=50$ is a circle centered at the origin. Therefore, $(a, b)$ satisfies the conditions if and only if the line and circle intersect at least once, and they intersect only at lattice points (points with integer coordinates).

Knowing this, it makes sense to look for lattice points on the circle whose equation is $x^2+y^2=50$. Testing cases, we find that there are twelve lattice points on the circle: $(\pm 1, \pm 7)$, $(\pm 7, \pm 1)$, and $(\pm 5, \pm 5)$ (where the two $\pm$ signs in each pair are independent of each other).

There are $\tbinom{12}{2} = 66$ pairs of these points, and each pair determines a line. However, the graph of $ax+by=1$ can never pass through the origin $(0, 0)$, since if $x=y=0$, then $ax+by=0 \neq 1$. Therefore, the six pairs which consist of diametrically opposed points are invalid, since the line through them passes through the origin. This corrects our count to $66 - 6 = 60$.

In addition, for each of the twelve points, there is a line tangent to the circle at that point, so that the only solution to the system is that one point. This brings the final total to $60 + 12 = \boxed{72}$. The answer is $\boxed{72}$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many integers are solutions to the equation $$(x-2)^{(25-x^2)}=1?$$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
We need some basic facts from number theory: $a^0 = 1$ for any $a,$ $1^b = 1$ for any $b,$ and $(-1)^c = 1$ if $c$ is an even integer. Unless the base is a complex number (which is excluded since we are looking for integer solutions), there are no other ways to get an RHS of $1.$ Thus, either the exponent is zero $($giving the equation $25 - x^2 = 0),$ the base is $1$ $($giving $x -2 = 1),$ or the base is $-1$ and the exponent is even $($giving the simultaneous equations $x - 2 = -1$ and $25 - x^2 = 2n$ for some integer $n).$ Solving the first equation gives $x = \pm 5,$ and solving the second gives $x = 3.$ The third equation implies that $x = 1,$ in which case $25 - x^2 = 24$ is indeed even, so $x = 1$ is a valid solution. In all, there are $\boxed{4}$ integer solutions. The answer is $\boxed{4}$

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



The problem asks for how many positive integers $m$ the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. 

To solve this problem, we can use the property of absolute value function. The function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ will be equal to $\frac{m}{100}$ at four different points if and only if $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ oscillates between $0$ and $4$, and we want it to be equal to $\frac{m}{100}$ at exactly $4$ points.

So we have $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which simplifies to $0 < m < 200$. The number of positive integers in this range is $199$.

However, we need to check if each of these values of $m$ actually gives us $4$ distinct solutions. We can do this by solving the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ for each value of $m$ and checking the number of solutions.

This is a complex task and requires a computer program to perform. We can use Python and the `sympy` library to do this. The following Python code will solve the problem:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solve, Abs

def count_solutions():
    x = symbols('x')
    m_values = range(1, 200)
    count = 0

    for m in m_values:
        equation = Abs(Abs(x - 1) - 2) - m / 100
        solutions = solve(equation, x)
        if len(solutions) == 4:
            count += 1

    return count

result = count_solutions()
print(result)
```

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The number of solutions of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to the number of times the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ intersects the horizontal line $y = \frac{m}{100}$.
The function $f(x)$ is a piecewise function with four cases:
1. If $x < 1$, then $f(x) = \vert -(x-1) - 2 \vert = \vert -x + 1 - 2 \vert = \vert -x - 1 \vert = x + 1 + 2 = x + 3$.
2. If $1 \leq x < 3$, then $f(x) = \vert x - 1 - 2 \vert = \vert x - 3 \vert = 3 - x$.
3. If $3 \leq x < 5$, then $f(x) = \vert x - 1 - 2 \vert = \vert x - 3 \vert = x - 3$.
4. If $x \geq 5$, then $f(x) = \vert x - 1 - 2 \vert = \vert x - 3 \vert = x - 3 - 2 = x - 5$.
The function $f(x)$ is a V-shaped graph with vertices at $x = 1$, $x = 3$, and $x = 5$. The line $y = \frac{m}{100}$ intersects the graph at four distinct points if and only if $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. This is because the maximum value of $f(x)$ is $2$ (at $x = 3$), and the minimum value is $0$ (at $x = 1$ and $x = 5$). Therefore, $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$ if and only if $0 < m < 200$. The number of positive integers $m$ in the interval $(0, 200)$ is $199$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $199$. The answer is: $199$

We will use the property of absolute value function to solve this problem. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $2$. Therefore, we have $m=200$.

So the positive integer $m$ that satisfies the equation is $200$. The answer is $\boxed{200}$.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We are given the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ and we want to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions.

2. We know that the expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a piecewise function with 4 cases. The function will be equal to:
   - $-(x-1)+2$ when $x<1$,
   - $(x-1)-2$ when $1 \leq x < 3$,
   - $-(x-1)-2$ when $x \geq 3$.

3. Thus, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to the absolute difference between the slopes of the piecewise function at the transition points.

4. The slopes of the piecewise function at the transition points are:
   - $1$ at $x=1$,
   - $-1$ at $x=3$.

5. Therefore, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal to $1 - (-1) = 2$.

6. Solving for $m$ gives $m = 200$.

So, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions, and that is $m = 200$. The answer is: $1$
