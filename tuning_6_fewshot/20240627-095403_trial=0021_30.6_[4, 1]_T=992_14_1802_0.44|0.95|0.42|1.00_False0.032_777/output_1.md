**Problem:** 
"What is the minimum value of the expression $x^2+y^2+2x-4y+8$ for real $x$ and $y$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Rearranging the expression, we have  \[x^2+2x+y^2-4y+8\]Completing the square in $x$, we need to add and subtract $(2/2)^2=1$. Completing the square in $y$, we need to add and subtract $(4/2)^2=4$. Thus, we have \[(x^2+2x+1)-1+(y^2-4y+4)-4+8 \Rightarrow (x+1)^2+(y-2)^2+3\]Since the minimum value of $(x+1)^2$ and $(y-2)^2$ is $0$ (perfect squares can never be negative), the minimum value of the entire expression is $\boxed{3}$, and is achieved when $x=-1$ and $y=2$. The answer is $\boxed{3}$

**Problem**
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


To solve this problem, we can use the method of completing the square.
First, let's rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $(x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2) + (y^2 - 4xy + 4x^2) = (x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2$.
Now, let's consider the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, we know that $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$, so $|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |(x-2y) + (y-2x)| = |-x - y| = |-(x+y)| = |x+y|$.
Therefore, $|x+y| = 40$.
Now, let's substitute $u = x+y$ and $v = x-2y$ into the expression $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2$.
We have $x = \frac{u+v}{3}$ and $y = \frac{2u-v}{3}$.
Substituting these into the expression, we get
\begin{align*}
(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2 &= \left(\frac{u+v}{3} - 2\cdot\frac{2u-v}{3}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{2u-v}{3} - 2\cdot\frac{u+v}{3}\right)^2 \\
&= \left(\frac{u+v - 4u + 2v}{3}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{2u - v - 2u - 2v}{3}\right)^2 \\
&= \left(\frac{-3u + 3v}{3}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{-3v}{3}\right)^2 \\
&= (u-v)^2 + v^2.
\end{align*}
Now, we know that $|u| = 40$, so $u^2 = 1600$.
And we also know that $v = x - 2y = \frac{u - 3y}{3}$, so $3v = u - 3y \Rightarrow y = \frac{u - 3v}{3}$.
Substituting this into the equation $|x+y| = 40$, we get $|u + \frac{u - 3v}{3}| = 40 \Rightarrow |3u + u - 3v| = 120 \Rightarrow |4u - 3v| = 120$.
Squaring both sides, we get $(4u - 3v)^2 = 14400 \Rightarrow 16u^2 - 24uv + 9v^2 = 14400$.
Substituting $u^2 = 1600$, we get $16(1600) - 24uv + 9v^2 = 14400 \Rightarrow 25600 - 24uv + 9v^2 = 14400 \Rightarrow 9v^2 - 24uv + 11200 = 0$.
This is a quadratic equation in $v^2$, and its discriminant is $(-24u)^2 - 4(9)(11200) = 576u^2 - 376320$.
Since we know that $u^2 = 1600$, the discriminant becomes $576(1600) - 376320 = 921600 - 376320 = 545280$.
Since the discriminant is positive, the quadratic equation has real solutions for $v^2$.
The minimum value of $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2 = (u-v)^2 + v^2$ is achieved when $v = 0$, because the square of a real number is always nonnegative.
When $v = 0$, we have $u = 40$, and the minimum value of $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2 = (u-v)^2 + v^2 = u^2 = 1600$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 1600.
The answer is: $1600$

To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**
