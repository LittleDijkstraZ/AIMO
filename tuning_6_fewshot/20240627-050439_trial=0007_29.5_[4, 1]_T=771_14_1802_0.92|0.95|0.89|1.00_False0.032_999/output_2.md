**Problem:** 
"How many solutions does the equation \[\frac{(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)\dotsm(x-100)}{(x-1^2)(x-2^2)(x-3^2)\dotsm(x-100^2)} = 0\]have for $x$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Any solution to this equation must make the numerator of the left-hand side zero, while keeping the denominator non-zero. The numerator is zero when $x$ is one of the numbers $1, 2, 3, \dots, 100.$ However, for any value in this list that is a perfect square, the denominator will also be zero, so that value of $x$ will not be a root. Therefore, we want to find the number of integers in the list $1, 2, \dots, 100$ which are not perfect squares. The perfect squares in the list are $1^2, 2^2, \dots, 10^2,$ so there are $10$ perfect squares, and \[100 - 10 = \boxed{90}\]integers which are not perfect squares. The answer is $\boxed{90}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has exactly $4$ distinct solutions. 

The equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ is a modified version of the equation $|x - a| = b$. This equation has two distinct solutions if and only if $b > 0$. 

So, for the equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ to have $4$ distinct solutions, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be positive. This implies $m > 0$. 

Now, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has exactly $4$ distinct solutions. 

The expression $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ will have $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $0 < \frac{m}{100} \leq 2$. 

This inequality simplifies to $0 < m \leq 200$. 

So, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality is the number of integers from $1$ to $200$, inclusive. 

To find this number, we can use the formula for the number of integers from $a$ to $b$ inclusive, which is $b - a + 1$. 

Applying this formula, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has exactly $4$ distinct solutions is $200 - 1 + 1 = 200$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has exactly $4$ distinct solutions is $200$.
The answer is $\boxed{200}$.

The error in the script is due to not defining the value of $m$ before using it in the script. This is a common error when dealing with loops and variables in Python. Let's correct this by defining the value of $m$ before using it in the script.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Eq, Abs, solveset, S

def solve_equation():
    x, m = symbols('x m')

    # Define the equation

    # Create a list to store the solutions
    solutions = []

    for m in range(1, 101):
        equation_m = equation.subs(m/100, m)
        solution_set = solveset(equation_m, x, domain=S.Reals)

        # Count the number of distinct solutions
        num_solutions = len(solution_set)

        # If the number of solutions equals 4, add the value of m to the list

    return solutions

The error in the script is due to the function `solveset` returning a `ConditionSet` object, which doesn't have a `len()` method. Instead, we should use the `Eq` function from sympy to solve the equation and check if the number of solutions is exactly 4. Let's correct this.

**Solution:** 



To find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions, we can use the fact that the right-hand side of the equation is always positive. Therefore, we can only have two cases:

1. $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, which gives us $4$ distinct solutions.
2. $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = -\frac{m}{100}$, which does not give us any solution (since the left-hand side is always nonnegative).

For the first case, we can analyze the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$. This equation has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} \in (0, 2)$. Therefore, $0 < m < 200$. The number of positive integers $m$ in this range is $199$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $199$. The answer is $\boxed{199}$.

The value of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $100$. However, based on the given constraint that $m$ is a positive integer, we can conclude that the value of $m$ should be less than or equal to 100. Since the maximum value of $m$ that results in 4 distinct solutions is 100, the value of $m$ that satisfies the condition is 100. Therefore, the solution is $\boxed{100}$.
