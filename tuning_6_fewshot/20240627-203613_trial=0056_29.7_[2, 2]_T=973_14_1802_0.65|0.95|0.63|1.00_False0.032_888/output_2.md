**Example**

**Problem:** 
"For certain ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ of real numbers, the system of equations
\[\begin{aligned} ax+by&=1 \\ x^2 + y^2 &= 50  \end{aligned}\]has at least one solution, and each solution is an ordered pair $(x,y)\,$ of integers. How many such ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ are there?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The graph of $ax+by=1$ is a line, while the graph of $x^2+y^2=50$ is a circle centered at the origin. Therefore, $(a, b)$ satisfies the conditions if and only if the line and circle intersect at least once, and they intersect only at lattice points (points with integer coordinates).

Knowing this, it makes sense to look for lattice points on the circle whose equation is $x^2+y^2=50$. Testing cases, we find that there are twelve lattice points on the circle: $(\pm 1, \pm 7)$, $(\pm 7, \pm 1)$, and $(\pm 5, \pm 5)$ (where the two $\pm$ signs in each pair are independent of each other).

There are $\tbinom{12}{2} = 66$ pairs of these points, and each pair determines a line. However, the graph of $ax+by=1$ can never pass through the origin $(0, 0)$, since if $x=y=0$, then $ax+by=0 \neq 1$. Therefore, the six pairs which consist of diametrically opposed points are invalid, since the line through them passes through the origin. This corrects our count to $66 - 6 = 60$.

In addition, for each of the twelve points, there is a line tangent to the circle at that point, so that the only solution to the system is that one point. This brings the final total to $60 + 12 = \boxed{72}$. The answer is $\boxed{72}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


To solve this problem, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has exactly 4 distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 1 and 2. This is because the expression on the left-hand side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, can take on exactly 4 distinct values: 0, 1, 2, and 3. The value 0 corresponds to the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=0$, which has a unique solution $x=1$. The value 1 corresponds to the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=1$, which has two solutions, and so on.

So we want $\frac{m}{100}$ to be strictly between 1 and 2, which means $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Multiplying all sides of the inequalities by 100, we get $100 < m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from 101 to 199, inclusive. To find the number of these integers, we subtract the smallest integer in the range from the largest integer in the range and then add 1 (because both ends of the range are inclusive). So the number of such integers is $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$.

Therefore, there are 99 positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly 4 distinct solutions. The answer is: $99$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many integers are solutions to the equation $$(x-2)^{(25-x^2)}=1?$$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
We need some basic facts from number theory: $a^0 = 1$ for any $a,$ $1^b = 1$ for any $b,$ and $(-1)^c = 1$ if $c$ is an even integer. Unless the base is a complex number (which is excluded since we are looking for integer solutions), there are no other ways to get an RHS of $1.$ Thus, either the exponent is zero $($giving the equation $25 - x^2 = 0),$ the base is $1$ $($giving $x -2 = 1),$ or the base is $-1$ and the exponent is even $($giving the simultaneous equations $x - 2 = -1$ and $25 - x^2 = 2n$ for some integer $n).$ Solving the first equation gives $x = \pm 5,$ and solving the second gives $x = 3.$ The third equation implies that $x = 1,$ in which case $25 - x^2 = 24$ is indeed even, so $x = 1$ is a valid solution. In all, there are $\boxed{4}$ integer solutions. The answer is $\boxed{4}$

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


The steps to solve the problem are as follows:

1. First, we need to understand that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. This means that the right-hand side $\frac{m}{100}$ is a number between 1 and 2. Therefore, $1 \leq \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which implies that $100 \leq m < 200$.

2. Now, we need to find the number of integers in the range $100 \leq m < 200$. This is simply $200 - 100 = 100$.

3. However, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ in this range. Since $m$ cannot be zero, we subtract 1 from the total number of integers in the range. So, the number of positive integers $m$ is $100 - 1 = 99$.

Now, let's write the Python code to perform these calculations:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def count_positive_integers():
    total_integers = 200 - 100
    positive_integers = total_integers - 1
    return positive_integers

result = count_positive_integers()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 99

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
99
```
The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is $99$. Therefore, the answer is $99$. However, there is a mistake in the problem statement. The number of distinct solutions to the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ cannot be exactly 4. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has at most 4 solutions, but it can have fewer. The correct question should ask for the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly 4 distinct solutions. For these values of $m$, the equation has exactly 4 solutions. Let's correct the problem statement and find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly 4 distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is an integer between 1 and 2 (inclusive). This means that $1 \leq \frac{m}{100} \leq 2$, which implies that $100 \leq m \leq 200$. The positive integers in this range are the integers from 100 to 200, inclusive. The number of such integers is $200 - 100 + 1 = 101$. However, we need to subtract 1 because $m$ cannot be 100 or 200. So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly 4 distinct solutions is $101 - 2 = 99$. However, this result is contradictory to the previous result. The previous result was obtained by considering the number of integers in the range $100 \leq m < 200$, and we found $99$ positive integers. The current result is obtained by considering the number of integers in the range $100 < m < 200$, and we found $99$ positive integers. Both results are consistent.

The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly 4 distinct solutions is $99$. The answer is: $99$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let \[f(x) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
-x + 3 & \text{if } x \le 0, \\
2x - 5 & \text{if } x > 0.
\end{array}
\right.\]How many solutions does the equation $f(f(x)) = 4$ have?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
To solve the equation $f(f(x)) = 4,$ we first find the values $x$ such that $f(x) = 4.$

Either $f(x) = -x + 3$ (for $x \le 0$) or $f(x) = 2x - 5$ (for $x > 0$). If $-x + 3 = 4,$ then $x = -1.$ Note that this value satisfies $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = 4,$ then $x = 9/2.$ Note that this value satisfies $x > 0.$ Therefore, the solutions to $f(x) = 4$ are $x = -1$ and $x = 9/2.$

Next, we solve for the values $x$ such that $f(x) = -1.$ If $-x + 3 = -1,$ then $x = 4.$ This value does not satisfy $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = -1,$ then $x = 2.$ This value satisfies $x > 0.$

Finally, we solve for the values $x$ such that $f(x) = 9/2.$ If $-x + 3 = 9/2,$ then $x = -3/2.$ This value satisfies $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = 9/2,$ then $x = 19/4.$ This value satisfies $x > 0.$

Therefore, the equation $f(f(x)) = 4$ has the solutions $x = 2,$ $-3/2,$ and $19/4,$ for a total of $\boxed{3}$ solutions. The answer is $\boxed{3}$

The value of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $1$. However, we need to check if this value of $m$ satisfies the conditions of the problem.

Let's substitute $m=1$ back into the equation and solve for $x$:

```python

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

def verify_m():
    x = symbols('x')
    equation = abs(abs(x - 1) - 2) - 1 / 100

The solutions for $x$ are $-1.01$, $-0.99$, $2.99$, and $3.01$. All of these solutions are distinct and real, so the value of $m$ that we found is indeed the one that gives us $4$ distinct solutions.

Therefore, the value of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $1$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"For certain ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ of real numbers, the system of equations
\[\begin{aligned} ax+by&=1 \\ x^2 + y^2 &= 50  \end{aligned}\]has at least one solution, and each solution is an ordered pair $(x,y)\,$ of integers. How many such ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ are there?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The graph of $ax+by=1$ is a line, while the graph of $x^2+y^2=50$ is a circle centered at the origin. Therefore, $(a, b)$ satisfies the conditions if and only if the line and circle intersect at least once, and they intersect only at lattice points (points with integer coordinates).

Knowing this, it makes sense to look for lattice points on the circle whose equation is $x^2+y^2=50$. Testing cases, we find that there are twelve lattice points on the circle: $(\pm 1, \pm 7)$, $(\pm 7, \pm 1)$, and $(\pm 5, \pm 5)$ (where the two $\pm$ signs in each pair are independent of each other).

There are $\tbinom{12}{2} = 66$ pairs of these points, and each pair determines a line. However, the graph of $ax+by=1$ can never pass through the origin $(0, 0)$, since if $x=y=0$, then $ax+by=0 \neq 1$. Therefore, the six pairs which consist of diametrically opposed points are invalid, since the line through them passes through the origin. This corrects our count to $66 - 6 = 60$.

In addition, for each of the twelve points, there is a line tangent to the circle at that point, so that the only solution to the system is that one point. This brings the final total to $60 + 12 = \boxed{72}$. The answer is $\boxed{72}$

**Problem:** 
"How many solutions does the equation \[\frac{(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)\dotsm(x-100)}{(x-1^2)(x-2^2)(x-3^2)\dotsm(x-100^2)} = 0\]have for $x$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Any solution to this equation must make the numerator of the left-hand side zero, while keeping the denominator non-zero. The numerator is zero when $x$ is one of the numbers $1, 2, 3, \dots, 100.$ However, for any value in this list that is a perfect square, the denominator will also be zero, so that value of $x$ will not be a root. Therefore, we want to find the number of integers in the list $1, 2, \dots, 100$ which are not perfect squares. The perfect squares in the list are $1^2, 2^2, \dots, 10^2,$ so there are $10$ perfect squares, and \[100 - 10 = \boxed{90}\]integers which are not perfect squares. The answer is $\boxed{90}$

To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions.

First, we can simplify the equation by multiplying both sides by 100 to get rid of the fraction: $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=m$.

This equation is a piecewise function with four cases to consider:

1. If $x \geq 1$, then $\vert x - 1 - 2 \vert = m$ or $\vert x - 1 - (-2) \vert = m$.
2. If $0 \leq x < 1$, then $\vert -x + 1 - 2 \vert = m$ or $\vert -x + 1 - (-2) \vert = m$.
3. If $x < 0$, then $\vert -x - 1 - 2 \vert = m$ or $\vert -x - 1 - (-2) \vert = m$.

Solving these equations for $m$ gives:

1. If $x \geq 1$, then $\vert x - 3 \vert = m$ or $\vert x + 1 \vert = m$.
2. If $0 \leq x < 1$, then $\vert -x - 1 \vert = m$ or $\vert x + 1 \vert = m$.
3. If $x < 0$, then $\vert -x - 3 \vert = m$ or $\vert x + 3 \vert = m$.

The solutions to these equations are:

1. If $x \geq 1$, then $x - 3 = m$ or $x + 1 = m$. The solutions are $x = m + 3$ and $x = m - 1$.
2. If $0 \leq x < 1$, then $x + 1 = m$. The solution is $x = m - 1$.
3. If $x < 0$, then $x + 3 = m$. The solution is $x = m - 3$.

For the equation to have four distinct solutions, we need to find the values of $m$ for which the solutions from the three cases do not overlap. This happens when $m - 3 < m - 1 < m < m + 1$. Simplifying these inequalities gives $3 < 1$, which is a contradiction. Therefore, the only way for the equation to have four distinct solutions is if one of the solutions from one of the cases is equal to one of the solutions from another case.

By comparing the solutions, we find that the only way this can happen is if $m - 1 = m$, which gives $m = 1$. However, this does not satisfy the conditions for any of the cases. Therefore, there must be another value of $m$ that makes two of the solutions from different cases equal.

By comparing the solutions, we find that the only way this can happen is if $m - 3 = m - 1$, which gives $m = 2$. This satisfies the conditions for the case $x < 0$.

Therefore, the only value of $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is $m = 2$. So, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions. The answer is: $1$

## QUESTION 2 - 12

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"For certain ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ of real numbers, the system of equations
\[\begin{aligned} ax+by&=1 \\ x^2 + y^2 &= 50  \end{aligned}\]has at least one solution, and each solution is an ordered pair $(x,y)\,$ of integers. How many such ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ are there?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The graph of $ax+by=1$ is a line, while the graph of $x^2+y^2=50$ is a circle centered at the origin. Therefore, $(a, b)$ satisfies the conditions if and only if the line and circle intersect at least once, and they intersect only at lattice points (points with integer coordinates).

Knowing this, it makes sense to look for lattice points on the circle whose equation is $x^2+y^2=50$. Testing cases, we find that there are twelve lattice points on the circle: $(\pm 1, \pm 7)$, $(\pm 7, \pm 1)$, and $(\pm 5, \pm 5)$ (where the two $\pm$ signs in each pair are independent of each other).

There are $\tbinom{12}{2} = 66$ pairs of these points, and each pair determines a line. However, the graph of $ax+by=1$ can never pass through the origin $(0, 0)$, since if $x=y=0$, then $ax+by=0 \neq 1$. Therefore, the six pairs which consist of diametrically opposed points are invalid, since the line through them passes through the origin. This corrects our count to $66 - 6 = 60$.

In addition, for each of the twelve points, there is a line tangent to the circle at that point, so that the only solution to the system is that one point. This brings the final total to $60 + 12 = \boxed{72}$. The answer is $\boxed{72}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


We know that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. The expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ can take on the values $0$, $1$, $2$, or $3$ (since it's equal to $\frac{m}{100}$, which is a positive number, and can take on any positive value). 

For each of these cases, we can solve the equation to find the corresponding values of $m$.

For $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=0$, we have $\vert x-1 \vert =2$, which gives us $x-1=2$ or $x-1=-2$. Solving these equations gives $x=3$ or $x=-1$.

For $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=1$, we have two cases:
1. $\vert x-1 \vert =3$, which gives us $x-1=3$ or $x-1=-3$. Solving these equations gives $x=4$ or $x=-2$.
2. $\vert x-1 \vert =1$, which gives us $x-1=1$ or $x-1=-1$. Solving these equations gives $x=2$ or $x=0$.

For $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=2$, we have $\vert x-1 \vert =4$, which gives us $x-1=4$ or $x-1=-4$. Solving these equations gives $x=5$ or $x=-3$.

For $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=3$, we have $\vert x-1 \vert =5$, which has no solutions because the absolute value of a number cannot be equal to a number greater than $2$.

So the values of $m$ that make the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have $4$ distinct solutions are the values of $\frac{m}{100}$ in the set $\{0, 1, 2, 3\}$, which are $0, 1, 2, 3$. Multiplying each of these by $100$, we find that the possible values of $m$ are $0, 100, 200, 300$. However, $m$ must be a positive integer, so we discard $m=0$. Therefore, the only possible value of $m$ is $100, 200, 300$. There are $3$ positive integers $m$ that satisfy the equation.

So the answer is $3$.

The Python code to verify this is:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def count_m():
    num_solutions = 4
    m_values = []
    for i in range(num_solutions):
        m = i * 100
        m_values.append(m)
    return len(m_values)

result = count_m()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 4

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
4
```
However, this code counts the number of all possible values of m, including 0, which is not a valid value for m. To correct this, we need to remove 0 from the list of possible values of m.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def count_m():
    num_solutions = 4
    m_values = []
    for i in range(1, num_solutions):
        m = i * 100
        m_values.append(m)
    return len(m_values)

result = count_m()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 3

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
3
```
The correct number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the equation is $3$.

Therefore, the value of $m$ that makes the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have $4$ distinct solutions is $100, 200, 300$. There are $3$ positive integers $m$ that satisfy the equation.
The value of $m$ is $100$. The answer is $\boxed{100}$.
