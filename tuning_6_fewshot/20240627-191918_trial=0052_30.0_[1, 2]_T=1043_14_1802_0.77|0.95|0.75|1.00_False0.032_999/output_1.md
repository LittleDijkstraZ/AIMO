**Problem:** 
"Find the minimum value of $2x^2 + 2y^2 + 5z^2 - 2xy - 4yz - 4x - 2z + 15$ over all real numbers $x,$ $y,$ $z.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
We can write the given expression as
\begin{align*}
&(x^2 - 4x + 4) + (x^2 - 2xy + y^2) + (y^2 - 4yz + 4z^2) + (z^2 - 2z + 1) + 10 \\
&= (x - 2)^2 + (x - y)^2 + (y - 2z)^2 + (z - 1)^2 + 10
\end{align*}The minimum value is then $\boxed{10},$ which occurs when $x = 2,$ $y = 2,$ and $z = 1.$ The answer is $\boxed{10}$

## QUESTION 1 - 5

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"What is the minimum value of the expression $2x^2+3y^2+8x-24y+62$ for real $x$ and $y$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Rearranging the expression, we have  \[2x^2+8x+3y^2-24y+62\]We first complete the square in $x$. Factoring a 2 from the first two terms of the expression, we get  \[2(x^2+4x)+3y^2-24y+62\]In order for the expression inside the parenthesis to be a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(4/2)^2=4$ inside the parenthesis. Doing this, we have \[2(x^2+4x+4-4)+3y^2-24y+62 \Rightarrow 2(x+2)^2+3y^2-24y+54\]Now we complete the square in $y$. Factoring a 3 from the $y$ terms in the expression, we get \[2(x+2)^2+3(y^2-8y)+54\]In order for the expression inside the second parenthesis to be a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(8/2)^2=16$ inside the parenthesis. Doing this, we have \[2(x+2)^2+3(y^2-8y+16-16)+54 \Rightarrow 2(x+2)^2+3(y-4)^2+6\]Since the minimum value of $2(x+2)^2$ and $3(y-4)^2$ is $0$ (perfect squares can never be negative), the minimum value of the entire expression is $\boxed{6}$, and is achieved when $x=-2$ and $y=4$. The answer is $\boxed{6}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


First, we define the function $f(x, y) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$. We want to find the minimum value of this function under the constraint $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$.

To solve this problem, we can use a numerical approach. We can generate a large number of random $(x, y)$ pairs that satisfy the constraint and compute the function value for each pair. Then, we can find the minimum function value among all the computed values.

Here is the entire script:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

import random
import numpy as np

def f(x, y):
    return 5*x**2 + 5*y**2 - 8*x*y

def constraint(x, y):
    return abs(x - 2*y) + abs(y - 2*x) - 40

def solve_problem():
    min_value = float('inf')
    for _ in range(100000):
        x = random.uniform(-100, 100)
        y = random.uniform(-100, 100)
        if constraint(x, y) == 0:
            value = f(x, y)
            if value < min_value:
                min_value = value
    return min_value

min_value = solve_problem()
print(min_value)
```

CODE RESULTS inf

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
inf
```
The script is generating random $(x, y)$ pairs and checking if they satisfy the constraint. If they do, it computes the function value and checks if it is smaller than the current minimum value. If so, it updates the minimum value. However, the script is not working correctly because it is not handling the constraint correctly. The constraint $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$ is not being satisfied by the random pairs being generated. This is because the random function `random.uniform` generates values uniformly in the specified range, but it does not guarantee that the generated values will satisfy the constraint.

To solve this problem, we need to find a different approach. Notice that the constraint equation $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|x - 2y| = |2x - y| = 20$. This implies that the distance from $(x, y)$ to $(2y, y)$ is 20, and the distance from $(x, y)$ to $(y, 2x)$ is also 20. The point $(2y, y)$ and $(y, 2x)$ form a right triangle with $(x, y)$ as the right angle vertex. By the Pythagorean theorem, we have $(x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2 = 400$.

Expanding this equation gives $x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2 + y^2 - 4xy + 4x^2 = 400$, which simplifies to $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = 400$. So the minimum value of the function $f(x, y) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ under the constraint is 400.

Therefore, the minimum value of the function $f(x, y) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is 400.
The answer is $\boxed{400}$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"If $x + 2y= 4$ and $xy = -8$, what is the value of $x^2 + 4y^2$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
We see that $(x + 2y)^2 = (x^2 + 4y^2) + 4xy = 4^2 = 16$. We want to find $x^2 + 4y^2$ and are given $xy = -8$. So, $x^2 + 4y^2 + 4xy = x^2 + 4y^2 + 4(-8) = 16$. It follows that $x^2 + 4y^2 = \boxed{48}$. The answer is $\boxed{48}$

Piecewise((18*y**2 - 720*y + 8000, y <= 80/3), (nan, True))
```
The minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is achieved when $x=2y$ and $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. To find the minimum value, we need to find the minimum value of the piecewise function.

    y = symbols('y')
    f1 = 18*y**2 - 720*y + 8000
    f2 = nan

    # Find the derivative of the first piece
    df1 = diff(f1, y)

    # Find the critical points of the first piece
    critical_points = solve(df1, y)

    # Evaluate the first piece at the critical points and the endpoints of its domain
    values = [f1.subs(y, cp) for cp in critical_points]

    # The minimum value of the piecewise function is the minimum of these values
    min_value = Min(*values)

    return min_value

result = min_value_piecewise()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 800

The minimum value of the piecewise function is 800. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 800. The answer is $\boxed{800}$.
