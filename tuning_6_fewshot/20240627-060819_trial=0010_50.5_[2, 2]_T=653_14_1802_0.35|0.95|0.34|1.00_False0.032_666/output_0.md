    x, k, l = symbols('x k l')

    # Equation of the parabola
    parabola = k*x**2 - 2*k*x + l - 4

    # Solve for x when the parabola intersects the line y = 4
    solutions = solve(parabola, x)

    # The distance between the points A and B is 6
    distance_AB = 6

    # The distance from a point (x, 4) to the origin is sqrt(x**2 + 4**2) = sqrt(x**2 + 16)
    # The sum of the squares of the distances from A and B to the origin is then
    # (sqrt(solutions[0]**2 + 16)**2 + sqrt(solutions[1]**2 + 16)**2)

    # Using the identity (a+b)**2 = a**2 + b**2 + 2ab, we can simplify this to
    # (solutions[0]**2 + 16 + solutions[1]**2 + 16 + 2*sqrt((solutions[0]**2 + 16)*(solutions[1]**2 + 16)))

    # And since the distance between A and B is 6, we know that (solutions[1] - solutions[0])**2 = 6**2 = 36
    # So, (solutions[1]**2 - 2*solutions[0]*solutions[1] + solutions[0]**2) = 36
    # And therefore, 2*(solutions[0]**2 + solutions[1]**2) = 36 + 4*(solutions[0]*solutions[1])
    # And since the product of the roots of a quadratic equation ax**2 + bx + c = 0 is c/a, we know that
    # solutions[0]*solutions[1] = l/k
    # So, 2*(solutions[0]**2 + solutions[1]**2) = 36 + 4*(l/k)

    # Substituting this into the expression for the sum of the squares of the distances, we get
    # 2*(solutions[0]**2 + 16 + solutions[1]**2 + 16) = 36 + 4*(l/k) + 2*sqrt((solutions[0]**2 + 16)*(solutions[1]**2 + 16))
    # Simplifying this gives
    # 2*(2*(solutions[0]**2 + solutions[1]**2) + 32) = 36 + 4*(l/k) + 2*sqrt((solutions[0]**2 + 16)*(solutions[1]**2 + 16))
    # And since 2*(solutions[0]**2 + solutions[1]**2) = 36 + 4*(l/k), this simplifies to
    # 2*(36 + 4*(l/k) + 32) = 36 + 4*(l/k) + 2*sqrt((solutions[0]**2 + 16)*(solutions[1]**2 + 16))
    # And further simplifying gives
    # 72 + 8*(l/k) + 64 = 36 + 4*(l/k) + 2*sqrt((solutions[0]**2 + 16)*(solutions[1]**2 + 16))
    # And subtracting 36 + 4*(l/k) from both sides gives
    # 36 + 4*(l/k) + 104 = 2*sqrt((solutions[0]**2 + 16)*(solutions[1]**2 + 16))
    # And simplifying gives
    # 140 + 4*(l/k) = 2*sqrt((solutions[0]**2 + 16)*(solutions[1]**2 + 16))
    # And squaring both sides gives
    # (140 + 4*(l/k))**2 = 4*((solutions[0]**2 + 16)*(solutions[1]**2 + 16))
    # And simplifying gives
    # 19600 + 1120*(l/k) + 16*(l/k)**2 = 4*(solutions[0]**2 + 16)*(solutions[1]**2 + 16)
    # And since 2*(solutions[0]**2 + solutions[1]**2) = 36 + 4*(l/k), this simplifies to
    # 19600 + 1120*(l/k) + 16*(l/k)**2 = 4*(18 + 2*(l/k))*(18 + 2*(l/k))
    # And expanding the right side gives
    # 19600 + 1120*(l/k) + 16*(l/k)**2 = 4*(324 + 72*(l/k) + 4*(l/k)**2)
    # And simplifying gives
    # 19600 + 1120*(l/k) + 16*(l/k)**2 = 1296 + 288*(l/k) + 16*(l/k)**2
    # And subtracting 16*(l/k)**2 from both sides gives
    # 19600 + 1120*(l/k) = 1296 + 288*(l/k)
    # And subtracting 1296 from both sides gives
    # 18304 + 832*(l/k) = 288*(l/k)
    # And subtracting 832*(l/k) from both sides gives
    # 18304 = 204.8*(l/k)
    # And dividing both sides by 204.8 gives
    # l/k = 89.6
    # And since l and k are both positive, this means l = 89.6*k
    # And substituting this into the equation for the sum of the squares of the distances gives
    # 2*(36 + 4*(89.6*k/k)) + 104 = 2*sqrt((solutions[0]**2 + 16)*(solutions[1]**2 + 16))
    # And simplifying gives
    # 2*(36 + 4*89.6) + 104 = 2*sqrt((solutions[0]**2 + 16)*(solutions[1]**2 + 16))
    # And further simplifying gives
    # 2*(36 + 358.4) + 104 = 2*sqrt((solutions[0]**2 + 16)*(solutions[1]**2 + 16))
    # And simplifying gives
    # 2*400 + 104 = 2*sqrt((solutions[0]**2 + 16)*(solutions[1]**2 + 16))

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"The smallest distance between the origin and a point on the parabola $y=x^2-5$ can be expressed as $\sqrt{a}/b$, where $a$ and $b$ are positive integers, and $a$ is not divisible by the square of any prime.  Find $a+b$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the distance formula, we are trying to minimize $\sqrt{x^2+y^2}=\sqrt{x^2+x^4-10x^2+25}$. In general minimization problems like this require calculus, but one elementary optimization method that sometimes works is completing the square.  We have $$\sqrt{x^2+x^4-10x^2+25}=\sqrt{(x^2-9/2)^2+(25-81/4)}.$$This expression is minimized when the square equals $0$, i.e. when $x=\pm 3/\sqrt{2}.$ For this value of $x$, the distance is $$\sqrt{25-\frac{81}{4}}=\frac{\sqrt{19}}{2}.$$Hence the desired answer is $\boxed{21}$. The answer is $\boxed{21}$

**Problem**
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


We start by finding the points of intersection of the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ and the line $y = 4$. Setting these equal gives us the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$. Let's call the roots of this equation $x_1$ and $x_2$, which represent the x-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$ respectively. We know that $|x_1 - x_2| = 6/k$ (since the distance between the points is 6 divided by the scale factor $k$ of the parabola).

By Vieta's formulas, we know that $x_1 + x_2 = 2k/k = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = (l - 4)/k$. We can use these to express $x_1$ and $x_2$ in terms of $k$ and $l$:

$$x_1 = 1 + 3/k, \quad x_2 = 1 - 3/k.$$

Now we can find the y-coordinates of $A$ and $B$ by substituting these into the equation of the parabola:

$$y_1 = k(1 + 3/k)^2 - 2k(1 + 3/k) + l = k + 6 + l - 2k - 6 = l - k + 6,$$
$$y_2 = k(1 - 3/k)^2 - 2k(1 - 3/k) + l = k + 6 + l + 2k - 6 = l + k + 6.$$

The distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin are $\sqrt{x_1^2 + y_1^2}$ and $\sqrt{x_2^2 + y_2^2}$ respectively. We want to find the sum of the squares of these distances:

$$(x_1^2 + y_1^2) + (x_2^2 + y_2^2) = (1 + 6/k + (l - k + 6)^2) + (1 - 6/k + (l + k + 6)^2).$$

We can simplify this expression using the fact that $x_1x_2 = (l - 4)/k$:

$$(1 + 6/k + (l - k + 6)^2) + (1 - 6/k + (l + k + 6)^2) = 2 + 2(l - 4) + (l - k + 6)^2 + (l + k + 6)^2.$$

This simplifies to:

$$2 + 2l - 8 + (l - k + 6)^2 + (l + k + 6)^2 = 2l - 6 + (l - k + 6)^2 + (l + k + 6)^2.$$

Now we can substitute $k = 1$ (since we are looking for the sum of the squares of the distances, and the scale factor $k$ only affects the distance between the points, not the individual distances themselves) and simplify:

$$2l - 6 + (l + 5)^2 + (l + 7)^2 = 2l - 6 + l^2 + 10l + 25 + l^2 + 14l + 49 = 2l^2 + 26l + 78.$$

We can use Python to find the numerical value of this expression when $l = 4$:

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Find the distance between the vertex of the graph of the equation $y=x^2 + 2x - 6 $ and the point $(4, 5)$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Completing the square, we get $y=(x + 1)^2 - 7 $. The vertex of the graph of this equation is thus $(-1, -7)$.The distance between $(4, 5)$ and $(-1, -7)$ is $\sqrt{(4-(-1))^2 + (5-(-7))^2} = \sqrt{25+144} =\boxed{13}$. The answer is $\boxed{13}$
