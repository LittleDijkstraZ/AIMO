**Problem:** 
"How many square units are in the area of the triangle whose vertices are the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the curve $y = (x-3)^2 (x+2)$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we need to find where this curve intersects the $x$ and $y$ axes.  If $y=0$, then $(x-3)^2(x+2)=0$, which has solutions of $x=3$ and $x=-2$.  If $x=0$, then $y=(-3)^2(2)=18$.  So, the curve has two $x$-intercepts and one $y$-intercept.  The length of the base along the $x$-axis is $3-(-2)=5$.  The height from this base is equal to the $y$-intercept, 18.  The area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 5\cdot 18=\boxed{45}$. The answer is $\boxed{45}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


This problem is a bit complex to solve directly using Python. However, we can simplify it by realizing that the expression will be zero if either of the two factors is zero. This gives us four conditions to consider:
1. $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x - y| - 10 = 0$
2. $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x| - 8 = 0$
3. $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ and $|y| - 8 = 0$
4. $|x - y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x| - 8 = 0$
5. $|x - y| - 10 = 0$ and $|y| - 8 = 0$
6. $|x| - 8 = 0$ and $|y| - 8 = 0$

By solving each of these conditions, we can find the vertices of the polygon. Then, we can calculate the area of the polygon.

Here is a Python code to solve the problem:
```python

from sympy import symbols, Abs, solve

def calculate_area():
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # Solve each condition
    vertices = []
    vertices.extend(solve([Abs(x + y) - 10, Abs(x - y) - 10, Abs(x) - 8, Abs(y) - 8], (x, y)))
    vertices.extend(solve([Abs(x + y) - 10, Abs(x) - 8, Abs(y) - 8], (x, y)))
    vertices.extend(solve([Abs(x + y) - 10, Abs(x - y) - 10, Abs(x) - 8, Abs(y) - 8], (x, y)))
    vertices.extend(solve([Abs(x - y) - 10, Abs(x) - 8, Abs(y) - 8], (x, y)))
    vertices.extend(solve([Abs(x - y) - 10, Abs(x + y) - 10, Abs(x) - 8, Abs(y) - 8], (x, y)))
    vertices.extend(solve([Abs(x) - 8, Abs(y) - 8], (x, y)))

    # Calculate the area of the polygon
    area = 0
    for i in range(len(vertices)):
        x1, y1 = vertices[i]
        if i == len(vertices) - 1:
            x2, y2 = vertices[0]
        else:
            x2, y2 = vertices[i + 1]
        area += 0.5 * Abs(x1*y2 - x2*y1)

    return area

area = calculate_area()
print(area)
```

**Problem:** 
"Find the number of 10-tuples $(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{10})$ of real numbers such that
\[(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2 = \frac{1}{11}.\]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,
\begin{align*}
&[(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + \dots + 1^2 + 1^2)][(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2] \\

\end{align*}From the given condition, we have equality, so by the equality condition for Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[\frac{1 - x_1}{1} = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{1} = \frac{x_2 - x_3}{1} = \dots = \frac{x_9 - x_{10}}{1} = \frac{x_{10}}{1}.\]Let
\[d = 1 - x_1 = x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_3 = \dots = x_9 - x_{10} = x_{10}.\]Then
\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so
\[(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_{10}) = \left( \frac{10}{11}, \frac{9}{11}, \frac{8}{11}, \dots, \frac{1}{11} \right).\]In particular, there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Solution:** 



First, we need to understand the given equation and the conditions that make it zero. The equation is a product of two terms, so it is zero if either of the terms is zero.

The term $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ is zero when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$. The term $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ is zero when $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$. The term $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ is zero when $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = 8$ or $x = -8$. The term $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2$ is zero when $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

These conditions describe a square with vertices at $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$. The side length of the square is $16$, so the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $256$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    # The side length of the square is 16, so the area of the square is 16^2 = 256
    area = 16**2
    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

The area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is $\boxed{256}$.

**Solution:** 


The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.

Let's consider the first term:
\[(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0.\]
This equation is satisfied only when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ or their opposites $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length $20$ and area $400$.

Now let's consider the second term:
\[(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0.\]
This equation is satisfied only when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$ or their opposites $y = 8$ and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length $16$ and area $256$.

The intersection of the two squares is another square with side length $8$ and area $64$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon formed by the points $(x, y)$ is the sum of the areas of the two squares minus the area of the smaller square, which is $400 + 256 - 64 = 592$.

So the area of the convex polygon is $592$. The answer is: $592$

**Solution:** 


The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. This gives us two systems of equations to solve:

1. $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x - y| - 10 = 0$
2. $|x| - 8 = 0$ and $|y| - 8 = 0$

For the first system, we have $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations gives us the vertices of the rhombus formed by the points that satisfy the first system.

For the second system, we have $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these four equations gives us the vertices of the square formed by the points that satisfy the second system.

The vertices of the rhombus are $(\pm 10, 0)$ and $(0, \pm 10)$, and the vertices of the square are $(\pm 8, \pm 8)$. The convex polygon formed by the union of these two sets of points is a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. So, either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.
2. Each term is a sum of squares, which are always nonnegative. Therefore, for the product to be zero, each term must be zero.
3. For the first term, we have $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x-y| - 10 = 0$, which simplifies to $|x+y| = 10$ and $|x-y| = 10$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x+y = 10$, $x+y = -10$, $x-y = 10$, and $x-y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle.
4. For the second term, we have $|x| - 8 = 0$ and $|y| - 8 = 0$, which simplifies to $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square.
5. The intersection of the rectangle and the square is the convex polygon we are looking for.
6. To find the area of the convex polygon, we need to find the area of the rectangle and subtract the area of the square that is outside the rectangle.
7. The length of the rectangle is $20$ (from $x+y = 10$ to $x+y = -10$) and the width is $20$ (from $x-y = 10$ to $x-y = -10$). So, the area of the rectangle is $20 \times 20 = 400$.
8. The side length of the square is $16$ (from $x = 8$ to $x = -8$ or from $y = 8$ to $y = -8$). So, the area of the square is $16 \times 16 = 256$.
9. The area of the convex polygon is $400 - 256 = 144$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $144$. The answer is: $144$

**Problem:** 
"How many square units are in the area of the triangle whose vertices are the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the curve $y = (x-3)^2 (x+2)$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we need to find where this curve intersects the $x$ and $y$ axes.  If $y=0$, then $(x-3)^2(x+2)=0$, which has solutions of $x=3$ and $x=-2$.  If $x=0$, then $y=(-3)^2(2)=18$.  So, the curve has two $x$-intercepts and one $y$-intercept.  The length of the base along the $x$-axis is $3-(-2)=5$.  The height from this base is equal to the $y$-intercept, 18.  The area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 5\cdot 18=\boxed{45}$. The answer is $\boxed{45}$

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


This problem is a bit complex and requires a deep understanding of absolute value and inequalities. However, the solution can be found by analyzing the conditions given in the problem.

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations gives us the vertices of the square with side length 20.

Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these four equations gives us the vertices of the square with side length 16.

The intersection of these two squares is a smaller square with side length 8. The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 64.

```python

Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

\end{align*}From the given condition, we have equality, so by the equality condition for Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[\frac{1 - x_1}{1} = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{1} = \frac{x_2 - x_3}{1} = \dots = \frac{x_9 - x_{10}}{1} = \frac{x_{10}}{1}.\]Let

The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. So we need to solve two separate systems of equations:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first system, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$. This implies that $-10 \leq x + y \leq 10$ and $-8 \leq x \leq 8$. Similarly, for the second system, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $-10 \leq x - y \leq 10$ and $-8 \leq y \leq 8$.

The intersection of these two systems of inequalities gives us the vertices of the polygon. The polygon is a square with side length 16 (since the maximum value of $x$ or $y$ is 8 in each case). The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$
