Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Step 1: We know that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. We can rewrite this as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$. By the triangle inequality, we have $|x-2y| + |2y-x| \geq |(x-2y) + (2y-x)| = |0| = 0$. But we know that $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$, so the only way this is possible is if $|x-2y| = |2y-x| = 20$. This implies that $x-2y = \pm 20$ and $2y-x = \pm 20$. Solving these equations, we find that $x = 10 \pm 10\sqrt{2}$ and $y = 5 \pm 5\sqrt{2}$.

Step 2: Now we substitute these values of $x$ and $y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We find that the expression is minimized when $x = 10 - 10\sqrt{2}$ and $y = 5 - 5\sqrt{2}$.

Step 3: Substituting these values into the expression, we get $5(10 - 10\sqrt{2})^2 + 5(5 - 5\sqrt{2})^2 - 8(10 - 10\sqrt{2})(5 - 5\sqrt{2})$.

Step 4: Calculating this expression, we find that it simplifies to $-200\sqrt{2} + 200$.

Step 5: Finally, we calculate the numerical value of this expression. We get $-200\sqrt{2} + 200 \approx 29.3$.

However, this is not the correct answer. Let's try another approach.

Step 1: Let $u = x - 2y$ and $v = 2y - x$. Then $|u| = |v| = 20$. We can rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x - 2y)^2 + 4xy] - 8xy = 5[u^2 + 4(u + v)/2] - 8(u + v)/2 = 5u^2 + 10uv + 5v^2$.

Step 2: Substituting $u = 20$ and $v = -20$, we get $5(20)^2 + 10(20)(-20) + 5(-20)^2 = 2000 - 4000 + 2000 = 0$.

Step 3: However, this doesn't make sense because the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ should be minimized, not zero. Let's try another approach.

Step 1: Let $a = x + y$ and $b = x - y$. Then $x = (a + b)/2$ and $y = (a - b)/2$. We can rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $5[(a + b)^2/4 + (a - b)^2/4] - 8(a + b)(a - b)/4 = (5/4)[a^2 + b^2]$.

Step 2: Now we need to find the relationship between $a$ and $b$ from the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. Substituting $x = (a + b)/2$ and $y = (a - b)/2$, we get $|(a + b)/2 - 2(a - b)/2| + |(a - b)/2 - 2(a + b)/2| = 40$, which simplifies to $|a - b| + |a + b| = 40$.

Step 3: By the triangle inequality, we have $|a - b| + |a + b| \geq |(a - b) + (a + b)| = |2a| = 2|a|$. So we have $2|a| = 40$, which implies $|a| = 20$.

Step 4: Substituting $|a| = 20$ into the expression $(5/4)[a^2 + b^2]$, we get $(5/4)(20^2 + b^2) = 500 + (5/4)b^2$.

Step 5: To minimize this expression, we need to minimize $(5/4)b^2$. Since $b^2$ is always non-negative, the minimum value of $(5/4)b^2$ is 0, which occurs when $b = 0$.

Step 6: When $b = 0$, we have $x = y$. Substituting this into the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we get $|x-2x| + |x-2x| = 40$, which simplifies to $|-x| + |-x| = 40$. This implies $2|-x| = 40$, so $|-x| = 20$, which means $|x| = 20$.

Step 7: Substituting $|x| = 20$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get $5(20)^2 + 5(20)^2 - 8(20)(20) = 2000 + 2000 - 3200 = 800$.

Step 8: So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 800.

The answer is: $800$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"What is the minimum value of the expression $x^2+y^2+2x-4y+8$ for real $x$ and $y$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Rearranging the expression, we have  \[x^2+2x+y^2-4y+8\]Completing the square in $x$, we need to add and subtract $(2/2)^2=1$. Completing the square in $y$, we need to add and subtract $(4/2)^2=4$. Thus, we have \[(x^2+2x+1)-1+(y^2-4y+4)-4+8 \Rightarrow (x+1)^2+(y-2)^2+3\]Since the minimum value of $(x+1)^2$ and $(y-2)^2$ is $0$ (perfect squares can never be negative), the minimum value of the entire expression is $\boxed{3}$, and is achieved when $x=-1$ and $y=2$. The answer is $\boxed{3}$

**Solution:**


This problem is a bit tricky to solve directly. However, we can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to solve it.

The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states that for any real numbers $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$ and $b_1, b_2, ..., b_n$, we have:
\[(a_1^2 + a_2^2 + ... + a_n^2)(b_1^2 + b_2^2 + ... + b_n^2) \geq (a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 + ... + a_nb_n)^2.\]

In our case, let $a_1 = x$, $a_2 = y$, $b_1 = 1$, and $b_2 = -2$. Then we have:
\[(x^2 + y^2)(1^2 + (-2)^2) \geq (x - 2y)^2.\]
Simplifying the left side gives:
\[(x^2 + y^2)(1 + 4) \geq (x - 2y)^2.\]
\[5(x^2 + y^2) \geq (x - 2y)^2.\]

Similarly, let $a_1 = y$, $a_2 = x$, $b_1 = -2$, and $b_2 = 1$. Then we have:
\[(y^2 + x^2)((-2)^2 + 1^2) \geq (y - 2x)^2.\]
\[5(y^2 + x^2) \geq (y - 2x)^2.\]

Adding these two inequalities, we get:
\[10(x^2 + y^2) \geq (x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2.\]

Now, let's substitute the given condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ into the inequality. We know that $|a| + |b| \geq |a + b|$, so we have:
\[|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| \geq |(x - 2y) + (y - 2x)| = |-x - y| = |-(x + y)| = |x + y|.\]
Thus, $|x + y| = 40$.

Now, let's substitute this into the inequality:
\[10(x^2 + y^2) \geq (x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2 = (x + y)^2 = 40^2 = 1600.\]

Dividing both sides by 10, we get:
\[x^2 + y^2 \geq \frac{1600}{10} = 160.\]

Now, let's substitute this into the expression we want to minimize:
\[5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = 5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy \geq 5*160 - 8xy = 800 - 8xy.\]

To minimize this expression, we need to maximize $8xy$. By the AM-GM inequality (Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean inequality), we have:
\[8xy \leq 8\sqrt{x^2y^2} = 8|xy|.\]

By the condition $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$, we know that $|x + y| = 40$. Thus, $|xy| = \frac{|x + y|^2 - (x^2 + y^2)}{4} = \frac{40^2 - 160}{4} = 240$.

So, $8xy \leq 8*240 = 1920$.

Substituting this into the expression, we get:
\[800 - 8xy \geq 800 - 1920 = -1120.\]

However, this is not possible since the expression is a sum of squares and cannot be negative. So, we must have made a mistake in our reasoning.

Let's go back and check our steps. We noticed that we made a mistake when we used the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. The correct inequality should be:
\[(x^2 + y^2)(1^2 + (-2)^2) \geq (x*1 - 2*y)^2 = (x - 2y)^2.\]
\[5(x^2 + y^2) \geq (x - 2y)^2.\]

Similarly,
\[(y^2 + x^2)((-2)^2 + 1^2) \geq (y*(-2) - x*1)^2 = (y - 2x)^2.\]
\[5(y^2 + x^2) \geq (y - 2x)^2.\]

Adding these two inequalities, we get:
\[10(x^2 + y^2) \geq (x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2.\]

Now, let's substitute the given condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ into the inequality. We know that $|a| + |b| \geq |a - b|$, so we have:
\[|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| \geq |(x - 2y) - (y - 2x)| = |x - 2y - y + 2x| = |3x - 3y| = 3|x - y|.\]
Thus, $3|x - y| = 40$, or $|x - y| = \frac{40}{3}$.

Now, let's substitute this into the inequality:
\[10(x^2 + y^2) \geq (x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2 = (x - y)^2 = \left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{1600}{9}.\]

Dividing both sides by 10, we get:
\[x^2 + y^2 \geq \frac{1600}{90} = \frac{160}{9}.\]

Now, let's substitute this into the expression we want to minimize:
\[5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = 5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy \geq 5*\frac{160}{9} - 8xy = \frac{800}{9} - 8xy.\]

To minimize this expression, we need to maximize $8xy$. By the AM-GM inequality, we have:
\[8xy \leq 8\sqrt{x^2y^2} = 8|xy|.\]

By the condition $|x - y| = \frac{40}{3}$, we know that $|xy| = \frac{|x - y|^2 - (x^2 - 2xy + y^2)}{4} = \frac{\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 - \frac{160}{9}}{4} = \frac{1600}{27}$.

So, $8xy \leq 8*\frac{1600}{27} = \frac{12800}{27}$.

Substituting this into the expression, we get:
\[\frac{800}{9} - 8xy \geq \frac{800}{9} - \frac{12800}{27} = \frac{800}{9} - \frac{4480}{27} = -\frac{1120}{27}.\]

This is still not possible since the expression is a sum of squares and cannot be negative. So, we must have made

 This problem is a bit complex and requires a bit of analytical thinking. However, we can solve it by using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.

The given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$. By the triangle inequality, we know that $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$, so we have $|x-2y| + |2y-x| \geq |(x-2y) + (2y-x)| = 0$. Therefore, the only way for the equation to hold is when both $|x-2y|$ and $|2y-x|$ are equal to $20$. This gives us two cases:

1. $x-2y = 20$ and $2y-x = 20$. Solving these equations gives $x = 20$ and $y = 0$.
2. $x-2y = -20$ and $2y-x = -20$. Solving these equations gives $x = -20$ and $y = 0$.

In both cases, we have $y = 0$. Substituting $y = 0$ into the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ gives $|x| + |-2x| = 40$, which simplifies to $|x| + |2x| = 40$. This gives us two more cases:

3. $x = 20$.
4. $x = -20$.

So the only possible solutions are $(x, y) = (20, 0)$ and $(x, y) = (-20, 0)$. Now we substitute these values into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to find the minimum value:

For $(x, y) = (20, 0)$, we have $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(20)^2 + 5(0)^2 - 8(20)(0) = 2000$.
For $(x, y) = (-20, 0)$, we have $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(-20)^2 + 5(0)^2 - 8(-20)(0) = 2000$.

So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $2000$. The answer is: $2000$

**Solution:**


This problem is a bit tricky, but we can solve it by using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.

First, let's rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2$.

Now, let's use the given condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. By the triangle inequality, we know that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |(x-2y) - (y-2x)| = |x-2y - y + 2x| = |x - 3y + 2x| = |3x - 3y| = 3|x - y|$. So we have $3|x - y| = 40$, which implies $|x - y| = \frac{40}{3}$.

Now, let's use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality: $(a^2 + b^2)(x^2 + y^2) \geq (ax + by)^2$ for any real numbers $a$, $b$, $x$, and $y$.

Applying this to our problem, we have $(1^2 + 1^2)((x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2) \geq (x-2y + y-2x)^2 = (-(x-2y) + (y-2x))^2 = (-3(x-y))^2 = 9|x-y|^2 = 9 \cdot \left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 = 9 \cdot \frac{1600}{9} = 1600$.

Therefore, we have $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2 \geq \frac{1600}{2} = 800$.

So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 800.

The answer is: $800$
