Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Let $w$ be the width of each of the identical rectangles. Since $PQ=3w$, $RS=2x$ and $PQ=RS$ (because $PQRS$ is a rectangle), then $2x = 3w$, or $$w=\frac{2}{3}x.$$ Therefore, the area of each of the five identical rectangles is $$x\left(\frac{2}{3}x\right)=\frac{2}{3}x^2.$$ Since the area of $PQRS$ is 4000 and it is made up of five of these identical smaller rectangles, then $$5\left(\frac{2}{3}x^2\right)=4000$$ or $$\frac{10}{3}x^2 = 4000$$ or $x^2 = 1200$ or $x \approx 34.6$ which, when rounded off to the nearest integer, is $\boxed{35}.$ The answer is $\boxed{35}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. 

The first expression is zero when $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x - y| - 10 = 0$, which simplifies to $|x+y| = 10$ or $|x - y| = 10$. This represents a pair of parallel lines with a distance of 10 units between them.

The second expression is zero when $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$, which simplifies to $|x| = 8$ or $|y| = 8$. This represents a pair of parallel lines with a distance of 8 units from the origin.

The intersection of these lines form a rectangle with side lengths of 16 units and 20 units. The area of this rectangle is $16 \times 20 = 320$ square units.

So, the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points that satisfy the given equation is 320 square units.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_ 2= (-16,2).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that
\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as
\[\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1.\]Find $h + k + a + b.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

**Solution:**


This problem is a bit tricky and requires understanding of absolute value function and how it affects the equations. The absolute value function $|x|$ makes the value of $x$ always positive. So, when $|x|$ equals to a certain value, $x$ could be that value or its opposite. 

For the equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, for the equation to be $0$, both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)$ must be $0$. That means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$. By solving these four equations, we find that the points that satisfy this equation lie on the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, or $x - y = -10$.

Similarly, for the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, for the equation to be $0$, both $(\vert x \vert - 8)$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)$ must be $0$. That means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $x = 8$ or $x = -8$ and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. The points that satisfy this equation lie on the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, or $y = -8$.

The intersection of these lines form a square with side length $10$ (because the distance from $x + y = 10$ to $x + y = -10$ is $20$ and divided by $2$ is $10$, and this is the side length of the square). The area of the square is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $\boxed{100}$.

This problem is not solvable by direct sympy calculations, as it involves absolute value and piecewise function definitions. Let's try a different approach using geometric interpretation.

The given equation implies that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The equations $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ imply that the points that satisfy them form a square with side length 10 centered at the origin. The equations $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ imply that the points that satisfy them form a square with side length 16 centered at the origin.

The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for. This polygon is a square with side length 10 centered at the origin, but only within a square with side length 16 centered at the origin.

Therefore, the area of the polygon is the area of the smaller square, which is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Find the number of 10-tuples $(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{10})$ of real numbers such that
\[(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2 = \frac{1}{11}.\]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,
\begin{align*}
&[(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + \dots + 1^2 + 1^2)][(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2] \\
&\ge [(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + (x_2 - x_3) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10}]^2 = 1.
\end{align*}From the given condition, we have equality, so by the equality condition for Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[\frac{1 - x_1}{1} = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{1} = \frac{x_2 - x_3}{1} = \dots = \frac{x_9 - x_{10}}{1} = \frac{x_{10}}{1}.\]Let
\[d = 1 - x_1 = x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_3 = \dots = x_9 - x_{10} = x_{10}.\]Then
\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so
\[(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_{10}) = \left( \frac{10}{11}, \frac{9}{11}, \frac{8}{11}, \dots, \frac{1}{11} \right).\]In particular, there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

This problem involves understanding the zero product property in algebra. If the product of two expressions is zero, then at least one of the expressions must be zero. Therefore, we can break down the problem into solving each of the factors equal to zero.

The equation is given as: 
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]

Setting each factor equal to zero gives us:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \implies \vert x + y \vert = 10$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \implies \vert x - y \vert = 10$
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \implies \vert x \vert = 8$
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \implies \vert y \vert = 8$

The solutions to these equations are the vertices of the polygon. The vertices are $(8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, $(-8, 0)$, $(0, -8)$, $(0, 0)$, $(10, 10)$, $(-10, -10)$, $(10, -10)$, and $(-10, 10)$. 

To find the area of the polygon, we can use the Shoelace formula. The Shoelace formula is a method to find the area of a polygon given its vertices. The formula is:
\[Area = \frac{1}{2} \vert (x_1y_2 + x_2y_3 + \dots + x_ny_1) - (y_1x_2 + y_2x_3 + \dots + y_nx_1) \vert.\]

Applying the Shoelace formula to the vertices of the polygon gives:
\[Area = \frac{1}{2} \vert (8*8 + 0*0 + -8*-8 + 0*0 + 10*10 + -10*-10 + 10*-10 + -10*10) - (0*10 + 8*0 + 0*-8 + 8*0 + 10*-10 + -10*10 + 10*10 + -10*-10) \vert = \frac{1}{2} \vert (64 + 64 + 64 + 64 + 100 + 100 + 100 + 100) - (0 + 0 - 64 + 0 - 100 - 100 + 100 + 100) \vert = \frac{1}{2} \vert 512 + 256 \vert = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 768 = 384.\]

Therefore, the area of the polygon is 384 square units. The answer is: $384$

label("$x$", (x/2, -0.1), S);

[/asy]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Let $w$ be the width of each of the identical rectangles. Since $PQ=3w$, $RS=2x$ and $PQ=RS$ (because $PQRS$ is a rectangle), then $2x = 3w$, or $$w=\frac{2}{3}x.$$ Therefore, the area of each of the five identical rectangles is $$x\left(\frac{2}{3}x\right)=\frac{2}{3}x^2.$$ Since the area of $PQRS$ is 4000 and it is made up of five of these identical smaller rectangles, then $$5\left(\frac{2}{3}x^2\right)=4000$$ or $$\frac{10}{3}x^2 = 4000$$ or $x^2 = 1200$ or $x \approx 34.6$ which, when rounded off to the nearest integer, is $\boxed{35}.$ The answer is $\boxed{35}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we first need to understand the given equation. The equation is equal to zero, which means that either the first term or the second term is zero. This gives us two cases to consider.

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.

Case 2: $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.

Case 3: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $\vert x \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.

Case 4: $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

Now, we need to find the intersection points of these cases. From case 1 and case 2, we have four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. From case 3 and case 4, we have four more lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

By solving these systems of equations, we find the intersection points of these lines:

- $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$ from $x + y = 10$ and $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.
- $(8, -2)$, $(8, 2)$, $(-8, -2)$, and $(-8, 2)$ from $x - y = 10$ and $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.
- $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, and $(0, -10)$ from $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, and $x - y = -10$.

The points $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$ form a square with side length 4. The points $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, and $(0, -10)$ form a square with side length 20.

The area of the convex polygon formed by the intersection points is the sum of the areas of these two squares. The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of the smaller square is $4^2 = 16$ and the area of the larger square is $20^2 = 400$. Therefore, the total area of the convex polygon is $16 + 400 = 416$.
The answer is: $416$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"An ellipse is defined parametrically by
\[(x,y) = \left( \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t}, \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t} \right).\]Then the equation of the ellipse can be written in the form
\[Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0,\]where $A,$ $B,$ $C,$ $D,$ $E,$ and $F$ are integers, and $\gcd(|A|,|B|,|C|,|D|,|E|,|F|) = 1.$  Find $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F|.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
In the equation $y = \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\cos t$ to get
\[\cos t = \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3}.\]In the equation $x = \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\sin t$ to get
\[\sin t = \frac{1}{2} x (2 - \cos t) + 1 = \frac{1}{2} x \left( 2 - \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right) + 1 = 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)}.\]Since $\cos^2 t + \sin^2 t = 1,$
\[\left( \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right)^2 + \left( 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)} \right)^2 = 1.\]Multiplying both sides by $(2(y + 3))^2$ and expanding, it will simplify to
\[81x^2 - 36xy + 16y^2 - 108x + 240y + 900 = 0.\]Therefore, $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F| = 81 + 36 + 16 + 108 + 240 + 900 = \boxed{1381}.$ The answer is $\boxed{1381}$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either of the terms must be zero. We consider each term separately:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

We can solve these equations to find the vertices of the polygon:

1. If $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, then $x = 10$ and $y = 0$.
2. If $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$, then $x = 0$ and $y = 10$.
3. If $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$, then $x = 0$ and $y = -10$.
4. If $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$, then $x = -10$ and $y = 0$.
5. If $x = 8$ and $y = 8$, then the point is $(8, 8)$.
6. If $x = 8$ and $y = -8$, then the point is $(8, -8)$.
7. If $x = -8$ and $y = 8$, then the point is $(-8, 8)$.
8. If $x = -8$ and $y = -8$, then the point is $(-8, -8)$.

So the vertices of the polygon are $(0, 10)$, $(10, 0)$, $(0, -10)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$. Plotting these points on a coordinate plane, we see that the polygon is a square with side length 20. The area of the square is $20^2 = 400$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    # The side length of the square is 20
    side_length = 20

    # The area of the square is side_length^2
    area = side_length**2

    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 400

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output

The area of the convex polygon is 400. The answer is: $400$

## QUESTION 3 - 11

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many square units are in the area of the triangle whose vertices are the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the curve $y = (x-3)^2 (x+2)$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we need to find where this curve intersects the $x$ and $y$ axes.  If $y=0$, then $(x-3)^2(x+2)=0$, which has solutions of $x=3$ and $x=-2$.  If $x=0$, then $y=(-3)^2(2)=18$.  So, the curve has two $x$-intercepts and one $y$-intercept.  The length of the base along the $x$-axis is $3-(-2)=5$.  The height from this base is equal to the $y$-intercept, 18.  The area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 5\cdot 18=\boxed{45}$. The answer is $\boxed{45}$

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


The problem statement involves absolute value functions and a product of two terms equal to zero. This suggests that we can use the zero-product property to our advantage. We can break this problem into several steps:

1. Understand the zero-product property: If a product of two terms is zero, then at least one of the terms must be zero.
2. Break down the problem into smaller parts: The given equation can be broken down into two separate equations: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
3. Solve each equation: For each equation of the form $(\vert u \vert - k)^2 = 0$, it implies that $\vert u \vert = k$, which further simplifies to $u = k$ or $u = -k$. Therefore, we have four sets of solutions:
   - $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, $x - y = -10$, $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, $y = -8$.
4. Analyze the solutions: The solutions can be visualized as the intersections of the lines $x + y = \pm 10$, $x - y = \pm 10$, $x = \pm 8$, $y = \pm 8$. These lines form a square with side length 10, and the vertices of the square are at $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, -2)$.
5. Calculate the area of the square: The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side. The length of the side of the square is 10, so the area is $10^2 = 100$.

The area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points satisfying the given equation is 100.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def calculate_area():
    # The side length of the square is 10
    side_length = 10

    # The area of a square is the side length squared
    area = side_length ** 2

    return area

area = calculate_area()
print(area)
```

CODE RESULTS 100

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
100
```
The area of the convex polygon is $100$. The answer is $\boxed{100}$.
