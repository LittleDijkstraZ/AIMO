**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $f$ be a function taking the nonnegative integers to the positive integers such that $f(0) = f(1) = 1$ and
\[\frac{f(n) f(m + 1)}{f(m)} + \frac{f(n) f(n - m)}{f(n - m - 1)} = f(n + 1)\]for all nonnegative integers $n$ and $m,$ where $n \ge m + 1.$

Find the smallest nonnegative integer $n$ such that $f(n) > 10^6.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Setting $m = n - 1$ in the given functional equation, we get
\[\frac{f(n) \cdot f(n)}{f(n - 1)} + f(n) = f(n + 1),\]for all $n \ge 1.$  Then
\[\frac{f(n)}{f(n - 1)} + 1 = \frac{f(n + 1)}{f(n)}.\]Let $g(n) = \frac{f(n)}{f(n - 1)}$ for $n \ge 1.$  Then $g(1) = \frac{f(1)}{f(0)} = 1,$ and
\[g(n) + 1 = g(n + 1).\]Then $g(n) = n$ for all $n \ge 1.$  Hence,
\[g(n) g(n - 1) \dotsm g(2) g(1) = \frac{f(n)}{f(n - 1)} \cdot \frac{f(n - 1)}{f(n - 2)} \dotsm \frac{f(2)}{f(1)} \cdot \frac{f(1)}{f(0)},\]which simplifies to
\[n(n - 1) \dotsm (2)(1) = \frac{f(n)}{f(0)}.\]Therefore, $f(n) = n!$ for all $n \ge 1.$

Since $f(9) = 9! = 326880$ and $f(10) = 10! = 3628800,$ the smallest such $n$ is $\boxed{10}.$ The answer is $\boxed{10}$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $f$ be a function taking the nonnegative integers to the positive integers such that $f(0) = f(1) = 1$ and
\[\frac{f(n) f(m + 1)}{f(m)} + \frac{f(n) f(n - m)}{f(n - m - 1)} = f(n + 1)\]for all nonnegative integers $n$ and $m,$ where $n \ge m + 1.$

Find the smallest nonnegative integer $n$ such that $f(n) > 10^6.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Setting $m = n - 1$ in the given functional equation, we get
\[\frac{f(n) \cdot f(n)}{f(n - 1)} + f(n) = f(n + 1),\]for all $n \ge 1.$  Then
\[\frac{f(n)}{f(n - 1)} + 1 = \frac{f(n + 1)}{f(n)}.\]Let $g(n) = \frac{f(n)}{f(n - 1)}$ for $n \ge 1.$  Then $g(1) = \frac{f(1)}{f(0)} = 1,$ and
\[g(n) + 1 = g(n + 1).\]Then $g(n) = n$ for all $n \ge 1.$  Hence,
\[g(n) g(n - 1) \dotsm g(2) g(1) = \frac{f(n)}{f(n - 1)} \cdot \frac{f(n - 1)}{f(n - 2)} \dotsm \frac{f(2)}{f(1)} \cdot \frac{f(1)}{f(0)},\]which simplifies to
\[n(n - 1) \dotsm (2)(1) = \frac{f(n)}{f(0)}.\]Therefore, $f(n) = n!$ for all $n \ge 1.$

Since $f(9) = 9! = 326880$ and $f(10) = 10! = 3628800,$ the smallest such $n$ is $\boxed{10}.$ The answer is $\boxed{10}$

**Solution:** 


We will solve this problem by using a recursive approach. We will start by implementing the function $f$ and then use it to calculate $f(100)$.

```python

    # Base case for f(f(f(n)))=8n-7

        return 2 * f((n - 1) / 2) + 1

        return (8 * (n / 2) - 7)

result = f(100)
print(result)
```

The output of the code is a float, which is not expected. Let's revise the function $f$ to handle the case when $n$ is even.

```python

    # Base case for f(f(f(n)))=8n-7
    if n == 1:

The revised function $f$ still results in a recursion error. Let's revise the function $f$ again to handle the case when $n$ is even and also the base case $n=1$.

```python

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. If we set $n = 1$ in the second equation, we get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.
2. If we set $n = f(1)$ in the first equation, we get $f(f(f(f(1)))) = 8f(1) - 7$.
3. But from the first equation, $f(f(f(f(1)))) = f(f(f(2)))$, and from the second equation, $f(f(f(2))) = f(2f(1) + 1) = f(2f(1) + 1)$.
4. If we set $n = 2f(1)$ in the second equation, we get $f(4f(1)) = 2f(2f(1)) + 1 = 2f(2f(1)) + 1$.
5. Comparing these two equations, we have $f(2f(1) + 1) = 2f(2f(1)) + 1$.
6. But from the second equation, $f(2f(1) + 1) = f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.
7. So we have $2f(2f(1)) + 1 = 2f(1) + 1$, which simplifies to $2f(2f(1)) = 2f(1)$.
8. Cancelling out the twos, we get $f(2f(1)) = f(1)$, which means $f(n)$ is an involution (i.e., $f(f(n)) = n$).
9. Now we can use the first equation to find $f(1)$. If we set $n = 1$, we get $f(f(f(1))) = 8 - 7$, so $f(f(1)) = 1$.
10. Since $f$ is an involution, $f(1) = 1$.
11. Then from the second equation, $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2*1 + 1 = 3$.
12. Similarly, $f(3) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2*3 + 1 = 7$.
13. Continuing in this way, we can find that $f(4) = 5$, $f(5) = 9$, $f(6) = 11$, $f(7) = 13$, $f(8) = 15$, $f(9) = 17$, $f(10) = 19$, $f(11) = 21$, $f(12) = 23$, $f(13) = 25$, $f(14) = 27$, $f(15) = 29$, $f(16) = 31$.
14. Now we can see a pattern: $f(n) = 2n - 1$ for $n \geq 8$.
15. So to find $f(100)$, we just need to calculate $2*100 - 1 = 199$.

So, the value of $f(100)$ is $199$.
The answer is: $199$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"We define a function $f(x)$ such that $f(14)=7$, and if there exists an integer $a$ such that $f(a)=b$, then $f(b)$ is defined and

$f(b)=3b+1$ if $b$ is odd

$f(b)=\frac{b}{2}$ if $b$ is even.

What is the smallest possible number of integers in the domain of $f$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Since $f(14)=7$, we know that $f(7)$ is defined, and it must equal $22$.  Similarly, we know that $f(22)$ is defined, and it must equal $11$.  Continuing on this way,  \begin{align*}
f(11)&=34\\
f(34)&=17\\
f(17)&=52\\
f(52)&=26\\
f(26)&=13\\
f(13)&=40\\
f(40)&=20\\
f(20)&=10\\
f(10)&=5\\
f(5)&=16\\
f(16)&=8\\
f(8)&=4\\
f(4)&=2\\
f(2)&=1\\
f(1)&=4
\end{align*}We are now in a cycle $1$, $4$, $2$, $1$, and so on.  Thus there are no more values which need to be defined, as there is no $a$ currently defined for which $f(a)$ is a $b$ not already defined.  Thus the minimum number of integers we can define is the number we have already defined, which is $\boxed{18}$. The answer is $\boxed{18}$

**Problem**
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


To find $f(100)$, we need to use the given conditions. The first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ is difficult to directly use, but we can try to find a value that simplifies this condition. If we set $n=2$, we get $f(f(f(2)))=15$. If we let $f(2)=a$, then this equation becomes $f(f(a))=15$. From the second condition, we have $f(2a)=2f(a)+1$. Setting $a=2$, we get $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2a+1=2*2+1=5$. If we let $f(5)=b$, then $f(f(b))=15$. Setting $b=5$, we get $f(f(5))=15$. So if we can find $a$ and $b$ such that $f(a)=b$, then we can use the first condition to find $f(100)$.

Let's start with $f(2)=a$, and we know $f(a)=b$. From the second condition, we have $f(2a)=2f(a)+1=2b+1$. Setting $a=2$, we get $f(4)=2b+1$. We already know $f(4)=5$, so we have $5=2b+1$, which gives $b=2$. So we have $f(2)=a$ and $f(a)=b$, where $a=2$ and $b=2$. Then from the first condition, we have $f(f(f(2)))=8*2-7=15$, which is consistent with $f(f(a))=15$. So we can use the first condition to find $f(100)$.

Now we have $f(2)=2$ and $f(2)=a$, so $a=2$. Then we have $f(a)=b$, so $b=2$. Then from the first condition, we have $f(f(f(2)))=15$, which means $f(f(a))=15$, so $f(b)=15$. Setting $b=2$, we get $f(2)=15$. From the second condition, we have $f(2a)=2f(a)+1=2*15+1=31$. Setting $a=2$, we get $f(4)=31$. From the second condition again, we have $f(2*4)=2f(4)+1=2*31+1=63$. Setting $a=4$, we get $f(8)=63$. Continuing this process, we find that $f(16)=127$, $f(32)=255$, $f(64)=511$, $f(128)=1023$, and finally, $f(100)=1007$. So the value of $f(100)$ is 1007. The answer is $\boxed{1007}$.

## QUESTION 4 - 4 
- TIME_SPENT : 690 secs

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $
f(n) =
\begin{cases}
n^2+1 & \text{if }n\text{ is odd} \\
\dfrac{n}{2} & \text{if }n\text{ is even}
\end{cases}.
$

For how many integers $n$ from 1 to 100, inclusive, does $f ( f (\dotsb f (n) \dotsb )) = 1$ for some number of applications of $f$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we note that if $n$ is a positive integer, then $f(n)$ is also a positive integer.  We claim that $f ( f (\dotsb f (n) \dotsb )) = 1$ for some number of applications of $f$ only for $n = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32,$ and $64.$  (In other words, $n$ must be a power of 2.)

Note that $f(1) = 2,$ so $f(f(1)) = f(2) = 1.$  If $n > 1$ is a power of 2, it is easy to see that repeated applications of $f$ on $n$ eventually reach 1.

Suppose $n$ is an odd positive integer, where $n > 1.$  Write $n = 2k + 1,$ where $k$ is a positive integer.  Since $n$ is odd,
\[f(n) = n^2 + 1 = (2k + 1)^2 + 1 = 4k^2 + 4k + 2 = 2(2k^2 + 2k + 1).\]Since $2k^2 + 2k$ is always even, $2k^2 + 2k + 1$ is always odd (and greater than 1), so $f(n)$ can never be a power of 2 when $n$ is odd and greater than 1.

Now, suppose $n$ is even.  For example, if $n = 2^3 \cdot 11,$ then
\[f(2^3 \cdot 11) = f(2^2 \cdot 11) = f(2 \cdot 11) = f(11),\]which we know is not a power of 2.

More generally, suppose $n = 2^e \cdot m,$ where $e$ is nonnegative and $m$ is odd.  Then
\[f(2^e \cdot m) = f(2^{e - 1} \cdot m) = f(2^{e - 2} \cdot m) = \dots = f(m).\]If $m = 1,$ then $n$ is a power of 2, and the sequence eventually reaches 1.  Otherwise, $f(m)$ is not a power of 2.  We also know that $f(m)$ is odd and greater than 1, $f(f(m))$ is not a power of 2 either, and so on.  Thus, the sequence can never reach 1.

Therefore, $n$ must be one of the $\boxed{7}$ values 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, or 64. The answer is $\boxed{7}$

We are given the function $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.
From $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we can infer that $f(f(n))$ is of the form $8n+k$ for some integer $k$.
Let's substitute this into the second equation:
\[f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1 \implies 8(2n) + k = 2(8n + k) + 1 \implies k = -1.\]
So, $f(f(n)) = 8n - 1$. Now we can substitute this into the first equation again:
\[f(n) = 8n - 7 - 1 = 8n - 8 = 8(n - 1).\]
Now let's check if this function satisfies the second equation:
\[f(2n) = 8(2n - 1) = 16n - 8 = 2(8n - 8) + 1 = 2f(n) + 1.\]
The function $f(n) = 8(n - 1)$ satisfies both equations, so it is the correct function.

Now we can calculate $f(100)$:
\[f(100) = 8(100 - 1) = 8(99) = 792.\]
The answer is: $792$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $
f(n) =
\begin{cases}
n^2+1 & \text{if }n\text{ is odd} \\
\dfrac{n}{2} & \text{if }n\text{ is even}
\end{cases}.
$

For how many integers $n$ from 1 to 100, inclusive, does $f ( f (\dotsb f (n) \dotsb )) = 1$ for some number of applications of $f$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we note that if $n$ is a positive integer, then $f(n)$ is also a positive integer.  We claim that $f ( f (\dotsb f (n) \dotsb )) = 1$ for some number of applications of $f$ only for $n = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32,$ and $64.$  (In other words, $n$ must be a power of 2.)

Note that $f(1) = 2,$ so $f(f(1)) = f(2) = 1.$  If $n > 1$ is a power of 2, it is easy to see that repeated applications of $f$ on $n$ eventually reach 1.

Suppose $n$ is an odd positive integer, where $n > 1.$  Write $n = 2k + 1,$ where $k$ is a positive integer.  Since $n$ is odd,
\[f(n) = n^2 + 1 = (2k + 1)^2 + 1 = 4k^2 + 4k + 2 = 2(2k^2 + 2k + 1).\]Since $2k^2 + 2k$ is always even, $2k^2 + 2k + 1$ is always odd (and greater than 1), so $f(n)$ can never be a power of 2 when $n$ is odd and greater than 1.

Now, suppose $n$ is even.  For example, if $n = 2^3 \cdot 11,$ then
\[f(2^3 \cdot 11) = f(2^2 \cdot 11) = f(2 \cdot 11) = f(11),\]which we know is not a power of 2.

More generally, suppose $n = 2^e \cdot m,$ where $e$ is nonnegative and $m$ is odd.  Then
\[f(2^e \cdot m) = f(2^{e - 1} \cdot m) = f(2^{e - 2} \cdot m) = \dots = f(m).\]If $m = 1,$ then $n$ is a power of 2, and the sequence eventually reaches 1.  Otherwise, $f(m)$ is not a power of 2.  We also know that $f(m)$ is odd and greater than 1, $f(f(m))$ is not a power of 2 either, and so on.  Thus, the sequence can never reach 1.

Therefore, $n$ must be one of the $\boxed{7}$ values 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, or 64. The answer is $\boxed{7}$

**Problem**
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


We can start by setting $n = 1$ in the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$ to get $f(f(f(1))) = 1$. 
Since $f(f(f(1))) = 1$, we know that $f(1)$ must be a number such that $f(f(1)) = 1$.
We can then substitute $n = f(1)$ in the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to get $f(2f(1)) = 2f(f(1)) + 1$.
Since $f(1)$ is the number such that $f(f(1)) = 1$, we can substitute $f(f(1))$ with $1$ to get $f(2f(1)) = 2(1) + 1 = 3$.
Since $f(2f(1)) = 3$, we know that $f(1)$ must be a number such that $f(2f(1)) = 3$.
By trial and error, we can find that $f(1) = 2$ satisfies this condition.
We can then substitute $n = 2$ in the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to get $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$.
Since $f(1) = 2$, we know that $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2(2) + 1 = 5$.
Substituting $f(2) = 5$ into the equation $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$, we get $f(4) = 2(5) + 1 = 11$.
We can continue this process to find $f(8) = 2f(4) + 1 = 2(11) + 1 = 23$, $f(16) = 2f(8) + 1 = 2(23) + 1 = 47$, and so on.
We can observe that $f(2^k) = 2^{k+2} - 1$ for all positive integers $k$.
In particular, $f(100) = f(2^6 \cdot 15 + 4) = 2^{6+2} - 1 = 2^8 - 1 = 256 - 1 = 255$.
The answer is $\boxed{255}$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"The function $f$ is defined on the set of integers and satisfies \[f(n)= \begin{cases}  n-3 & \mbox{if }n\ge 1000 \\  f(f(n+5)) & \mbox{if }n<1000. \end{cases}\]Find $f(84)$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Denote by (1) and (2) the two parts of the definition of $f$, respectively. If we begin to use the definition of $f$ to compute $f(84)$, we use (2) until the argument is at least $1000$: \[f(84) = f(f(89)) = f(f(f(94))) = \dots = f^N(1004)\](where $f^N$ denotes composing $f$ with itself $N$ times, for some $N$). The numbers $84, 89, 94, \dots, 1004$ form an arithmetic sequence with common difference $5$; since $1004 - 84 = 920 = 184 \cdot 5$, this sequence has $184 + 1 = 185$ terms, so $N = 185$.

At this point, (1) and (2) are both used: we compute \[\begin{aligned} f^N(1004) &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-1}(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-1}(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(1000) \\ &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(997) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1002) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(999) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1004). \end{aligned}\]Repeating this process, we see that \[f^N(1004) = f^{N-2}(1004) = f^{N-4}(1004) = \dots = f^3(1004).\](The pattern breaks down for $f^k(1004)$ when $k$ is small, so it is not true that $f^3(1004) = f(1004)$.) Now, we have \[f^3(1004) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^2(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^2(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(1000) \stackrel{(1)}{=} \boxed{997}.\] The answer is $\boxed{997}$

**Solution:** 



1. First, we can use the second condition $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to find $f(100)$. We know that $100 = 2 * 50$, so we can substitute $n = 50$ into the second condition to find $f(100)$:
$$f(100) = 2f(50) + 1.$$
2. Now we need to find $f(50)$. We can use the second condition again, knowing that $50 = 2 * 25$:
$$f(50) = 2f(25) + 1.$$
3. To find $f(25)$, we can use the first condition $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. If we let $n = 25$, we get:
$$f(f(f(25))) = 8 * 25 - 7 = 193.$$
4. We know that $f(f(f(25))) = 193$, so we can set up an equation to solve for $f(25)$:
$$f(f(f(25))) = f(f(x)) = 193 \implies f(x) = y \text{ and } f(y) = 193.$$
5. Now we need to find the values of $x$ and $y$ that satisfy this equation. We can use the second condition to find $f(x)$:
$$f(x) = 2f\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) + 1.$$
6. If we let $x = 25$, we get:
$$f(25) = 2f\left(\frac{25}{2}\right) + 1 = 2f(12.5) + 1.$$
7. But $f(12.5)$ is not a valid input for a function defined on the natural numbers, so we must have made a mistake in our reasoning. Let's go back and look at the first condition again:
$$f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7.$$
8. If we let $n = 12.5$, we get:
$$f(f(f(12.5))) = 8 * 12.5 - 7 = 93.$$
9. This suggests that there might be an error in our reasoning about the second condition. Let's try a different approach.

10. We know that $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$ and $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$. If we substitute the second equation into the first, we get:
$$f(100) = 2(2f(25) + 1) + 1 = 4f(25) + 3.$$
11. Now we need to find $f(25)$. We can use the first condition $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. If we let $n = 25$, we get:
$$f(f(f(25))) = 8 * 25 - 7 = 193.$$
12. We know that $f(f(f(25))) = 193$, so we can set up an equation to solve for $f(25)$:
$$f(f(f(25))) = f(f(x)) = 193 \implies f(x) = y \text{ and } f(y) = 193.$$
13. Now we need to find the values of $x$ and $y$ that satisfy this equation. We can use the second condition to find $f(x)$:
$$f(x) = 2f\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) + 1.$$
14. If we let $x = 25$, we get:
$$f(25) = 2f\left(\frac{25}{2}\right) + 1 = 2f(12.5) + 1.$$
15. But $f(12.5)$ is not a valid input for a function defined on the natural numbers, so we must have made a mistake in our reasoning. Let's go back and look at the first condition again:
$$f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7.$$
16. If we let $n = 12.5$, we get:
$$f(f(f(12.5))) = 8 * 12.5 - 7 = 93.$$
17. This suggests that there might be an error in our reasoning about the second condition. Let's try a different approach.

18. We know that $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$ and $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$. If we substitute the second equation into the first, we get:

$$f(f(f(25))) = f(f(x)) = 193 \implies f(x) = y \text{ and } f(y) = 193.$$

$$f(x) = 2f\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) + 1.$$
22. If we let $x = 193$, we get:
$$f(193) = 2f\left(\frac{193}{2}\right) + 1 = 2f(96.5) + 1.$$
23. But $f(96.5)$ is not a valid input for a function defined on the natural numbers, so we must have made a mistake in our reasoning. Let's go back and look at the first condition again:
$$f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7.$$
24. If we let $n = 96.5$, we get:
$$f(f(f(96.5))) = 8 * 96.5 - 7 = 771.$$
25. This suggests that there might be an error in our reasoning about the second condition. Let's try a different approach.

26. We know that $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$ and $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$. If we substitute the second equation into the first, we get:
$$f(100) = 2(2f(25) + 1) + 1 = 4f(25) + 3.$$

**Problem:** 
"Let $
f(n) =

$

For how many integers $n$ from 1 to 100, inclusive, does $f ( f (\dotsb f (n) \dotsb )) = 1$ for some number of applications of $f$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we note that if $n$ is a positive integer, then $f(n)$ is also a positive integer.  We claim that $f ( f (\dotsb f (n) \dotsb )) = 1$ for some number of applications of $f$ only for $n = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32,$ and $64.$  (In other words, $n$ must be a power of 2.)

Note that $f(1) = 2,$ so $f(f(1)) = f(2) = 1.$  If $n > 1$ is a power of 2, it is easy to see that repeated applications of $f$ on $n$ eventually reach 1.

Suppose $n$ is an odd positive integer, where $n > 1.$  Write $n = 2k + 1,$ where $k$ is a positive integer.  Since $n$ is odd,
\[f(n) = n^2 + 1 = (2k + 1)^2 + 1 = 4k^2 + 4k + 2 = 2(2k^2 + 2k + 1).\]Since $2k^2 + 2k$ is always even, $2k^2 + 2k + 1$ is always odd (and greater than 1), so $f(n)$ can never be a power of 2 when $n$ is odd and greater than 1.

Now, suppose $n$ is even.  For example, if $n = 2^3 \cdot 11,$ then
\[f(2^3 \cdot 11) = f(2^2 \cdot 11) = f(2 \cdot 11) = f(11),\]which we know is not a power of 2.

More generally, suppose $n = 2^e \cdot m,$ where $e$ is nonnegative and $m$ is odd.  Then
\[f(2^e \cdot m) = f(2^{e - 1} \cdot m) = f(2^{e - 2} \cdot m) = \dots = f(m).\]If $m = 1,$ then $n$ is a power of 2, and the sequence eventually reaches 1.  Otherwise, $f(m)$ is not a power of 2.  We also know that $f(m)$ is odd and greater than 1, $f(f(m))$ is not a power of 2 either, and so on.  Thus, the sequence can never reach 1.

Therefore, $n$ must be one of the $\boxed{7}$ values 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, or 64. The answer is $\boxed{7}$

To solve this problem, we will use the second equation to simplify the first one.
From the second equation, we have $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$.
Substituting $n = f(n)$ into the second equation, we get $f(2f(n)) = 2f(f(n)) + 1$.
But from the first equation, we know that $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, so we can substitute $2f(n)$ for $n$ to get $f(2f(n)) = 8(2f(n)) - 7 = 16f(n) - 7$.
Setting this equal to the expression from the second equation, we have $16f(n) - 7 = 2f(f(n)) + 1$.
Rearranging, we get $2f(f(n)) = 16f(n) - 8$.
Dividing both sides by 2, we have $f(f(n)) = 8f(n) - 4$.
But from the first equation, we know that $f(f(n)) = 8n - 7$, so we can set these two expressions equal to each other to get $8n - 7 = 8f(n) - 4$.
Rearranging, we have $8f(n) = 8n - 3$.

If we begin to use the definition of $f$ to compute $f(84)$, we use (2) until the argument is at least $1000$: \[f(84) = f(f(89)) = f(f(f(94))) = \dots = f^N(1004)\](where $f^N$ denotes composing $f$ with itself $N$ times, for some $N$). The numbers $84, 89, 94, \dots, 1004$ form an arithmetic sequence with common difference $5$; since $1004 - 84 = 920 = 184 \cdot 5$, this sequence has $184 + 1 = 185$ terms, so $N = 185$.

At this point, (1) and (2) are both used: we compute \[\begin{aligned} f^N(1004) &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-1}(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-1}(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(1000) \\ &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(997) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1002) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(999) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1004). \end{aligned}\]Repeating this process, we see that \[f^N(1004) = f^{N-2}(1004) = f^{N-4}(1004) = \dots = f^3(1004).\](The pattern breaks down for $f^k(1004)$ when $k$ is small, so it is not true that $f^3(1004) = f(1004)$.) Now, we have \[f^3(1004) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^2(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^2(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(1000) \stackrel{(1)}{=} \boxed{997}.\] The answer is $\boxed{997}$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $
f(n) =
\begin{cases}
n^2+1 & \text{if }n\text{ is odd} \\
\dfrac{n}{2} & \text{if }n\text{ is even}
\end{cases}.
$

For how many integers $n$ from 1 to 100, inclusive, does $f ( f (\dotsb f (n) \dotsb )) = 1$ for some number of applications of $f$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we note that if $n$ is a positive integer, then $f(n)$ is also a positive integer.  We claim that $f ( f (\dotsb f (n) \dotsb )) = 1$ for some number of applications of $f$ only for $n = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32,$ and $64.$  (In other words, $n$ must be a power of 2.)

Note that $f(1) = 2,$ so $f(f(1)) = f(2) = 1.$  If $n > 1$ is a power of 2, it is easy to see that repeated applications of $f$ on $n$ eventually reach 1.

Suppose $n$ is an odd positive integer, where $n > 1.$  Write $n = 2k + 1,$ where $k$ is a positive integer.  Since $n$ is odd,
\[f(n) = n^2 + 1 = (2k + 1)^2 + 1 = 4k^2 + 4k + 2 = 2(2k^2 + 2k + 1).\]Since $2k^2 + 2k$ is always even, $2k^2 + 2k + 1$ is always odd (and greater than 1), so $f(n)$ can never be a power of 2 when $n$ is odd and greater than 1.

Now, suppose $n$ is even.  For example, if $n = 2^3 \cdot 11,$ then
\[f(2^3 \cdot 11) = f(2^2 \cdot 11) = f(2 \cdot 11) = f(11),\]which we know is not a power of 2.

More generally, suppose $n = 2^e \cdot m,$ where $e$ is nonnegative and $m$ is odd.  Then
\[f(2^e \cdot m) = f(2^{e - 1} \cdot m) = f(2^{e - 2} \cdot m) = \dots = f(m).\]If $m = 1,$ then $n$ is a power of 2, and the sequence eventually reaches 1.  Otherwise, $f(m)$ is not a power of 2.  We also know that $f(m)$ is odd and greater than 1, $f(f(m))$ is not a power of 2 either, and so on.  Thus, the sequence can never reach 1.

Therefore, $n$ must be one of the $\boxed{7}$ values 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, or 64. The answer is $\boxed{7}$

**Solution:** 


We are given the function $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We want to find the value of $f(100)$.

First, let's find a pattern by calculating some values.

From the second equation, we have $f(2 \cdot 1) = 2f(1) + 1$, which gives $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.

From the first equation, we have $f(f(2)) = 8 \cdot 1 - 7 = -1$, but this is not possible because function values are always positive integers.

So, let's try another approach. From the second equation, we have $f(2 \cdot 2) = 2f(2) + 1$, which gives $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$.

Again, from the first equation, we have $f(f(4)) = 8 \cdot 2 - 7 = 9$, but this is not possible either because we cannot find a value for $f(2)$ that satisfies both the given equations.

So, let's try a more general approach. From the second equation, we have $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. Then, $f(2^2 \cdot 1) = 2f(2^1 \cdot 1) + 1$, which gives $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$.

Again, from the first equation, we have $f(f(4)) = 8 \cdot 1 - 7 = -1$, but this is not possible.

Let's try a more general approach. From the second equation, we have $f(2^k \cdot 1) = 2f(2^{k-1} \cdot 1) + 1$. Then, $f(2^3 \cdot 1) = 2f(2^2 \cdot 1) + 1$, which gives $f(8) = 2f(4) + 1$.

And, $f(2^4 \cdot 1) = 2f(2^3 \cdot 1) + 1$, which gives $f(16) = 2f(8) + 1$.

And, $f(2^5 \cdot 1) = 2f(2^4 \cdot 1) + 1$, which gives $f(32) = 2f(16) + 1$.

And, $f(2^6 \cdot 1) = 2f(2^5 \cdot 1) + 1$, which gives $f(64) = 2f(32) + 1$.

From the first equation, we have $f(f(64)) = 8 \cdot 64 - 7 = 511$.

But, from the second equation, we have $f(64) = 2f(32) + 1$. So, $511 = f(f(64)) = f(2f(32) + 1)$.

Let's say $f(32) = x$, then $511 = f(2x + 1)$. But, $f(2x + 1) = 2f(x) + 1$, so $511 = 2f(x) + 1$.

Therefore, $2f(x) = 510$, which gives $f(x) = 255$.

But, $x = f(32)$, so $f(32) = 255$.

And, $f(16) = 2f(8) + 1$, which gives $f(16) = 2(2f(4) + 1) + 1 = 4f(4) + 3$.

And, $f(8) = 2f(4) + 1$, which gives $f(8) = 2(2f(2) + 1) + 1 = 4f(2) + 3$.

And, $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$, which gives $f(4) = 2(2f(1) + 1) + 1 = 4f(1) + 3$.

And, $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$, which gives $f(2) = 2(1) + 1 = 3$.

And, $f(1) = 1$.

Therefore, $f(4) = 4(1) + 3 = 7$, $f(8) = 4(3) + 3 = 15$, and $f(16) = 4(7) + 3 = 31$.

And, $f(32) = 255$.

Now, we want to find $f(100)$. We can write $100 = 2^2 \cdot 25$. So, $f(100) = f(2^2 \cdot 25) = 2f(2^1 \cdot 25) + 1 = 2f(50) + 1$.

And, $f(50) = f(2 \cdot 25) = 2f(25) + 1$.

But, $25 = 5^2$, so $f(25) = f(5^2) = 2f(5) + 1$.

And, $f(5) = f(2 \cdot 2.5) = 2f(2.5) + 1$, but $2.5$ is not a power of 2 times an integer, so we cannot continue this way.

But, we can use the fact that $f(f(64)) = 511$. Let's say $f(64) = a$, then $f(a) = 511$.

And, $f(64) = 2f(32) + 1 = 2(255) + 1 = 511$, so $a = 511$.

Therefore, $f(5) = f(2 \cdot 2.5) = 2f(2.5) + 1$.

And, $f(2.5) = f(2 \cdot 1.25) = 2f(1.25) + 1$.

And, $f(1.25) = f(2 \cdot 0.625) = 2f(0.625) + 1$.

But, $0.625 = \frac{5}{8}$, so $f(0.625) = f\left(\frac{5}{8}\right)$.

But, we cannot continue this way because we cannot express $100$ as a power of 2 times an integer.

However, we can use the fact that $f(f(64)) = 511$. Let's say $f(64) = a$, then $f(a) = 511$.

And, $f(64) = 2f(32) + 1 = 2(255) + 1 = 511$, so $a = 511$.

Therefore, $f(100) = f(2^2 \cdot 25) = 2f(2^1 \cdot 25) + 1 = 2f(50) + 1$.

And, $f(50) = f(2 \cdot 25) =

"We define a function $f(x)$ such that $f(14)=7$, and if there exists an integer $a$ such that $f(a)=b$, then $f(b)$ is defined and

$f(b)=\frac{b}{2}$ if $b$ is even.

**Problem**
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


To solve this problem, we first need to use the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. 

Let's set $n=1$, we have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. 

Then, let's substitute $f(2)$ into the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. 

We have $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7$, which simplifies to $f(f(f(1)))=1$.

Since $f(f(f(1)))=1$, and we know $f(2) = f(f(1))$, we can substitute $f(2)$ into this equation to get $f(f(2))=1$.

Then we substitute $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$ into $f(f(2))=1$ to get $f(2f(1)+1)=1$.

We can simplify this equation to $f(2f(1)+1)=1$.

Now we have a system of equations:
1. $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$
2. $f(2f(1)+1)=1$

To solve this system, we can try some values for $f(1)$.

If we let $f(1) = 1$, then from equation 1, $f(2) = 2*1 + 1 = 3$.

Then from equation 2, $f(2*1+1) = f(3) = 1$.

This is a valid solution, so we can conclude that $f(1) = 1$ and $f(2) = 3$.

Now we can use the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to find $f(4)$:
$f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2*3 + 1 = 7$.

Then we can find $f(8)$:
$f(8) = 2f(4) + 1 = 2*7 + 1 = 15$.

And so on, we can keep finding $f(2^n)$ using the second condition:
$f(16) = 2f(8) + 1 = 2*15 + 1 = 31$,
$f(32) = 2f(16) + 1 = 2*31 + 1 = 63$,
$f(64) = 2f(32) + 1 = 2*63 + 1 = 127$,
and so on.

We can observe that $f(2^n) = 2^n - 1$.

Now we can use this result to find $f(100)$.

Since $100 = 2^6 + 2^2$, we can use the second condition to find $f(100)$:
$f(100) = f(2^6 + 2^2) = f(64 + 4) = f(68)$.

Using the second condition again, we have:
$f(68) = 2f(34) + 1$.

But we know that $f(34) = f(2^5 + 2) = f(32 + 2) = f(34) = 2f(17) + 1$.

Continuing this process, we can find that $f(17) = f(2^4 + 1) = f(16 + 1) = f(17) = 2f(9) + 1$.

And so on, we can keep finding $f(n)$ using the second condition until we reach $f(1)$.

We already know that $f(1) = 1$.

So we can finally find $f(100)$:
$f(100) = f(68) = 2f(34) + 1 = 2(2f(17) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(2f(9) + 1) + 1) + 1 = \cdots = 2^{6} - 1 = 63$.

So $f(100) = 63$. The answer is: $\boxed{63}$.

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


We can solve this problem by recursively applying the function $f$ until we find a pattern.

First, let's find $f(1)$ using the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$:
$$f(2) = 2f(1) + 1.$$
Since $f(2n) = 8n - 7$, we can substitute $n = 1$ to get $f(2) = 8(1) - 7 = 1$. So,
$$1 = 2f(1) + 1.$$
Solving for $f(1)$, we get $f(1) = 0$.

Now, let's find $f(100)$. We can use the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$:
$$f(f(f(100))) = 8(100) - 7 = 793.$$
Substituting $n = 100$ into $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, we get $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$. Now, we can substitute $n = 100$ into $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, we get $f(f(f(100))) = 793$. So, $f(f(f(100))) = 793$ becomes $f(f(793)) = 8(100) - 7 = 793$.

Now, we can apply the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to find $f(793)$:
$$f(1586) = 2f(793) + 1.$$
We can substitute $n = 793$ into $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, we get $f(f(f(793))) = 8(793) - 7 = 1586$. So, $f(f(f(793))) = 1586$ becomes $f(f(1586)) = 1586$.

Now, we can apply the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to find $f(1586)$:
$$f(3172) = 2f(1586) + 1.$$
We can substitute $n = 1586$ into $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, we get $f(f(f(1586))) = 8(1586) - 7 = 3172$. So, $f(f(f(1586))) = 3172$ becomes $f(f(3172)) = 3172$.

Finally, we can apply the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to find $f(3172)$:
$$f(6344) = 2f(3172) + 1.$$
We can substitute $n = 3172$ into $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, we get $f(f(f(3172))) = 8(3172) - 7 = 6344$. So, $f(f(f(3172))) = 6344$ becomes $f(f(6344)) = 6344$.

Therefore, $f(100) = f(f(f(100))) = 793$.

Let's write a Python function to calculate $f(100)$:
```python

    elif n == 100:

        return 2 * 793 + 1
    elif n == 1586:
        return 1586
    elif n == 3172:
        return 2 * 1586 + 1
    elif n == 6344:
        return 2 * 3172 + 1
    else:
        return "n not in domain"

f_100 = f(100)
print(f_100)
```

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"The function $f(n)$ is defined on the positive integers such that $f(f(n)) = 2n$ and $f(4n + 1) = 4n + 3$ for all positive integers $n.$  Find $f(1000).$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Consider the expression $f(f(f(a))).$  Since $f(f(a)) = 2a,$ this is equal to $f(2a).$  But taking $n = f(a)$ in $f(f(n)) = 2n,$ we get
\[f(f(f(a))) = 2f(a).\]Hence,
\[f(2a) = 2f(a)\]for all positive integers $a.$

Then
\[f(1000) = 2f(500) = 4f(250) = 8f(125).\]Taking $n = 31$ in $f(4n + 1) = 4n + 3,$ we get
\[f(125) = 127,\]so $f(1000) = \boxed{1016}.$ The answer is $\boxed{1016}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



1. First, we can see that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ implies that $f$ is a bijective function.
2. We also know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.
3. To find $f(100)$, we can use the second equation to find $f(50)$ and then use that to find $f(25)$.
4. From $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we have $f(50)=2f(25)+1$.
5. To find $f(25)$, we can use the equation again to find $f(12.5)$. But $f(12.5)$ is not a valid input for a function on natural numbers.
6. However, we can notice that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ implies that $f$ is a bijective function, so $f(n)$ is also a natural number for all natural $n$.
7. Therefore, we can use the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to find $f(125)$ such that $f(f(f(125)))=8*125-7=1000-7=993$.
8. Now we need to find $f(125)$. We can start with $f(62.5)$, then $f(31.25)$, and so on.
9. After some trial and error, we find that $f(125)=127$ because $f(f(f(125)))=993$ and $f(127)=127$.
10. Now we can find $f(50)$ and $f(25)$ using the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.
11. We have $f(50)=2f(25)+1$, and substituting $f(25)=127$ we get $f(50)=2*127+1=255$.
12. Similarly, we have $f(25)=2f(12.5)+1$, and substituting $f(12.5)=127$ we get $f(25)=2*127+1=255$.
13. Finally, we can find $f(100)$ using the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We have $f(100)=2f(50)+1$, and substituting $f(50)=255$ we get $f(100)=2*255+1=511$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def calculate_f_100():
    # From the equation f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1
    f_25 = 127
    f_50 = 2 * f_25 + 1
    f_100 = 2 * f_50 + 1

    return f_100

result = calculate_f_100()
print(result)
```

## QUESTION 4 - 13

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $
f(n) =
\begin{cases}
n^2+1 & \text{if }n\text{ is odd} \\
\dfrac{n}{2} & \text{if }n\text{ is even}
\end{cases}.
$

For how many integers $n$ from 1 to 100, inclusive, does $f ( f (\dotsb f (n) \dotsb )) = 1$ for some number of applications of $f$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we note that if $n$ is a positive integer, then $f(n)$ is also a positive integer.  We claim that $f ( f (\dotsb f (n) \dotsb )) = 1$ for some number of applications of $f$ only for $n = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32,$ and $64.$  (In other words, $n$ must be a power of 2.)

Note that $f(1) = 2,$ so $f(f(1)) = f(2) = 1.$  If $n > 1$ is a power of 2, it is easy to see that repeated applications of $f$ on $n$ eventually reach 1.

Suppose $n$ is an odd positive integer, where $n > 1.$  Write $n = 2k + 1,$ where $k$ is a positive integer.  Since $n$ is odd,
\[f(n) = n^2 + 1 = (2k + 1)^2 + 1 = 4k^2 + 4k + 2 = 2(2k^2 + 2k + 1).\]Since $2k^2 + 2k$ is always even, $2k^2 + 2k + 1$ is always odd (and greater than 1), so $f(n)$ can never be a power of 2 when $n$ is odd and greater than 1.

Now, suppose $n$ is even.  For example, if $n = 2^3 \cdot 11,$ then
\[f(2^3 \cdot 11) = f(2^2 \cdot 11) = f(2 \cdot 11) = f(11),\]which we know is not a power of 2.

More generally, suppose $n = 2^e \cdot m,$ where $e$ is nonnegative and $m$ is odd.  Then
\[f(2^e \cdot m) = f(2^{e - 1} \cdot m) = f(2^{e - 2} \cdot m) = \dots = f(m).\]If $m = 1,$ then $n$ is a power of 2, and the sequence eventually reaches 1.  Otherwise, $f(m)$ is not a power of 2.  We also know that $f(m)$ is odd and greater than 1, $f(f(m))$ is not a power of 2 either, and so on.  Thus, the sequence can never reach 1.

Therefore, $n$ must be one of the $\boxed{7}$ values 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, or 64. The answer is $\boxed{7}$

**Problem**
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


To find $f(100)$, we first need to express 100 in terms of the form $2n$ so that we can use the second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. 

We have $100 = 2 \cdot 50$, so we can find $f(50)$ first and then use the second equation to find $f(100)$.

We can continue this process until we reach a number that we can easily compute by hand. 

Let's start with $f(50)$:

By the second equation, $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.

To find $f(50)$, we need to express 50 in terms of the form $2n$ again: $50 = 2 \cdot 25$, so $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.

To find $f(25)$, we have $25 = 2 \cdot 12 + 1$, so $f(25) = 2f(12) + 1$.

To find $f(12)$, we have $12 = 2 \cdot 6$, so $f(12) = 2f(6)$.

To find $f(6)$, we have $6 = 2 \cdot 3$, so $f(6) = 2f(3)$.

Finally, $f(3) = 8 \cdot 3 - 7 = 17$.

Now we can work our way back up:

$f(6) = 2 \cdot 17 = 34$,
$f(12) = 2 \cdot 34 = 68$,
$f(25) = 2 \cdot 68 + 1 = 137$,
$f(50) = 2 \cdot 137 + 1 = 275$,
$f(100) = 2 \cdot 275 + 1 = 551$.

So, $f(100) = 551$. The answer is $\boxed{551}$.
