Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We know that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions.
2. Let's denote $\frac{m}{100}$ as $k$, so the equation becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=k$.
3. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=k$ has four distinct solutions if and only if $0<k<1$.
4. Therefore, we need to find the value of $m$ such that $0<\frac{m}{100}<1$, which simplifies to $0<m<100$.
5. The only positive integer $m$ in this range is $m=1$.

So the value of $m$ that makes the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have four distinct solutions is $m=1$. The answer is: $1$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $3$. This is because the expression on the left side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, can take on any value in the interval $[1,3]$ and no value outside of this interval. Therefore, we want to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $1<\frac{m}{100}<3$, or equivalently, $100<m<300$. The number of positive integers in this range is $300-100-1=199$. So the answer is $\boxed{199}$.

Here is a Python code to calculate the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition:
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def count_m():
    lower_bound = 100
    upper_bound = 300
    return upper_bound - lower_bound - 1

result = count_m()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 199

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output

```
The answer is $\boxed{199}$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let \[f(x) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
-x + 3 & \text{if } x \le 0, \\
2x - 5 & \text{if } x > 0.
\end{array}
\right.\]How many solutions does the equation $f(f(x)) = 4$ have?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
To solve the equation $f(f(x)) = 4,$ we first find the values $x$ such that $f(x) = 4.$

Either $f(x) = -x + 3$ (for $x \le 0$) or $f(x) = 2x - 5$ (for $x > 0$). If $-x + 3 = 4,$ then $x = -1.$ Note that this value satisfies $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = 4,$ then $x = 9/2.$ Note that this value satisfies $x > 0.$ Therefore, the solutions to $f(x) = 4$ are $x = -1$ and $x = 9/2.$

Next, we solve for the values $x$ such that $f(x) = -1.$ If $-x + 3 = -1,$ then $x = 4.$ This value does not satisfy $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = -1,$ then $x = 2.$ This value satisfies $x > 0.$

Finally, we solve for the values $x$ such that $f(x) = 9/2.$ If $-x + 3 = 9/2,$ then $x = -3/2.$ This value satisfies $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = 9/2,$ then $x = 19/4.$ This value satisfies $x > 0.$

Therefore, the equation $f(f(x)) = 4$ has the solutions $x = 2,$ $-3/2,$ and $19/4,$ for a total of $\boxed{3}$ solutions. The answer is $\boxed{3}$

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is a number between $1$ and $2$ (exclusive). This is because the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, will oscillate between $-2$ and $2$ when $x$ varies over the real line, and the absolute value of this expression will be equal to $\frac{m}{100}$ at exactly $4$ points.

So, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. This is equivalent to finding the number of positive integers $m$ such that $100 < m < 200$. The number of such integers is $200 - 100 - 1 = 99$.

```python

def count_m():

    lower_bound = 100
    upper_bound = 200
    m_values = list(range(lower_bound + 1, upper_bound))
    return len(m_values)

result = count_m()

```

The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $99$. The answer is: $99$

## QUESTION 2 - 5

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"For certain ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ of real numbers, the system of equations
\[\begin{aligned} ax+by&=1 \\ x^2 + y^2 &= 50  \end{aligned}\]has at least one solution, and each solution is an ordered pair $(x,y)\,$ of integers. How many such ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ are there?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The graph of $ax+by=1$ is a line, while the graph of $x^2+y^2=50$ is a circle centered at the origin. Therefore, $(a, b)$ satisfies the conditions if and only if the line and circle intersect at least once, and they intersect only at lattice points (points with integer coordinates).

Knowing this, it makes sense to look for lattice points on the circle whose equation is $x^2+y^2=50$. Testing cases, we find that there are twelve lattice points on the circle: $(\pm 1, \pm 7)$, $(\pm 7, \pm 1)$, and $(\pm 5, \pm 5)$ (where the two $\pm$ signs in each pair are independent of each other).

There are $\tbinom{12}{2} = 66$ pairs of these points, and each pair determines a line. However, the graph of $ax+by=1$ can never pass through the origin $(0, 0)$, since if $x=y=0$, then $ax+by=0 \neq 1$. Therefore, the six pairs which consist of diametrically opposed points are invalid, since the line through them passes through the origin. This corrects our count to $66 - 6 = 60$.

In addition, for each of the twelve points, there is a line tangent to the circle at that point, so that the only solution to the system is that one point. This brings the final total to $60 + 12 = \boxed{72}$. The answer is $\boxed{72}$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let \[f(x) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
-x + 3 & \text{if } x \le 0, \\
2x - 5 & \text{if } x > 0.

Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
To solve the equation $f(f(x)) = 4,$ we first find the values $x$ such that $f(x) = 4.$

Either $f(x) = -x + 3$ (for $x \le 0$) or $f(x) = 2x - 5$ (for $x > 0$). If $-x + 3 = 4,$ then $x = -1.$ Note that this value satisfies $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = 4,$ then $x = 9/2.$ Note that this value satisfies $x > 0.$ Therefore, the solutions to $f(x) = 4$ are $x = -1$ and $x = 9/2.$

Next, we solve for the values $x$ such that $f(x) = -1.$ If $-x + 3 = -1,$ then $x = 4.$ This value does not satisfy $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = -1,$ then $x = 2.$ This value satisfies $x > 0.$

Finally, we solve for the values $x$ such that $f(x) = 9/2.$ If $-x + 3 = 9/2,$ then $x = -3/2.$ This value satisfies $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = 9/2,$ then $x = 19/4.$ This value satisfies $x > 0.$

Therefore, the equation $f(f(x)) = 4$ has the solutions $x = 2,$ $-3/2,$ and $19/4,$ for a total of $\boxed{3}$ solutions. The answer is $\boxed{3}$

**Solution:** 



This problem requires a careful understanding of the absolute value function and its properties. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. This is because the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, can take on three distinct values: $-2, 0, 2$. The value $2$ gives us four distinct solutions.

To confirm this, we can set $\frac{m}{100} = 2$ and solve for $m$. Multiplying both sides by $100$ gives $m = 200$.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is $1$.

The answer is $\boxed{1}$.

Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
If $|x-7| = |x+1|$, then either $x-7 = x+1$ or $x-7 = -(x+1)$.  Simplifying $x-7=x+1$ gives $0=8$, which has no solutions, so no values of $x$ satisfy $x-7 = x+1$.  If $x-7 = -(x+1)$, then $x-7 = -x-1$, so $2x = 6$, which gives $x=3$.  So, there is $\boxed{1}$ solution.

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we can use the fact that the function $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|$ has a graph that is a "V" shape with the "bottom" of the "V" at $x=3$ and $x=-1$. The function on the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, is a horizontal line that moves up and down as $m$ changes. 

For the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, the line $\frac{m}{100}$ must intersect the "V" shape in exactly 4 places. This happens when the line is above the "V" shape's peak but below the distance between the two peaks. The distance between the two peaks of the "V" shape is 4, so we want the line to be at a height between 0 and 4. Therefore, the possible values of $\frac{m}{100}$ are between 0 and 4, or $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 4$. Multiplying all sides of the inequalities by 100 gives $0 < m < 400$. The positive integers in this range are 1, 2, ..., 399, making 399 possible values for $m$. However, we need the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation has 4 distinct solutions. Looking back at the graph, we see that the equation has 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to the distance from the peak of the "V" shape to the ground, which is 2. So, $m = 200$ is the only value that gives 4 distinct solutions. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 1. The answer is: 1
