**Problem:** 
"How many distinct solutions are there to the equation $|x-7| = |x+1|$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
If $|x-7| = |x+1|$, then either $x-7 = x+1$ or $x-7 = -(x+1)$.  Simplifying $x-7=x+1$ gives $0=8$, which has no solutions, so no values of $x$ satisfy $x-7 = x+1$.  If $x-7 = -(x+1)$, then $x-7 = -x-1$, so $2x = 6$, which gives $x=3$.  So, there is $\boxed{1}$ solution.

Challenge: See if you can find a quick solution to this problem by simply thinking about the graphs of $y=|x-7|$ and $y=|x+1|$. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



We will use the concept of graph to solve this problem. The graph of $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a V-shape with three branches, each of which is a line segment of length 1. The "valleys" of the V's are at $x = 3$ and $x = -1$, with depths of 2. The graph of $y = \frac{m}{100}$ is a horizontal line at height $\frac{m}{100}$.

For the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ to have 4 distinct solutions, the line $y = \frac{m}{100}$ must intersect the "valleys" of the V-shape at a height that is strictly between 0 and 2. This means $\frac{m}{100}$ must be strictly between 0 and 2, so $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Multiplying all sides of the inequalities by 100 gives $0 < m < 200$.

The positive integers in this range are exactly the integers from 1 to 199, inclusive. So there are 199 positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions. The answer is: $199$

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"

**Solution:** 



To solve this problem, we need to find the value of $m$ for which the equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. 

The equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ is a piecewise function with four cases depending on the value of $x$. We can solve this equation by considering each case separately and then finding the value of $m$ that gives 4 distinct solutions.

Here is a step-by-step approach:

1. First, we need to find the critical points of the function $|x - 1| - 2$. The critical points occur where the expression inside the absolute value changes sign, so we set $x - 1 = 0$ to find $x = 1$.

2. Now we consider the four cases for the values of $x$:
   - Case 1: $x < 1$. In this case, $|x - 1| - 2 = -(x - 1) - 2 = -x + 1 - 2 = -x - 1$.
   - Case 2: $1 \leq x \leq 3$. In this case, $|x - 1| - 2 = x - 1 - 2 = x - 3$.
   - Case 3: $x > 3$. In this case, $|x - 1| - 2 = x - 1 - 2 = x - 3$.

3. For each case, we solve the equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$:
   - Case 1: $-x - 1 - 2 = \frac{m}{100} \Rightarrow -x - 3 = \frac{m}{100} \Rightarrow x = -3 - \frac{m}{100}$. This gives us the equation $x = -3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
   - Case 2: $x - 3 = \frac{m}{100} \Rightarrow x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$. This gives us the equation $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.
   - Case 3: $x - 3 = \frac{m}{100} \Rightarrow x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$. This gives us the same equation as in Case 2.

4. Now we need to find the value of $m$ that gives 4 distinct solutions. By graphing or by analyzing the equations, we find that the value of $m$ that gives 4 distinct solutions is $m = 100$.

So, the value of $m$ for which the equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is $m = 100$. The answer is: $100$

## QUESTION 2 - 2

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many solutions does the equation \[\frac{(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)\dotsm(x-100)}{(x-1^2)(x-2^2)(x-3^2)\dotsm(x-100^2)} = 0\]have for $x$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Any solution to this equation must make the numerator of the left-hand side zero, while keeping the denominator non-zero. The numerator is zero when $x$ is one of the numbers $1, 2, 3, \dots, 100.$ However, for any value in this list that is a perfect square, the denominator will also be zero, so that value of $x$ will not be a root. Therefore, we want to find the number of integers in the list $1, 2, \dots, 100$ which are not perfect squares. The perfect squares in the list are $1^2, 2^2, \dots, 10^2,$ so there are $10$ perfect squares, and \[100 - 10 = \boxed{90}\]integers which are not perfect squares. The answer is $\boxed{90}$

The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $100$. However, we need to find the value of $m$ for which the equation has exactly $4$ distinct solutions. We can do this by setting the value of $m$ in the range $1$ to $100$. Let's modify our code to find the value of $m$ for which the equation has exactly $4$ distinct solutions.

I apologize for the error in the code. The problem with the code is that it doesn't properly set up the equation for the absolute value function. The equation should be $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$, not $| |x - 1| - 2 | = m$. Let's correct this and try again.

## QUESTION 2 - 10 
- TIME_SPENT : 449 secs

10_
**Example**

**Problem:** 
"For certain ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ of real numbers, the system of equations
\[\begin{aligned} ax+by&=1 \\ x^2 + y^2 &= 50  \end{aligned}\]has at least one solution, and each solution is an ordered pair $(x,y)\,$ of integers. How many such ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ are there?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The graph of $ax+by=1$ is a line, while the graph of $x^2+y^2=50$ is a circle centered at the origin. Therefore, $(a, b)$ satisfies the conditions if and only if the line and circle intersect at least once, and they intersect only at lattice points (points with integer coordinates).

Knowing this, it makes sense to look for lattice points on the circle whose equation is $x^2+y^2=50$. Testing cases, we find that there are twelve lattice points on the circle: $(\pm 1, \pm 7)$, $(\pm 7, \pm 1)$, and $(\pm 5, \pm 5)$ (where the two $\pm$ signs in each pair are independent of each other).

There are $\tbinom{12}{2} = 66$ pairs of these points, and each pair determines a line. However, the graph of $ax+by=1$ can never pass through the origin $(0, 0)$, since if $x=y=0$, then $ax+by=0 \neq 1$. Therefore, the six pairs which consist of diametrically opposed points are invalid, since the line through them passes through the origin. This corrects our count to $66 - 6 = 60$.

In addition, for each of the twelve points, there is a line tangent to the circle at that point, so that the only solution to the system is that one point. This brings the final total to $60 + 12 = \boxed{72}$. The answer is $\boxed{72}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solve, floor, Abs

def count_solutions():
    """For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"""
    x = symbols('x')
    m = symbols('m', integer=True)
    count = 0

    for m_val in range(1, 101):
        equation = Abs(Abs(x - 1) - 2) - m_val / 100
        solutions = solve(equation, x)
        if len(solutions) == 4:
            count += 1

    return count

result = count_solutions()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 100

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
100
```
The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $100$. The answer is $\boxed{100}$.
