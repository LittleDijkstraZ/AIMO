**Problem:** 
"Find the number of 10-tuples $(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{10})$ of real numbers such that
\[(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2 = \frac{1}{11}.\]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,
\begin{align*}
&[(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + \dots + 1^2 + 1^2)][(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2] \\
&\ge [(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + (x_2 - x_3) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10}]^2 = 1.
\end{align*}From the given condition, we have equality, so by the equality condition for Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[\frac{1 - x_1}{1} = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{1} = \frac{x_2 - x_3}{1} = \dots = \frac{x_9 - x_{10}}{1} = \frac{x_{10}}{1}.\]Let
\[d = 1 - x_1 = x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_3 = \dots = x_9 - x_{10} = x_{10}.\]Then
\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so
\[(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_{10}) = \left( \frac{10}{11}, \frac{9}{11}, \frac{8}{11}, \dots, \frac{1}{11} \right).\]In particular, there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_ 2= (-16,2).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that
\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as
\[\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1.\]Find $h + k + a + b.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step.

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we first observe that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the equation given is equivalent to the following two systems of equations:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The first system of equations implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$, and the second system implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

Solving the equations $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$, we get the following four equations:

1. $x + y = 10$ and $x = 8$, which gives $y = 2$.
2. $x + y = -10$ and $x = 8$, which gives $y = -18$.
3. $x - y = 10$ and $x = 8$, which gives $y = -2$.
4. $x - y = -10$ and $x = 8$, which gives $y = 18$.

Solving the equations $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, we get the following four equations:

1. $x - y = 10$ and $y = 8$, which gives $x = 18$.
2. $x - y = -10$ and $y = 8$, which gives $x = -2$.
3. $x - y = 10$ and $y = -8$, which gives $x = 2$.
4. $x - y = -10$ and $y = -8$, which gives $x = -18$.

Therefore, the vertices of the polygon are $(8, 2)$, $(8, -18)$, $(18, -2)$, $(-2, 18)$, $(-2, -8)$, $(-18, -8)$, $(-18, 8)$, and $(8, 8)$.

To find the area of the polygon, we can divide it into two rectangles and subtract the area of the overlapping square:

- The two rectangles have dimensions $16 \times 20$, so their total area is $2 \times 16 \times 20 = 640$.
- The overlapping square has side length $8$, so its area is $8^2 = 64$.

Therefore, the area of the polygon is $640 - 64 = 576$. The answer is: $576$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The equation is satisfied if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The first two equations are satisfied when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
The third equation is satisfied when $\vert x \vert = 8$, and the fourth equation is satisfied when $\vert y \vert = 8$.
These conditions give us the vertices of a square with side length 16.
To find the area of the square, we square the side length: $16^2 = 256$.
The area of the convex polygon is 256.
The answer is: $256$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many square units are in the area of the triangle whose vertices are the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the curve $y = (x-3)^2 (x+2)$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we need to find where this curve intersects the $x$ and $y$ axes.  If $y=0$, then $(x-3)^2(x+2)=0$, which has solutions of $x=3$ and $x=-2$.  If $x=0$, then $y=(-3)^2(2)=18$.  So, the curve has two $x$-intercepts and one $y$-intercept.  The length of the base along the $x$-axis is $3-(-2)=5$.  The height from this base is equal to the $y$-intercept, 18.  The area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 5\cdot 18=\boxed{45}$. The answer is $\boxed{45}$

**Solution:**


This problem requires a mathematical analysis of the given equation and the properties of absolute value and the square of a real number. The equation is a product of two terms, each of which is a square of a difference of absolute values. The only way for the product to be zero is if at least one of the factors is zero. This leads to a system of four absolute value equations, each of which represents a pair of lines in the coordinate plane. The intersection points of these lines form the vertices of the polygon.

The polygon is a square with side length 16, because the distances from the origin to each of the lines $\vert x \pm y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$, $\vert y \vert = 8$ are both 8, by symmetry. The area of a square is the square of the length of its side, so the area of the polygon is $16^2 = 256$.

```python

def polygon_area():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
