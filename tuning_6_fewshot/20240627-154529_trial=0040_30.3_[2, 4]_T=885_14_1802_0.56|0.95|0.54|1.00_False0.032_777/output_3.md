Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We are given a product of two expressions that equals zero. This means that either the first expression equals zero, or the second expression equals zero, or both equal zero.

2. Let's denote the two expressions as $A = ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$ and $B = ((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$.

3. If $A = 0$, then $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

4. If $B = 0$, then $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

5. The solutions to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ are the points that form a square with side length 10. The solutions to $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ are the points that form a square with side length 16.

6. The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for. The area of this polygon is the area of the smaller square, which is $10^2 = 100$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 100.

The answer is: $100$

**Problem:** 
"Five identical rectangles are arranged to form a larger rectangle $PQRS$, as shown.  The area of $PQRS$ is $4000$.  What is the length, $x$, rounded off to the nearest integer? [asy]
real x = 1; real w = 2/3;

// Draw outer square and labels

label("$x$", (x/2, -0.1), S);

[/asy]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Let $w$ be the width of each of the identical rectangles. Since $PQ=3w$, $RS=2x$ and $PQ=RS$ (because $PQRS$ is a rectangle), then $2x = 3w$, or $$w=\frac{2}{3}x.$$ Therefore, the area of each of the five identical rectangles is $$x\left(\frac{2}{3}x\right)=\frac{2}{3}x^2.$$ Since the area of $PQRS$ is 4000 and it is made up of five of these identical smaller rectangles, then $$5\left(\frac{2}{3}x^2\right)=4000$$ or $$\frac{10}{3}x^2 = 4000$$ or $x^2 = 1200$ or $x \approx 34.6$ which, when rounded off to the nearest integer, is $\boxed{35}.$ The answer is $\boxed{35}$

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

2. Similarly, the expression $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

3. The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 10 (the distance from the origin to the lines $x + y = \pm 10$ or $x - y = \pm 10$).

4. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Find the number of 10-tuples $(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{10})$ of real numbers such that
\[(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2 = \frac{1}{11}.\]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,
\begin{align*}
&[(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + \dots + 1^2 + 1^2)][(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2] \\
&\ge [(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + (x_2 - x_3) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10}]^2 = 1.
\end{align*}From the given condition, we have equality, so by the equality condition for Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[\frac{1 - x_1}{1} = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{1} = \frac{x_2 - x_3}{1} = \dots = \frac{x_9 - x_{10}}{1} = \frac{x_{10}}{1}.\]Let
\[d = 1 - x_1 = x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_3 = \dots = x_9 - x_{10} = x_{10}.\]Then
\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so
\[(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_{10}) = \left( \frac{10}{11}, \frac{9}{11}, \frac{8}{11}, \dots, \frac{1}{11} \right).\]In particular, there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we first need to understand the given equation and the conditions it imposes on $x$ and $y$. The equation is
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]
This equation is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. 

Each of these equations is satisfied when the absolute value expression equals 10 or 8. This gives us the following conditions on $x$ and $y$:
1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x + y \vert = 8$.
2. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 8$.
3. $\vert x \vert = 10$ or $\vert x \vert = 8$.
4. $\vert y \vert = 10$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The solutions to these equations give us the coordinates of the vertices of the polygon. 

The vertices of the polygon are the points where the absolute value expressions equal 10 or 8. These points are:
1. $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(8, 0)$, $(-8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, $(0, -8)$.
2. $(10, 10)$, $(10, -10)$, $(-10, 10)$, $(-10, -10)$, $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$.

The polygon is a square with side length 16 (since the distance between the points $(8, 0)$ and $(0, 8)$ is $\sqrt{8^2 + 8^2} = 8\sqrt{2} = 16$).

The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, -2)$, and $(-8, 2)$.

Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So the vertices of the square are also $(8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(8, -8)$.

The intersection of these two squares is a square with side length 8. The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$.
The answer is $\boxed{64}$.

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


The problem is asking for the area of a polygon formed by the points that satisfy the given equation. The equation is a product of two terms, each of which is a square of a difference of absolute values. The product is zero if and only if at least one of the terms is zero. Therefore, we need to find the points that satisfy each of the following equations:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For equation 1, $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ means $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
For equation 2, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ means $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
For equation 3, $\vert x \vert = 8$ means $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
For equation 4, $\vert y \vert = 8$ means $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

The solutions to these equations form a square with side length 16, centered at the origin. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_ 2= (-16,2).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that
\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as
\[\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1.\]Find $h + k + a + b.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if both of its factors are equal to zero. The factor $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ is zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The factor $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2$ is zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The solutions to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ are the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. The solutions to $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ are the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersection of these lines form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.
