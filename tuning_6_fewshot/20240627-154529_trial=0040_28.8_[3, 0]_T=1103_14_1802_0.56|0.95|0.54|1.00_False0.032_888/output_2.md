**Problem:** 
"How many solutions does the equation \[\frac{(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)\dotsm(x-100)}{(x-1^2)(x-2^2)(x-3^2)\dotsm(x-100^2)} = 0\]have for $x$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Any solution to this equation must make the numerator of the left-hand side zero, while keeping the denominator non-zero. The numerator is zero when $x$ is one of the numbers $1, 2, 3, \dots, 100.$ However, for any value in this list that is a perfect square, the denominator will also be zero, so that value of $x$ will not be a root. Therefore, we want to find the number of integers in the list $1, 2, \dots, 100$ which are not perfect squares. The perfect squares in the list are $1^2, 2^2, \dots, 10^2,$ so there are $10$ perfect squares, and \[100 - 10 = \boxed{90}\]integers which are not perfect squares. The answer is $\boxed{90}$

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solve, Eq, Abs

def find_m():
    x = symbols('x')
    m = symbols('m', integer=True)
    count = 0

    for m_value in range(1, 101):
        equation = Eq(Abs(Abs(x - 1) - 2), m_value/100)
        solutions = solve(equation, x)

CODE RESULTS 100

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
100
```
The value of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 100. However, we are asked to find the number of such $m$. In our code, we have only considered a single value of $m$, which is 100. But we need to check for all possible values of $m$ from 1 to 100. 

To do this, we can modify our code slightly to iterate through all values of $m$ and count the number of times the equation has 4 distinct solutions.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solve, Eq, Abs

def find_m():
    x = symbols('x')
    m = symbols('m', integer=True)
    count = 0

    for m_value in range(1, 101):
        equation = Eq(Abs(Abs(x - 1) - 2), m_value/100)
        solutions = solve(equation, x)

        if len(solutions) == 4:
            count += 1

    return count

result = find_m()

## QUESTION 2 - 1

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"For certain ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ of real numbers, the system of equations
\[\begin{aligned} ax+by&=1 \\ x^2 + y^2 &= 50  \end{aligned}\]has at least one solution, and each solution is an ordered pair $(x,y)\,$ of integers. How many such ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ are there?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The graph of $ax+by=1$ is a line, while the graph of $x^2+y^2=50$ is a circle centered at the origin. Therefore, $(a, b)$ satisfies the conditions if and only if the line and circle intersect at least once, and they intersect only at lattice points (points with integer coordinates).

Knowing this, it makes sense to look for lattice points on the circle whose equation is $x^2+y^2=50$. Testing cases, we find that there are twelve lattice points on the circle: $(\pm 1, \pm 7)$, $(\pm 7, \pm 1)$, and $(\pm 5, \pm 5)$ (where the two $\pm$ signs in each pair are independent of each other).

There are $\tbinom{12}{2} = 66$ pairs of these points, and each pair determines a line. However, the graph of $ax+by=1$ can never pass through the origin $(0, 0)$, since if $x=y=0$, then $ax+by=0 \neq 1$. Therefore, the six pairs which consist of diametrically opposed points are invalid, since the line through them passes through the origin. This corrects our count to $66 - 6 = 60$.

In addition, for each of the twelve points, there is a line tangent to the circle at that point, so that the only solution to the system is that one point. This brings the final total to $60 + 12 = \boxed{72}$. The answer is $\boxed{72}$

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $2$. This means $1<\frac{m}{100}<2$, which implies $100<m<200$. The number of positive integers $m$ in this range is $200-100-1=99$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $99$.

We can use Python to confirm this:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def count_m():
    """For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"""
    lower_bound = 100
    upper_bound = 200
    count = upper_bound - lower_bound - 1
    return count

result = count_m()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 99

The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $99$. The answer is $\boxed{99}$.

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions.

First, we can observe that the right-hand side of the equation is always non-negative, so $m$ must be a non-negative integer. Also, the absolute value of the left-hand side is at most 2, so $\frac{m}{100} \leq 2$, which implies $m \leq 200$.

Now, let's consider the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. This equation can be rewritten as two separate cases:

1. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$: In this case, $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two sub-cases:
   a. $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$: In this sub-case, $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.
   b. $-(x-1) = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$: In this sub-case, $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

2. $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = \frac{m}{100}$: In this case, $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two sub-cases:
   a. $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$: In this sub-case, $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
   b. $-(x-1) = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$: In this sub-case, $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

For each of these cases, we need to find the values of $x$ that are real and distinct. This means that the expressions inside the absolute value in each case must have different values for distinct $x$. This gives us the following conditions:

1. For the first case, $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 + \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $4 \neq 0$, which is always true.
2. For the second case, $3 - \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $4 \neq -2$, which is also always true.

So, both cases will always give us two distinct solutions for $x$. Now, we need to find the values of $m$ for which these solutions are also distinct from the solutions of the other two cases. This means that we need to find the values of $m$ for which:

1. $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $0 \neq \frac{2m}{100}$, or $m \neq 0$.
2. $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $4 \neq -2 - \frac{2m}{100}$, or $m \neq -100$.
3. $-1 + \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $0 \neq \frac{2m}{100}$, or $m \neq 0$.
4. $-1 + \frac{m}{100} \neq 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $-4 \neq 4 - \frac{2m}{100}$, or $m \neq 200$.

All these conditions are always true except for the condition $m \neq 0$. So, the only condition we need to impose is $0 < m \leq 200$. The number of positive integers in this range is $200$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions is 200.

The answer is: $200$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many integers are solutions to the equation $$(x-2)^{(25-x^2)}=1?$$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
We need some basic facts from number theory: $a^0 = 1$ for any $a,$ $1^b = 1$ for any $b,$ and $(-1)^c = 1$ if $c$ is an even integer. Unless the base is a complex number (which is excluded since we are looking for integer solutions), there are no other ways to get an RHS of $1.$ Thus, either the exponent is zero $($giving the equation $25 - x^2 = 0),$ the base is $1$ $($giving $x -2 = 1),$ or the base is $-1$ and the exponent is even $($giving the simultaneous equations $x - 2 = -1$ and $25 - x^2 = 2n$ for some integer $n).$ Solving the first equation gives $x = \pm 5,$ and solving the second gives $x = 3.$ The third equation implies that $x = 1,$ in which case $25 - x^2 = 24$ is indeed even, so $x = 1$ is a valid solution. In all, there are $\boxed{4}$ integer solutions. The answer is $\boxed{4}$

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We are asked to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly 4 distinct solutions.
2. First, we need to understand that the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be positive. Therefore, $m$ must be a positive integer.
3. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is a piecewise function with 4 cases to consider based on the absolute values.
4. For each case, we need to solve the equation and find the number of distinct solutions.
5. After solving each case, we sum up the number of distinct solutions for each case.
6. If the sum equals 4, then the corresponding $m$ is a valid value.

Now, let's write a Python script to find the value of $m$:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solve, Eq, Piecewise

def find_m():
    x, m = symbols('x m')
    # define the piecewise function
    f = Piecewise((abs(x - 1) - 2 - m/100, abs(x - 1) - 2 >= 0),
                  (-abs(x - 1) + 2 - m/100, True))
    # define the equation
    equation = Eq(f, 0)
    # initialize the count of distinct solutions
    count = 0
    # iterate over possible values of m
    for i in range(1, 101):
        # substitute the value of m into the equation
        equation_sub = equation.subs(m, i)
        # find the solutions to the equation
        solutions = solve(equation_sub, x)
        # count the number of distinct solutions
        count += len(set(solutions))
    # return the value of m for which the count equals 4
    for i in range(1, 101):
        if count == 4:
            return i
        count -= len(set(solutions))

result = find_m()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 100

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output

The value of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly 4 distinct solutions is $100$.
