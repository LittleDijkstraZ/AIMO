**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many solutions does the equation \[\frac{(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)\dotsm(x-100)}{(x-1^2)(x-2^2)(x-3^2)\dotsm(x-100^2)} = 0\]have for $x$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Any solution to this equation must make the numerator of the left-hand side zero, while keeping the denominator non-zero. The numerator is zero when $x$ is one of the numbers $1, 2, 3, \dots, 100.$ However, for any value in this list that is a perfect square, the denominator will also be zero, so that value of $x$ will not be a root. Therefore, we want to find the number of integers in the list $1, 2, \dots, 100$ which are not perfect squares. The perfect squares in the list are $1^2, 2^2, \dots, 10^2,$ so there are $10$ perfect squares, and \[100 - 10 = \boxed{90}\]integers which are not perfect squares. The answer is $\boxed{90}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we need to first understand the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}.\]
The equation has four distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ equals to $1$. 

So, we can set $\frac{m}{100}$ equals to $1$ and solve for $m$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

def find_m():
    m = symbols('m')
    equation = Eq(m / 100, 1)
    solution = solve(equation, m)
    return solution[0]

result = find_m()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 100

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
100
```
The value of $m$ that makes the equation have four distinct solutions is $100$. However, we need to check if this value of $m$ actually gives us four distinct solutions. If we substitute $m = 100$ into the equation, we get \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=1.\]

This equation is equivalent to two cases: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 1$ or $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -1$.

The first case, $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 1$, simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = 3$. This gives us two more equations: $x - 1 = 3$ or $x - 1 = -3$, which simplifies to $x = 4$ or $x = -2$.

The second case, $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -1$, simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = 1$. This gives us two more equations: $x - 1 = 1$ or $x - 1 = -1$, which simplifies to $x = 2$ or $x = 0$.

So, for $m = 100$, the equation has four distinct solutions: $x = 0$, $x = 2$, $x = -2$, and $x = 4$. Therefore, the value of $m$ that makes the equation have four distinct solutions is $100$. The answer is $\boxed{100}$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"For certain ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ of real numbers, the system of equations
\[\begin{aligned} ax+by&=1 \\ x^2 + y^2 &= 50  \end{aligned}\]has at least one solution, and each solution is an ordered pair $(x,y)\,$ of integers. How many such ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ are there?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The graph of $ax+by=1$ is a line, while the graph of $x^2+y^2=50$ is a circle centered at the origin. Therefore, $(a, b)$ satisfies the conditions if and only if the line and circle intersect at least once, and they intersect only at lattice points (points with integer coordinates).

Knowing this, it makes sense to look for lattice points on the circle whose equation is $x^2+y^2=50$. Testing cases, we find that there are twelve lattice points on the circle: $(\pm 1, \pm 7)$, $(\pm 7, \pm 1)$, and $(\pm 5, \pm 5)$ (where the two $\pm$ signs in each pair are independent of each other).

There are $\tbinom{12}{2} = 66$ pairs of these points, and each pair determines a line. However, the graph of $ax+by=1$ can never pass through the origin $(0, 0)$, since if $x=y=0$, then $ax+by=0 \neq 1$. Therefore, the six pairs which consist of diametrically opposed points are invalid, since the line through them passes through the origin. This corrects our count to $66 - 6 = 60$.

In addition, for each of the twelve points, there is a line tangent to the circle at that point, so that the only solution to the system is that one point. This brings the final total to $60 + 12 = \boxed{72}$. The answer is $\boxed{72}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $2$. This is because the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a graph with $4$ distinct "hills" or peaks when it takes on values between $1$ and $2$.

If we multiply both sides of the inequality $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$ by $100$, we get $100 < m < 200$. The number of positive integers $m$ in this interval is $200 - 100 - 1 = 99$. Therefore, there are $99$ positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def count_m():
    """
    This function counts the number of positive integers m for which the equation 
    | |x - 1| - 2 | = m/100 has 4 distinct solutions.
    Returns: the number of such integers.
    """
    lower_bound = 100
    upper_bound = 200
    count = upper_bound - lower_bound - 1
    return count

result = count_m()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 99

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output

The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $99$. The answer is: $99$.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. 

Firstly, we know that $\frac{m}{100}$ is a positive number because $m$ is a positive integer. The expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is an absolute value function with a nested absolute value. This function will be equal to $\frac{m}{100}$ at 4 different points, which implies that the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ intersects the horizontal line $y=\frac{m}{100}$ at 4 different points. 

For the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ to intersect the horizontal line $y=\frac{m}{100}$ at 4 different points, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be greater than 2 and less than 3. This implies that $2<\frac{m}{100}<3$, which simplifies to $200<m<300$. 

The only positive integer $m$ in this range is 201.

Therefore, the value of $m$ that makes the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have 4 distinct solutions is $m=201$. 

So the answer is $\boxed{201}$.

Assistant:

 This problem is quite challenging to solve directly using programming. Instead, we can solve it using mathematical reasoning.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 1$. Therefore, $m = 100$.

So, there is only 1 positive integer $m$ that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions, which is $m = 100$.
The answer is: $1$

**Problem:** 
"How many solutions does the equation \[\frac{(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)\dotsm(x-100)}{(x-1^2)(x-2^2)(x-3^2)\dotsm(x-100^2)} = 0\]have for $x$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Any solution to this equation must make the numerator of the left-hand side zero, while keeping the denominator non-zero. The numerator is zero when $x$ is one of the numbers $1, 2, 3, \dots, 100.$ However, for any value in this list that is a perfect square, the denominator will also be zero, so that value of $x$ will not be a root. Therefore, we want to find the number of integers in the list $1, 2, \dots, 100$ which are not perfect squares. The perfect squares in the list are $1^2, 2^2, \dots, 10^2,$ so there are $10$ perfect squares, and \[100 - 10 = \boxed{90}\]integers which are not perfect squares. The answer is $\boxed{90}$
