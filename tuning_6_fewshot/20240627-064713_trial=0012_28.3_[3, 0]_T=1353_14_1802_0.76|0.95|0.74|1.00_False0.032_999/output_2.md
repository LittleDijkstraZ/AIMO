**Problem:** 
"How many distinct solutions are there to the equation $|x-7| = |x+1|$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
If $|x-7| = |x+1|$, then either $x-7 = x+1$ or $x-7 = -(x+1)$.  Simplifying $x-7=x+1$ gives $0=8$, which has no solutions, so no values of $x$ satisfy $x-7 = x+1$.  If $x-7 = -(x+1)$, then $x-7 = -x-1$, so $2x = 6$, which gives $x=3$.  So, there is $\boxed{1}$ solution.

Challenge: See if you can find a quick solution to this problem by simply thinking about the graphs of $y=|x-7|$ and $y=|x+1|$. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


We know that the equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions. This means that the expression inside the absolute value, $|x-1|-2$, must be equal to $\pm\frac{m}{100}$. 

So we have two equations: $|x-1|-2 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $|x-1|-2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.

We can rewrite these as: $|x-1| = 2+\frac{m}{100}$ and $|x-1| = 2-\frac{m}{100}$.

For each equation, we have two possibilities: $x-1 = 2+\frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 = -(2+\frac{m}{100})$, and $x-1 = 2-\frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 = -(2-\frac{m}{100})$.

Solving these equations gives us four distinct solutions if and only if $0 < 2-\frac{m}{100} < 2+\frac{m}{100}$.

Simplifying this inequality gives $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 4$, which means $0 < m < 400$.

Therefore, the positive integers $m$ that satisfy the equation are the integers from 1 to 399. 

However, we need the number of these integers that make the original equation have four distinct solutions. 

By analyzing the graphs of $y = ||x-1|-2$ and $y = \frac{m}{100}$, we find that the equation has four distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between the minimum and maximum values of $|x-1|-2$. 

This happens when $\frac{m}{100} = 1$, or $m = 100$. 

Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ that makes the equation have four distinct solutions. The answer is: $\boxed{1}$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many solutions does the equation \[\frac{(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)\dotsm(x-100)}{(x-1^2)(x-2^2)(x-3^2)\dotsm(x-100^2)} = 0\]have for $x$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Any solution to this equation must make the numerator of the left-hand side zero, while keeping the denominator non-zero. The numerator is zero when $x$ is one of the numbers $1, 2, 3, \dots, 100.$ However, for any value in this list that is a perfect square, the denominator will also be zero, so that value of $x$ will not be a root. Therefore, we want to find the number of integers in the list $1, 2, \dots, 100$ which are not perfect squares. The perfect squares in the list are $1^2, 2^2, \dots, 10^2,$ so there are $10$ perfect squares, and \[100 - 10 = \boxed{90}\]integers which are not perfect squares. The answer is $\boxed{90}$

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


First, we know that the equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. This implies that the right-hand side $\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal to 1, because $| |x - 1| - 2 | = 1$ has exactly 4 solutions. So, we have $\frac{m}{100} = 1$, which gives us $m = 100$. Therefore, the only possible value for $m$ is $100$. So, the answer is $\boxed{1}$.
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def num_solutions():
    # As shown above, the only possible value for m is 100
    m = 100
    return m

result = num_solutions()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 100

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output

```
The value of $m$ is $100$. However, the problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ that make the equation have 4 distinct solutions. In this case, there is only one such value, which is $100$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition is $1$. The answer is $\boxed{1}$.

**Solution:** 



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to the distance between two adjacent steps in the piecewise function defined by $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. This function has three steps at $x = -1$, $x = 3$, and $x = 5$. The distances between these steps are $4$ and $2$. So, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal to one of these distances. Therefore, $m$ must be one of the values $400$ or $200$. 

We need to determine which value of $m$ results in 4 distinct solutions. This can be done by graphing the function $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ and observing where it intersects the horizontal line $y = \frac{m}{100}$. For $m = 400$, the line intersects the function at four points, while for $m = 200$, the line intersects the function at two points. Therefore, the only value of $m$ that results in 4 distinct solutions is $m = 400$.

The answer is: $1$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"For certain ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ of real numbers, the system of equations
\[\begin{aligned} ax+by&=1 \\ x^2 + y^2 &= 50  \end{aligned}\]has at least one solution, and each solution is an ordered pair $(x,y)\,$ of integers. How many such ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ are there?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The graph of $ax+by=1$ is a line, while the graph of $x^2+y^2=50$ is a circle centered at the origin. Therefore, $(a, b)$ satisfies the conditions if and only if the line and circle intersect at least once, and they intersect only at lattice points (points with integer coordinates).

Knowing this, it makes sense to look for lattice points on the circle whose equation is $x^2+y^2=50$. Testing cases, we find that there are twelve lattice points on the circle: $(\pm 1, \pm 7)$, $(\pm 7, \pm 1)$, and $(\pm 5, \pm 5)$ (where the two $\pm$ signs in each pair are independent of each other).

There are $\tbinom{12}{2} = 66$ pairs of these points, and each pair determines a line. However, the graph of $ax+by=1$ can never pass through the origin $(0, 0)$, since if $x=y=0$, then $ax+by=0 \neq 1$. Therefore, the six pairs which consist of diametrically opposed points are invalid, since the line through them passes through the origin. This corrects our count to $66 - 6 = 60$.

In addition, for each of the twelve points, there is a line tangent to the circle at that point, so that the only solution to the system is that one point. This brings the final total to $60 + 12 = \boxed{72}$. The answer is $\boxed{72}$

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"

**Solution:** 



The problem involves the absolute value function and asking for the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions. 

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be rewritten as a piecewise function:

\[
\begin{cases}
\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100} & \text{if } \vert x-1 \vert -2 \geq 0 \\
-(\vert x-1 \vert -2) = \frac{m}{100} & \text{if } \vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0
\end{cases}
\]

which simplifies to:

\[
\begin{cases}
\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100} & \text{if } \vert x-1 \vert -2 \geq 0 \\
\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100} & \text{if } \vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0
\end{cases}
\]

Now we need to solve each of the four cases separately:

1. $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, this gives us two equations: $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $-(x-1) = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.
2. $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, this gives us two equations: $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $-(x-1) = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.

For each of these cases, we need to find the value of $m$ for which the right side of the equation is positive. 

The right side of the equation is positive when:

1. $2 + \frac{m}{100} > 0 \Rightarrow m > -200$, but since $m$ is a positive integer, we only need to consider $m \geq 1$.
2. $2 - \frac{m}{100} > 0 \Rightarrow m < 200$.

Therefore, the positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions are in the range $1 \leq m \leq 200$.

To find the number of such positive integers $m$, we simply calculate the number of integers in the range from 1 to 200:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def count_positive_integers():
    return 200 - 1 + 1

result = count_positive_integers()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 200

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
200
```
The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 200. However, we are looking for the number of such $m$ for which the equation has exactly 4 distinct solutions.

To do this, we need to find the values of $m$ for which the right side of the equation is equal to zero or negative. 

The right side of the equation is zero when:

1. $2 + \frac{m}{100} = 0 \Rightarrow m = -200$, but since $m$ is a positive integer, this case is not valid.
2. $2 - \frac{m}{100} = 0 \Rightarrow m = 200$.

The right side of the equation is negative when:

1. $2 + \frac{m}{100} < 0 \Rightarrow m < -200$, but since $m$ is a positive integer, this case is not valid.
2. $2 - \frac{m}{100} < 0 \Rightarrow m > 200$.

Therefore, the only value of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is $m = 200$.

However, we are looking for the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions, not just the value of $m$ that satisfies this condition.

To find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has exactly 4 distinct solutions, we need to consider the number of positive integers $m$ in the range $1 \leq m \leq 200$.

Since we found that the only value of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is $m = 200$, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has exactly 4 distinct solutions is 1.

The answer is: 1
