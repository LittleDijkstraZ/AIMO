**Problem:** 
"How many solutions does the equation \[\frac{(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)\dotsm(x-100)}{(x-1^2)(x-2^2)(x-3^2)\dotsm(x-100^2)} = 0\]have for $x$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Any solution to this equation must make the numerator of the left-hand side zero, while keeping the denominator non-zero. The numerator is zero when $x$ is one of the numbers $1, 2, 3, \dots, 100.$ However, for any value in this list that is a perfect square, the denominator will also be zero, so that value of $x$ will not be a root. Therefore, we want to find the number of integers in the list $1, 2, \dots, 100$ which are not perfect squares. The perfect squares in the list are $1^2, 2^2, \dots, 10^2,$ so there are $10$ perfect squares, and \[100 - 10 = \boxed{90}\]integers which are not perfect squares. The answer is $\boxed{90}$

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The problem is asking for how many positive integers $m$ the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 1$. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a graph that is a series of V's, each with a width of $1$ at the base. Therefore, for the equation to have $4$ distinct solutions, the height of the V's must be equal to $\frac{m}{100}$, and this height must be $1$.

Therefore, we have $\frac{m}{100} = 1$, which implies $m = 100$.

So, there is only $1$ positive integer $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions. The answer is: $1$

## QUESTION 2 - 1

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"For certain ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ of real numbers, the system of equations
\[\begin{aligned} ax+by&=1 \\ x^2 + y^2 &= 50  \end{aligned}\]has at least one solution, and each solution is an ordered pair $(x,y)\,$ of integers. How many such ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ are there?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The graph of $ax+by=1$ is a line, while the graph of $x^2+y^2=50$ is a circle centered at the origin. Therefore, $(a, b)$ satisfies the conditions if and only if the line and circle intersect at least once, and they intersect only at lattice points (points with integer coordinates).

Knowing this, it makes sense to look for lattice points on the circle whose equation is $x^2+y^2=50$. Testing cases, we find that there are twelve lattice points on the circle: $(\pm 1, \pm 7)$, $(\pm 7, \pm 1)$, and $(\pm 5, \pm 5)$ (where the two $\pm$ signs in each pair are independent of each other).

There are $\tbinom{12}{2} = 66$ pairs of these points, and each pair determines a line. However, the graph of $ax+by=1$ can never pass through the origin $(0, 0)$, since if $x=y=0$, then $ax+by=0 \neq 1$. Therefore, the six pairs which consist of diametrically opposed points are invalid, since the line through them passes through the origin. This corrects our count to $66 - 6 = 60$.

In addition, for each of the twelve points, there is a line tangent to the circle at that point, so that the only solution to the system is that one point. This brings the final total to $60 + 12 = \boxed{72}$. The answer is $\boxed{72}$

**Solution:** 



The problem asks for how many positive integers $m$ the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. 

To solve this problem, we can first rewrite the equation as $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. 

We know that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=k$ (where $k$ is a constant) has $4$ distinct solutions when $0<k<1$. 

So we need to find the value of $m$ such that $\frac{m}{100}$ is in the range $(0, 1)$. 

This means $0<\frac{m}{100}<1$, which simplifies to $0<m<100$. 

The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from $1$ to $99$. 

So there are $99$ positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

The answer is: $99$.

The list of values for $m$ is not correct. The equation $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when $1 \leq m \leq 100$. However, the list of values for $m$ is from 1 to 100, which means all the values of $m$ from 1 to 100 are valid. Therefore, the list of values for $m$ is correct.

The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 100. The answer is: 100

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, we need to understand the structure of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. This equation has 4 distinct solutions.
2. We know that the absolute value function $\vert x \vert$ makes all values positive. So, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have different expressions inside the absolute value based on the value of $x$.
3. We can split the equation into two cases based on the value of $x$:
   - Case 1: $x \geq 1$. In this case, the equation becomes $\vert x-1-2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert x-3 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.
   - Case 2: $x < 1$. In this case, the equation becomes $\vert 1-x-2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert -x-1 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, which is equivalent to $\vert x+1 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.
4. For each case, we need to solve the resulting equations and count the number of distinct solutions.
5. After solving the equations, we can determine the value of $m$ that gives us 4 distinct solutions.

Now, let's implement this in Python using the sympy library:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solve, Eq, Abs

def find_m():
    x, m = symbols('x m')
    solutions = []

    # Case 1: x >= 1
    equation1 = Eq(Abs(x - 3), m / 100)
    solutions1 = solve(equation1, x)

    # Case 2: x < 1
    equation2 = Eq(Abs(x + 1), m / 100)
    solutions2 = solve(equation2, x)

    # Combine the solutions
    solutions = solutions1 + solutions2

    # Count the number of distinct solutions
    distinct_solutions = len(set(solutions))

    return distinct_solutions

distinct_solutions = find_m()
print(distinct_solutions)
```

CODE RESULTS 4

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
4
```
The number of distinct solutions for the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is 4. Therefore, the value of $m$ that satisfies this condition is 200. The answer is: $2$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many distinct solutions are there to the equation $|x-7| = |x+1|$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
If $|x-7| = |x+1|$, then either $x-7 = x+1$ or $x-7 = -(x+1)$.  Simplifying $x-7=x+1$ gives $0=8$, which has no solutions, so no values of $x$ satisfy $x-7 = x+1$.  If $x-7 = -(x+1)$, then $x-7 = -x-1$, so $2x = 6$, which gives $x=3$.  So, there is $\boxed{1}$ solution.

Challenge: See if you can find a quick solution to this problem by simply thinking about the graphs of $y=|x-7|$ and $y=|x+1|$. The answer is $\boxed{1}$
