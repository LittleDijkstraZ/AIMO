**Problem:** 
"What is the minimum value of the expression $2x^2+3y^2+8x-24y+62$ for real $x$ and $y$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Rearranging the expression, we have  \[2x^2+8x+3y^2-24y+62\]We first complete the square in $x$. Factoring a 2 from the first two terms of the expression, we get  \[2(x^2+4x)+3y^2-24y+62\]In order for the expression inside the parenthesis to be a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(4/2)^2=4$ inside the parenthesis. Doing this, we have \[2(x^2+4x+4-4)+3y^2-24y+62 \Rightarrow 2(x+2)^2+3y^2-24y+54\]Now we complete the square in $y$. Factoring a 3 from the $y$ terms in the expression, we get \[2(x+2)^2+3(y^2-8y)+54\]In order for the expression inside the second parenthesis to be a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(8/2)^2=16$ inside the parenthesis. Doing this, we have \[2(x+2)^2+3(y^2-8y+16-16)+54 \Rightarrow 2(x+2)^2+3(y-4)^2+6\]Since the minimum value of $2(x+2)^2$ and $3(y-4)^2$ is $0$ (perfect squares can never be negative), the minimum value of the entire expression is $\boxed{6}$, and is achieved when $x=-2$ and $y=4$. The answer is $\boxed{6}$

**Problem**
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solve, simplify

def min_value():
    # Define the variables
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # Define the expression
    expr = 5*x**2 + 5*y**2 - 8*x*y

    # Define the constraint
    constraint = abs(x - 2*y) + abs(y - 2*x) - 40

    # Solve the constraint for y
    y_sol = solve(constraint, y)[0]

    # Substitute y in the expression
    expr_sub = expr.subs(y, y_sol)

    # Find the minimum value
    min_val = simplify(expr_sub.diff(x))

    # Solve for x when the derivative is zero
    x_sol = solve(min_val, x)

    # Substitute x in the expression
    min_val = expr_sub.subs(x, x_sol[0])

    return min_val

result = min_value()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 800

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
800
```
The minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $\boxed{800}$.
The answer is: $800$
