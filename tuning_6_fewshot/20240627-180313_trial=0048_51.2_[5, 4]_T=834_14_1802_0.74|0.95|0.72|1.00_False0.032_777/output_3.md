**Problem:** 
"An ellipse is defined parametrically by
\[(x,y) = \left( \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t}, \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t} \right).\]Then the equation of the ellipse can be written in the form
\[Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0,\]where $A,$ $B,$ $C,$ $D,$ $E,$ and $F$ are integers, and $\gcd(|A|,|B|,|C|,|D|,|E|,|F|) = 1.$  Find $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F|.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
In the equation $y = \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\cos t$ to get
\[\cos t = \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3}.\]In the equation $x = \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\sin t$ to get
\[\sin t = \frac{1}{2} x (2 - \cos t) + 1 = \frac{1}{2} x \left( 2 - \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right) + 1 = 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)}.\]Since $\cos^2 t + \sin^2 t = 1,$
\[\left( \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right)^2 + \left( 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)} \right)^2 = 1.\]Multiplying both sides by $(2(y + 3))^2$ and expanding, it will simplify to
\[81x^2 - 36xy + 16y^2 - 108x + 240y + 900 = 0.\]Therefore, $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F| = 81 + 36 + 16 + 108 + 240 + 900 = \boxed{1381}.$ The answer is $\boxed{1381}$

The error in the above code is because we are trying to solve an equation with absolute values directly using the `solveset` function from Sympy. However, this function does not support absolute values. To overcome this, we can solve the equation step by step.

Let's start with the first part of the equation: $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$.
This equation is satisfied only when $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the four solutions: $(x, y) = (5, 5), (-5, -5), (5, -5), (-5, 5)$.

Now, let's move to the second part of the equation: $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. This equation is satisfied only when $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the four solutions: $(x, y) = (8, 8), (-8, -8), (8, -8), (-8, 8)$.

Combining the solutions from both parts, we have a total of 8 solutions. These solutions form a square with side length 16. Therefore, the area of the polygon is the area of this square, which is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: 256

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"An ellipse is defined parametrically by

Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
In the equation $y = \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\cos t$ to get
\[\cos t = \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3}.\]In the equation $x = \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\sin t$ to get
\[\sin t = \frac{1}{2} x (2 - \cos t) + 1 = \frac{1}{2} x \left( 2 - \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right) + 1 = 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)}.\]Since $\cos^2 t + \sin^2 t = 1,$
\[\left( \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right)^2 + \left( 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)} \right)^2 = 1.\]Multiplying both sides by $(2(y + 3))^2$ and expanding, it will simplify to
\[81x^2 - 36xy + 16y^2 - 108x + 240y + 900 = 0.\]Therefore, $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F| = 81 + 36 + 16 + 108 + 240 + 900 = \boxed{1381}.$ The answer is $\boxed{1381}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The given equation is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The solutions to these equations are:
- $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ gives $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = \pm 10$.
- $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ gives $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x - y = \pm 10$.
- $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ gives $\vert x \vert = 8$, which implies $x = \pm 8$.
- $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ gives $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $y = \pm 8$.
These lines form a square with side length $16$ (the sum of the absolute values of the $x$ and $y$ coordinates), so the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is $\boxed{256}$.

**Problem:** 
"Let $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_ 2= (-16,2).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that
\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as
\[\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1.\]Find $h + k + a + b.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we can first notice that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to the system of equations:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From equation (2), we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that $x = 8$ or $x = -8$, and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. This gives us a total of 4 points: $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

Now, let's consider equation (1). If $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, then $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these two equations simultaneously, we get four more points: $(5,5)$, $(-5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, and $(5,-5)$.

Thus, the eight points $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, $(-8,-8)$, $(5,5)$, $(-5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, and $(5,-5)$ form the vertices of the octagon. The area of the octagon can be found by calculating the area of a square with side length 16 and subtracting the areas of four right triangles with legs of length 6 and 8. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$, and the area of each triangle is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot 6 \cdot 8 = 24$. Therefore, the area of the octagon is $256 - 4 \cdot 24 = 176$. The answer is: $176$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many square units are in the area of the triangle whose vertices are the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the curve $y = (x-3)^2 (x+2)$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we need to find where this curve intersects the $x$ and $y$ axes.  If $y=0$, then $(x-3)^2(x+2)=0$, which has solutions of $x=3$ and $x=-2$.  If $x=0$, then $y=(-3)^2(2)=18$.  So, the curve has two $x$-intercepts and one $y$-intercept.  The length of the base along the $x$-axis is $3-(-2)=5$.  The height from this base is equal to the $y$-intercept, 18.  The area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 5\cdot 18=\boxed{45}$. The answer is $\boxed{45}$
