Assistant:

 The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be solved by considering the cases for the absolute values separately.

The number of solutions will depend on the value of $\frac{m}{100}$. Specifically, the number of solutions will be $4$ if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $2$ and $3$. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ will have a value of $2$ or $3$ at these points, and will change its value at these points.

So we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $200 < m < 300$. The number of such integers is $100$.

So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $100$.
The answer is: $100$

## QUESTION 2 - 1

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let \[f(x) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
-x + 3 & \text{if } x \le 0, \\
2x - 5 & \text{if } x > 0.
\end{array}
\right.\]How many solutions does the equation $f(f(x)) = 4$ have?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
To solve the equation $f(f(x)) = 4,$ we first find the values $x$ such that $f(x) = 4.$

Either $f(x) = -x + 3$ (for $x \le 0$) or $f(x) = 2x - 5$ (for $x > 0$). If $-x + 3 = 4,$ then $x = -1.$ Note that this value satisfies $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = 4,$ then $x = 9/2.$ Note that this value satisfies $x > 0.$ Therefore, the solutions to $f(x) = 4$ are $x = -1$ and $x = 9/2.$

Next, we solve for the values $x$ such that $f(x) = -1.$ If $-x + 3 = -1,$ then $x = 4.$ This value does not satisfy $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = -1,$ then $x = 2.$ This value satisfies $x > 0.$

Finally, we solve for the values $x$ such that $f(x) = 9/2.$ If $-x + 3 = 9/2,$ then $x = -3/2.$ This value satisfies $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = 9/2,$ then $x = 19/4.$ This value satisfies $x > 0.$

Therefore, the equation $f(f(x)) = 4$ has the solutions $x = 2,$ $-3/2,$ and $19/4,$ for a total of $\boxed{3}$ solutions. The answer is $\boxed{3}$

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step.

**Solution:** 



The problem asks for how many positive integers $m$ the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has $4$ distinct solutions. 

We know that the expression on the left side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, takes the value of $0$ only when $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$, or $x = 3$ or $x = -1$. Similarly, it takes the value of $1$ only when $\vert x-1 \vert = 3$, or $x = 4$ or $x = -2$. Therefore, the expression takes the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ only when $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 1$. This implies that $0 < m < 100$.

Now we need to find out how many $m$ in this range make the equation have $4$ distinct solutions. 

We can start by setting $\frac{m}{100} = 1$, which gives $m = 100$. At this value, the equation becomes \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=1.\] This equation has $4$ distinct solutions: $x = 3, 1, -1, -3$.

Then we decrease $m$ by a small amount, say $\Delta m = 1$, and the equation becomes \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{99}{100}.\] This equation still has $4$ distinct solutions.

We continue to decrease $m$ until we reach $m = 1$. At this value, the equation becomes \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{1}{100}.\] This equation has only $2$ distinct solutions: $x = 3, -1$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $99 - 1 + 1 = 99$.

However, this is not the final answer because we have not considered the case when $0 < \frac{m}{100} = \frac{1}{100}$. In this case, the equation becomes \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{1}{100},\] which also has $4$ distinct solutions: $x = 1.00005, 0.99995, -0.99995, -1.00005$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $99 + 1 = 100$.

The answer is: $100$.
