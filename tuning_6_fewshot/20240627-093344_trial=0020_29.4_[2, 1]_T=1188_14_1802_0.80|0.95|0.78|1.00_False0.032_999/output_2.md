**Problem:** 
"How many solutions does the equation \[\frac{(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)\dotsm(x-100)}{(x-1^2)(x-2^2)(x-3^2)\dotsm(x-100^2)} = 0\]have for $x$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Any solution to this equation must make the numerator of the left-hand side zero, while keeping the denominator non-zero. The numerator is zero when $x$ is one of the numbers $1, 2, 3, \dots, 100.$ However, for any value in this list that is a perfect square, the denominator will also be zero, so that value of $x$ will not be a root. Therefore, we want to find the number of integers in the list $1, 2, \dots, 100$ which are not perfect squares. The perfect squares in the list are $1^2, 2^2, \dots, 10^2,$ so there are $10$ perfect squares, and \[100 - 10 = \boxed{90}\]integers which are not perfect squares. The answer is $\boxed{90}$

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


This problem requires a detailed analysis of the equation and the number of solutions it can have. The equation is \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] and we want to find for how many positive integers $m$ does it have $4$ distinct solutions.

First, let's consider the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$. Since $m$ is a positive integer, $\frac{m}{100}$ is a positive fraction.

The left side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, is the absolute value of the absolute value of $x-1$ minus $2$. This function has a "V" shape, with the vertex at $x=1$. It is $0$ when $x=1$, decreases to $-2$ as $x$ decreases from $1$ to $0$, then increases from $-2$ to $0$ as $x$ increases from $1$ to $2$, and stays $0$ for $x>2$.

For the equation to have $4$ distinct solutions, the right side, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be equal to the value of the left side at $x=1$, which is $0$, and also equal to the value of the left side at $x=3$, which is $2-2=0$.

Therefore, $\frac{m}{100}=0$ and $\frac{m}{100}=2-2=0$. This means $m$ must be $0$ or $200$. However, $m$ must be a positive integer, so $m=200$.

Therefore, the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $200$. The answer is: 1

However, this is not correct. Let's analyze the problem further.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can have $4$ distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}=1$. This is because the left side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, can take on the value of $1$ twice: once when $x$ is slightly less than $0$ (where it decreases from $2$ to $1$), and once when $x$ is slightly greater than $2$ (where it increases from $1$ to $2$).

So, we need to solve the equation $\frac{m}{100}=1$, which gives $m=100$.

Therefore, the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $100$. The answer is: 1

Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


For the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ to have $4$ distinct solutions, it must be in the form shown in the graph below:

draw((3,0)--(3,2),linewidth(1));
draw((4,0)--(4,3),linewidth(1));
draw((5,0)--(5,0.5),linewidth(1));
draw((0,1)--(5,1),linewidth(1));
draw((0,2)--(5,2),linewidth(1));
draw((0,3)--(5,3),linewidth(1));

label("0", (0,-0.2), S, fontsize(10));
label("1", (1,-0.2), S, fontsize(10));
label("2", (2,-0.2), S, fontsize(10));
label("3", (3,-0.2), S, fontsize(10));
label("4", (4,-0.2), S, fontsize(10));
label("5", (5,-0.2), S, fontsize(10));
label("0", (-0.2,0), W, fontsize(10));
label("1", (-0.2,1), W, fontsize(10));
label("2", (-0.2,2), W, fontsize(10));
label("3", (-0.2,3), W, fontsize(10));
label("$\frac{m}{100}$", (5.5,0), E, fontsize(10));
[/asy]

This means that $\frac{m}{100}$ must be less than $2$ and greater than $0$, so $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. This implies $0 < m < 200$.

Now we need to find how many positive integers $m$ in the range $0 < m < 200$ make the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have $4$ distinct solutions.

After analyzing the graph, we can see that the equation has $4$ distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to the distance between the two "humps" in the graph. This distance is $1$, so we need $\frac{m}{100}=1$, which gives $m=100$.

Therefore, the only value of $m$ that makes the equation have $4$ distinct solutions is $m=100$. So there is only $1$ value of $m$ that satisfies the condition. The answer is: $1$.
The answer is: $\boxed{1}$

## QUESTION 2 - 2 
- TIME_SPENT : 597 secs

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"For certain ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ of real numbers, the system of equations
\[\begin{aligned} ax+by&=1 \\ x^2 + y^2 &= 50  \end{aligned}\]has at least one solution, and each solution is an ordered pair $(x,y)\,$ of integers. How many such ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ are there?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The graph of $ax+by=1$ is a line, while the graph of $x^2+y^2=50$ is a circle centered at the origin. Therefore, $(a, b)$ satisfies the conditions if and only if the line and circle intersect at least once, and they intersect only at lattice points (points with integer coordinates).

Knowing this, it makes sense to look for lattice points on the circle whose equation is $x^2+y^2=50$. Testing cases, we find that there are twelve lattice points on the circle: $(\pm 1, \pm 7)$, $(\pm 7, \pm 1)$, and $(\pm 5, \pm 5)$ (where the two $\pm$ signs in each pair are independent of each other).

There are $\tbinom{12}{2} = 66$ pairs of these points, and each pair determines a line. However, the graph of $ax+by=1$ can never pass through the origin $(0, 0)$, since if $x=y=0$, then $ax+by=0 \neq 1$. Therefore, the six pairs which consist of diametrically opposed points are invalid, since the line through them passes through the origin. This corrects our count to $66 - 6 = 60$.

In addition, for each of the twelve points, there is a line tangent to the circle at that point, so that the only solution to the system is that one point. This brings the final total to $60 + 12 = \boxed{72}$. The answer is $\boxed{72}$

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



To solve this problem, we need to find out how many positive integers $m$ make the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have exactly 4 distinct solutions.

Let's break down the equation:
- $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$
- This equation is equivalent to a piecewise function:
  - If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 \geq 0$, then the equation becomes $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$.
  - If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0$, then the equation becomes $-( \vert x-1 \vert -2 ) = \frac{m}{100}$.

Now, let's solve these two equations:

1. For $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$:
   - $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$
   - $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 = -2 - \frac{m}{100}$
   - $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$

2. For $-( \vert x-1 \vert -2 ) = \frac{m}{100}$:
   - $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = \frac{m}{100}$
   - $-\vert x-1 \vert = -2 + \frac{m}{100}$
   - $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$
   - $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 = -2 + \frac{m}{100}$
   - $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ or $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$

Now we have 4 possible solutions for $x$:
- $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$
- $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$
- $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$
- $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$

For these 4 solutions to be distinct, we need the fractions $\frac{m}{100}$ to be different for each equation. This means $m$ cannot be a multiple of 100.

So, we need to find out how many positive integers $m$ are not multiples of 100 and make the sum of the absolute values of the differences of the right sides of the equations greater than 4. That is, we want to find out how many positive integers $m$ satisfy:
- $\vert (3 + \frac{m}{100}) - (-1 - \frac{m}{100}) \vert + \vert (3 - \frac{m}{100}) - (-1 + \frac{m}{100}) \vert > 4$
- $\vert 4 + \frac{2m}{100} \vert + \vert 4 - \frac{2m}{100} \vert > 4$
- $4 + \frac{2m}{100} + 4 - \frac{2m}{100} > 4$
- $8 > 4$

This inequality is always true, so any positive integer $m$ that is not a multiple of 100 will make the equation have 4 distinct solutions.

Since there are infinitely many positive integers that are not multiples of 100, the number of positive integers $m$ that make the equation have 4 distinct solutions is infinite. However, we need to find a specific number of such $m$ that are between 1 and 1000.

Let's check how many positive integers $m$ between 1 and 1000 are not multiples of 100. There are $\left\lfloor \frac{1000}{100} \right\rfloor = 10$ multiples of 100 between 1 and 1000. So, the number of positive integers $m$ between 1 and 1000 that are not multiples of 100 is $1000 - 10 = 990$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ between 1 and 1000 that make the equation have 4 distinct solutions is 990.
The answer is $\boxed{990}$.

 The given equation is $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ and we want to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that this equation has $4$ distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be solved graphically as a series of piecewise functions. The solutions to the equation will be the number of times the function $\frac{m}{100}$ intersects the graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$.

For the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, it has a "V" shape with the vertex at $(1,2)$. The function is equal to $2 - (x-1)$ when $x < 1$, equal to $2$ when $1 \leq x \leq 3$, and equal to $(x-1) - 2 = x - 3$ when $x > 3$.

The function $\frac{m}{100}$ is a horizontal line that intersects the graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ at four distinct points if and only if $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 1$. This is because the "V" shape of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a width of $2$ at the vertex, so the line $\frac{m}{100}$ can intersect the graph at four distinct points only if its height is between $0$ and $1$.

Therefore, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $0 < m < 100$. The number of such integers is $99$.

So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $99$.

The answer is: $99$.

**Problem:** 
"How many distinct solutions are there to the equation $|x-7| = |x+1|$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
If $|x-7| = |x+1|$, then either $x-7 = x+1$ or $x-7 = -(x+1)$.  Simplifying $x-7=x+1$ gives $0=8$, which has no solutions, so no values of $x$ satisfy $x-7 = x+1$.  If $x-7 = -(x+1)$, then $x-7 = -x-1$, so $2x = 6$, which gives $x=3$.  So, there is $\boxed{1}$ solution.

Challenge: See if you can find a quick solution to this problem by simply thinking about the graphs of $y=|x-7|$ and $y=|x+1|$. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


This problem is more complicated than the previous one, and requires a deeper understanding of absolute value functions and their graphs. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $3$. This is because the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a graph that is a 'V' shape with the minimum value of $1$ and the maximum value of $3$. Therefore, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be in the interval $(1,3)$ for the equation to have four distinct solutions. This implies that $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 3$, or equivalently, $100 < m < 300$. The number of positive integers $m$ in this interval is $300 - 100 - 1 = 199$. However, we must exclude the values of $m$ that make the right hand side equal to either $1$ or $3$, since those would only give three distinct solutions. When $\frac{m}{100} = 1$, we have $m = 100$, and when $\frac{m}{100} = 3$, we have $m = 300$. So, we need to exclude these two values. This leaves us with $199 - 2 = 197$ values of $m$. Therefore, there are $197$ positive integers $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions.
The answer is: $197$

**Problem:** 
"How many solutions does the equation \[\frac{(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)\dotsm(x-100)}{(x-1^2)(x-2^2)(x-3^2)\dotsm(x-100^2)} = 0\]have for $x$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Any solution to this equation must make the numerator of the left-hand side zero, while keeping the denominator non-zero. The numerator is zero when $x$ is one of the numbers $1, 2, 3, \dots, 100.$ However, for any value in this list that is a perfect square, the denominator will also be zero, so that value of $x$ will not be a root. Therefore, we want to find the number of integers in the list $1, 2, \dots, 100$ which are not perfect squares. The perfect squares in the list are $1^2, 2^2, \dots, 10^2,$ so there are $10$ perfect squares, and \[100 - 10 = \boxed{90}\]integers which are not perfect squares. The answer is $\boxed{90}$

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


We can start by understanding the structure of the equation. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to the difference of the two partitions of the absolute value function. The partitions are $2$ and $1$, so the equation has four distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}=2-1=1$. Therefore, $m=100$.
