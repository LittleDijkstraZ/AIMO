**Example**

**Problem:** 
"For certain ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ of real numbers, the system of equations
\[\begin{aligned} ax+by&=1 \\ x^2 + y^2 &= 50  \end{aligned}\]has at least one solution, and each solution is an ordered pair $(x,y)\,$ of integers. How many such ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ are there?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The graph of $ax+by=1$ is a line, while the graph of $x^2+y^2=50$ is a circle centered at the origin. Therefore, $(a, b)$ satisfies the conditions if and only if the line and circle intersect at least once, and they intersect only at lattice points (points with integer coordinates).

Knowing this, it makes sense to look for lattice points on the circle whose equation is $x^2+y^2=50$. Testing cases, we find that there are twelve lattice points on the circle: $(\pm 1, \pm 7)$, $(\pm 7, \pm 1)$, and $(\pm 5, \pm 5)$ (where the two $\pm$ signs in each pair are independent of each other).

There are $\tbinom{12}{2} = 66$ pairs of these points, and each pair determines a line. However, the graph of $ax+by=1$ can never pass through the origin $(0, 0)$, since if $x=y=0$, then $ax+by=0 \neq 1$. Therefore, the six pairs which consist of diametrically opposed points are invalid, since the line through them passes through the origin. This corrects our count to $66 - 6 = 60$.

In addition, for each of the twelve points, there is a line tangent to the circle at that point, so that the only solution to the system is that one point. This brings the final total to $60 + 12 = \boxed{72}$. The answer is $\boxed{72}$

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step.

**Solution:** 


The sympy-based approach for solving this problem involves the following steps:

1. We start by setting up the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ and solving it for $x$.
2. We then find the number of distinct solutions for each value of $m$ from $1$ to $100$.
3. We count the number of times the equation has $4$ distinct solutions.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 To solve this problem, we need to analyze the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ and find the values of $m$ for which it has $4$ distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is a piecewise function. We can break it down into cases based on the value of $x$:

1. If $x \le 1$, then $\vert x-1 \vert = 1-x$, so the equation becomes $\vert 1-x-2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert -x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$. This simplifies to $\vert x+1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$.
2. If $1 < x \le 3$, then $\vert x-1 \vert = x-1$, so the equation becomes $\vert x-1-2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert x-3 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$.
3. If $x > 3$, then $\vert x-1 \vert = x-1$, so the equation becomes $\vert x-1-2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert x-3 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$.

For each case, we need to solve the equation and find the values of $x$ that satisfy it. Then we count the number of distinct solutions in each case and add them up.

After analyzing the problem, we find that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions when $m=50$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $1$. The answer is: $1$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let \[f(x) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
-x + 3 & \text{if } x \le 0, \\
2x - 5 & \text{if } x > 0.
\end{array}
\right.\]How many solutions does the equation $f(f(x)) = 4$ have?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
To solve the equation $f(f(x)) = 4,$ we first find the values $x$ such that $f(x) = 4.$

Either $f(x) = -x + 3$ (for $x \le 0$) or $f(x) = 2x - 5$ (for $x > 0$). If $-x + 3 = 4,$ then $x = -1.$ Note that this value satisfies $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = 4,$ then $x = 9/2.$ Note that this value satisfies $x > 0.$ Therefore, the solutions to $f(x) = 4$ are $x = -1$ and $x = 9/2.$

Next, we solve for the values $x$ such that $f(x) = -1.$ If $-x + 3 = -1,$ then $x = 4.$ This value does not satisfy $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = -1,$ then $x = 2.$ This value satisfies $x > 0.$

Finally, we solve for the values $x$ such that $f(x) = 9/2.$ If $-x + 3 = 9/2,$ then $x = -3/2.$ This value satisfies $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = 9/2,$ then $x = 19/4.$ This value satisfies $x > 0.$

Therefore, the equation $f(f(x)) = 4$ has the solutions $x = 2,$ $-3/2,$ and $19/4,$ for a total of $\boxed{3}$ solutions. The answer is $\boxed{3}$

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, we need to consider the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. We know that this equation has 4 distinct solutions. 

Now, let's analyze the inner absolute value $\vert x-1 \vert -2$. This expression will be equal to 0 when $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$. This happens when $x = 3$ and $x = -1$. So the inner absolute value can be written as:

\[
\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 
\begin{cases} 
x-3, & \text{if } x \geq 1 \\
-(x+1), & \text{if } x < 1 
\end{cases}
\]

Now we can analyze the outer absolute value $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. This expression will be equal to $\frac{m}{100}$ for 4 distinct values of $x$ if $\frac{m}{100}$ is between 0 and 2. This means $0 \leq \frac{m}{100} \leq 2$, or $0 \leq m \leq 200$.

Now we need to find the number of integer values of $m$ that make the equation have 4 distinct solutions. This is equivalent to finding the number of integer solutions to $0 \leq m \leq 200$ that make the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have 4 distinct solutions.

We can do this by trying each value of $m$ from 0 to 200 and counting the number of distinct solutions for each $m$. We find that there is exactly one value of $m$ in the range $0 \leq m \leq 200$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions. That value is $m=200$.

So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 1. The answer is: $1$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let \[f(x) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
-x + 3 & \text{if } x \le 0, \\
2x - 5 & \text{if } x > 0.

\right.\]How many solutions does the equation $f(f(x)) = 4$ have?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
To solve the equation $f(f(x)) = 4,$ we first find the values $x$ such that $f(x) = 4.$

Either $f(x) = -x + 3$ (for $x \le 0$) or $f(x) = 2x - 5$ (for $x > 0$). If $-x + 3 = 4,$ then $x = -1.$ Note that this value satisfies $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = 4,$ then $x = 9/2.$ Note that this value satisfies $x > 0.$ Therefore, the solutions to $f(x) = 4$ are $x = -1$ and $x = 9/2.$

Next, we solve for the values $x$ such that $f(x) = -1.$ If $-x + 3 = -1,$ then $x = 4.$ This value does not satisfy $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = -1,$ then $x = 2.$ This value satisfies $x > 0.$

Finally, we solve for the values $x$ such that $f(x) = 9/2.$ If $-x + 3 = 9/2,$ then $x = -3/2.$ This value satisfies $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = 9/2,$ then $x = 19/4.$ This value satisfies $x > 0.$

Therefore, the equation $f(f(x)) = 4$ has the solutions $x = 2,$ $-3/2,$ and $19/4,$ for a total of $\boxed{3}$ solutions. The answer is $\boxed{3}$

The number of distinct solutions of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $4$ if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $2$, i.e., $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$.
