**Problem:** 
"Let $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_ 2= (-16,2).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that
\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as
\[\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1.\]Find $h + k + a + b.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. 

Let's analyze each expression separately:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
This expression is zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These two equations represent two squares being equal to 100, so their roots are all real numbers. Therefore, the solution to this equation is all points $(x, y)$ in the plane.

2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
This expression is zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These two equations represent two squares being equal to 64, so their roots are all real numbers. Therefore, the solution to this equation is all points $(x, y)$ in a square with side length 16 centered at the origin.

The intersection of these two solutions is the set of all points $(x, y)$ that satisfy both equations. This intersection is a square with side length 16 centered at the origin. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon formed by the points satisfying the given equation is 256.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Find the number of 10-tuples $(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{10})$ of real numbers such that
\[(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2 = \frac{1}{11}.\]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,
\begin{align*}
&[(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + \dots + 1^2 + 1^2)][(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2] \\
&\ge [(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + (x_2 - x_3) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10}]^2 = 1.
\end{align*}From the given condition, we have equality, so by the equality condition for Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[\frac{1 - x_1}{1} = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{1} = \frac{x_2 - x_3}{1} = \dots = \frac{x_9 - x_{10}}{1} = \frac{x_{10}}{1}.\]Let
\[d = 1 - x_1 = x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_3 = \dots = x_9 - x_{10} = x_{10}.\]Then
\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so
\[(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_{10}) = \left( \frac{10}{11}, \frac{9}{11}, \frac{8}{11}, \dots, \frac{1}{11} \right).\]In particular, there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The product of two terms equals zero if and only if at least one of the terms equals zero. So, we have two sets of equations: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

2. Solving the equations $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This results in a square with side length 10.

3. Solving the equations $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This results in a square with side length 16.

4. The area of the square with side length 10 is $10^2 = 100$, and the area of the square with side length 16 is $16^2 = 256$.

5. The convex polygon enclosed by the points satisfying the original equation is the intersection of these two squares, which is a square with side length 10.

6. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{100}$.

"Let $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_ 2= (-16,2).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that
\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. Therefore, either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. 

The first expression is zero when either $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x - y| - 10 = 0$, which implies $|x + y| = 10$ or $|x - y| = 10$. These are the equations of two lines passing through the origin making an angle of $45^\circ$ and $135^\circ$ respectively.

The second expression is zero when either $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$, which implies $|x| = 8$ or $|y| = 8$. These are the equations of two lines parallel to the y-axis and x-axis respectively, at a distance of 8 units from the origin.

The intersection points of these lines form a rectangle with side lengths $16$ and $20$, hence the area of the rectangle is $16 \times 20 = 320$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $320$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So, the equation given in the problem implies that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

2. These equations are equivalent to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

3. The solutions for the equations $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ are well-known and can be plotted on a coordinate plane. They form a square with side length 16.

4. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

**Problem:** 
"Five identical rectangles are arranged to form a larger rectangle $PQRS$, as shown.  The area of $PQRS$ is $4000$.  What is the length, $x$, rounded off to the nearest integer? [asy]

label("$x$", (x/2, -0.1), S);

[/asy]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Let $w$ be the width of each of the identical rectangles. Since $PQ=3w$, $RS=2x$ and $PQ=RS$ (because $PQRS$ is a rectangle), then $2x = 3w$, or $$w=\frac{2}{3}x.$$ Therefore, the area of each of the five identical rectangles is $$x\left(\frac{2}{3}x\right)=\frac{2}{3}x^2.$$ Since the area of $PQRS$ is 4000 and it is made up of five of these identical smaller rectangles, then $$5\left(\frac{2}{3}x^2\right)=4000$$ or $$\frac{10}{3}x^2 = 4000$$ or $x^2 = 1200$ or $x \approx 34.6$ which, when rounded off to the nearest integer, is $\boxed{35}.$ The answer is $\boxed{35}$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


This problem is a challenge in understanding the properties of absolute values and how they relate to the geometry of the problem. The equation given is a product of two terms equal to zero, which means that either of the terms must be zero. This gives us four cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first two cases, this implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. Geometrically, this represents all points $(x, y)$ that are at a distance of 10 units from the origin in the $x+y$ and $x-y$ directions respectively. These are two lines that pass through the origin and make an angle of 45 degrees with the x-axis.

For the third and fourth cases, this implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. Geometrically, this represents all points $(x, y)$ that are at a distance of 8 units from the origin in the x and y directions respectively. These are two lines that pass through the origin and make an angle of 90 degrees with the x-axis.

The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 10 (since the lines from the first two cases are the diagonals of the square formed by the lines from the third and fourth cases). The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. So, the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units.
The answer is: $100$

**Problem:** 
"Find the number of 10-tuples $(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{10})$ of real numbers such that

Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,
\begin{align*}
&[(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + \dots + 1^2 + 1^2)][(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2] \\
&\ge [(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + (x_2 - x_3) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10}]^2 = 1.
\end{align*}From the given condition, we have equality, so by the equality condition for Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[\frac{1 - x_1}{1} = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{1} = \frac{x_2 - x_3}{1} = \dots = \frac{x_9 - x_{10}}{1} = \frac{x_{10}}{1}.\]Let
\[d = 1 - x_1 = x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_3 = \dots = x_9 - x_{10} = x_{10}.\]Then
\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so
\[(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_{10}) = \left( \frac{10}{11}, \frac{9}{11}, \frac{8}{11}, \dots, \frac{1}{11} \right).\]In particular, there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$
