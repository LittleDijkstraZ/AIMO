Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The problem is asking for the area of a polygon that is formed by the points that satisfy the equation. The equation is equal to zero if and only if either of the factors is zero. This means that the points that satisfy the equation are those that satisfy either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The solutions to $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ are the points where $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which form a square with side length 20. The vertices of this square are $(10,0)$, $(0,10)$, $(-10,0)$, and $(0,-10)$.

The solutions to $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ are the points where $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which form another square with side length 20, but with vertices at $(10,0)$, $(0,-10)$, $(-10,0)$, and $(0,10)$. These two squares overlap at the points $(10,0)$ and $(0,10)$, so the combined shape is a square with side length 20.

The solutions to $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ are the points where $\vert x \vert = 8$, which form two vertical lines at $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.

The solutions to $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ are the points where $\vert y \vert = 8$, which form two horizontal lines at $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

The combined shape formed by these points is a square with side length 16 (since the square formed by the points that satisfy $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ is inside the square formed by the points that satisfy $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$).

The area of this square is $16 \times 16 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



We have a system of equations:

$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$

If a product of terms equals zero, then at least one of the terms is zero. So we have two subcases:

1) Either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

2) Both of them are zero.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. From these equations we get four lines: $y = x \pm 10$ and $y = -(x \pm 10)$.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. From these equations we get four lines: $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

The intersection of these lines form a square with side length $20$ (the distance from $x = 8$ to $x = -8$), so the area of the square is $20^2 = 400$.

So, the area of the convex polygon formed by the set of points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying the equation is $400$. The answer is: $\boxed{400}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The problem is asking for the area of a polygon formed by the points that satisfy the equation. The equation itself is a bit complex, but it's basically saying that the product of two expressions equals zero, which means that each expression must be zero.

2. The two expressions are $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2$. Each of these expressions being zero implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

3. Solving these absolute value equations, we get four lines: $x + y = \pm10$, $x - y = \pm10$, $x = \pm8$, $y = \pm8$. These lines form a square with side length of 16 units.

4. The area of this square is side length squared, which is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So, we can split the problem into two cases: 
   a) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, and 
   b) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

2. For the first case, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, it implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These equations represent two pairs of parallel lines in the plane, which form a rectangle.

3. For the second case, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, it implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. These equations represent two pairs of parallel lines in the plane, which form a rectangle.

4. The intersection of the two rectangles is the convex polygon we are looking for. The sides of this rectangle are $16$ and $20$, so its area is $16 \times 20 = 320$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $320$. The answer is: $320$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, let's observe the equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

The product of two numbers equals 0 if and only if at least one of the numbers equals 0. That means either 

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first case, we have $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. The only way this equation can hold is if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This describes a square with side length 10 and its vertices are at $( \pm 10, 0)$ and $(0, \pm 10)$.

For the second case, we have $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This is only true if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which describes a square with side length 16 and its vertices are at $( \pm 8, 0)$ and $(0, \pm 8)$.

The intersection of these two squares forms a smaller square with side length 10 (the smaller square is entirely inside the larger square). So the area of the convex polygon is the area of the smaller square, which is $10^2 = 100$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units. The answer is: $100$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The product of two positive numbers equals zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Thus, we have two sets of equations to solve for $(x, y)$:

1) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \text{ and } (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, and
2) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \text{ and } (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From 1), we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10 \text{ and } \vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us the vertices of a square centered at the origin with side length 10.

From 2), we have $\vert x \vert = 8 \text{ and } \vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us a square centered at the origin with side length 16.

The vertices of the first square are $(\pm 10, 0), (0, \pm 10)$, and the vertices of the second square are $(\pm 8, 0), (0, \pm 8)$. The vertices of the convex polygon enclosed by these points are the intersections of the line segments connecting these vertices. It is easy to see that the intersection points are $(\pm 10/2, \pm 10/2), (\pm 8/2, \pm 8/2)$.

The side length of the square formed by the vertices of the convex polygon is the distance between $(10/2, 10/2)$ and $(0, 0)$, which is $\sqrt{(10/2)^2 + (10/2)^2} = 5\sqrt{2}$ using the distance formula. Thus, the area of the convex polygon is the side length squared times the number of square units, which is $(5\sqrt{2})^2 \times 4 = 200$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 200 square units. The answer is: $200$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 First, let's analyze the problem. The equation $AB=0$ is true if and only if $A=0$ or $B=0$. So, the given equation is equivalent to one of the following two conditions:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$,
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first condition, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the four lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

For the second condition, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So we get the four lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The region enclosed by these lines is a square with side length $20$. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$. So the area of the convex polygon is $400$.

Here's a Python code to compute the area of the polygon:
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    side_length = 20
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 400

The area of the convex polygon is $400$. The answer is $\boxed{400}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:


The equation $A \cdot B = 0$ implies that at least one of the factors must be zero. So we need to solve four separate equations: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

Each of these equations simplifies to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

Solving the equations $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ gives us the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

Solving the equations $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ gives us the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

These lines form a square with side length $20$. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.

So the area of the convex polygon is $400$.

And that's how we find the area of the polygon! Now let's write the entire code.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solve, Abs

    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # Solve the equations |x + y| = 10 and |x - y| = 10
    solutions1 = solve([Abs(x + y) - 10, Abs(x - y) - 10], [x, y])

    # Solve the equations |x| = 8 and |y| = 8
    solutions2 = solve([Abs(x) - 8, Abs(y) - 8], [x, y])

    # The vertices of the polygon are the union of the solutions
    vertices = solutions1 + solutions2
