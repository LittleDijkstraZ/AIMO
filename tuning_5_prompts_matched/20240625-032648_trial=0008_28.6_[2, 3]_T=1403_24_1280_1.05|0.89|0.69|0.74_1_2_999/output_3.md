Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



We have two products of absolute values in our problem, and each of these absolute values are in a square, which will make the value either positive or zero. In the product, one of the absolute values will be $0$ only when $x+y=10$ or $x-y=10$, and the other absolute value will be $0$ only when $x=8$ or $y=8$. 

So, we have 4 lines to plot: $x+y=10$, $x-y=10$, $x=-8$, and $y=-8$. 

The area enclosed by these 4 lines is a square. 

We can find the side of the square by solving the absolute value equations. For $x+y=10$, if we set $x=0$, we get $y=10$. For $x-y=10$, if we set $x=0$, we get $y=-10$. So the side of the square is $10+10=20$ units.

Finally, the area of the square is $20*20=400$ square units. 

So, the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{400}$ square units.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The given equation can be factored into two equations: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
Solving these absolute value equations gives us four equations:
1. $x + y = 10$
2. $x + y = -10$
3. $x - y = 10$
4. $x - y = -10$
The solution to these equations form a rectangle with vertices at $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$.
The length of the rectangle is $20$ and the width is $4$, so the area of the rectangle is $20 \times 4 = \boxed{80}$.
The answer is $\boxed{80}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, we need to understand what the problem is asking. It says we have points (x, y) satisfying a certain equation. The equation is a bit complicated, but essentially it's saying that the square of the distance between (x, y) and (-10, 10) times the square of the distance between (x, y) and (8, 8) equals zero. 

This means that the points (x, y) are either at exactly (8, 8), at exactly (-10, 10), or at some combination of those two points. 

Since the points form a polygon, we can draw lines between them. The polygon will be convex if all the interior angles are less than 180 degrees. This is because if any angle were 180 degrees or more, the polygon would be concave. 

So, we need to find all the points that satisfy the equation and then connect them to form a polygon. 

Once we have the polygon, we can calculate its area. 

Now let's write the Python code to solve this problem:

```python

def area_of_polygon():
    # Define the variables
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # Define the equation
    equation = ((Abs(x + y) - 10)**2 + (Abs(x - y) - 10)**2) * ((Abs(x) - 8)**2 + (Abs(y) - 8)**2)

    # Solve the equation for x and y
    solutions = solve(equation, (x, y))

    # Calculate the area of the polygon
    area = 0
    for i in range(len(solutions)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(solutions)):
            # Calculate the distance between the points
            distance = ((solutions[i][0] - solutions[j][0])**2 + (solutions[i][1] - solutions[j][1])**2)**0.5
            # Add the distance to the area
            area += distance

    return area

result = area_of_polygon()

 The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ is satisfied only when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the four vertices of the square as $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$.

Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ is satisfied only when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the four vertices of the square as $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The vertices of the convex polygon are the intersection points of these two squares, which are $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares, which is $2(8^2) = 2(64) = \boxed{128}$.

Here is Python code to calculate the area of the polygon:

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Step 1: Understand the problem
The problem is asking for the area of a polygon formed by the points that satisfy the given equation.

Step 2: Break down the problem
The equation involves absolute values and squares, so it's not straightforward to solve directly. We can however break it down into simpler parts and analyze them separately.

Step 3: Analyze the parts
The equation is of the form $(A)(B) = 0$, which implies that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. 

We can analyze the two parts separately:

Part 1: $A = ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$

This implies that both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) = 0$, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

This represents two lines in the coordinate plane, $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, and their reflections in the x and y axes. These lines form a square with side length 10.

Part 2: $B = ((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$

This implies that both $(\vert x \vert - 8) = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8) = 0$, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

This represents two lines in the coordinate plane, $x = 8$ and $y = 8$, and their reflections in the x and y axes. These lines form a square with side length 8.

Step 4: Combine the results

The points that satisfy both parts of the equation are the intersection of the two squares. This intersection forms a smaller square with side length 2.

Step 5: Calculate the area

The area of a square is given by the formula $side^2$. Therefore, the area of the smaller square is $2^2 = 4$.

So, the area of the polygon formed by the points that satisfy the given equation is $\boxed{4}$.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We have two absolute value expressions that should be equal to zero.
2. Each absolute value expression is a square.
3. The equation is a product of two squared expressions.

Let's denote the two absolute value expressions as $A$ and $B$:

$A = |x + y| - 10 = 0$

$B = |x - y| - 10 = 0$

We can solve these two equations separately to find the coordinates $(x, y)$ that satisfy these equations. The solutions will be the vertices of the polygon.

Solving $A = 0$ gives us $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$. Similarly, solving $B = 0$ gives us $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.

Now, we can draw the lines representing these equations on a coordinate plane and find the vertices of the polygon. We will have a square with side length 10 units.

The area of this square is $10 \times 10 = 100$ square units. So, the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{100}$.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We need to find the area of the polygon that is enclosed by the set of points that satisfy the equation. The equation itself is a bit tricky to solve, but it's a product of two quadratics, so it might be possible to use properties of quadratics to solve it.

2. We can see that both quadratics inside the parentheses are of the form $(|x| - a)^2 + (|y| - b)^2$, which represents a circle with center $(a, b)$ and radius $a$. So, our equation is essentially the product of the areas of two circles.

3. We know that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. This means that the area of the polygon is the area of the union of the two circles.

4. To find the area of the union of the two circles, we can use the formula for the area of the intersection of two circles, and then subtract it from the total area of the two circles.

5. The total area of the two circles is $2\pi(8)^2 = 128\pi$.

6. The area of the intersection of the two circles is $\pi(10)^2 = 100\pi$.

7. Therefore, the area of the polygon is $128\pi - 100\pi = 28\pi$.

So, the answer is $\boxed{28\pi}$.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, we need to understand what the given equation means. It says that the product of two terms is zero. A product of two terms is zero if at least one of the terms is zero. So, we have two cases:

   a) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
   
   b) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

2. Now, let's solve these equations:

   a) For $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. This represents a square with side length $20$ and vertices at $(0,10), (0,-10), (10,0), (-10,0)$.
   
   b) For $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This represents another square with side length $20$ and vertices at $(0,10), (0,-10), (10,0), (-10,0)$.
   
   c) For $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$. This represents a rectangle with dimensions $16 \times 8$ and vertices at $(8,0), (-8,0), (0,8), (0,-8)$.
   
   d) For $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert y \vert = 8$. This represents another rectangle with dimensions $16 \times 8$ and vertices at $(8,0), (-8,0), (0,8), (0,-8)$.

3. The area of the convex polygon formed by the intersection of these squares and rectangles can be found by subtracting the overlapping area from the total area of the squares and rectangles.

4. The total area of the squares is $20^2 + 20^2 = 800$ square units.

5. The total area of the rectangles is $16 \times 8 + 16 \times 8 = 256$ square units.

6. The overlapping area is the area of the smaller squares, which is $20^2 = 400$ square units.

7. The area of the convex polygon is the total area minus the overlapping area, which is $800 + 256 - 400 = 656$ square units.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{656}$ square units.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Step 1: Simplify the equation by using the property of absolute value. The absolute value of a quantity is equal to zero if and only if the quantity is zero. Therefore, we can simplify the equation to $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

Step 2: Solve the simplified equations. From $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. Similarly, from $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. From $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert x \vert = 8$. And from $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert y \vert = 8$.

Step 3: Convert the absolute value equations to regular equations. We have four cases for each absolute value equation:

Case 1: $x + y = 10$, $x - y = 10$, $x = 8$, $y = 8$.
Case 2: $x + y = 10$, $x - y = 10$, $x = -8$, $y = -8$.
Case 3: $x + y = 10$, $x - y = 10$, $x = 8$, $y = -8$.
Case 4: $x + y = 10$, $x - y = 10$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$.

Step 4: Solve the system of equations for each case and find the vertices of the convex polygon.

Step 5: Calculate the area of the convex polygon. The area of a rectangle is the product of its length and width. In this case, the length is 20 (since the difference between the x-coordinates of the vertices is 20) and the width is 16 (since the difference between the y-coordinates of the vertices is 16). Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $20 \times 16 = 320$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{320}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, let's consider each term inside the product:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2$

In each case, we have a square of a difference term, which makes it nonnegative. Therefore, for the product to be zero, both terms in each case must be zero. 

Now, let's solve each case separately:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x \vert = 8$
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert y \vert = 8$

Now, let's consider the possible solutions for each case:

1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ implies $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$
2. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ implies $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$
3. $\vert x \vert = 8$ implies $x = 8$ or $x = -8$
4. $\vert y \vert = 8$ implies $y = 8$ or $y = -8$

Now, let's consider the combinations of these solutions:

- If $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, we get $x = 10$ and $y = 0$
- If $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$, we get $x = 0$ and $y = 10$
- If $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$, we get $x = 0$ and $y = -10$
- If $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$, we get $x = -10$ and $y = 0$

So, the solutions are $(10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, and $(-10, 0)$. These points form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. 

So, the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{100}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, observe that the given condition is the product of two quadratic expressions being equal to zero. This means either one of the quadratic expressions must be equal to zero for the whole expression to be zero. 

Hence, we have two systems of equations to solve:

1) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
2) $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

Now, let's solve these equations one by one:

For equation 1), we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$. These give us the following four systems of equations:

a) $x + y = 10$ and $x = 8$
b) $x + y = -10$ and $x = 8$
c) $x + y = 10$ and $x = -8$
d) $x + y = -10$ and $x = -8$

Solving these systems, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(8,2)$, $(8,-18)$, $(-8,18)$, $(-8,-2)$.

Similarly, for equation 2), we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These give us the following four systems of equations:

e) $x - y = 10$ and $y = 8$
f) $x - y = -10$ and $y = 8$
g) $x - y = 10$ and $y = -8$
h) $x - y = -10$ and $y = -8$

Solving these systems, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(18,8)$, $(-18,8)$, $(10,-8)$, $(-10,-8)$.

Now, we can plot these points on a graph and observe the shape of the polygon. It turns out that the polygon is a square with side length $20\sqrt{2}$.

Therefore, the area of the polygon is $(20\sqrt{2})^2 = 800$.

So, the answer is $\boxed{800}$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):

 We can observe that the equation is equal to zero when either of the factors is equal to zero. Let's consider each factor separately.

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$

This equation is zero when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ are on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$. These lines intersect at $(5, 5)$.

2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

This equation is zero when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ are on the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$, and the lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length 16.

The points that satisfy both equations are the intersection of the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ with the square formed by the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. This forms a square with side length 16, which is the area of the convex polygon.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The problem statement contains absolute value functions, which can be tricky to solve directly. However, we can use the property of absolute value that $\vert x \vert^2 = x^2$ for any real number $x$. 

2. We can rewrite the equation as follows: $((\vert x + y \vert^2 - 100) + (\vert x - y \vert^2 - 100))((\vert x \vert^2 - 16\vert x \vert + 64) + (\vert y \vert^2 - 16\vert y \vert + 64)) = 0$.

3. Now, we can see that the left-hand side is the sum of four squares, each of which is equal to zero. Therefore, each term must be equal to zero.

4. Let's consider the first term in the parentheses: $\vert x + y \vert^2 - 100 = 0$, which simplifies to $\vert x + y \vert^2 = 100$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$.

5. Similarly, we can find that $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

6. Solving these equations, we get four pairs of $(x, y)$: $(8, 0)$, $(8, 16)$, $(-8, 0)$, and $(-8, -16)$.

7. Now, let's plot these points in a coordinate plane and connect them to form a polygon.

8. The polygon formed is a square with side length 16.

9. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the answer is $\boxed{256}$.
