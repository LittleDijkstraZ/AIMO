Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



We start with the equation: $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$

We can rewrite the equation as two separate cases:

Case 1: $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$

Case 2: $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$

Case 1: In this case, we have two absolute value expressions, which means either the expression inside the absolute value is zero or its negation is zero. This gives us four separate equations:

1.1: $x + y - 10 = 0$
1.2: $x + y + 10 = 0$
1.3: $x - y - 10 = 0$
1.4: $x - y + 10 = 0$

Case 2: Similarly, for this case we get:

2.1: $x - 8 = 0$
2.2: $x + 8 = 0$
2.3: $y - 8 = 0$
2.4: $y + 8 = 0$

Now, let's solve these equations:

1.1 and 2.1 gives us $x = 10, y = 0$
1.2 and 2.2 gives us $x = 0, y = -10$
1.3 and 2.3 gives us $x = 0, y = 10$
1.4 and 2.4 gives us $x = -10, y = 0$

The points are: $(10, 0), (0, -10), (0, 10), (-10, 0)$

The area of the convex polygon formed by these points is the area of the square with side length 20. Using the formula for the area of a square, $Area = side^2$, we get $Area = 20^2 = 400$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{400}$ square units.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, let's define the function. We'll call it calculate_area.
2. In this function, we'll use a for loop to iterate through the values of x and y.
3. We'll check if the expression is equal to zero in each iteration.
4. If the expression is zero, we'll add the current point (x, y) to a list called points.
5. After iterating through all possible values of x and y, we'll calculate the area of the convex polygon formed by these points using the shoelace formula.
6. The shoelace formula is given by the absolute value of the sum of the product of the coordinates of the points in the counter-clockwise order.
7. We'll use the abs() function to get the absolute value.

Here's the code:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import *

def calculate_area():
    points = []
    for x in range(-20, 21):
        for y in range(-20, 21):
            if (abs(x + y) - 10)**2 + (abs(x - y) - 10)**2 == 0 or abs(x) - 8 == 0 or abs(y) - 8 == 0:
                points.append((x, y))

    def shoelace_formula(points):
        sum = 0
        for i in range(len(points)):
            j = (i + 1) % len(points)
            sum += points[i][0]*points[j][1] - points[j][0]*points[i][1]
        return abs(sum) / 2

    area = shoelace_formula(points)
    return area

area = calculate_area()
print(area)
```

The area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{0}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, let's think about the multi-choice question. The first expression, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ will be true if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This can be true if both $x$ and $y$ are $5$, or both are $-5$, or one is $5$ and the other is $-5$. So we have three lines $x + y = 5$, $x + y = -5$, $x - y = 5$, and $x - y = -5$.

The second expression, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ will be true if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. So we have four lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

Now, we can draw these lines on a graph and see that they enclose a rectangle with vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$.

The area of this rectangle is $(8 - (-8)) \times (8 - (-8)) = 16 \times 16 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{256}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The expression $A \cdot B = 0$ is equivalent to $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. That is, the points that satisfy the equation are a combination of the points that satisfy $A = 0$ and $B = 0$. Therefore, we can analyze each absolute value separately.

The absolute value function $|x|$ can be replaced by a piecewise function:

$$|x| = \begin{cases} 
x & \text{if } x \geq 0 \\
-x & \text{if } x < 0 
\end{cases}$$

This gives us four cases to consider:

1. $x + y = 10$, $x - y = 10$, $x = 8$, $y = 8$
2. $x + y = 10$, $x - y = 10$, $x = 8$, $y = -8$
3. $x + y = 10$, $x - y = 10$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$
4. $x + y = 10$, $x - y = 10$, $x = -8$, $y = -8$

These are the lines and points that define the vertices of the polygon.

To find the area of the polygon, we can use the Shoelace Formula. First, we need the coordinates of the vertices. From the above analysis, we have the following vertices:

A. $(10, 0)$
B. $(0, 10)$
C. $(10, 20)$
D. $(20, 10)$
E. $(8, 8)$
F. $(8, -8)$
G. $(-8, 8)$
H. $(-8, -8)$

Now, we can apply the Shoelace Formula, which states that if the coordinates of the vertices of a polygon are $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), \ldots, (x_n, y_n)$ (with $n$ pairs of coordinates), then the area of the polygon is given by:

$$\frac{1}{2} |(x_1y_2 + x_2y_3 + \ldots + x_ny_1) - (y_1x_2 + y_2x_3 + \ldots + y_nx_1)|$$

Calculating this, we get the area of the polygon as $\boxed{256}$.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We can notice that the expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ has solutions only if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. These equations simplify to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ respectively.

2. Similarly, the expression $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ has solutions only if both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. These equations simplify to $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ respectively.

3. Therefore, the solutions to the original equation are given by the intersections of the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, and the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$. 

4. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(8,2)$, $(8,-2)$, $(-8,2)$, $(-8,-2)$. 

5. To find the area of the polygon, we can calculate the area of the rectangle formed by these points and subtract the areas of the right triangles formed by the origin and each of the points $(8,2)$, $(8,-2)$, $(-8,2)$, $(-8,-2)$.

6. The area of the rectangle is $8 \times 10 = 80$ square units.

7. The area of each right triangle is $0.5 \times 8 \times 2 = 8$ square units.

8. Therefore, the area of the polygon is $80 - 4 \times 8 = 48$ square units.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{48}$.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, we can rewrite the equation as $A \cdot B = 0$, where $A = (|x+y| - 10)^2 + (|x-y| - 10)^2$ and $B = (|x| - 8)^2 + (|y| - 8)^2$.

This means that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. We can solve these equations separately to find the points that satisfy these conditions.

For $A = 0$, we have $|x+y| = 10$ and $|x-y| = 10$. This gives us four equations: $x+y = 10$, $x+y = -10$, $x-y = 10$, and $x-y = -10$. Solving these equations, we find the vertices of the polygon: $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, and $(-5,-5)$.

For $B = 0$, we have $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. This gives us four equations: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. Solving these equations, we find the vertices of the polygon: $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

Now, we can draw the polygon and find its area. The polygon is a square with side length $10$, so its area is $10^2 = 100$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{100}$.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The given equation is a product of two equations. Therefore, the equation is satisfied when either of the two equations is satisfied. 

The two equations are $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which simplifies to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which simplifies to $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. 

These equations represent two squares, each of side length 10 units. Their centers are at (0, 0) and (0, 10) respectively. The vertices of the squares are at $(\pm 5, \pm 5)$ and $(\pm 5, \pm 15)$ respectively. 

The second set of equations are $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which simplifies to $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which simplifies to $\vert y \vert = 8$. 

These equations represent two squares, each of side length 8 units. Their centers are at (0, 0) and (8, 0) respectively. The vertices of the squares are at $(\pm 4, \pm 4)$ and $(\pm 8, \pm 8)$ respectively. 

The four squares form a rectangle with length 18 units and width 10 units. 

The area of the rectangle is length * width = 180 square units. 

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{180}$ square units.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, we see that the left part of the equation equals zero only when $|x+y|=10$ and $|x-y|=10$, which means $x+y=\pm10$ and $x-y=\pm10$.

Solving this system of equations, we get $x=5$ and $y=5$, $x=5$ and $y=-5$, $x=-5$ and $y=5$, $x=-5$ and $y=-5$. This means that the vertices of the polygon are at points $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, and $(-5,-5)$.

The next step is to find the lengths of the sides of the polygon. We can see that the polygon is a square with side length $\sqrt{10^2+10^2}=10\sqrt{2}$.

The area of the square is $(10\sqrt{2})^2=200$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{200}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. Let's denote $A = |x + y| - 10$ and $B = |x - y| - 10$. The original equation can be rewritten as $AB(A^2 + B^2)(|x|^2 - 16|x| + 64 + |y|^2 - 16|y| + 64) = 0$.

2. We know that for the product of several numbers to be zero, at least one of the numbers must be zero. Therefore, we have the following four cases:

   a) $A = |x + y| - 10 = 0$. Solving for $x + y$ gives $x + y = 10$.
   
   b) $B = |x - y| - 10 = 0$. Solving for $x - y$ gives $x - y = 10$.
   
   c) $A^2 + B^2 = 0$. Squaring the first two equations and adding them gives $(x + y)^2 + (x - y)^2 = 400$, which simplifies to $2x^2 + 2y^2 = 400$. Dividing by 2 gives $x^2 + y^2 = 200$.
   
   d) $|x|^2 - 16|x| + 64 + |y|^2 - 16|y| + 64 = 0$. Simplifying this gives $|x|^2 - 16|x| + |y|^2 - 16|y| = 0$. Since $|x|^2$ and $|y|^2$ are always nonnegative, we can rewrite this as $(x - 8)^2 + (y - 8)^2 = 0$. This means $x = y = 8$.

3. Now we have the four lines $x + y = 10$, $x - y = 10$, $x^2 + y^2 = 200$, and $x = y = 8$. The first two lines intersect at the point $(5,5)$, and the last line intersects the first two lines at the points $(8,2)$ and $(2,8)$.

4. The four lines form a convex polygon, and we can find its vertices by finding the intersection points of the lines. The vertices of the polygon are $(5,5)$, $(8,2)$, $(2,8)$, and $(8,8)$.

5. To find the area of the polygon, we can divide it into two triangles by drawing a line from $(5,5)$ to $(8,8)$. The two triangles have vertices at $(5,5)$, $(8,2)$, and $(8,8)$, and $(5,5)$, $(2,8)$, and $(8,8)$, respectively.

6. The area of a triangle with vertices $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$, and $(x_3, y_3)$ is given by the formula $\frac{1}{2} |x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2)|$. Using this formula, we find the area of the first triangle to be $\frac{1}{2} |5(2 - 8) + 8(8 - 5) + 8(5 - 2)| = \frac{1}{2} |(-30) + 24 + 24| = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 18 = 9$, and the area of the second triangle to be $\frac{1}{2} |5(8 - 8) + 2(8 - 5) + 8(5 - 8)| = \frac{1}{2} |0 + 6 - 24| = \frac{1}{2} \cdot (-18) = -9$.

7. The area of the polygon is the sum of the areas of the two triangles, which is $9 + (-9) = 0$.

8. The area of the polygon is 0, because the points enclosed by the lines form a figure with no area.

So the answer is $\boxed{0}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



We have a system of inequalities and we need to plot it to find the feasible region. The feasible region is the area where all the inequalities are satisfied.

1. Plot the graphs of the following inequalities:
   a. $|x| \le 8$
   b. $|y| \le 8$
   c. $|x+y| \le 10$
   d. $|x-y| \le 10$

2. The feasible region is the intersection of all these regions. It's a convex polygon because the feasible region is formed by lines and line segments, which are convex.

3. To find the area of this convex polygon, we can use the shoelace formula. The shoelace formula is a way to find the area of a polygon when you know the coordinates of the vertices. 

4. The vertices of the polygon are the points where the inequalities are equalities, i.e., the points where the boundary lines intersect. 

5. To find these points, we can solve the following system of equations:
   a. $|x| = 8$
   b. $|y| = 8$
   c. $|x+y| = 10$
   d. $|x-y| = 10$

6. Solve the system of equations to find the coordinates of the vertices. 

7. Use the shoelace formula to find the area of the polygon.

Now, let's solve the system of equations:

The system of equations can be written as:

1. $x = \pm 8$
2. $y = \pm 8$
3. $x+y = \pm 10$ or $x+y = \mp 10$
4. $x-y = \pm 10$ or $x-y = \mp 10$

Solving these equations, we get the following vertices:

$(8, 2), (8, -2), (-8, 2), (-8, -2), (2, 8), (2, -8), (-2, 8), (-2, -8)$

Now, let's use the shoelace formula to find the area of the polygon:

The shoelace formula is given by:

$A = \frac{1}{2} \cdot |(x_1y_2 + x_2y_3 + \cdots + x_ny_1) - (y_1x_2 + y_2x_3 + \cdots + y_nx_1)|$

Substituting the coordinates of the vertices, we get:

$A = \frac{1}{2} \cdot |(8 \cdot 2 + 8 \cdot 8 + 2 \cdot 2 + 2 \cdot 8 + (-8) \cdot (-2) + (-8) \cdot 8 + (-2) \cdot (-8) + (-2) \cdot 8) - (2 \cdot 8 + 8 \cdot 2 + 8 \cdot (-2) + 2 \cdot (-8) + (-8) \cdot 8 + (-2) \cdot 2 + (-2) \cdot (-8) + 8 \cdot (-2))|$

$A = \frac{1}{2} \cdot |(16 + 64 + 4 + 16 - 16 - 64 - 16 - 16) - (16 + 16 - 16 - 16 - 64 - 4 - 16 - 16)|$

$A = \frac{1}{2} \cdot |(0) - (0)|$

$A = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0$

$A = 0$

So, the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{0}$ square units.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



This problem is asking us to find the area of a convex polygon defined by the points that satisfy the given condition. The condition is a product of two quadratic expressions equal to zero, which implies that either one of the expressions is zero, or both are zero. We can solve this problem by analyzing each quadratic expression separately.

Step 1: Simplify the expressions
The given condition is: $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$

We can simplify this to two separate conditions:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

Step 2: Solve the conditions
Now we can solve these conditions separately:

For condition 1, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This means either $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. Solving these absolute value equations gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

For condition 2, either $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This means either $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. Solving these absolute value equations gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

Step 3: Find the intersection points
Now we need to find the intersection points of these lines. By analyzing the lines, we can see that there are 9 intersection points: $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, $(-8,-8)$, $(10,0)$, $(0,10)$, $(-10,0)$, $(0,-10)$, and $(0,0)$.

Step 4: Calculate the area of the polygon
The 9 intersection points enclose a convex polygon, and we can calculate its area using the shoelace formula. The shoelace formula states that if the vertices of a polygon are $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), ..., (x_n, y_n)$, then the area of the polygon is given by:

$\frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i)$

Here, the vertices of the polygon are $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, $(-8,-8)$, $(10,0)$, $(0,10)$, $(-10,0)$, $(0,-10)$, and $(0,0)$. Applying the shoelace formula, we get the area as $\boxed{320}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The given equation is a product of two quadratic expressions. The product of two expressions equals zero if and only if at least one of the expressions equals zero. Therefore, the given equation is satisfied if at least one of the following conditions holds:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

Let's solve these conditions one by one:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

Now, let's find the intersection points of these lines:

1. Intersection of $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ gives $x = 10$ and $y = 0$.
2. Intersection of $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$ gives $x = 0$ and $y = 10$.
3. Intersection of $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$ gives $x = -10$ and $y = -20$.
4. Intersection of $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$ gives $x = -10$ and $y = 0$.

So, the vertices of the polygon are $(10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, $(-10, -20)$, and $(-10, 0)$. Now, let's find the lengths of the sides of the polygon:

1. Distance between $(10, 0)$ and $(0, 10)$ is $\sqrt{(10 - 0)^2 + (0 - 10)^2} = 10\sqrt{2}$.
2. Distance between $(0, 10)$ and $(-10, -20)$ is $\sqrt{(0 - (-10))^2 + (10 - (-20))^2} = 10\sqrt{5}$.
3. Distance between $(-10, -20)$ and $(-10, 0)$ is $\sqrt{(-10 - (-10))^2 + (-20 - 0)^2} = 20$.
4. Distance between $(-10, 0)$ and $(10, 0)$ is $\sqrt{(-10 - 10)^2 + (0 - 0)^2} = 20$.

The polygon is a trapezoid with bases of length $10\sqrt{2}$ and $20$ and height $10$. The area of a trapezoid is given by the formula $\frac{1}{2}(b_1 + b_2)h$, where $b_1$ and $b_2$ are the lengths of the bases and $h$ is the height. Substituting the values, we get the area as $\frac{1}{2}(10\sqrt{2} + 20) \cdot 10 = 100\sqrt{2} + 100$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{100\sqrt{2} + 100}$.
