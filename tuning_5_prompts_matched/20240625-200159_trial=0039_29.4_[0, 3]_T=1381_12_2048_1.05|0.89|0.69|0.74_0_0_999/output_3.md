Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We know that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. That is, the given equation is equal to zero if and only if either $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$ or $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

2. For $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$, it implies that both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which simplifies to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solution set of these two equations forms a square with side length of 20.

3. For $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$, it implies that both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which simplifies to $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solution set of these two equations forms a square with side length of 16.

4. The convex polygon is the intersection of the two squares. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of the smaller square.

5. The area of the smaller square is $16 \times 16 = 256$.

    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    side_length_larger_square = 20
    side_length_smaller_square = 16
    area_smaller_square = side_length_smaller_square ** 2
    return area_smaller_square

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

The area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The expression given is equal to zero if and only if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This means that either $|x+y|=10$ and $|x|=8$ or $|x-y|=10$ and $|y|=8$. Solving these absolute value equations, we have four groups of solutions:

1. $x+y=10$ and $x=-8$, which gives $y=18$ and $y=-18$.
2. $x+y=-10$ and $x=-8$, which gives $y=-2$ and $y=2$.
3. $x-y=10$ and $y=-8$, which gives $x=18$ and $x=-2$.
4. $x-y=-10$ and $y=-8$, which gives $x=-18$ and $x=2$.

These four groups of solutions define a rectangle with vertices at the points $(-8, 18)$, $(-8, -18)$, $(18, -8)$, and $(-18, -8)$. The length of the rectangle is $18 - (-18) = 36$, and the width is $18 - (-8) = 26$. The area of the rectangle is therefore $36 \times 26 = 936$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 936.
The answer is: $936$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The condition $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is equivalent to one of the two following conditions holding: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

2. If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives the vertices of the square with side length 10.

3. If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives the vertices of the square with side length 8.

4. Therefore, the points satisfying the original condition enclose a convex polygon which is the union of two squares: one with side length 10 and one with side length 8.

5. The area of a square with side length $s$ is $s^2$. So the area of the square with side length 10 is $10^2 = 100$ and the area of the square with side length 8 is $8^2 = 64$.

6. The area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of these two squares, which is $100 + 64 = 164$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $164$. The answer is: $\boxed{164}$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of them is zero. This means that our equation equals zero if and only if $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

Each of these equations is of the form $(\vert z \vert - a)^2 = 0$, where $z$ is a variable and $a$ is a constant. This equation holds if and only if $\vert z \vert = a$, which implies $z = a$ or $z = -a$.

So, we have the following four equations:
1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$,
2. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$,
3. $\vert x \vert = 8$,
4. $\vert y \vert = 8$.

From equations 3 and 4, we get $x = 8$ or $x = -8$, and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

From equations 1 and 2, we can get different combinations of $x$ and $y$ that satisfy the equations. For example, if $x = 8$ and $y = 8$, then $x + y = 16$ and $x - y = 0$, both of which satisfy the equations. Similarly, we can find other combinations.

The solutions to these equations form the vertices of a square with side length 16 (from the combinations $x = 8$, $y = 8$ and $x = -8$, $y = -8$). Therefore, the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, we can see that the equation equals to zero means either the first part is zero or the second part is zero. So the solution set must satisfy either $|x+y| = 10$ or $|x-y| = 10$ or $|x| = 8$ or $|y| = 8$. This gives us 4 lines on the plane:

- $|x+y| = 10$ is the equation of two lines: $y = -x + 10$ and $y = -x - 10$.
- $|x-y| = 10$ is the equation of two lines: $y = x + 10$ and $y = x - 10$.
- $|x| = 8$ is the equation of two lines: $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.
- $|y| = 8$ is the equation of two lines: $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

Plotting these lines on the plane, we find that they form a square with side length 20. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$. So the area of the polygon is 400.

The solution to this problem is $\boxed{400}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation equals zero if either the first term or the second term equals zero. Thus, we have four cases to consider:

1. $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x| - 8 = 0$ and $|y| - 8 = 0$
2. $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x| - 8 = 0$ and $|y| - 8 \neq 0$
3. $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x| - 8 \neq 0$ and $|y| - 8 = 0$
4. $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x| - 8 \neq 0$ and $|y| - 8 \neq 0$
5. $|x-y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x| - 8 = 0$ and $|y| - 8 = 0$
6. $|x-y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x| - 8 = 0$ and $|y| - 8 \neq 0$
7. $|x-y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x| - 8 \neq 0$ and $|y| - 8 = 0$
8. $|x-y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x| - 8 \neq 0$ and $|y| - 8 \neq 0$

Cases 1 and 5 give us the solution $(x, y) = (8, 8)$, and the other cases give us the solutions $(x, y) = (8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$. These are the vertices of a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$
