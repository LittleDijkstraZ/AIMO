Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Step 1: To solve this problem, we first need to understand the structure of the equation and what each term does. The equation is a product of two terms, both of which are squares. If a square equals zero, then one of its terms must be zero. So, the equation will be satisfied if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

Step 2: For each of these equations to be zero, their arguments must be equal to zero. Therefore, the solutions are given by $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

Step 3: Each of these absolute value equations has two solutions, resulting in a total of 8 solutions. These solutions are the vertices of the polygon.

Step 4: Now, we need to find the area of this polygon. The polygon is a square with side length 16 (since $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ implies that the square's side length is 16).

Step 5: The area of the square is the side length squared, so the area is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the polygon is $\boxed{256}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, we need to solve the system of equations, given by $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
2. The solutions of the first two equations are four pairs of $(x, y)$: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$.
3. The solutions of the last two equations are four pairs of $(x, y)$: $(8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, $(-8, 0)$, and $(0, -8)$.
4. The intersection of the solutions of the first two equations and the solutions of the last two equations is the set of vertices of the polygon.
5. The area of the polygon is then given by the sum of the areas of the triangles formed by each pair of vertices.

Now, let's compute the area:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import Matrix, Rational, simplify

def compute_area():
    # Vertices of the polygon
    vertices = [(8, 2), (8, -2), (-8, 2), (-8, -2), (8, 0), (0, 8), (-8, 0), (0, -8)]

    # Initialize the area
    area = Rational(0)

    # Compute the area of each triangle formed by the vertices
    for i in range(len(vertices)):
        x1, y1 = vertices[i]
        for j in range(i+1, len(vertices)):
            x2, y2 = vertices[j]
            area += abs((x1*y2 - x2*y1) / 2)

    # Simplify the area
    area = simplify(area)

    return area

result = compute_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 512.000000000000

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output

The area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{512}$ square units.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, we need to understand the given equations. We have two absolute value expressions multiplied by each other, which means that each must be equal to zero for the whole expression to be zero. This gives us four separate equations to solve.

Let's solve each equation separately and then find the intersection points of the lines:

1. For the first equation, we have $|x + y| - 10 = 0$. The absolute value expression can be rewritten as two separate cases: $x + y - 10 = 0$ and $-(x + y) - 10 = 0$. This gives us two lines $y = -x + 10$ and $y = -x - 10$.

2. For the second equation, we have $|x - y| - 10 = 0$. Similarly to the first equation, this can be rewritten as two separate cases: $x - y - 10 = 0$ and $-(x - y) - 10 = 0$. This gives us two lines $y = x - 10$ and $y = x + 10$.

3. For the third equation, we have $|x| - 8 = 0$. This can be rewritten as two separate cases: $x - 8 = 0$ and $-(x) - 8 = 0$. This gives us two lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.

4. For the fourth equation, we have $|y| - 8 = 0$. Similarly to the third equation, this can be rewritten as two separate cases: $y - 8 = 0$ and $-(y) - 8 = 0$. This gives us two lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

Now we have four pairs of lines, and we need to find their intersection points. Intersecting lines will be the vertices of the polygon. We will use sympy to solve these equations and find the vertices of the polygon.

Let's define the vertices of the polygon as a list of points:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

def find_vertices():
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # Define the equations
    eq1 = Eq(x + y, 10)
    eq2 = Eq(x - y, 10)
    eq3 = Eq(x, 8)
    eq4 = Eq(y, 8)

    # Solve the equations
    vertices = []
    vertices.extend(solve((eq1, eq3), (x, y)))
    vertices.extend(solve((eq1, eq4), (x, y)))
    vertices.extend(solve((eq2, eq3), (x, y)))
    vertices.extend(solve((eq2, eq4), (x, y)))

    return vertices

result = find_vertices()
print(result)
```

```
```output

CODE RESULTS [x, y, x, y, x, y, x, y]

INTERMEDIATE OUT :

[x, y, x, y, x, y, x, y]
```
Now we have the vertices of the polygon. To find the area of the polygon, we can use the shoelace formula. However, this problem can be solved using other methods as well. The shoelace formula requires the vertices to be ordered, which we don't have here. Instead, we can use the determinant method to find the area of the polygon.

To do this, we will first convert the vertices to a list of coordinates. Then, we will calculate the area using the determinant method.

Let's convert the vertices to a list of coordinates and calculate the area:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon(vertices):
    # Convert vertices to a list of coordinates
    coordinates = [(vertex[x], vertex[y]) for vertex in vertices]

    # Calculate the area
    area = 0
    for i in range(len(coordinates)):
        j = (i + 1) % len(coordinates)
        area += coordinates[i][0] * coordinates[j][1] - coordinates[j][0] * coordinates[i][1]

    # Take the absolute value to get the area
    area = abs(area)

    return area

result = area_of_polygon(result)
print(result)
```

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, we can see that the given equation is of the form $f(x) * g(y) = 0$. This implies that either $f(x) = 0$ or $g(y) = 0$. 

In other words, the points that satisfy this equation must either satisfy $f(x) = 0$ or $g(y) = 0$. This means that the points that satisfy this equation must lie on the lines defined by the equations $f(x) = 0$ and $g(y) = 0$.

The lines $f(x) = 0$ and $g(y) = 0$ are given by:

1. $f(x) = 0$:

   $|x + y| - 10 = 0$

   $|x - y| - 10 = 0$

   $|x| - 8 = 0$

   $|y| - 8 = 0$

2. $g(y) = 0$:

   $|x + y| - 10 = 0$

   $|x - y| - 10 = 0$

   $|x| - 8 = 0$

   $|y| - 8 = 0$

The lines $f(x) = 0$ and $g(y) = 0$ define a square with vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$. The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$.

So, the area of the convex polygon formed by the points that satisfy the given equation is $\boxed{64}$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We have a system of two equations: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

2. The first equation implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. We can solve this system of equations to get the vertices of the polygon.

3. The second equation implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. We can solve this system of equations to get the vertices of the polygon.

4. Now we have the vertices of the polygon, we can calculate its area. The polygon is formed by the intersections of the four lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$, and the four lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

5. We can use the shoelace formula to calculate the area of the polygon. The shoelace formula states that if the vertices of a polygon are $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), \dots, (x_n, y_n)$, then the area of the polygon is $\frac{1}{2} \vert (x_1y_2 + x_2y_3 + \dots + x_ny_1) - (y_1x_2 + y_2x_3 + \dots + y_nx_1) \vert$.

6. To find the area of the polygon, we can list all the vertices and apply the shoelace formula. The vertices are $(8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, and $(0, -10)$.

7. After listing the vertices, we can apply the shoelace formula to calculate the area of the polygon. The area is $\frac{1}{2} \vert (8 \cdot 8 + (-8) \cdot 8 + (-8) \cdot (-8) + 8 \cdot (-8) + 10 \cdot 0 + (-10) \cdot 0 + 0 \cdot 10 + 0 \cdot (-10) - (8 \cdot (-8) + (-8) \cdot (-8) + (-8) \cdot 8 + 8 \cdot 8)) \vert = \frac{1}{2} \vert (64 - 64 + 64 - 64 + 0 + 0 + 0 - 0 - (64 - 64 + 64 - 64))) \vert = \frac{1}{2} \vert 0 - 0 \vert = 0$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{0}$.

Here is the complete python code to calculate the area:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    # Vertices of the polygon
    vertices = [(8, 8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8), (8, -8), (10, 0), (-10, 0), (0, 10), (0, -10)]

    # Shoelace formula
    x_coordinates, y_coordinates = zip(*vertices)
    area = abs(sum(x1*y2 - x2*y1 for x1, y1 in zip(x_coordinates, y_coordinates) for x2, y2 in zip(x_coordinates, y_coordinates)) / 2)

    return area

result = area_of_polygon()

Hence, the area of the polygon is the sum of the areas of four squares. The first square has side length 20, the second 20, the third 16 and the last 16.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Step 1: Recognize that the expression equals 0 means that either the first part equals 0 or the second part equals 0. We can then deal with these two cases separately.

Step 2: If $|x + y| - 10 = 0$, then $|x + y| = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$.

Step 3: If $|x - y| - 10 = 0$, then $|x - y| = 10$, which means $x - y = \pm 10$.

Step 4: If $|x| - 8 = 0$, then $|x| = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$.

Step 5: If $|y| - 8 = 0$, then $|y| = 8$, which means $y = \pm 8$.

Step 6: Solving these four sets of equations, we get the following points: $(\pm 8, 0)$, $(0, \pm 8)$, $(\pm 10, 0)$, and $(0, \pm 10)$.

Step 7: These points form a square with side length $16$, so the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{256}$.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Step 1: To solve this problem, we need to find the area of the polygon enclosed by the points satisfying the given equation.

Step 2: We can rewrite the equation as two separate cases:
   a) (|x + y| - 10)^2 = 0 and (|x - y| - 10)^2 = 0
   b) (|x| - 8)^2 = 0 and (|y| - 8)^2 = 0

Step 3: For case (a), we have |x + y| = 10 and |x - y| = 10. This gives us four separate cases:
   i) x + y = 10 and x - y = 10
   ii) x + y = 10 and x - y = -10
   iii) x + y = -10 and x - y = 10
   iv) x + y = -10 and x - y = -10

Step 4: For case (b), we have |x| = 8 and |y| = 8. This gives us four separate cases:
   v) x = 8 and y = 8
   vi) x = 8 and y = -8
   vii) x = -8 and y = 8
   viii) x = -8 and y = -8

Step 5: Solving the equations for each case, we can find the coordinates of the points that satisfy the equation.

Step 6: Plotting these points on a graph, we can visualize the polygon enclosed by these points.

Step 7: Calculating the area of this polygon, we can find the final numerical answer.

This problem is based on absolute values and quadratic equations, which is a typical algebra problem. 

To solve this, we first need to understand the conditions given in the problem:

1. The expression should be equal to zero, which means one of the factors should be zero.
2. The factors are quadratic equations, so we can set each factor to zero and solve for the values of x and y.

Now, let's solve the problem:

```python

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

def area_of_polygon():
    # Define variables
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # Define the equation
    equation = ((abs(x + y) - 10)**2 + (abs(x - y) - 10)**2) * ((abs(x) - 8)**2 + (abs(y) - 8)**2)

    # Set each factor to zero and solve for x and y
    solutions = []
    solutions.extend(solve(Eq((abs(x + y) - 10)**2, 0), (x, y)))
    solutions.extend(solve(Eq((abs(x - y) - 10)**2, 0), (x, y)))
    solutions.extend(solve(Eq((abs(x) - 8)**2, 0), (x, y)))
    solutions.extend(solve(Eq((abs(y) - 8)**2, 0), (x, y)))

    # Get the x and y coordinates of the vertices of the polygon
    vertices = [tuple(solution) for solution in solutions]

    # Calculate the area of the polygon
    area = 0

        j = (i + 1) % len(vertices)
        area += vertices[i][0] * vertices[j][1] - vertices[j][0] * vertices[i][1]

    # Return the absolute value of the area (as the area can be negative)
    return abs(area)

result = area_of_polygon()

1. We have two products, both of them need to be zero for the equation to hold true.
2. If either of the products is zero, then one of the terms in each product needs to be zero.
3. This gives us four cases to consider:
   a. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$
   b. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$
   c. $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$
   d. $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$
4. We can solve these four cases separately and obtain the solutions.
5. These solutions will give us the vertices of the polygon.
6. To find the area of the polygon, we can use the Shoelace formula or other methods like calculating the area of individual triangles and summing them up.

Now, let's solve the problem using Python and sympy:

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, we need to understand what the given equation means and what it represents. 

The equation is of the form $AB=0$, which implies that either $A=0$ or $B=0$. 

So, we have two cases to consider:

1) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$

2) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

Let's analyze each case:

1) For the first case, we have $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. 

This further implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. 

So, the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$. These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(0, 10), (10, 0), (-10, 0), (0, -10)$.

2) For the second case, we have $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. 

This further implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. 

So, the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$. These lines form a square with vertices at $(8, 0), (0, 8), (-8, 0), (0, -8)$.

The intersection of these two regions gives us the points that satisfy both cases. This is the convex polygon we are looking for.

To find the area of this convex polygon, we can calculate the area of the rectangle and subtract the area of the square.

The rectangle has length 20 (from -10 to 10 on the x-axis) and width 20 (from -10 to 10 on the y-axis). So, its area is $20 \times 20 = 400$ square units.

The square has side length 16 (from -8 to 8 on the x-axis or y-axis). So, its area is $16 \times 16 = 256$ square units.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $400 - 256 = 144$ square units.

So, the answer is $\boxed{144}$.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We have two equations that need to be satisfied: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

2. From these equations, we have four possibilities: 
    - $x + y = 10$ and $x = 8$ and $y = 8$.
    - $x + y = -10$ and $x = 8$ and $y = 8$.
    - $x + y = 10$ and $x = -8$ and $y = 8$.
    - $x + y = -10$ and $x = -8$ and $y = 8$.

3. Solving these possibilities, we get the following vertices of the polygon:
    - $(8, 2)$
    - $(8, -18)$
    - $(-16, 18)$
    - $(-16, -2)$

4. Now, we need to calculate the area of the polygon.

5. We can use the Shoelace Formula for this:

For a polygon with vertices $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), \dots, (x_n, y_n)$, the area is given by:

Area = $\frac{1}{2} |(x_1y_2 + x_2y_3 + \dots + x_ny_1) - (y_1x_2 + y_2x_3 + \dots + y_nx_1)|$

6. Using this formula, we get:

Area = $\frac{1}{2} |(8\cdot2 + 8\cdot(-18) + (-16)\cdot18 + (-16)\cdot(-2)) - (2\cdot8 + (-18)\cdot8 + 18\cdot(-16) + (-2)\cdot(-16))|$

7. After simplifying, we get:

Area = $\frac{1}{2} |(-104 + 128 - 288 + 32) - (-16 + 144 - 288 + 32)|$

8. Further simplification gives:

Area = $\frac{1}{2} |(24) - (-224)|$

9. Finally, we get:

Area = $\frac{1}{2} \cdot 248 = 124$

So, the area of the polygon is $\boxed{124}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



If the condition $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ is satisfied, we have $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) = 0$, which leads to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These two equations imply $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$, which gives $x = y$ or $x = -y$. Similarly, if the condition $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ is satisfied, we have $(\vert x \vert - 8) = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8) = 0$, which leads to $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These two equations imply $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

So the problem now is to find the intersection points of the lines $x = y$, $x = -y$, $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$ and $y = -8$. 

Since $x = y$ and $x = -y$ are two perpendicular lines, and they intersect with $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$ and $y = -8$ at the same four points $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$ and $(-8, -8)$, these four points form a square. The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$.

The error in the code is caused by the fact that we are trying to find the maximum of an empty list. This is because the `solutions` list is empty, which means that there is no intersection between the two sets of lines $x = y$, $x = -y$, $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$ and $y = -8$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{64}$.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The expression is equal to zero if any of the terms is equal to zero. Hence, either:

1) $|x+y|-10 = 0$ and $|x-y|-10 = 0$ or

2) $|x|-8 = 0$ and $|y|-8 = 0$

Now, let's solve these cases:

1) For the first case, $|x+y| = 10$ and $|x-y| = 10$

Since the absolute value of a real number is always positive or zero, we have four different possibilities:

1.1) $x+y = 10$ and $x-y = 10$
1.2) $x+y = 10$ and $x-y = -10$
1.3) $x+y = -10$ and $x-y = 10$
1.4) $x+y = -10$ and $x-y = -10$

Solving these equations we get:

1.1) $x = 10, y = 0$
1.2) $x = 0, y = -10$
1.3) $x = 0, y = 10$
1.4) $x = -10, y = 0$

2) For the second case, $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$

Hence:

2.1) $x = 8$ or $x = -8$
2.2) $y = 8$ or $y = -8$

Combining these two cases together, we get the vertices of the polygon: $(10, 0)$, $(0, -10)$, $(0, 10)$, and $(-10, 0)$. And also $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The polygon has 8 sides, and it's a square with side length 10. So, its area is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the answer is $\boxed{100}$.

1) $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x - y| - 10 = 0$
2) $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$

Now, let's solve each case using Python and sympy.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Abs, Eq, solve

def solve_problem():
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # Case 1
    eq1 = Eq(Abs(x + y) - 10, 0)
    eq2 = Eq(Abs(x - y) - 10, 0)

    # Case 2
    eq3 = Eq(Abs(x) - 8, 0)
    eq4 = Eq(Abs(y) - 8, 0)

    # Solve the equations
    solutions1 = solve((eq1, eq2), (x, y))
    solutions2 = solve((eq3, eq4), (x, y))

    # Find the intersection of the solutions
    intersection = set(solutions1) & set(solutions2)

    return intersection

result = solve_problem()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS set()

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
set()
```
Since there's no intersection between the solutions, the points that satisfy the conditions do not form a polygon, which means the area of this polygon is $\boxed{0}$.

## QUESTION 3 - 17 
- TIME_SPENT : 865 secs

17_User:

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, we need to identify the cases when the expression equals zero.
2. To do this, we can use the property of absolute value, which states that $\vert a \vert = 0$ if and only if $a = 0$.
3. Hence, we can set each term inside the absolute value equal to zero and solve the resulting equations.
4. This will give us the vertices of the convex polygon.
5. Then, we can use the Shoelace formula to calculate the area of the polygon.

Let's start with the code:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solve, simplify

def find_area():
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # Solve the equations
    solutions_1 = solve([(abs(x + y) - 10) * (abs(x) - 8), (abs(x - y) - 10) * (abs(y) - 8)], (x, y))
    solutions_2 = solve([(abs(x + y) - 10) * (abs(y) - 8), (abs(x - y) - 10) * (abs(x) - 8)], (x, y))
    solutions_3 = solve([(abs(x + y) - 10) * (abs(x) - 8), (abs(x - y) - 10) * (abs(x) - 8)], (x, y))
    solutions_4 = solve([(abs(x + y) - 10) * (abs(y) - 8), (abs(x - y) - 10) * (abs(y) - 8)], (x, y))

    # Flatten the list of solutions
    solutions = [solution for solution in solutions_1 + solutions_2 + solutions_3 + solutions_4]

    # Calculate the area using the Shoelace formula
    x_coords, y_coords = zip(*solutions)
    area = abs(sum([x_coords[i]*y_coords[i+1] - x_coords[i+1]*y_coords[i] for i in range(len(x_coords)-1)]) + x_coords[-1]*y_coords[0] - x_coords[0]*y_coords[-1]) / 2

    # Simplify the area
    area = simplify(area)

    return area

result = find_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS Traceback: line 824, in __new__
    raise TypeError("Invalid NaN comparison")
TypeError: Invalid NaN comparison

FAIL


INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
Traceback: line 824, in __new__
    raise TypeError("Invalid NaN comparison")

```

Apparently, the previous code was not working because of an error in the calculation of the area using the Shoelace formula. Let's try again:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solve, simplify
from sympy.vector import CoordSys3D
from sympy import Polygon, sqrt

def find_area():
    x, y = symbols('x y')
    N = CoordSys3D('N')
    A = N.x
    B = N.y

    # Set up the equations
    eq1 = abs(A + B) - 10
    eq2 = abs(A - B) - 10
    eq3 = abs(A) - 8
    eq4 = abs(B) - 8

    # Solve the equations
    solutions_1 = solve([eq1 * eq3, eq2 * eq4], (A, B))
    solutions_2 = solve([eq1 * eq4, eq2 * eq3], (A, B))
    solutions_3 = solve([eq1 * eq3, eq2 * eq3], (A, B))
    solutions_4 = solve([eq1 * eq4, eq2 * eq4], (A, B))

    # Flatten the list of solutions
    solutions = [solution for solution in solutions_1 + solutions_2 + solutions_3 + solutions_4]

    # Convert the solutions to points
    points = [(solution[0].evalf(), solution[1].evalf()) for solution in solutions]

    # Calculate the area using the Shoelace formula
    area = abs(sum([points[i][0]*points[i+1][1] - points[i+1][0]*points[i][1] for i in range(len(points)-1)]) + points[-1][0]*points[0][1] - points[0][0]*points[-1][1]) / 2

    return area

result = find_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS Traceback: line 1007, in solve
    raise NotImplementedError('solving %s when the argument '
NotImplementedError: solving Abs(N.x + N.y) when the argument is not real or imaginary.

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output

    raise NotImplementedError('solving %s when the argument '

```

It seems that we are still getting an error, but it seems to be a different kind of error. Let's try another approach.

This problem involves absolute values, which make it difficult to solve directly. Instead, we can consider the equation as a set of conditions and solve for each condition separately.

The equation is:

$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$

This equation is satisfied if any of the following conditions are true:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
3. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
4. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$

For each condition, we can solve the equations separately and find the intersection points. Then, we can use the Shoelace formula to calculate the area of the polygon formed by these points.

Let's try this approach:

```python

from sympy import symbols, solve, simplify, sqrt
