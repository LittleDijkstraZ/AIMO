Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The problem asks us to find the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points satisfying the condition $0 = ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. 

To start, we can notice that the expression on the left-hand side is a product of two expressions. For a product to be zero, one of the factors must be zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

Let's analyze each case:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$

The equation above represents a pair of lines parallel to the x-axis at y = -10 and y = 10, and a pair of lines parallel to the y-axis at x = -10 and x = 10. These lines enclose a square with side length 20. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.

2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

The equation above represents a pair of lines parallel to the x-axis at y = -8 and y = 8, and a pair of lines parallel to the y-axis at x = -8 and x = 8. These lines enclose a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the total area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points satisfying the original equation is $400 + 256 = 656$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{656}$.

 We need to find the area of the convex polygon formed by the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the given equation. To do this, we need to understand the geometry of the points that satisfy the equation.

The equation can be simplified as follows:

$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \lor (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \lor (\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \lor (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

This is because if any of the terms inside the OR operation is zero, then the whole expression will be zero.

Solving these equations, we get the following points:

1. For $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, the points are $(x, y) = (10, 0)$ and $(x, y) = (-10, 0)$.
2. For $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, the points are $(x, y) = (0, 10)$ and $(x, y) = (0, -10)$.
3. For $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, the points are $(x, y) = (8, 0)$ and $(x, y) = (-8, 0)$.
4. For $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, the points are $(x, y) = (0, 8)$ and $(x, y) = (0, -8)$.

Now, we can plot these points on a graph and connect them to form the polygon. 

The resulting polygon is a square with side length 20. 

The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{400}$.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, notice that the left part of the equation is equivalent to $0$ only when $|x+y|=10$ and $|x-y|=10$ or when $|x|=8$ and $|y|=8$. This is because both of these expressions are squares and a square can only be $0$ if the expression inside it is also $0$.

So, we have to solve the following system of equations:

1. $|x+y|=10$
2. $|x-y|=10$
3. $|x|=8$
4. $|y|=8$

From (3) and (4), we have four possible combinations of $x$ and $y$:

1. $x=8$, $y=8$
2. $x=8$, $y=-8$
3. $x=-8$, $y=8$
4. $x=-8$, $y=-8$

Substitute these values into (1) and (2) and solve for $x$ and $y$ respectively:

1. $x=8$, $y=8$: $|x+y|=16 \neq 10$ and $|x-y|=0 \neq 10$. This combination does not satisfy the conditions.
2. $x=8$, $y=-8$: $|x+y|=0=10$ and $|x-y|=16 \neq 10$. This combination does not satisfy the conditions.
3. $x=-8$, $y=8$: $|x+y|=0=10$ and $|x-y|=16 \neq 10$. This combination does not satisfy the conditions.
4. $x=-8$, $y=-8$: $|x+y|=-16 \neq 10$ and $|x-y|=0 \neq 10$. This combination does not satisfy the conditions.

Therefore, the system of equations has no solution and there is no convex polygon with vertices at these points.

So, the area of this convex polygon is $\boxed{0}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We are given a system of inequalities and we need to find the area of the region that satisfies these inequalities.

2. First, we'll solve the inequalities and find the vertices of the polygon.

3. After that, we'll use the shoelace formula to calculate the area of the polygon.

Let's start:

First, we'll solve the inequalities:

1. $|x+y|-10 = 0$ gives $|x+y| = 10$ or $x+y = \pm 10$.

2. $|x-y|-10 = 0$ gives $|x-y| = 10$ or $x-y = \pm 10$.

3. $|x|-8 = 0$ gives $|x| = 8$ or $x = \pm 8$.

4. $|y|-8 = 0$ gives $|y| = 8$ or $y = \pm 8$.

Now, we'll find the vertices of the polygon:

1. Intersection of $x+y = 10$ and $x-y = 10$ gives $x = 10$ and $y = 0$. So, one vertex is $(10, 0)$.

2. Intersection of $x+y = 10$ and $x-y = -10$ gives $x = 0$ and $y = 10$. So, another vertex is $(0, 10)$.

3. Intersection of $x+y = -10$ and $x-y = 10$ gives $x = -10$ and $y = -20$. So, another vertex is $(-10, -20)$.

4. Intersection of $x+y = -10$ and $x-y = -10$ gives $x = 0$ and $y = -10$. So, another vertex is $(0, -10)$.

5. Intersection of $x-y = 10$ and $x = 8$ gives $x = 8$ and $y = -2$. So, another vertex is $(8, -2)$.

6. Intersection of $x-y = -10$ and $x = 8$ gives $x = 8$ and $y = 18$. So, another vertex is $(8, 18)$.

7. Intersection of $x-y = 10$ and $y = 8$ gives $x = 18$ and $y = 8$. So, another vertex is $(18, 8)$.

8. Intersection of $x-y = -10$ and $y = 8$ gives $x = -2$ and $y = 8$. So, another vertex is $(-2, 8)$.

Now, we'll use the shoelace formula to calculate the area of the polygon:

The shoelace formula states that if the vertices of a polygon are $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), ..., (x_n, y_n)$, then the area of the polygon is given by:

Area = $\frac{1}{2} |(x_1y_2 + x_2y_3 + ... + x_ny_1) - (y_1x_2 + y_2x_3 + ... + y_nx_1)|$

Applying this formula to our vertices, we get:

Area = $\frac{1}{2} |(10*10 + 0*10 + 10*(-20) + 0*(-10) + 8*18 + (-2)*8 + 8*(-10) + 18*8) - (0*10 + 10*10 + (-20)*10 + 0*(-2) + 18*(-2) + 8*8 + 18*8 + 8*(-10))|$

Simplifying this expression, we get:

Area = $\frac{1}{2} |(100 + 0 - 200 + 0 + 144 - 16 + 64 + 144) - (0 + 100 - 200 + 0 - 36 + 64 + 144 - 80)|$

Area = $\frac{1}{2} |(-100 + 400 - 100)| = \frac{1}{2} * 200 = 100$

So, the area of the polygon is 100 square units.

The answer is $\boxed{100}$.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The expression $AB = 0$ is true when $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, we can split the condition into two parts:

1. $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$
2. $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$

Let's analyze each condition:

1.1. $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$
This means that both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The absolute value equations have two solutions each, $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$. Solving these linear equations, we get four points: $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, $(-5,-5)$.

1.2. $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$
This means that both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The absolute value equations have two solutions each, $x = 8$ or $x = -8$ and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. Solving these linear equations, we get four more points: $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, $(-8,-8)$.

However, note that the points $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, $(-5,-5)$, $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, $(-8,-8)$ are actually the same points. Therefore, the convex polygon is just a square with side length 10 units.

Finally, the area of the square is $10^2 = \boxed{100}$ square units.

Assistant:

 We are given a math problem that involves absolute values and squares. The task is to find the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points that satisfy the given equation.

To solve this problem, we can first analyze the equation and identify the conditions that make it equal to zero. The equation is given as:

$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$

The equation will be zero if either of the following conditions is true:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From condition 1, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ or $x - y = 10$.

From condition 2, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x = 8$ or $y = 8$.

The intersection points of these lines are the vertices of the polygon. We can find these vertices by solving the system of equations formed by the lines.

Once we have the vertices, we can calculate the area of the polygon using the Shoelace formula or any other method for calculating the area of a polygon given its vertices.

After solving the problem, the final numerical answer is $\boxed{320}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is of the form $A \cdot B = 0$ which means either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore we have two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10 \Rightarrow x + y = \pm 10$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8 \Rightarrow x = \pm 8$.

Similarly for $y$:

1. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x - y \vert = 10 \Rightarrow x - y = \pm 10$.
2. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert y \vert = 8 \Rightarrow y = \pm 8$.

These are the equations of 8 lines in the plane. The intersection points of these lines are the vertices of the polygon.

The polygon is formed by the intersections of these lines:

1. The lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$ intersect at $(-10, 20)$.
2. The lines $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$ intersect at $(10, -20)$.
3. The lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$ intersect at $(8, 0)$.
4. The lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$ intersect at $(0, -8)$.

There are also intersection points of the lines with the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$:

1. The lines $x + y = 10$ and $x = 8$ intersect at $(8, 2)$.
2. The lines $x + y = 10$ and $y = 8$ intersect at $(2, 8)$.
3. The lines $x - y = 10$ and $x = 8$ intersect at $(8, -2)$.
4. The lines $x - y = 10$ and $y = 8$ intersect at $(2, -8)$.

Now we can draw the polygon. It is a rectangle with sides 20 and 16.

Finally, calculate the area: $\text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} = 20 \times 16 = \boxed{320}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The product of two numbers is zero if at least one of the numbers is zero. This means we can consider the following two cases separately:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first case, we have four possibilities:

1.1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$
1.2. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$
1.3. $\vert x + y \vert = 0$ which implies $x = -y$
1.4. $\vert x - y \vert = 0$ which implies $x = y$

For the second case, we have four possibilities:

2.1. $\vert x \vert = 8$ which implies $-8 \leq x \leq 8$
2.2. $\vert y \vert = 8$ which implies $-8 \leq y \leq 8$
2.3. $\vert x \vert = 0$ which implies $x = 0$
2.4. $\vert y \vert = 0$ which implies $y = 0$

Now let's consider the intersections of the cases:

1.1 and 2.1: $x = -y$ and $-8 \leq x \leq 8$, which gives us a square with side length 16 and area $16^2 = 256$
1.2 and 2.2: $x = y$ and $-8 \leq y \leq 8$, which gives us a square with side length 16 and area $16^2 = 256$
1.3 and 2.3: $x = 0$ and $-8 \leq y \leq 8$, which gives us a line segment of length 16 and area $0$
1.4 and 2.4: $y = 0$ and $-8 \leq x \leq 8$, which gives us a line segment of length 16 and area $0$
1.3 and 2.1: $x = 0$ and $x = -y$, which gives us a point and area $0$
1.3 and 2.2: $x = 0$ and $x = y$, which gives us a point and area $0$
1.4 and 2.3: $y = 0$ and $x = -y$, which gives us a point and area $0$
1.4 and 2.4: $y = 0$ and $x = y$, which gives us a point and area $0$

So the total area of the convex polygon is $256 + 256 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 512$.

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{512}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The condition is: $ ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$

This condition will hold true for the following 2 conditions:

1) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10 \rightarrow x + y = \pm 10$

2) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8 \rightarrow x = \pm 8$

Let's draw these lines in coordinate system and analyze the areas enclosed by them:

1) The lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$ are parallel to x-axis, and are at a distance of 10 units from it.

2) The lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$ are parallel to y-axis, and are at a distance of 8 units from it.

Now let's find the coordinates where these lines intersect.

Intersection of $x + y = 10$ and $x = 8$ is $(8, 2)$

Intersection of $x + y = 10$ and $x = -8$ is $(-8, 18)$

Intersection of $x + y = -10$ and $x = 8$ is $(8, -18)$

Intersection of $x + y = -10$ and $x = -8$ is $(-8, -2)$

So the vertices of the polygon are $(8, 2)$, $(-8, 18)$, $(8, -18)$ and $(-8, -2)$

Now the area of the polygon can be calculated using Shoelace Formula.

The Shoelace Formula is a nifty formula for the area of an n-sided polygon, given the coordinates of its vertices. But before we apply this formula, we need to check if the vertices are listed in a clockwise or counterclockwise order. To do this, we sum up the products of the x-coordinates and the y-coordinates of the vertices, and see whether the result is positive or negative.

In our case, the vertices are listed in counterclockwise order (you can easily verify this by observing that going through the vertices in order, we always turn right, which means the area will be positive), so we can apply the Shoelace Formula.

Shoelace Formula is: Area = $\frac{1}{2} \vert \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}y_{i+1} - \sum_{i=1}^{n} y_{i}x_{i+1} \vert$

Here $x_{n+1}$ and $y_{n+1}$ are same as $x_1$ and $y_1$ respectively

So the Area = $\frac{1}{2} \vert (8*2 + (-8)*18 + 8*(-18) + (-8)*(-2)) - (2*8 + 18*(-8) + (-18)*8 + (-2)*(-8)) \vert$

After calculating the above expression we get Area = $384$

So the area of the polygon is $\boxed{384}$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The given equation is:

$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$

This equation is satisfied when either of the two terms is zero. This gives us four conditions to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

Now, let's analyze each condition:

1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$
2. $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$

The first condition gives us the equation of two lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$. The second condition gives us the equations of two lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$. These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, $(-8, 0)$, and $(0, -8)$.

The area of this rectangle is $8 \times 8 = 64$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{64}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



We have the equation $f(x, y) = (\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and this means either $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$ and either $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$. Solving these systems of linear equations we get the corners of the polygon: $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$ and $(-10, 0)$.

Similarly, we have the equation $g(x, y) = (\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ and this means either $x = 8$ or $x = -8$ and either $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. Solving these systems of linear equations we get the corners of the polygon: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$ and $(-8, -8)$.

Now we have 4 lines: $y = 10 - x$, $y = x - 10$, $y = x + 8$ and $y = -x - 8$. The area of the polygon is the sum of the areas of two right triangles. The first one has vertices in $(0, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, $(10, 10)$ and the second one has vertices in $(0, 0)$, $(0, -10)$, $(-10, -10)$.

Thus, the area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two right triangles which is $Area = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 10 \cdot 10 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 10 \cdot 10 = 100$.

So, the area of the polygon is $\boxed{100}$.
