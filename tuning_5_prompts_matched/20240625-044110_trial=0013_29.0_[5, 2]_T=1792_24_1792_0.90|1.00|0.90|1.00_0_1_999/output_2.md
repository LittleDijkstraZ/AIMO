Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has a piecewise definition of the form:
\[
\begin{cases}
\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100} \\
-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = \frac{m}{100}
\end{cases}
\]
Solving each equation separately, we get:
\[
\begin{cases}
\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100} \\
\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}
\end{cases}
\]
Now, we have four cases to consider:
\[
\begin{cases}
x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100} \\
x-1 = -(2 + \frac{m}{100})
\end{cases}
\]
and
\[
\begin{cases}
x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100} \\
x-1 = -(2 - \frac{m}{100})
\end{cases}
\]
Solving these equations, we get the following solutions:
\[
\begin{cases}
x = 3 + \frac{m}{100} \\
x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}
\end{cases}
\]
and
\[
\begin{cases}
x = 3 - \frac{m}{100} \\
x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}
\end{cases}
\]
For the equation to have four distinct solutions, the expressions $3 + \frac{m}{100}$, $-1 - \frac{m}{100}$, $3 - \frac{m}{100}$, and $-1 + \frac{m}{100}$ must all be positive and distinct. This gives us the inequalities:
\[
\begin{cases}
3 + \frac{m}{100} > -1 - \frac{m}{100} \\
3 + \frac{m}{100} > 3 - \frac{m}{100} \\
3 + \frac{m}{100} > -1 + \frac{m}{100} \\
-1 - \frac{m}{100} > 3 - \frac{m}{100} \\
-1 - \frac{m}{100} > -1 + \frac{m}{100} \\
3 - \frac{m}{100} > -1 + \frac{m}{100}
\end{cases}
\]
Solving these inequalities, we find that $100 < m < 300$. The positive integers $m$ in this range are 101 through 299, which gives us 199 possible values for $m$. However, we also need to ensure that the solutions are distinct. Checking the slopes of the lines defined by the expressions, we see that they are all distinct (either positive or negative), so the solutions are indeed distinct for all values of $m$ in the range. Therefore, there are 199 values of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions. The answer is: $199$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"

Assistant:

 The given equation is $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$, which has 4 distinct solutions. 

The expression $|x - 1| - 2$ can take three values: $-\frac{m}{100}$, $0$, and $\frac{m}{100}$. 

For $| |x - 1| - 2 | = 0$, there will be 2 solutions. So, the interesting case is when $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \pm \frac{m}{100}$.

We consider the two cases separately:
1. When $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$, the equation becomes $ |x - 1| - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$ or $ |x - 1| - 2 = -\frac{m}{100}$. Solving these two equations we get the solutions $x = 1 + 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = 1 + 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, or $x = 1 + 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = 1 + 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ when the absolute value is taken into account. Thus, in this case, there are 4 distinct solutions if and only if $1 + 2 + \frac{m}{100} \neq 1 + 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $m \neq 0$.

2. When $| |x - 1| - 2 | = -\frac{m}{100}$, the equation doesn't have any solutions because the absolute value function is always non-negative, and the left hand side of the equation is non-negative, while the right hand side is negative.

So, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $m \neq 0$ and $1 + 2 + \frac{m}{100} \neq 1 + 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. This simplifies to $m \neq 0$ and $m \neq 0$, which is always true for positive integers $m$.

However, we must also ensure that the solutions for $x$ are distinct. The first solution is $x = 1 + 2 + \frac{m}{100} = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$, and the second solution is $x = 1 + 2 - \frac{m}{100} = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$. For the solutions to be distinct, $\frac{m}{100} \neq -\frac{m}{100}$, which implies $m \neq 0$.

So, the condition for the equation to have 4 distinct solutions is that $m$ is a positive integer different from 0. The number of such positive integers is infinite. However, the problem asks for a specific number of positive integers $m$, and since the number of such positive integers is infinite, the problem is flawed and does not have a definite answer. 

However, if we were to consider a specific range of values for $m$, say from 1 to 100, we could then count the number of such $m$ values. In that case, the number of such $m$ values is 99, since all positive integers from 1 to 100, except for 0, would satisfy the conditions.

So, if the problem were rephrased to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation has 4 distinct solutions for $m$ in the range 1 to 100, the answer would be 99.

In conclusion, the problem appears to be flawed in that it asks for a specific number of positive integers $m$ while the number of such positive integers is infinite. However, considering a specific range of values for $m$, say from 1 to 100, we could count the number of such $m$ values, in which case the answer would be 99.

In this case, to solve the problem as stated, the correct answer is that the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation has 4 distinct solutions is infinite. Therefore, the output is $\boxed{\text{infinite}}$. However, if the problem were rephrased to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation has 4 distinct solutions for $m$ in the range 1 to 100, the answer would be 99. In either case, the answer is correct depending on how the problem is interpreted.

Assistant:

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions, so we need to find the values of $m$ for which this is true.

Let's start by analyzing the expression inside the absolute value: $\vert x-1 \vert -2$. This expression can be positive or negative, so we need to consider both cases separately.

Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$.
This gives us two sub-cases to consider:

Sub-case 1.1: If $x \geq 1$, then $x-1 \geq 0$, so $\vert x-1 \vert = x-1$. The equation becomes $x-1 -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x-3 = \frac{m}{100}$. Solving for $x$, we get $x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$.

Sub-case 1.2: If $x < 1$, then $x-1 < 0$, so $\vert x-1 \vert = 1-x$. The equation becomes $1-x-2 = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $1-x-2 = \frac{m}{100}$, and then $x = 1 - \frac{m}{100} - 2$, which simplifies to $x = 1 - \frac{m+100}{100}$.

Now let's consider the other absolute value: $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. This is equal to $\frac{m}{100}$, so $\vert x-3 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$ for sub-case 1.1, and $\vert 1 - \frac{m+100}{100} - 2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\vert -\frac{m+100}{100} -1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert \frac{m-100}{100} \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, for sub-case 1.2.

For sub-case 1.1, we need to consider two more sub-cases:

Sub-case 1.1.1: If $\frac{m}{100} + 3 \geq 1$, then $\frac{m}{100} \geq -2$, or $m \geq -200$. But $m$ must be a positive integer, so this doesn't give us any solutions.

Sub-case 1.1.2: If $\frac{m}{100} + 3 < 1$, then $\frac{m}{100} < -2$, or $m < -200$. But $m$ must be a positive integer, so this doesn't give us any solutions either.

For sub-case 1.2, we need to consider two more sub-cases:

Sub-case 1.2.1: If $1 - \frac{m+100}{100} - 2 \geq 1$, then $-\frac{m+100}{100} \geq 0$, or $m \leq -100$. But $m$ must be a positive integer, so this doesn't give us any solutions.

Sub-case 1.2.2: If $1 - \frac{m+100}{100} - 2 < 1$, then $-\frac{m+100}{100} < 0$, or $m > -100$. But $m$ must be a positive integer, so we need to find the positive values of $m$ that satisfy $\vert \frac{m-100}{100} \vert = \frac{m}{100}$. This simplifies to $\frac{m-100}{100} = \frac{m}{100}$ if $m-100 \geq 0$, or $\frac{100-m}{100} = \frac{m}{100}$ if $m-100 < 0$.
The first equation gives $m-100 = m$, which gives no solutions. The second equation gives $100-m = m$, or $m = 50$.

So in case 1, we have one solution, $m=50$.

Case 2: $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = -\frac{m}{100}$.
However, the absolute value of a quantity cannot be negative, so there are no solutions in this case.

Therefore, the only positive integer value of $m$ that makes the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have 4 distinct solutions is $m=50$. The answer is: $1$

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"

Assistant:

 To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of distinct solutions of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 1 and 2. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ oscillates between 1 and 2. Therefore, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Multiplying all sides of the inequalities by 100 gives $100 < m < 200$. The number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality is $200 - 100 - 1 = 99$. Therefore, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions for 99 positive integers $m$.

The python code to calculate the number of positive integers $m$ is:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def count_m():
    lower_bound = 100
    upper_bound = 200
    count = upper_bound - lower_bound - 1
    return count

result = count_m()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 99

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
99
```

Hence, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 99. The answer is: $99$

Assistant:


This problem is a bit complex, and a direct Python solution is not straightforward. However, we can solve it step by step.

Firstly, let's analyze the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.

This equation has 4 distinct solutions, which means that the right side, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be greater than 2 but less than 3. This is because the absolute value expression on the left side (which is between 0 and 2) can be made equal to any number in this range by adjusting the value of $m$.

So we have $2 < \frac{m}{100} < 3$, which gives $200 < m < 300$. 

The only positive integer $m$ in this range is $201$.

So the answer is $\boxed{1}$. However, I must admit that this problem is quite tricky and requires a deep understanding of absolute value equations. For such complex problems, it might be better to have a human solve it rather than expect a machine to do it quickly.

 The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ falls into the interval $(0, 2)$. The maximum value of $m$ that allows four distinct solutions is when $\frac{m}{100}=2$, giving $m=200$. The minimum value of $m$ is when $\frac{m}{100}$ is just greater than $0$, giving $m=1$. Therefore, we are looking for the number of positive integers from $1$ to $200$.

There are $200$ positive integers from $1$ to $200$, so the number of such $m$ is $200$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def count_m():
    """Count the number of positive integers from 1 to 200."""
    return 200

result = count_m()

The number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition is $200$. The answer is: $200$.

Assistant:

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.
We first need to analyze the equation to understand its behavior.

Consider the absolute value equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=a$, where $a$ is a nonnegative real number.

1. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2>0$, then the equation becomes $\vert x-1 \vert -2=a$, which simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert=a+2$. This gives us two cases:
   a. If $x-1>0$, then $x-1=a+2$, and $x=a+3$.
   b. If $x-1<0$, then $-(x-1)=a+2$, and $x=1-a-2=-a-1$.

2. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2\leq0$, then the equation becomes $-( \vert x-1 \vert -2 )=a$, which simplifies to $-\vert x-1 \vert +2=a$, and then $\vert x-1 \vert =2-a$. This gives us two cases:
   a. If $x-1>0$, then $x-1=2-a$, and $x=3-a$.
   b. If $x-1<0$, then $-(x-1)=2-a$, and $x=a-1$.

Hence, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=a$ has four distinct solutions: $x=a+3$, $x=-a-1$, $x=3-a$, and $x=a-1$.

Now, we return to the original problem, where $a=\frac{m}{100}$.
The equation has four distinct solutions when $0 \leq \frac{m}{100} < 2$, because when $\frac{m}{100} \geq 2$, the absolute value inside becomes negative, and the equation becomes invalid.

So, $0 \leq m < 200$ is the range of $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions. 

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ in this range is $200$. The answer is: $200$

Assistant:

 To find the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions, we need to analyze the equation and find the possible values of $m$.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $2$, $1$, $3$, or any other positive number greater than $3$. 

This is because the expression on the left side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, can take on any value from $0$ to $3$, and the only way for it to take on $4$ distinct values is when it takes on these specific values.

Therefore, the possible values of $m$ are $200$, $100$, $300$, and all other positive integers greater than $300$.

However, the problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$, so we only consider the first three values: $200$, $100$, and $300$.

Therefore, there are $3$ positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions.
The answer is: $3$

Assistant:

 The problem statement seems to have a misconception: the expression $| |x-1|-2|$ is always between $0$ and $3$, inclusive, regardless of $x$. Therefore, the right hand side $\frac{m}{100}$ must also be in that interval for the equation to have a chance of having four distinct solutions. That means $\frac{m}{100}$ must be in the interval $(0,3]$, and so $m$ must be in the interval $(0,300]$.

Now, we need to find out for how many values of $m$ within this interval the equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly four distinct solutions. The graph of $| |x-1|-2|$ consists of a pair of "V"s, each with its bottom at $y=0$ and $y=4$, and the whole graph is invariant under translation by $10$ units. Therefore, the number of values of $m$ for which the equation has four solutions is the same as the number of multiples of $100$ in the interval $(0,300]$, which is $3$.

So the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation has four distinct solutions is $3$. The answer is: $\boxed{3}$

Assistant:

 The problem asks for how many positive integers $m$ the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has $4$ distinct solutions. Let's visualize the graph of $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ and $y = \frac{m}{100}$:

The graph of $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a V-shaped graph with two "valleys" at $x = -1$ and $x = 3$. The depth of each valley is $2$. The graph of $y = \frac{m}{100}$ is a horizontal line at $y = \frac{m}{100}$. The number of intersections between the two graphs is equal to the number of solutions to the equation.

For the equation to have $4$ distinct solutions, the horizontal line $y = \frac{m}{100}$ must intersect the graph of $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ in $4$ points. This happens when $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to the depth of one of the valleys, which is $2$. So we have $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, which gives $m = 200$. Therefore, there is only $1$ value of $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions. The value of $m$ is $200$. The answer is: $200$

 To solve this problem, we need to analyze the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ and find the values of $m$ for which it has $4$ distinct solutions.

First, let's rewrite the equation as $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. We know that the absolute value function has a piecewise definition, so let's consider the cases for $\vert x-1 \vert -2$.

1. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 \geq 0$, then $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100} \Rightarrow \vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100} + 2$. This gives us two possibilities: $x-1 = \frac{m}{100} + 2$ or $x-1 = -\left(\frac{m}{100} + 2\right)$.

2. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0$, then $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100} \Rightarrow \vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two possibilities: $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 = -\left(2 - \frac{m}{100}\right)$.

Each of these four possibilities gives us an equation to solve for $x$, and we need to count the number of distinct solutions. For each value of $m$, we can plot the resulting functions and count the number of intersections with the x-axis.

After analyzing the equations for different values of $m$, we find that the equation has $4$ distinct solutions when $m=150$.

Therefore, the value of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $m=150$. The answer is: $150$

 To solve this problem, we need to find the value of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. 

Let's start by graphing the left side of the equation, which is the absolute value of the absolute value of $x-1$ minus $2$. This function is a "double V" shape, with the points of the V's at $x=1-2= -1$ and $x=1+2=3$. The function is $0$ at $x= -1 + 2 = 1$ and $x= 3 - 2 = 1$, and is equal to $2$ at $x= -1$ and $x= 3$. 

The right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, is a horizontal line that goes up as $m$ increases. 

For the equation to have $4$ distinct solutions, the height of the horizontal line must be between the heights of the two points of the V's. That is, $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which simplifies to $0 < m < 200$. However, $m$ must be a positive integer, so the possible values of $m$ are the integers from $1$ to $199$, inclusive. The number of such integers is $199$.

Therefore, the value of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $199$. The answer is: $199$

Assistant:

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions, which means that the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, must be equal to either $-\frac{m}{100}$, $0$, or $\frac{m}{100}$. This gives us three separate cases to solve:

- Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$. Solving this gives $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, and then $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 = -(2 - \frac{m}{100})$.
- Case 2: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 0$. Solving this gives $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$, and then $x-1 = 2$ or $x-1 = -2$.
- Case 3: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$. Solving this gives $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, and then $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 = -(2 + \frac{m}{100})$.

For each of these cases, we need to find the values of $m$ that give distinct solutions. Let's analyze each case:

- Case 1: $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 = -(2 - \frac{m}{100})$. Solving these gives $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ or $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$. The solutions are distinct if and only if $3 - \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 + \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $m \neq 200$.
- Case 2: $x-1 = 2$ or $x-1 = -2$. Solving these gives $x = 3$ or $x = -1$. The solutions are distinct.
- Case 3: $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 = -(2 + \frac{m}{100})$. Solving these gives $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$. The solutions are distinct if and only if $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $m \neq -200$.

Since $m$ must be a positive integer, the only value of $m$ that doesn't give distinct solutions in any of the cases is $m = 200$. Therefore, the only positive integer values of $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions are the positive integers not equal to $200$. There are $\boxed{99}$ such positive integers. The answer is: $\boxed{99}$

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The first step to solve this problem is to understand the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. This equation represents the number of times the expression inside the absolute value function, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, changes its sign when $x$ varies from $-\infty$ to $\infty$. This number is equal to the number of distinct solutions of the equation.

The expression $\vert x-1 \vert -2$ changes its sign at $x = 1 \pm 2$, i.e., at $x = -1$ and $x = 3$. Therefore, the equation has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to the distance between these two points, i.e., $\frac{m}{100} = 3 - (-1) = 4$.

Solving for $m$ gives $m = 4 \cdot 100 = 400$.

So, the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is $m = 400$.

Therefore, the answer is $1$. However, since we are asked for the number of such $m$, we should give the answer as $1$ if we are looking for a numerical answer, but the correct answer is that there is only $\boxed{1}$ positive integer $m$ that satisfies the condition.

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is between $1$ and $2$. Therefore, we have $1 \le \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Multiplying all sides of the inequalities by $100$ gives $100 \le m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ satisfying this inequality are the integers from $100$ to $199$, inclusive. To find the number of these integers, we subtract the smallest integer from the largest and then add $1$. So the number of positive integers $m$ is $199 - 100 + 1 = 100$. The answer is: 100

Assistant:

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 1$. This is because the expression on the left side of the equation is always between $0$ and $3$, and it attains each of these values exactly once. Therefore, we need to solve the equation $\frac{m}{100} = 1$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

def find_m():
    m = symbols('m')
    equation = Eq(m/100, 1)
    solution = solve(equation, m)[0]
    return solution

m = find_m()
print(m)
```

So, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions for $m = 100$ only. The answer is: $1$.
