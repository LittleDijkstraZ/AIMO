Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, let's understand the math problem. The equation we have is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. Let's deal with each term separately.

The first term is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, and this equals to zero if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the sum of the absolute values of x and y is 10 and the absolute value of the difference of x and y is also 10. This forms a square with side length of 10 units.

The second term is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$, and this equals to zero if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that the absolute values of x and y are both 8, forming a square with side length of 16 units.

Now, we need to find the area of the convex polygon formed by the intersection of these two squares. The intersection of the two squares forms a square with side length of 10 units.

To find the area of this square, we simply square the side length: $10^2 = 100$. So, the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units.

Now, let's write this in python:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    side_length = 10
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 100

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
100
```
The area of the convex polygon is $100$ square units.
The answer is $\boxed{100}$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The expression is equal to zero only when both expressions inside the product are zero:
\[(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0\] and \[(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0.\]
This happens when
\[\vert x + y \vert = 10\] and \[\vert x \vert = 8.\]

Since $\vert x \vert = 8$, $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
Similarly, from $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.

If $x = 8$, from $x + y = 10$, we get $y = 2$. From $x + y = -10$, we get $y = -18$.
If $x = -8$, from $x + y = 10$, we get $y = 18$. From $x + y = -10$, we get $y = -2$.

So the vertices of the polygon are $(-8, -2)$, $(-8, 18)$, $(8, 2)$, and $(8, -18)$.

The polygon is a rectangle with length $16$ and width $20$, so its area is $16 \times 20 = 320$.

However, this is not the area of the polygon inside the square of side length $16+8=24$, but the area of the rectangle minus the areas of the four triangles that extend outside the square.

The four triangles each have base $8$ and height $8$, so the total area of the four triangles is $4 \times \frac{1}{2} \times 8 \times 8 = 128$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $320 - 128 = 192$. However, this is the area inside the square of side length $24$.

Since the question asks for the area inside the square of side length $16+8=24$, we need to subtract the area of the square of side length $16$ (which is $256$) from the area we just calculated. So the area of the polygon inside the square of side length $24$ is $192 - 256 = -64$.

But this is not possible, because the area cannot be negative. There must be a mistake in our reasoning. Let's go back and re-examine the problem.

We have \[(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0\] and \[(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0.\]

From \[(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0\] we get \[\vert x + y \vert = 10.\] That is, $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.

From \[(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0\] we get \[\vert x \vert = 8.\] That is, $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.

Now let's solve the system of equations $x + y = 10$ and $x = 8$:
\[8 + y = 10 \implies y = 2.\]
And let's solve the system of equations $x + y = -10$ and $x = 8$:
\[8 + y = -10 \implies y = -18.\]

Then, let's solve the system of equations $x + y = 10$ and $x = -8$:
\[-8 + y = 10 \implies y = 18.\]
And let's solve the system of equations $x + y = -10$ and $x = -8$:
\[-8 + y = -10 \implies y = -2.\]

So the vertices of the polygon are $(-8, -2)$, $(-8, 18)$, $(8, 2)$, and $(8, -18)$. The polygon is a rectangle with length $16$ and width $20$, so its area is indeed $16 \times 20 = 320$.

However, the area inside the square of side length $24$ is not what we are looking for. The question asks for the area inside the square of side length $16+8=24$. To find this, we need to subtract the area of the square of side length $16$ (which is $256$) from the area of the rectangle (which is $320$). So the area of the polygon inside the square of side length $24$ is $320 - 256 = 64$.

But this is still not the correct answer. Let's re-examine our steps again.

From \[(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0\] we get \[\vert x \vert = 8.\] That is, $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.

From \[(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0\] we get \[\vert x + y \vert = 10.\] That is, $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.

Now let's solve the system of equations $x + y = 10$ and $x = 8$:
\[8 + y = 10 \implies y = 2.\]
And let's solve the system of equations $x + y = -10$ and $x = 8$:
\[8 + y = -10 \implies y = -18.\]

Then, let's solve the system of equations $x + y = 10$ and $x = -8$:
\[-8 + y = 10 \implies y = 18.\]
And let's solve the system of equations $x + y = -10$ and $x = -8$:
\[-8 + y = -10 \implies y = -2.\]

So the vertices of the polygon are $(-8, -2)$, $(-8, 18)$, $(8, 2)$, and $(8, -18)$. The polygon is a rectangle with length $16$ and width $20$, so its area is indeed $16 \times 20 = 320$.

But this is not the area inside the square of side length $16+8=24$. The question asks for the area inside the square of side length $16+8=24$. To find this, we need to subtract the area of the square of side length $16$ (which is $256$) from the area of the rectangle (which is $320$). So the area of the polygon inside the square of side length $24$ is $320 - 256 = 64$.

This time, the area is positive, so it seems to be the correct answer. So the area of the polygon inside the square of side length $24$ is $64$. However, we must also consider the fact that the points satisfying the original equation are enclosed by the polygon, and the area of the polygon is enclosed by the square of side length $24$. Therefore, the area of the polygon inside the square of side length $24$ is $64$.

Therefore, the area of the polygon inside the square of side length $24$ is 64.
The answer is: $64$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The expression is equal to zero if any of its factors are equal to zero. This gives us four conditions:

1. $|x + y| - 10 = 0$
2. $|x - y| - 10 = 0$
3. $|x| - 8 = 0$
4. $|y| - 8 = 0$

Solving these conditions:

1. $|x + y| = 10 \implies x + y = \pm 10$
2. $|x - y| = 10 \implies x - y = \pm 10$
3. $|x| = 8 \implies x = \pm 8$
4. $|y| = 8 \implies y = \pm 8$

These conditions give us the vertices of the polygon:

$(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8), (10, 0), (-10, 0), (0, 10), (0, -10)$

The polygon is a square with side length $16$. The area of a square is given by the side length squared, so the area is $16^2 = 256$.

The sympy-based approach for solving this problem is to:

1. Analyze the given equation and identify the conditions that make it equal to zero.
2. Solve each condition to find the vertices of the polygon.
3. Determine the shape of the polygon.
4. Calculate the area of the polygon.

Finally, the area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The equation given is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. This equation equals to zero if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

2. These equations are equivalent to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$, respectively.

3. The solutions for $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$ are the points on the four lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, $x - y = -10$, $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

4. These lines enclose a rectangle with vertices at $(8, 2)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(8, -8)$.

5. To find the area of this rectangle, we can calculate the difference between the maximum and minimum $x$-coordinates times the difference between the maximum and minimum $y$-coordinates. The maximum and minimum $x$-coordinates are 8 and -8, respectively, so the difference is $8 - (-8) = 16$. The maximum and minimum $y$-coordinates are 8 and -8, respectively, so the difference is $8 - (-8) = 16$.

6. Therefore, the area of the rectangle is $16 \times 16 = 256$.

However, this result is counterintuitive because the area of the rectangle should be less than or equal to $10^2 + 10^2 = 200$. It seems that we made a mistake when we used the absolute value equations.

Let's reconsider the problem. The equations $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ actually represent four lines, not one line each. Similarly, $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ also represent four lines. The four lines from $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ form a cross, and the four lines from $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ form a square. The intersection of the cross and the square is the polygon we're interested in.

The cross has a base of length 20 and height of length 20, so its area is $20 \times 20 = 400$. The square has side length 16, so its area is $16 \times 16 = 256$. The intersection of the cross and the square is the polygon we're interested in, and its area is the area of the square, which is 256.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

Now let's write the entire script to solve the problem:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    # The cross formed by the lines |x + y| = 10 and |x - y| = 10 has a base of length 20 and height of length 20,
    # so its area is 20 * 20 = 400.
    cross_area = 20 * 20

    # The square formed by the lines |x| = 8 and |y| = 8 has side length 16,
    # so its area is 16 * 16 = 256.
    square_area = 16 * 16

    # The intersection of the cross and the square is the polygon we're interested in,
    # and its area is the area of the square, which is 256.
    polygon_area = square_area

    return polygon_area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```

The area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{256}$.

Now, let's correct the last step of the problem:
The intersection of the cross and the square is the polygon we're interested in, and its area is the area of the square, which is 256.
So, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The equation given is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero, the second term is zero, or both terms are zero.
The first term is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. For this term to be zero, we need both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these equations are all points of the form $(x, y)$ such that the distance between $(x, y)$ and the origin is 10. This is a circle centered at the origin with radius 10.
The second term is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. For this term to be zero, we need both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. This implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are all points of the form $(x, y)$ such that the distance between $(x, y)$ and the origin is 8. This is a circle centered at the origin with radius 8.
The intersection of these two circles is a square with side length 16 (since the difference in radii is 2). The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
So the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$
