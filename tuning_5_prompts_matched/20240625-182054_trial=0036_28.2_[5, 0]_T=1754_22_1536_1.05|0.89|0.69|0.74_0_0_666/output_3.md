Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, we see that the product of two expressions equals zero. This means that each of the expressions must be equal to zero. So we have two cases:

a) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10$.
b) $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x - y \vert = 10$.
c) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8$.
d) $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert y \vert = 8$.

2. From c) and d), we get $-8 \leq x, y \leq 8$.

3. From a) and b), we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that either $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$, and either $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$. We can solve these equations to get the coordinates of the vertices of the polygon.

4. We can find the coordinates of the vertices by solving the above equations:

If $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, we get $x = 10$ and $y = 0$.
If $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$, we get $x = 0$ and $y = 10$.
If $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$, we get $x = -10$ and $y = 0$.
If $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$, we get $x = 0$ and $y = -10$.

5. So the vertices of the polygon are $(10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, $(-10, 0)$, and $(0, -10)$.

6. The polygon is a square with side length 20. The area of the square is $20^2 = 400$.

So the area of the convex polygon is $400$. The answer is: $400$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Firstly, let's understand that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of them is zero. This implies that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

Now, let's solve each case:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10 \Rightarrow x + y = \pm 10$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x - y \vert = 10 \Rightarrow x - y = \pm 10$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8 \Rightarrow x = \pm 8$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert y \vert = 8 \Rightarrow y = \pm 8$.

The combinations of these equations give us the vertices of the polygon: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$. These points form a square with side length 16. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. So the area of the polygon is 256.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solve

def polygon_area():
    # The side length of the square
    side_length = 16

    # The area of the square
    area = side_length**2

    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, let's consider the equality $AB=0$. This happens if and only if $A=0$ or $B=0$. So, we can split the original equation into two cases: 

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first case, we have $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These two equations describe a square with side length 10.

For the second case, we have $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These two equations describe a square with side length 8.

The intersection of the two squares is a square with side length 8, which is completely inside the larger square. So the area of the convex polygon is the area of the larger square minus the area of the smaller square.

The area of a square with side length $a$ is $a^2$, so the area of the larger square is $10^2 = 100$, and the area of the smaller square is $8^2 = 64$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $100 - 64 = 36$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 36. The answer is: $36$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, we need to find the points that satisfy the equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the points $(5,5)$, $(-5,-5)$, $(5,-5)$, and $(-5,5)$.
3. If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So we have the points $(8,8)$, $(-8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.
4. The points that satisfy the original equation are the union of the points from step 2 and step 3, which are $(5,5)$, $(-5,-5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, $(8,8)$, $(-8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.
5. These points form a rectangle with side lengths 10 and 16, so the area of the rectangle is $10 \times 16 = 160$.

The answer is: $\boxed{160}$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, we notice that the equation is of the form $A \cdot B = 0$. This means that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$.

2. Let's denote $A = ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$ and $B = ((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. So either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$.

3. If $A = 0$, then $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. The only way this equation can be true is if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This is the equation of a square with side length 20, centered at the origin.

4. If $B = 0$, then $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. The only way this equation can be true is if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This is the equation of a square with side length 16, also centered at the origin.

5. The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for. The area of this polygon is the area of the smaller square (since it's entirely contained within the larger square).

6. The area of a square is side length squared. The side length of the smaller square is 16, so its area is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

So the Python code to calculate the area of the convex polygon is as follows:
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is $\boxed{256}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The given equation is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

In mathematics, the product of two factors is zero if and only if at least one of the factors is zero. So, we have two possibilities:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

Now, consider the first case:
$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. This gives us two lines: $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.
Similarly, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

Similarly, for the second case:
$(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which gives us two lines: $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.
The intersection of these lines with the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$ also forms a square with side length 10. The area of this square is also $10^2 = 100$.

Therefore, the total area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of these two squares, which is $100 + 100 = 200$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 200. The answer is: $200$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Step 1: Observe that the equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
The only way for both absolute values to be equal to 10 is if $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.
These four equations can be solved to obtain the vertices of the square: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$.

Step 2: Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
This means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$, giving us four more vertices of the square: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

Step 3: Combining both sets of vertices, we have a square with side length of 16.
To find the area of the square, simply square the length of one of its sides: $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units.
The answer is: $256$
