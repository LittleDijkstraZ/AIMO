Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. If you notice, this problem is an equation of two algebraic geometric shapes. Hence, to solve this, we have to find the points where these shapes intersects.

2. The shapes are two circles: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

3. The first equation's center is at the origin (0,0) and its radius is 10.

4. The second equation's center is at (8,8) and its radius is 8.

5. Now, the area of this polygon is the area of the first circle plus the area of the second circle.

6. Since these are two circles, the area of the polygon is $2\pi r^2$.

Let's calculate the area:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import pi, symbols

def calculate_area():
    r1 = 10
    r2 = 8

    # calculate the area of the polygon
    area = 2 * pi * (r1**2 + r2**2)

    return area

result = calculate_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 328*pi

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
328*pi
```
The area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{328\pi}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, we need to understand the meaning of the equation. The equation is satisfied if and only if either of the following conditions is met:

1. $(|x + y| - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(|x| - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(|y| - 8)^2 = 0$
2. $(|x - y| - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(|x| - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(|y| - 8)^2 = 0$

The first condition is satisfied if and only if $x = y = 8$. The second condition is satisfied if and only if $x = -y = 8$. Therefore, the points satisfying the equation are $(8, 8)$ and $(-8, 8)$.

The area of the convex polygon is $0$, because the two points form a line segment and a line segment has $0$ area.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import *

def calculate_area():
    # The points satisfying the equation are (8, 8) and (-8, 8)
    x1, y1 = 8, 8
    x2, y2 = -8, 8

    # Calculate the area of the convex polygon
    area = abs(x1*y2 - x2*y1)

    return area

result = calculate_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 128

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
128
```
The area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{0}$ square units.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, we need to consider two cases because of the absolute values in the equation.

1. For $x + y \ge 0$ and $x - y \ge 0$, the equation becomes:

$$((\sqrt{(x + y)^2} - 10)^2 + (\sqrt{(x - y)^2} - 10)^2)((\sqrt{x^2} - 8)^2 + (\sqrt{y^2} - 8)^2) = 0$$

2. For $x + y < 0$ or $x - y < 0$, one of the absolute value expressions will be negative, which is not possible. So we can ignore this case.

Now let's simplify the equation:

$$((x + y - 10)^2 + (x - y - 10)^2)((x^2 - 8)^2 + (y^2 - 8)^2) = 0$$

Each term in the product should be zero:

$$(x + y - 10)^2 = 0$$
$$(x - y - 10)^2 = 0$$
$$(x^2 - 8)^2 = 0$$
$$(y^2 - 8)^2 = 0$$

Solving these equations:

$$x + y = 10$$
$$x - y = 10$$
$$x^2 = 8$$
$$y^2 = 8$$

The solutions are:

$$x = \sqrt{8}, -\sqrt{8}$$
$$y = \sqrt{8}, -\sqrt{8}$$

So the points are $(\sqrt{8}, \sqrt{8}), (\sqrt{8}, -\sqrt{8}), (-\sqrt{8}, \sqrt{8}), (-\sqrt{8}, -\sqrt{8})$. These points form a square with side length $2\sqrt{8}$, and the area is $(2\sqrt{8})^2 = 32$.

So the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{32}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, notice that the expression is equal to 0 if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. 

2. Each of these equations corresponds to a pair of lines in the coordinate plane, so the points satisfying the equation are the intersections of these lines.

3. To find the intersections, we can solve each equation separately. 

4. For $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. This gives us two lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$. 

5. Similarly, for $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which gives us two lines $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.

6. For $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$, which gives us two lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$. 

7. For $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us two lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

8. The intersections of these lines form a rectangle. 

9. To find the dimensions of the rectangle, we can find the distances between the intersection points. 

10. The horizontal distance is the difference between the $x$-coordinates of the intersection points, which is $8 - (-8) = 16$. 

11. The vertical distance is the difference between the $y$-coordinates of the intersection points, which is $8 - (-8) = 16$. 

12. Therefore, the area of the rectangle is $16 \times 16 = 256$. 

So, the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{256}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The given equation is a product of two expressions equals to zero. Hence, either of the expressions should be equal to zero. Let's look at these expressions:

1. $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$
2. $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$

For the first expression to be equal to zero, both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)$ should be equal to zero. This gives us two pairs of equations:

a. $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$
b. $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$

Solving these pairs of equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(5,5)$ and $(-5,-5)$.

For the second expression to be equal to zero, both $(\vert x \vert - 8)$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)$ should be equal to zero. This gives us another pair of equations:

c. $x = 8$ and $y = 8$

Solving these pair of equations, we get another vertex of the polygon as $(8,8)$.

Hence, the polygon has vertices at $(5,5)$, $(-5,-5)$, and $(8,8)$. This is an equilateral triangle, and its area can be calculated as $\frac{1}{2} \times base \times height$. The base of the triangle can be calculated as the distance between $(5,5)$ and $(-5,-5)$, which is $\sqrt{(5 - (-5))^2 + (5 - (-5))^2} = 10\sqrt{2}$. The height of the triangle can be calculated as the distance between $(5,5)$ and $(8,8)$, which is $\sqrt{(5 - 8)^2 + (5 - 8)^2} = 3\sqrt{2}$.

So, the area of the polygon is $\frac{1}{2} \times 10\sqrt{2} \times 3\sqrt{2} = 30$ square units.

So the answer is $\boxed{30}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, notice that if either $||x| - 8| = 0$ or $||y| - 8| = 0$, we get that $x, y \in [-8, 8]$. 

Next, we are looking at $||x \pm y| - 10| = 0$, meaning that $x + y, x - y$ are in $[-10, 10]$. 

But if $x, y \in [-8, 8]$, it's trivial to see that both $x + y$ and $x - y$ are in $[-16, 16]$.

So all points are enclosed by $[-16, 16]^2$, a 256*256 square. 

However, we can see that we discard points which make either of $||x| - 8|$ or $||y| - 8|$ non-zero, which are points outside $[-8, 8]^2$. And if a point is strictly inside $[-8, 8]^2$, it will be kept as long as $||x + y| - 10| = 0$ or $||x - y| - 10| = 0$. 

The latter happens if and only if $x + y, x - y \in [-10, 10]$, which is a smaller square $[-10, 10]^2$ inscribed in $[-8, 8]^2$. 

Therefore the polygon we are looking for is $[-16, 16]^2$ minus $[0, 16]^2$ (the right half), $[0, -16]^2$ (the lower half) and $[-16, 0]^2$ (the left half), which is $[-16, 16]^2$ minus 3 times $[-16, 16]^2$ one quadrant, and hence is 7/8 of $[-16, 16]^2$. 

The polygon is non-convex but its area can still be computed. The area of $[-16, 16]^2$ is $256 * 256 = 2^{14}$, and the area of $[-16, 16]^2$ one quadrant is $16 * 16 = 2^{10}$.

Therefore, the area of the polygon is $2^{14} - 3 * 2^{10} = 2^{10} * (2^4 - 3) = 2^{10} * 13 = \boxed{16384}$.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We are asked to find the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points that satisfy the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. 

2. This equation is equal to zero if and only if at least one of the factors is equal to zero. 

3. Therefore, we can find the boundary of the polygon by solving the equations $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. 

4. Solving these equations, we get $x + y = \pm 10$, $x - y = \pm 10$, $x = \pm 8$, and $y = \pm 8$. 

5. These equations represent the sides of the polygon. We can find the vertices by solving the system of equations formed by the intersection of these lines. 

6. The polygon has 8 vertices, and we can find them by solving the system of equations formed by the intersection of the lines $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. 

7. The area of the polygon can be found by calculating the area of the convex polygon formed by these vertices. 

8. Since the polygon is symmetric with respect to the x-axis and y-axis, we can find the area of the polygon by finding the area of one of the triangles formed by the intersection of the lines $x + y = 10$, $x - y = 10$, $x = 8$, and $y = 8$ and then multiplying it by 4. 

9. The vertices of this triangle are $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, and $(4, 0)$. 

10. The area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot 8 \cdot 4 = 16$. 

11. Therefore, the area of the polygon is $4 \cdot 16 = 64$. 

So the answer is $\boxed{64}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



If $A * B = 0$ then $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. So in the expression 

$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$$

Either the first product is equal to 0 or the second product is equal to 0. 

This means that the points that satisfy the equation are the points that satisfy 

1) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or
2) $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or
3) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or
4) $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

Let's analyze each equation:

1) $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ means that $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$
2) $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ means that $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$
3) $\vert x \vert = 8$ means that $x = 8$ or $x = -8$
4) $\vert y \vert = 8$ means that $y = 8$ or $y = -8$

So the points that satisfy the equation are the points that satisfy the above equations. 

If we plot these points on a plane, we'll get a square with side length 16 (since the points satisfy $x = 8$ or $x = -8$ and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$). The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. 

So, the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{256}$.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. Let's denote $A = |x + y|$ and $B = |x - y|$. The equation becomes $((A - 10)^2 + (B - 10)^2)((A - 8)^2 + (B - 8)^2) = 0$. The solutions are given by:

   a) $(A - 10)^2 + (B - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies $A = B = 10$, i.e. $x = y$.
   
   b) $(A - 8)^2 + (B - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies $A = B = 8$, i.e. $x = \pm 8$ or $y = \pm 8$.
   
   For $A = B = 10$, we get the equation of the line $y = x$.
   
   For $A = B = 8$, we get the equations of the lines $y = x \pm 8$ and $y = -x \pm 8$.

2. The intersection points are obtained by solving the system of equations $y = x$ and $y = x \pm 8$, and the system of equations $y = x$ and $y = -x \pm 8$. The intersection points are $(0, 0)$, $(8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$.

3. To find the area of the convex polygon, we use the shoelace formula. The vertices of the polygon are $(0, 0)$, $(8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$.

Let's calculate the area using the shoelace formula:

The shoelace formula states that if the vertices of a polygon are $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), \ldots, (x_n, y_n)$, then the area of the polygon is given by

\[
A = \frac{1}{2} |(x_1y_2 + x_2y_3 + \ldots + x_{n-1}y_n + x_ny_1) - (y_1x_2 + y_2x_3 + \ldots + y_{n-1}x_n + y_nx_1)|.
\]

Applying this formula to our polygon, we get

\[
A = \frac{1}{2} |(0 \cdot 8 + 8 \cdot -8 + -8 \cdot -8 + 8 \cdot -8 + -8 \cdot 8) - (8 \cdot 8 + -8 \cdot -8 + -8 \cdot 8 + 8 \cdot -8 + 0 \cdot 8)| = \frac{1}{2} |0 - 0| = 0.
\]

So, the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{0}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



We are asked to find the area of a convex polygon enclosed by the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equation 

$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$

Notice that this equation is satisfied if and only if at least one of the following two conditions is met:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which is equivalent to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which is equivalent to $\vert x \vert = 8$.

In other words, each point $(x, y)$ that satisfies the equation must belong to either the vertical lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$ or the lines $y = 10 - x$ and $y = x - 10$. Plotting these lines, we find that the area of the enclosed polygon is the sum of the areas of two triangles and a square.

The sides of the square are $10$, so the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$. The base of each triangle is $10$, and the height is $8$, so the area of each triangle is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot 10 \cdot 8 = 40$. Therefore, the total area of the polygon is $100 + 40 + 40 = 180$.

Finally, remember to print the result:

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The equation we have is:
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0\]

2. The area of a polygon is given by the integral of the function inside the integral, so we have:
\[A = \iint ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) dx dy\]

3. The equation is true if either of the factors is zero. So, we have two cases:

   a. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
   
   b. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

4. The solution to each case will be the vertices of the polygon.

5. For the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This is the equation of a square with side length $10$ centered at the origin. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

6. For the second case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This is the equation of a square with side length $8$ centered at the origin. The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$.

7. The area of the polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares, which is $100 + 64 = 164$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{164}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The given condition is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

First, let's consider the equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
This equation is satisfied if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
These conditions give us two pairs of lines: $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.

Next, let's consider the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This equation is satisfied if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
These conditions give us four lines: $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

The points that satisfy both conditions are the intersections of the lines.
These points form a square with side length 16.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $16^2 = \boxed{256}$.

In Python, we can't directly calculate the area of the polygon, but we can still verify that the points form a square.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The given equation has two factors and the product of these factors is zero. That means either of the factors can be zero. We can write down two separate equations from each factor being zero:

1) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From the first equation we get $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and from the second we get $\vert x \vert = 8$. We need to note that the variables $x$ and $y$ are absolute values and that means they are non-negative. So the solutions from these two equations are $x + y = 10$ and $x = 8$. 

2) $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

Similarly, from the first equation we get $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and from the second we get $\vert y \vert = 8$. Again, $x$ and $y$ are absolute values and they are non-negative. So the solutions from these two equations are $x - y = 10$ and $y = 8$.

We now have four separate equations, but they are all line equations. If we plot these lines on a graph, we would see that they enclose a rectangle. The dimensions of the rectangle are given by the intercepts of the lines on the axes. The length of the rectangle is given by the difference of the $x$-intercepts which is $8 - (-8) = 16$ and the width of the rectangle is given by the difference of the $y$-intercepts which is $10 - (-10) = 20$.

Therefore, the area of the rectangle is given by the product of its length and width which is $16 \times 20 = 320$. 

So the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{320}$.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We can see that the function $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ if and only if $x = \pm10$ and $y = \pm10$. Thus, we know that the convex polygon has sides parallel to x- and y-axis.

2. The function $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ if and only if $x = \pm8$ and $y = \pm8$. Therefore, the polygon has 4 corners at points $\pm(8,8)$ and $\pm(8,-8)$.

3. Now, let's calculate the area of the polygon: we can split it into two rectangles and subtract the area of the intersection (which is also a rectangle).

4. The first rectangle has dimensions $16 \times 16$, so its area is $256$.

5. The second rectangle has dimensions $16 \times 8$, so its area is $128$.

6. The intersection area is a square with side length $8$, so its area is $64$.

7. Adding up the areas of the two rectangles and subtracting the area of the intersection, we get $256 + 128 - 64 = 320$.

The answer is $\boxed{320}$.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. To determine the area of the convex polygon, we first need to find the vertices of the polygon. The points that satisfy the given equation are the vertices of the polygon.

2. The given equation is of the form $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. A product of two terms is zero if and only if at least one of the terms is zero. This gives us two cases to consider.

3. If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon.

4. If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon.

5. Now, we need to calculate the area of the polygon. For a square, the area is the product of the length of two adjacent sides. Since the polygon is symmetric with respect to the x-axis and y-axis, we can just calculate the area of one of the triangles formed by the vertices and multiply it by 4 to get the area of the polygon.

Here is a Python script that solves the problem:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solve, Abs

def find_vertices():
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # Case 1: (|x + y| - 10)^2 + (|x - y| - 10)^2 = 0
    vertices1 = solve([Abs(x + y) - 10, Abs(x - y) - 10])

    # Case 2: (|x| - 8)^2 + (|y| - 8)^2 = 0
    vertices2 = solve([Abs(x) - 8, Abs(y) - 8])

    return vertices1, vertices2

vertices1, vertices2 = find_vertices()

# Calculate the area of the polygon
area = 4 * (vertices1[0][0] - vertices1[1][0]) * (vertices1[0][1] - vertices1[1][1])
print(area)
```

CODE RESULTS Traceback: line 21, in <module>
    area = 4 * (vertices1[0][0] - vertices1[1][0]) * (vertices1[0][1] - vertices1[1][1])
KeyError: 0

FAIL


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

    area = 4 * (vertices1[0][0] - vertices1[1][0]) * (vertices1[0][1] - vertices1[1][1])

FAIL

```
The key error occurs because vertices1 and vertices2 are empty lists. This is because the equations we set up are not solvable using sympy's `solve` function. The `solve` function is not able to find a symbolic solution for these equations, which is required to calculate the area of the polygon.

The given equations are non-linear absolute value equations. Solving such equations analytically is generally not possible, especially when the absolute value is involved in multiple terms. In such cases, it is recommended to use numerical methods to find the solution. However, Python does not have a built-in function to solve such equations numerically.

In summary, the area of the convex polygon cannot be determined using sympy's `solve` function. We need to use a numerical method to solve these equations.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. Notice the absolute value expressions in the problem, we can convert them to conditions by using sympy's Piecewise function. So, the problem can be simplified to the area enclosed by $((x + y - 10)^2 + (x - y - 10)^2)( (x - 8)^2 + (y - 8)^2) = 0$, which implies that either $(x + y - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(x - y - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(x - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(y - 8)^2 = 0$.

2. Using sympy, we can define the Piecewise functions for the absolute value expressions. For simplicity, we will assume x and y are both non-negative. 

3. Then, we can set up a grid to calculate the area of the polygon. Notice that the conditions are all linear, so we can calculate the area by summing up the areas of the triangles and rectangles formed by the intersections of the conditions.

Now, let's implement the solution in Python:

```python

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. Since $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ are nonnegative for all real numbers $x$ and $y$, we have $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ if and only if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. Similarly, since $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2$ are nonnegative for all real numbers $x$ and $y$, we have $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ if and only if both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
3. Therefore, the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if and only if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, or both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
4. This means the points satisfying the equation are either of the form $(x, 10 - x)$ or $(8, 8)$, which form a line segment.
5. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon enclosed by these points is the area of the line segment, which is 0.

To solve this problem, we can use python and the sympy library to compute the area of the convex polygon.

First, let's import the necessary libraries and define the equations:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Abs

def calculate_area():
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # Define the equations
    eq1 = Abs(x + y) - 10

    eq3 = Abs(x) - 8
    eq4 = Abs(y) - 8

    # Solve the equations
    solutions1 = [(x_val, 10 - x_val) for x_val in range(-10, 11) if eq1.subs(x, x_val) == 0]
    solutions2 = [(8, 8)]

    # Combine the solutions
    solutions = solutions1 + solutions2

    # Calculate the area of the convex polygon
    area = 0
    for i in range(len(solutions)):
        x1, y1 = solutions[i]
        if i == len(solutions) - 1 or solutions[i + 1] == (x1, y1):
            area += 0
        else:
            x2, y2 = solutions[i + 1]
            area += 0

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, let's denote $A = |x + y| - 10$, $B = |x - y| - 10$, $C = |x| - 8$ and $D = |y| - 8$.

The equation is now $(A^2 + B^2)(C^2 + D^2) = 0$. For the product of two terms to be zero, at least one of them must be zero. So, we have two cases:

Case 1: $A^2 + B^2 = 0$

Case 2: $C^2 + D^2 = 0$

In the first case, we have:
$A = |x + y| - 10 = 0$ and $B = |x - y| - 10 = 0$

In the second case, we have:
$C = |x| - 8 = 0$ and $D = |y| - 8 = 0$

For the absolute value $|x|$ to be equal to 8, $x$ must be either 8 or -8. The same applies to $y$. 

This means we have a rectangle with vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$. 

The area of this rectangle is $8 \times 16 = 128$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{128}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, we should rewrite the given equation in a more familiar form. Notice that we can write the left hand side as $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
2. We know that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Thus, we have four cases to consider: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, and $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
3. Solving these equations, we get four lines in the plane: $x + y = 10$, $x - y = 10$, $x = 8$, and $y = 8$. These lines divide the plane into nine regions.
4. We need to find the area of the convex polygon enclosed by these lines. The vertices of this polygon are the intersection points of these lines, which are $(0, 10)$, $(10, 0)$, $(8, 2)$, $(6, 4)$, $(4, 6)$, $(2, 8)$, $(-8, 18)$, $(-10, 20)$, $(-18, 30)$, and $(-20, 40)$.
5. The area of this polygon is the sum of the areas of the triangles formed by these vertices. We can use the Shoelace Formula to calculate the area of each triangle.
6. The Shoelace Formula states that if the coordinates of the vertices of a polygon are given in counterclockwise order, and the vertices are $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), \ldots, (x_n, y_n)$, then the area of the polygon is given by $\frac{1}{2} \vert (x_1y_2 + x_2y_3 + \cdots + x_ny_1) - (y_1x_2 + y_2x_3 + \cdots + y_nx_1) \vert$.
7. Applying the Shoelace Formula to each triangle, we find that the area of the convex polygon is $240$.

Here is a Python script that computes the area of the convex polygon:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Abs

def shoelace_formula(vertices):
    x, y = symbols('x y')
    area = Abs(sum(vertices[i][0]*vertices[i+1][1] - vertices[i][1]*vertices[i+1][0] for i in range(len(vertices))) / 2)
    return area

vertices = [(0, 10), (10, 0), (8, 2), (6, 4), (4, 6), (2, 8), (-8, 18), (-10, 20), (-18, 30), (-20, 40)]
area = shoelace_formula(vertices)
print(area)
```

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is the product of two terms, and the product of two terms is zero if and only if at least one of the terms is zero. Therefore, the points that satisfy the given equation are the union of the points that satisfy $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and the points that satisfy $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

We can analyze the two terms separately:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$

This term is zero if and only if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The absolute value equations can be split into two cases for each, resulting in a total of four cases. However, after analyzing these cases, we find that in all cases the solutions are symmetric with respect to the x and y axes, which means that the points form a square with side length 20. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.

2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

This term is zero if and only if both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. Again, the absolute value equations can be split into two cases for each, resulting in a total of four cases. After analyzing these cases, we find that in all cases the solutions are symmetric with respect to the x and y axes, which means that the points form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon formed by the union of the points that satisfy either of the given equations is $400 + 256 = 656$. So, the answer is $\boxed{656}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Step 1: Notice that the problem asks to find the area of a polygon, which is a geometric figure with many sides. So the equation given, which seems to be a product of two terms equals zero, should lead us to identify points where either term equals zero.

Step 2: The first term $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ equals zero if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

Step 3: The second term $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2$ equals zero if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

Step 4: Let's analyze these conditions. For the first term, we have four possibilities: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$. These are the equations of four lines.

Step 5: For the second term, we have $x = 8$ and $y = 8$, which are the equations of two lines parallel to the x and y axes, respectively, at a distance of 8 units from the origin.

Step 6: We are looking for the points that satisfy both conditions. We can draw these lines on a graph and find the intersection points. These intersection points will be the vertices of the polygon.

Step 7: Finally, we can calculate the area of the polygon using the coordinates of the vertices. 

Let's now implement this in Python using the `sympy` library.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solve, simplify

def calculate_area():
    # Define the variables
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # Define the equations
    eq1 = (abs(x + y) - 10)**2 + (abs(x - y) - 10)**2
    eq2 = (abs(x) - 8)**2 + (abs(y) - 8)**2

    # Find the intersection points
    solutions = solve((eq1, eq2), (x, y))

    # Calculate the area
    area = simplify(abs(0.5 * sum(solutions[i][0] * solutions[i][1] - solutions[i-1][0] * solutions[i-1][1] for i in range(1, len(solutions)))))

    return area

result = calculate_area()
print(result)
