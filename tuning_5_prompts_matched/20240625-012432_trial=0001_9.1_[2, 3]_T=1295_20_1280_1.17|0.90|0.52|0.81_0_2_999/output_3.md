Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First we note that the expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ if and only if $|x+y|=10$ and $|x-y|=10$.
2. The equations $|x+y|=10$ and $|x-y|=10$ are equivalent to the four equations $x+y=10$, $x+y=-10$, $x-y=10$, and $x-y=-10$. These form a rectangle with vertices at $(0, 10), (10, 0), (0, -10)$ and $(-10, 0)$.
3. The expression $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ if and only if $|x|=8$ and $|y|=8$. This means $x=8$ or $x=-8$, and $y=8$ or $y=-8$. So we get a square with side length 16 and vertices at $(8,8), (8,-8), (-8,8)$ and $(-8,-8)$.
4. The intersection of these two figures is a smaller square with side length 10 and vertices at $(0,8), (0,-8), (8,0)$ and $(-8,0)$.
5. The area of this square is $10^2=100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 100. Now we will use python to calculate the answer.

```python

def polygon_area():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    # The side length of the smaller square is 10
    side_length = 10

    # The area of a square is side length squared
    area = side_length ** 2

    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

The area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is $\boxed{100}$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
For this equation to be equal to zero, either the first or the second set of parentheses must be equal to zero.

The first set of parentheses being zero means $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These equations describe a square with side length 10, centered at the origin.

The second set of parentheses being zero means $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These equations describe a square with side length 16, centered at the origin.

However, the first square is completely contained within the second square, so the area of the convex polygon is the area of the larger square minus the area of the smaller square. The area of a square is given by side length squared, so the area of the smaller square is $10^2 = 100$, and the area of the larger square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $256 - 100 = 156$. The answer is: 156.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The expression $A \cdot B = 0$ means that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. So we can set each of the terms inside the parentheses equal to zero and solve for the points that satisfy the equation.

There are two cases:
1) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These equations describe a square with side length 20 and its vertices are $(0, 10), (10, 0), (0, -10), (-10, 0)$.
2) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This describes a square with side length 16 and its vertices are $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$.

The intersection of these two squares forms a smaller square with side length 10 (the smaller of the side lengths of the two squares) and its vertices are $(0, 5), (5, 0), (0, -5), (-5, 0)$.

The area of the square is $10^2 = 100$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The expression $ ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0 $ is a product of two factors. This product equals to zero if and only if at least one of the factors equals to zero.

2. Hence, either $ ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0 $ or $ ((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0 $.

3. The first equation $ ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0 $ implies that both $ \vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0 $ and $ \vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0 $, or in other words, $ \vert x + y \vert = 10 $ and $ \vert x - y \vert = 10 $. These equations describe a square with side length $ 10\sqrt{2} $.

4. The second equation $ ((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0 $ implies that both $ \vert x \vert - 8 = 0 $ and $ \vert y \vert - 8 = 0 $, or in other words, $ \vert x \vert = 8 $ and $ \vert y \vert = 8 $. These equations describe a square with side length $ 16 $.

5. The intersection of the two squares is a square with side length $ 10\sqrt{2} - 8 $, because the smaller square is entirely contained in the larger one.

6. The area of the convex polygon is thus the area of the larger square minus the area of the smaller square:

    $$ (10\sqrt{2})^2 - (10\sqrt{2} - 8)^2 $$
    $$ = 200 - (200 - 160\sqrt{2} + 64) $$
    $$ = 160\sqrt{2} - 136 $$

However, this is not a positive integer, but a positive real number. There must be a mistake in the calculations, so let's review our steps.

7. The mistake is in step 5, where we stated that the intersection of the two squares is a square with side length $ 10\sqrt{2} - 8 $. However, this is not accurate, because the smaller square can't be entirely contained in the larger one. Instead, the intersection of the two squares is a square with side length $ 8\sqrt{2} $.

8. Let's correct the calculation based on this correction:

    $$ (10\sqrt{2})^2 - (8\sqrt{2})^2 $$
    $$ = 200 - 128 $$
    $$ = 72 $$

So the area of the convex polygon is $72$ square units.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import sqrt

def calculate_area():
    # Side length of the larger square
    side_large = 10*sqrt(2)

    # Side length of the smaller square
    side_small = 8*sqrt(2)

    # Area of the larger square
    area_large = side_large**2

    # Area of the smaller square
    area_small = side_small**2

    # Area of the convex polygon
    area = area_large - area_small

    return area

result = calculate_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 72

The area of the convex polygon is $72$ square units. So the correct final numerical answer is 72.
The answer is: $\boxed{72}$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the given equation equals zero if and only if at least one of the following two equations equals zero:
1. $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$
2. $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$

The second equation equals zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = 8$ or $x = -8$ and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. This gives us a square with side length $16$ and area $256$.

The first equation equals zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us two cases:
Case 1: $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$. Solving this system of equations gives $x = 10$ and $y = 0$.
Case 2: $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$. Solving this system of equations gives $x = -10$ and $y = 0$.
So, the points that satisfy the first equation are $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, and $(0, -10)$. This gives us a square with side length $20$ and area $400$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $256 + 400 = 656$.

```python

    # Area of the square formed by the points that satisfy (|x| - 8)^2 + (|y| - 8)^2 = 0

Assistant:

 The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if both of the following conditions are met:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the convex polygon: $(8,2)$, $(8,-2)$, $(-8,2)$, and $(-8,-2)$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. 

The points $\left(x, y\right)$ that satisfy both conditions form a square with side length $16$. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So the area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$

 The given equation is a product of two terms, each of which must be equal to zero for the product to be zero. Therefore, we have two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From case 1, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$. These are four lines in the plane.

From case 2, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = 8$ or $x = -8$ and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. These are four lines in the plane.

The intersection points of these lines are the vertices of the polygon. By solving these equations, we find that the vertices of the polygon are $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

The polygon is a square with side length 16. The area of a square is the square of its side length, so the area of the polygon is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The expression is equal to 0 if either the first factor is 0 or the second factor is 0.
2. The first factor is 0 when $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. This gives us $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
3. The second factor is 0 when $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. This gives us $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The equation is equal to zero if and only if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This means that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
For $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, the possible solutions are $(x, y) = (8, 2)$ or $(x, y) = (-8, -2)$, $(8, -2)$ or $(x, y) = (-8, 2)$, $(2, 8)$ or $(x, y) = (-2, -8)$, and $(2, -8)$ or $(x, y) = (-2, 8)$.
For $\vert x \vert = 8$, the possible solutions are $(x, y) = (8, y)$ or $(x, y) = (-8, y)$.
Similarly, for $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, the possible solutions are $(x, y) = (x, 2)$ or $(x, y) = (x, -2)$.
And for $\vert y \vert = 8$, the possible solutions are $(x, y) = (x, 8)$ or $(x, y) = (x, -8)$.
Combining all these possibilities, we find that the points satisfying the equation are $(8, 2)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(2, 8)$, $(-2, -8)$, $(2, -8)$, and $(-2, 8)$.
These points form a square with side length 16, so the area of the convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$
