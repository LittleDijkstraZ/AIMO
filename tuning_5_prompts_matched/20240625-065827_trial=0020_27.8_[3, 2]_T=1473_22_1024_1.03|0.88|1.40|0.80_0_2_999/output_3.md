 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. Therefore, either the first term is zero, or the second term is zero. 

The first term is zero when either $|x+y| = 10$ or $|x-y| = 10$. These are the equations of two lines in the plane, so they form a parallelogram. The distance between the parallel lines $|x+y| = 10$ and $|x-y| = 10$ is $20$, and the sides of the parallelogram are $20\sqrt{2}$ (distance from $(0,0)$ to the line $|x+y| = 10$), so the area of the parallelogram is $20 \times 20\sqrt{2} = 400\sqrt{2}$.

The second term is zero when either $|x| = 8$ or $|y| = 8$. These are the equations of two lines in the plane, so they form a square. The side of the square is $16$, so the area of the square is $16 \times 16 = 256$.

The convex polygon formed by the intersection of the two regions is the intersection of the parallelogram and the square. This intersection is a smaller parallelogram, formed by the intersection of the sides of the parallelogram and the square. The sides of this smaller parallelogram are $16\sqrt{2}$ and $16$, so its area is $16 \times 16\sqrt{2} = 256\sqrt{2}$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the parallelogram and the square minus twice the area of the smaller parallelogram: $400\sqrt{2} + 256 - 2 \times 256\sqrt{2} = 400\sqrt{2} + 256 - 512\sqrt{2}$.

To simplify this, we can combine like terms: $400\sqrt{2} - 512\sqrt{2} + 256 = (400-512)\sqrt{2} + 256 = -112\sqrt{2} + 256$.

However, this is not a valid area, as area cannot be negative. It seems we made a mistake in our calculation. Let's reevaluate the problem.

The first term of the equation is zero when either $|x+y| = 10$ or $|x-y| = 10$. These are the equations of two lines in the plane, so they form a parallelogram. The distance between the parallel lines $|x+y| = 10$ and $|x-y| = 10$ is $20$, and the sides of the parallelogram are $20\sqrt{2}$ (distance from $(0,0)$ to the line $|x+y| = 10$), so the area of the parallelogram is $20 \times 20\sqrt{2} = 400\sqrt{2}$.

The second term of the equation is zero when either $|x| = 8$ or $|y| = 8$. These are the equations of two lines in the plane, so they form a square. The side of the square is $16$, so the area of the square is $16 \times 16 = 256$.

The convex polygon formed by the intersection of the two regions is the union of the parallelogram and the square. This union is a larger parallelogram, formed by the sides of the parallelogram and the square. The sides of this larger parallelogram are $20\sqrt{2}$ and $16$, so its area is $20\sqrt{2} \times 16 = 320\sqrt{2}$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of the larger parallelogram: $320\sqrt{2}$.
The answer is: $320\sqrt{2}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The condition $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.

Solving these equations, we find four solutions: $(x, y) = (5, 5), (-5, -5), (5, -5), (-5, 5)$.

Similarly, the condition $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

Solving these equations, we find four solutions: $(x, y) = (8, 8), (-8, -8), (8, -8), (-8, 8)$.

The points satisfying both conditions are the intersections of the two sets of solutions.

The convex polygon formed by these points is a square with side length 10. Therefore, its area is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 100.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def calculate_area():
    # Side length of the square
    side_length = 10

    # Area of the square
    area = side_length ** 2

    return area

result = calculate_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 100

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
100
```
The area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$.

The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. This expression is zero if and only if both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
The solutions to these equations are all points $(x, y)$ that are at a distance of 10 units from the origin in the $x+y$ and $x-y$ directions, respectively. These form a square with side length 20 units, centered at the origin.

The second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. This expression is zero if and only if both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The solutions to these equations are all points $(x, y)$ that are at a distance of 8 units from the origin in the x and y directions, respectively. These form a square with side length 16 units, centered at the origin.

The convex polygon formed by the points satisfying the given equation is the intersection of these two squares. This intersection is another square, with side length equal to the smaller side length, which is 8 units.

The area of a square with side length $s$ is $s^2$, so the area of the convex polygon is $8^2 = 64$ square units.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 64 square units. The answer is: $64$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The expression $A = ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

These equations are equivalent to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The equations $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ define squares with side length 10 centered at the origin. The equations $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ define squares with side length 16 centered at the origin.

The intersection of these squares is a square with side length 10 centered at the origin. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. So, the area of the convex polygon is $100$.

The answer is: $100$

 The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is true if and only if at least one of the factors is zero. This happens if and only if either $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$. 

The equations $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$ represent 4 straight lines in the plane, which form a square with side length 16. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$.

The answer is: $256$

Here is a Python program that calculates the area:
```python

 To solve this problem, we first need to understand the properties of absolute value and how it relates to the given equation. The absolute value function $|x|$ returns the non-negative value of $x$. So, $|x+y|=0$ or $|x-y|=0$ or $|x|=0$ or $|y|=0$ would make the whole left-hand side of the equation equals to zero.

From $|x+y|=0$, we have $x+y=0$, so $y=-x$.
From $|x-y|=0$, we have $x-y=0$, so $y=x$.
From $|x|=0$, we have $x=0$.
From $|y|=0$, we have $y=0$.

Combining these results, we find that the points that satisfy the equation are $(0,0)$, $(0,10)$, $(10,0)$, and $(-10,0)$. These four points form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is side length squared, which is $10^2 = 100$. So the area of the convex polygon is 100.

The Python code to calculate the area of the square is:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    side_length = 10
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 100

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
100
```
The area of the convex polygon is 100 square units. The answer is: $100$
