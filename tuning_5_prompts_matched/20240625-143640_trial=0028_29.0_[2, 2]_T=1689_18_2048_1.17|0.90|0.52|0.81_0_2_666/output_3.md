Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The problem is asking for the area of a polygon enclosed by the set of points that satisfy a given equation. The equation is $$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$
If the product of two numbers is zero, then either one of them is zero. So, we have two cases to consider:
1. Either $$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$$ or $$(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0.$$
2. If $$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0,$$ then both $$\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$$ and $$\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0.$$ So, $$\vert x + y \vert = 10$$ and $$\vert x - y \vert = 10.$$ This implies that $$x + y = \pm 10$$ and $$x - y = \pm 10.$$ Solving these equations, we get the points as $$(5,5), (5,-5), (-5,5), (-5,-5).$$
3. If $$(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0,$$ then both $$\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$$ and $$\vert y \vert - 8 = 0.$$ So, $$\vert x \vert = 8$$ and $$\vert y \vert = 8.$$ This implies that $$x = \pm 8$$ and $$y = \pm 8.$$ The points are $$(8,8), (8,-8), (-8,8), (-8,-8).$$
The set of points that satisfy the given equation are the points that are either $$(5,5), (5,-5), (-5,5), (-5,-5)$$ or $$(8,8), (8,-8), (-8,8), (-8,-8).$$ These points form a square with side length $$10$$ (from $$(5,5)$$ to $$(5,-5)$$) or $$16$$ (from $$(8,8)$$ to $$(8,-8)$$). The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of the convex polygon is either $$10^2 = 100$$ or $$16^2 = 256.$$ However, since the side length of the square is determined by the equation $$\vert x \pm y \vert = 10,$$ the side length of the square is $$10,$$ and therefore the area of the convex polygon is $$100.$$

The answer is: $100$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:


The equation $AB = 0$ is equivalent to either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Thus, the given equation is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
Solving these equations gives us the following systems of equations:

1. $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
2. $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
3. $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
4. $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

The solutions to these systems give us the vertices of the polygon. By analyzing the possible combinations, we find that the polygon is a square with side length 16. Therefore, its area is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

This problem involves understanding the conditions under which the product of two expressions equals zero. The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ equals zero if either of the two factors equals zero. This gives us two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 \neq 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. Solving these equations gives us a square with side length 10 units.

2. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 \neq 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. Solving these equations gives us a square with side length 16 units.

The convex polygon formed by the points satisfying the given equation is the intersection of these two squares, which is also a square. The side length of this square is the smaller of the two side lengths, which is 10 units. The area of a square is the square of its side length, so the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. 

So, the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units.

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{100}$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:


The equation $A \cdot B = 0$ implies that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the given equation is satisfied if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. 
The first equation is satisfied if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives the vertices of a square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$.
The second equation is satisfied if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives the vertices of a square with side length $16$.
The two squares overlap at their centers, forming a larger square with side length $16$. The area of the convex polygon is the area of the larger square minus the area of the smaller square, which is $16^2 - 10\sqrt{2}^2 = 256 - 200 = 56$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Since the expression is equal to zero, one of the factors must be zero. Thus, the problem is equivalent to finding the points where each factor is zero.

1. The first factor is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This factor equals to zero when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This results in four lines: $x + y = \pm10$ and $x - y = \pm10$.

2. The second factor is $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This factor equals to zero when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This results in four lines: $x = \pm8$ and $y = \pm8$.

The intersection of these lines form a square with side length of 16 units. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. So the area of the convex polygon is 256.

The python code to calculate this:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{256}$.
The answer is: $\boxed{256}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The expression equals 0 if and only if at least one of the two factors equals 0. 

The two factors are:

$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$$
$$((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$$

For the first factor to be 0, we need both:
$$\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$$
$$\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$$
which simplifies to:
$$\vert x + y \vert = 10$$
$$\vert x - y \vert = 10$$

For the second factor to be 0, we need both:
$$\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$$
$$\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$$
which simplifies to:
$$\vert x \vert = 8$$
$$\vert y \vert = 8$$

The solutions for the first pair of equations are all points on a square with side length 20 centered at the origin. The solutions for the second pair of equations are all points in a square with side length 16 centered at the origin.

The intersection of these two sets of solutions is the convex polygon we are looking for. This polygon is also a square, and its side length is the smaller of the two side lengths, which is 16.

The area of a square is given by the square of its side length, so the area of the polygon is $16^2 = 256$.

The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, we notice that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of them is zero. Therefore, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. This implies $x + y = \pm 10$.
3. If $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies $x - y = \pm 10$.
4. If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$. This implies $x = \pm 8$.
5. If $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies $y = \pm 8$.
6. By solving these equations, we find that the points $(x, y)$ satisfying the original equation are: $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8), (10, 0), (0, 10), (-10, 0), (0, -10)$.
7. These points form a square with side length $16$. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

Thus, the area of the convex polygon is $256$. 

The script to compute the area of the square is simple, as shown below:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_square():
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = area_of_square()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is $\boxed{256}$.
