Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We are looking for the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions. This equation is equivalent to a piecewise function that consists of four linear segments.
2. The number of solutions of the equation is equal to the number of times the right-hand side $\frac{m}{100}$ intersects the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$.
3. To find the number of intersections, we need to find the values of $m$ for which $\frac{m}{100}$ intersects the function in exactly four points.
4. By analyzing the graph of the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, we find that it intersects the x-axis four times in the interval $[0, 2]$.
5. The maximum value of the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ in this interval is 2, so for the right-hand side $\frac{m}{100}$ to intersect the function in exactly four points, we need $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$.
6. Multiplying all sides of the inequalities by 100 gives $0 < m < 200$.
7. Since we are looking for the number of positive integers $m$ in this interval, the number of such integers is $200 - 1 = 199$.
8. However, we must exclude the cases where the intersection is not exactly four, which occurs when $\frac{m}{100} = 1$. There are two such cases: when $\frac{m}{100} = 1^-$ and $\frac{m}{100} = 1^+$.
9. So we need to subtract these two cases from the total, giving us $199 - 2 = 197$.

So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions is 197. Therefore, the solution to the problem is the positive integer 197.
The answer is: $197$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The absolute value equations $|x - 1| - 2 = \pm \frac{m}{100}$ will have 4 distinct solutions for $x$ if the right side of the equation is between $0$ and $2$. This means $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, and so $0 < m < 200$. So we just need to count the number of positive integers $m$ in this range.

To implement this, we can use Python's `range` function to count the number of integers from 1 to 199.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def count_m():
    return len(range(1, 200))

result = count_m()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 199

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
199
```

So, there are 199 positive integers $m$ for which the equation $||x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. The answer is: $199$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The given equation has four distinct solutions, which implies that the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, equals $\frac{m}{100}$ or $2 - \frac{m}{100}$ four times.

2. We know that the expression inside the absolute value is a V-shaped function, which means it has a maximum value of 2 and a minimum value of 0. Thus, for the equation to have four distinct solutions, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be strictly between 0 and 2. This implies $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which further implies $0 < m < 200$.

3. Also, since the absolute value function has a positive and negative case, each time the function inside the absolute value equals $\frac{m}{100}$ or $2 - \frac{m}{100}$, we should consider both cases. 

4. Therefore, the problem boils down to finding how many positive integers $m$ are there such that $0 < m < 200$, and $m/100$ and $2 - m/100$ are both positive.

5. This can be solved by a simple python script as follows:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def count_m():
    count = 0
    for m in range(1, 200):
        if 0 < m/100 < 2 and 0 < 2 - m/100 < 2:
            count += 1
    return count

result = count_m()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 199

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
199
```

So the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition is $199$.
The answer is: $199$
