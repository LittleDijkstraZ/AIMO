 This problem cannot be solved directly with programming because it requires symbolic manipulation to solve for the function $f$. However, we can use mathematical reasoning to find a solution.

We have the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.
Let's first solve the second equation for $f(100)$. We have $f(200)=2f(100)+1$.
Then, we substitute $f(200)$ into the first equation to get $f(f(f(200)))=8\cdot200-7$.
Since $f(200)=2f(100)+1$, we have $f(f(f(200)))=f(f(2f(100)+1))=8\cdot200-7$.
Now, let's solve the first equation for $f(2f(100)+1)$. We have $f(f(f(2f(100)+1)))=8(2f(100)+1)-7$.
Since $f(f(f(2f(100)+1)))=f(f(201))=8\cdot200-7$, we have $8(2f(100)+1)-7=8\cdot200-7$.
Solving this equation for $f(100)$, we get $f(100)=\frac{8\cdot200-7-16}{16}=\frac{1600-7-16}{16}=\frac{1577}{16}$.
Since $f(100)$ must be a natural number, we take the floor of $\frac{1577}{16}$, which is $98$.
Therefore, $f(100)=98$.
The answer is $\boxed{98}$.

Assistant:

 The problem seems to be complicated to solve with a direct approach, and even if a solution is found, it would be quite inefficient. Instead, we can notice a couple of important details:

1. The first equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ tells us that $f$ composed with itself three times equals $8n-7$. If we could find a function that composed with itself three times is the identity, then we could easily find $f(n)$ by setting $f(f(f(n)))=n$.

2. The second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ tells us that $f$ is an odd function. 

Now, let's define a function $g(n)$ such that $g(n)=f(2n)-1$. From the second equation, we know that $g(n)=2f(n)$. This gives us the important property that $f(n)=\frac{g(n)}{2}$.

By substituting $f(n)=\frac{g(n)}{2}$ into the first equation, we get:

$g(g(g(n/2)))=8n-11$.

Notice that $g(n)$ composed with itself three times gives $8n-11$, which is almost the identity, but with an offset. To find a function that composed with itself three times is the identity, we can try a simple transformation. Let's define a new function $h(n)$ such that $h(n)=g(n)+2$. Then, $h(h(h(n)))=g(g(g(n)))+6=8n-7$.

So, we have found a function $h(n)$ such that $h(h(h(n)))=8n-7$. This means that $h$ composed with itself three times equals the identity. To find $h(n)$, we need to analyze the properties of $h(n)$ further.

Recall that $h(n)=g(n)+2=2f(n)+1$. We know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, so we can see that $h(n)=f(2n)$. This means that $h$ is an odd function similar to $f$. However, $h(n)$ does not map to $n$ because it is offset by 2.

Let's define a new function $k(n)$ such that $k(n)=h(n)-2$. Then, $k(k(k(n)))=h(h(h(n)))-6=8n-11$.

So, we have found a function $k(n)$ such that $k(k(k(n)))=8n-11$. This means that $k$ composed with itself three times is the identity minus a constant offset. To find $k(n)$, we need to analyze the properties of $k(n)$ further.

Recall that $k(n)=h(n)-2=2f(n)-1$. We know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, so we can see that $k(n)=2f(n/2)-1$. This means that $k(n)$ is not an odd function like $f$ and $h$, but rather an even function.

Now, let's try to find $f(n)$ from $k(n)$. From the definition of $k(n)$, we have $k(k(k(n)))=8n-11$. Substituting $k(n)=2f(n/2)-1$, we get:

$2f(2f(2f(n/2))-1)-1=8n-11$.

Notice that the left hand side is an expression for $f(f(f(n)))$. Therefore, we have $f(f(f(n)))=8n-11$.

Now, we can find $f(100)$ by substituting $n=100$ into the equation:

$f(f(f(100)))=8*100-11=789$.

Let's define a function `f_100` that computes $f(100)$:

```python

def f_100():
    """Calculate f(100)"""
    return 789

result = f_100()

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 To solve this problem, we will use a recursive approach to calculate $f(100)$.

First, we will find a base case to start the recursion. Looking at the second condition, we can see that if $n = 2$, then $f(2n) = f(4)$ and $f(n) = f(2)$. So, we have $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$.

We can use the first condition to express $f(4)$ and $f(2)$:
$f(f(f(2))) = 8*2 - 7 = 9$
$f(f(2)) = f(3)$
$f(2) = f(3)$
So, we have $f(4) = 2f(3) + 1$.

We can combine these two equations to find $f(3)$:
$2f(3) + 1 = 9 - f(3)$
$3f(3) = 8$
$f(3) = 8/3$

However, since $f(3)$ should be a natural number, this is not a valid base case. Instead, we can use the second condition to express $f(4)$ in terms of $f(2)$:
$f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$

Now, we can substitute $f(4) = 2f(3) + 1$ into this equation:
$2f(3) + 1 = 2f(2) + 1$
$f(3) = f(2)$

Since $f(3)$ and $f(2)$ are equal, and we have already determined that $f(2) = f(3) = 8/3$, this is a valid base case. We can now use this base case and the second condition to find $f(100)$:
$f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$
$f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$
$f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1$

Notice that we have a fractional value for $f(25)$, which means that the recursion will not terminate. However, we can still use the second condition to express $f(25)$ in terms of $f(12.5)$:
$f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1$

Now, we can substitute this into the equation for $f(50)$:
$f(50) = 2(2f(12.5) + 1) + 1$
$f(50) = 4f(12.5) + 3$

We can continue this process until we reach a base case. After several steps, we find that:
$f(100) = 2^7 f(12.5) + (2^6 + 2^5 + 2^4 + 2^3 + 2^2 + 2) = 2^7 f(12.5) + 127$

Unfortunately, we cannot continue the recursion any further because we have a fractional value for $f(12.5)$. However, we can make an observation that might help us find a pattern or connection to the base case.

Notice that the value of $f(n)$ is always one more than a power of 2. This suggests that the value of $f(n)$ might be $2^k + 1$ for some integer $k$. Let's check this for the base case $f(3) = 8/3$:
$8/3 = 2^3 + 1$

We found that the base case does not match the pattern $2^k + 1$. However, we can still use the pattern to find $f(100)$:
$f(100) = 2^7 f(12.5) + 127$

Since $f(100)$ should be a natural number, we can try different values of $f(12.5)$ and find a pattern:
- If $f(12.5) = 2$, then $f(100) = 2^7*2 + 127 = 141$
- If $f(12.5) = 2^3 + 1 = 9$, then $f(100) = 2^7*9 + 127 = 1403$
- If $f(12.5) = 2^4 + 1 = 17$, then $f(100) = 2^7*17 + 127 = 2867$
- ...

By trying different values of $f(12.5)$, we can see that the value of $f(100)$ increases by a factor of $2^7$ each time. However, we still need to find a value for $f(12.5)$ that matches the pattern $2^k + 1$ and gives us a natural number for $f(100)$.

After trying different values of $f(12.5)$ and checking for the pattern $2^k + 1$, we find that $f(12.5) = 2^4 + 1 = 17$ gives us a natural number for $f(100)$:
$f(100) = 2^7*17 + 127 = 2867$

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{2867}$.

Please note that this is not an exact solution, but an approximation based on the pattern observed in the base case. The exact solution would require a different approach or additional information to fully solve the problem.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 To solve this problem, we need to understand the two given conditions and use them to find the value of $f(100)$.

1. $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$: This condition implies that the function $f$ is applied three times on $n$ to get $8n-7$. This is a recursive function.

2. $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$: This condition shows that the function $f$ applied to $2n$ is equal to two times the function $f$ applied to $n$ plus one. This is a linear relationship.

Now, let's apply these conditions to find $f(100)$:

1. We know that $f(f(f(100)))=8*100-7=793$.

2. We also know that $f(2*50)=2f(50)+1$.

3. Now, we can apply the first condition to get $f(f(f(50)))=793$, which simplifies to $f(f(250))=793$.

4. We can apply the second condition to get $f(2*250)=2f(250)+1$, which simplifies to $f(500)=2f(250)+1$.

5. Substituting $f(500)$ with $793$ (from the first condition), we get $793=2f(250)+1$, which simplifies to $f(250)=\frac{793-1}{2}=396$.

6. Now, we can substitute $f(250)$ with $396$ (from the previous step) in the equation $f(2*50)=2f(50)+1$ to get $f(100)=2*396+1=793$.

Therefore, the value of $f(100)$ is $\boxed{793}$.

Note: The solution involves mathematical operations and logical reasoning. Implementing this solution in a programming language would not provide any additional value. The solution is purely mathematical.

First, we can solve the functional equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and get $f(n)$ in terms of $n$ directly. 

We can start by setting $n=f(n)$ in the second condition to get $f(2f(n))=2f(f(n))+1$, and then substitute $f(f(f(n)))$ with $8n-7$ to get $f(2n)=2(8n-7)+1=16n-13$. Therefore, $f(n)=8n-7$ for $n\geq2$.

Then we substitute $n=f(n)=8n-7$ into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we get $f(2(8n-7))=2(8n-7)+1=16n-13$. Solving this equation we get $n=\frac{f(n)+13}{16}$, which means $n$ should be a multiple of $2$ to make sure $f(n)$ is a natural number.

So far, we have $f(n)=8n-7$ for $n\geq2$ and $f(n)$ is a multiple of $2$. We can continue to set $n=f(n)$ in the second condition to get $f(2f(n))=2f(f(n))+1$, which simplifies to $f(2(8n-7))=2(8n-7)+1=16n-13$. Solving this equation we get $n=\frac{f(n)+13}{16}$, which means $n$ should be a multiple of $4$ to make sure $f(n)$ is a natural number.

We can continue this process, but it is clear that we will keep getting $f(n)$ is a multiple of $2$, $4$, $8$, and so on. So we can conclude that $f(n)$ is a multiple of $2^k$ for all $k\geq1$. 

Finally, we substitute $n=100$ into the equation $f(n)=8n-7$ to get $f(100)=8*100-7=\boxed{793}$.

1. $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$
2. $f(f(f(n)))=2f(f(n))+1$

By equating the right sides of the two equations, we can get $8n-7=2f(f(n))+1$, and then $f(f(n))=4n-4$. 

Similarly, we can substitute $f(f(n))$ into the equation $f(f(f(n)))=2f(f(n))+1$ to get $f(f(f(n)))=2(4n-4)+1=8n-7$, which confirms our equation.

Now, let's find $f(100)$. We know that $f(f(n))=4n-4$, so we can substitute $n=100$ into the equation to get $f(f(100))=4*100-4=396$. 

Then, we substitute $n=396$ into the equation $f(f(n))=4n-4$ to get $f(396)=4*396-4=1576$. 

Finally, substitute $n=1576$ into the equation $f(f(n))=4n-4$ to get $f(1576)=4*1576-4=6300$. 

So, the answer is $f(100)=\boxed{6300}$.

 This problem involves a function that is defined recursively, which makes it challenging to solve directly. However, by exploiting the structure of the function and the given equations, we can find a pattern that allows us to calculate $f(100)$.

Let's start by applying the second equation to the first equation in the problem:

$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$

$f(f(f(2n)))=2f(f(n))+1$

Now, let's apply the second equation again:

$f(f(2f(n)+1))=2f(f(n))+1$

At this point, we can see that the left side of the equation is of the form $f(f(2f(n)+1))$, which is similar to the form of $f(f(f(n)))$. This suggests that we can define a new function $g(n)$ such that $g(n) = f(f(n))$. Then, the equation becomes:

$g(2f(n)+1) = 2f(f(n))+1$

Now, let's apply the second equation again to the equation above:

$g(2f(n)+1) = 2f(2f(n)+1)+1$

By comparing this equation with the equation for $g(n)$, we can see that the left side of the equation is of the form $g(n)$, and the right side of the equation is of the form $2f(n)+1$. This suggests that the function $f(n)$ is an involution, meaning that $f(f(n)) = n$.

Now, let's use this property to find the value of $f(100)$:

Since $f(f(n)) = n$, we have $f(f(100)) = 100$. Therefore, $f(100) = 100$.

So, the solution to the problem is $f(100) = \boxed{100}$.

Assistant:

 To solve this problem, we can use the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to find some values of the function $f$.

Let's start with $f(2)$, we know that $f(2)=2f(1)+1$. Since $f(1)$ is a natural number, $f(2)$ must be an odd number. The only odd number in the form of $8n-7$ is $1$, so $f(2)=1$.

Then, we can find $f(4)$ by using the second condition again. We have $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2*1+1=3$. 

Continuing this process, we can find $f(8)$, $f(16)$, and so on. But we notice that these values form a sequence of powers of $2$. 

So, we can write a simple program to calculate $f(100)$:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def calculate_f_100():
    """A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."""
    # Initialize f(1) = 1
    f_1 = 1

    # Calculate f(2), f(4), ..., f(100)
    for i in range(2, 101):
        f_i = 2 * f_1 + 1
        f_1 = f_i

    return f_i

result = calculate_f_100()
print(result)

 To solve this problem, we can use a recursive function in Python. The function will take an argument `n` and use the given conditions to calculate `f(n)`. We can then call this function with `n=100` to find `f(100)`.

```python

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 To solve this problem, we can start by analyzing the given equations.

The first equation, $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, shows that applying the function $f$ three times to any number will result in the number being multiplied by 8 and then subtracting 7. This equation gives us some insight into the behavior of the function $f$.

The second equation, $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, shows that applying the function $f$ to any number twice will result in that number being multiplied by 2 and then incremented by 1. This equation also gives us some insight into the behavior of the function $f$.

Now, let's try to find the value of $f(100)$ using these equations.

We can start by finding $f(101)$ using the second equation. We know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, so $f(101)=2f\left(\frac{101}{2}\right)+1=2f(50)+1$. But we still don't know the value of $f(50)$, so we need to continue this process.

We can use the first equation to find $f(50)$. We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, so $f(f(f(50)))=8*50-7=393$. Since $f(50)$ is the argument to $f$ three times in this equation, we can rewrite it as $f(f(50))=f(393)$. 

Now we have a pair of equations: $f(101)=2f(50)+1$ and $f(50)=f(393)$. We can substitute the second equation into the first to get $f(101)=2f(f(393))+1$. 

We can continue this process to find $f(f(393))$ and $f(393)$. After several steps, we can find that $f(f(393))=f(199)$, $f(393)=f(199)+1$, $f(199)=f(99)+1$, $f(99)=f(49)+1$, and so on. 

By continuing this process, we can find that $f(100)=f(f(393))=f(199)$. 

Using the first equation, we can find that $f(199)=8*199-7=1581$. 

So, $f(100)=\boxed{1581}$.
