Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:


To solve this problem, we can first observe that the expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ equals to $0$ if and only if at least one of the factors is $0$. This gives us four cases:

1. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$
2. $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$
3. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$
4. $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$

Let's solve these cases one by one:

1. If $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$. If $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, then $x = 8$ or $y = 8$. By analyzing these cases, we can find that the four points are $(8,2)$, $(8,-2)$, $(-8,2)$, and $(-8,-2)$.

2. Similarly, if $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, then $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$. If $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, then $x = 8$ or $y = 8$. By analyzing these cases, we can find that the four points are $(2,8)$, $(2,-8)$, $(-2,8)$, and $(-2,-8)$.

3. If $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, then $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$, which gives us $x = 10$ and $y = 0$ or $x = 0$ and $y = -10$. The two points are $(10,0)$ and $(0,-10)$.

4. If $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, then $x = 8$ and $y = 8$ or $x = -8$ and $y = -8$, which gives us the two points $(8,8)$ and $(-8,-8)$.

Now we can draw these points on a coordinate plane and connect them to form a convex polygon. It turns out that these points form a rectangle with side lengths $20$ and $16$. Therefore, the area of this rectangle is $20 \times 16 = 320$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{320}$.

 First, we can see that the equation is equal to zero when either of the terms inside the product is zero. 

Therefore, we have four cases to consider:
1. $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x-y| - 10 = 0$
2. $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x| - 8 = 0$
3. $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ and $|y| - 8 = 0$
4. $|x-y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x| - 8 = 0$

Let's solve these four cases step by step:

```python

    # Case 1: |x+y| - 10 = 0 and |x-y| - 10 = 0

    case1_2 = Abs(x - y) - 10
    case1_solution = solveset(case1_1, x, domain=S.Reals) & solveset(case1_2, x, domain=S.Reals)

    case2_2 = Abs(x) - 8
    case2_solution = solveset(case2_1, x, domain=S.Reals) & solveset(case2_2, x, domain=S.Reals)

    return case1_solution, case2_solution, case3_solution, case4_solution

case1_solution, case2_solution, case3_solution, case4_solution = solve_cases()

```
So, for the first case we get two points: (10 - y, y) and (-y - 10, y). For the second and fourth cases, we get the points: (-8, 10 - y) and (-8, -y - 10). For the third case, we get the points: (8, y - 10) and (8, y + 10).

All these points are symmetric with respect to the origin (0, 0). So, they form a square with side length 20. The area of this square is $\boxed{400}$.

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 We can start by analyzing the equation. The equation equals zero if either of the two terms in the product equals zero. This gives us four cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 \neq 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 \neq 0$
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 \neq 0$
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 \neq 0$

Let's consider each case separately:

1. If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$. The lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$ form a pair of parallel lines. Similarly, if $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$. The lines $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$ form another pair of parallel lines.

2. If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = 8$ or $x = -8$. The lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$ form a pair of vertical lines. Similarly, if $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. The lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$ form another pair of horizontal lines.

3. and 4. These cases lead to the same lines as in case 2.

The four pairs of lines form a rectangle, and the area of this rectangle is $(10 + 10)(8 + 8) = 320$. 

So, the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{320}$ square units.

Assistant:

 The given equation implies two possibilities:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This gives us $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$, which simplifies to $x = y = \pm 5$. This gives us 4 points: $(5, 5), (5, -5), (-5, 5)$ and $(-5, -5)$.

2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This gives us $x = y = \pm 8$. This gives us 4 more points: $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8)$ and $(-8, -8)$.

So, we have 8 points: $(5, 5), (5, -5), (-5, 5), (-5, -5), (8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8)$ and $(-8, -8)$.

The plot of these points forms a rectangle with vertices at $(5, 5), (5, -5), (-5, 5), (-5, -5)$. The lengths of the sides of the rectangle are $10$ units (from $x = 5$ to $x = -5$) and $10$ units (from $y = 5$ to $y = -5$). 

The area of the rectangle is length times width, which is $10 \times 10 = 100$ square units.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{100}$.

 To solve this problem, we first need to understand the properties of the absolute value function and the square function. 

The absolute value function is always non-negative and equals zero if and only if the input is zero. The square function is also always non-negative and equals zero if and only if the input is zero.

Therefore, the product of two non-negative numbers equals zero if and only if at least one of the numbers equals zero.

So, in the given equation, the product equals zero if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

This simplifies to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The equations $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$ describe a square with side length 10 and a square with side length 8 respectively.

The area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of these two squares, which is $10^2 + 8^2 = 100 + 64 = 164$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{164}$.

 The given equation is a product of two terms, each of which is a squared absolute value subtracted from a constant.

When we set a product of two numbers equal to zero, it means that at least one of the numbers must be zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

Case 1 gives us $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which represents a line in the coordinate plane. Similarly, Case 2 gives us $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which are two lines parallel to the y-axis and x-axis respectively.

The intersection of these lines forms a rectangle with side lengths of 8 units and 10 units. 

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $8 \times 10 = 80$ square units.

14_User:

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation can be rewritten as:

$$
((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0
$$

The equation is satisfied if either of the two factors is equal to zero. The first factor is zero if $|x+y|=10$ or $|x-y|=10$, and the second factor is zero if $|x|=8$ or $|y|=8$. These conditions define a set of lines and circles in the plane. The lines intersect at points that form a square with side length 10. The circles with radius 8 centered at $(0,0)$, $(0,10)$, $(10,0)$, and $(10,10)$ also enclose the square. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of the square, which is $10^2 = \boxed{100}$ square units.

Here is a python code that calculates the area of the square:

    side_length = 10
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = area_of_square()
