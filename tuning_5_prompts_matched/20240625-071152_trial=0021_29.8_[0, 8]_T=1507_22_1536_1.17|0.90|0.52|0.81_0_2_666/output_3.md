Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



A product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the expression in the problem will be zero if either of the following two conditions holds:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

Now, let's solve these two conditions:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This can only be true if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$. In the first case, we have $x = 10$ and $y = 0$, and in the second case, we have $x = 0$ and $y = -10$. So, the points are $(10, 0)$ and $(0, -10)$.

2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This can only be true if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = 8$ or $x = -8$ and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. So, the points are $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

Now, let's plot these points in a coordinate plane and connect them. The resulting shape is a square with side length 10 units. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$ square units.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units.
The answer is: $100$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 This problem requires a deep understanding of absolute value and inequalities, as well as the properties of the area of a polygon. 

The equation given is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.

The first term being zero means that either $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x - y| - 10 = 0$, which simplifies to $|x + y| = 10$ or $|x - y| = 10$. These are lines in the coordinate plane.

The second term being zero means that either $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$, which simplifies to $|x| = 8$ or $|y| = 8$. These are also lines in the coordinate plane.

The points that satisfy either of these conditions form a square with side length 16 (since the maximum value of $|x|$ or $|y|$ that satisfies $|x| = 8$ or $|y| = 8$ is 8, and the maximum value of $|x + y|$ or $|x - y|$ that satisfies $|x + y| = 10$ or $|x - y| = 10$ is 10, which means the square's side length is 10, but it's centered at $(0,0)$ so its side length becomes $10 - (-8) = 18$, which implies that the side length of the square is $18 - 8 = 10$).

The area of this square is therefore $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon formed by the points satisfying the given equation is 256 square units.

Since the problem asks for a numerical answer, the answer is:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is $256$ square units. The answer is $\boxed{256}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The given equation is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. 

Now we know that any number squared equals zero if and only if the number itself equals zero. Therefore, either of the two factors in the equation must be equal to zero.

The first factor is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$ and the second factor is $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$.

For the first factor to be equal to zero, we need both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. These simplify to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points that satisfy this equation are those where the sum of the absolute values of the coordinates is 10, and the absolute value of the difference of the coordinates is also 10. These points form a square with side length 10.

For the second factor to be equal to zero, we need both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. These simplify to $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that the points that satisfy this equation are those where the absolute values of both coordinates are 8. These points form a square with side length 16.

The region enclosed by the points that satisfy the original equation is the intersection of the regions defined by these two factors. That intersection is simply the square with side length 10, because the square with side length 16 is entirely contained within the square with side length 10.

The area of a square is given by the square of its side length. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $10^2 = 100$.

The answer is: $100$.

1. The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

2. These equations are equivalent to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

3. Solving the absolute value equations, we get the following equations for the lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, $x - y = -10$, $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

4. These lines form a square with side length 10. To find the area of this square, we square the side length: $10^2 = 100$. So the area of the square is 100.

Now let's write the Python code to calculate the area of the square:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def square_area():
    side_length = 10
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = square_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 100

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
100
```
The area of the convex polygon is $100$. The answer is: $\boxed{100}$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The expression equals zero when either of the two terms equals zero.
This gives us the following system of equations:

1) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, 
2) $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$,
3) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$,
4) $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

Each of these equations simplifies to:

1) $\vert x + y \vert = 10$,
2) $\vert x - y \vert = 10$,
3) $\vert x \vert = 8$,
4) $\vert y \vert = 8$.

Solving each of these gives:

1) $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$,
2) $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$,
3) $x = 8$ or $x = -8$,
4) $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

Now we just need to find the intersections of these lines and find the area of the polygon they enclose.

The solutions to the system of equations are the vertices of the polygon, which are:

$(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(2, 8)$, $(-2, 8)$, $(2, -8)$, $(-2, -8)$.

Plotting these points, we see that the polygon is a square with side length 16. The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of the polygon is $16^2 = 256$.

Thus, the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{256}$.
The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either one of the expressions is zero, or both are zero. 

Let's analyze the two expressions separately:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$: 
   This equation can only be true if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. Solving these absolute value equations gives us $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. 
   
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$: 
   This equation can only be true if both $(\vert x \vert - 8) = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8) = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. Solving these absolute value equations gives us $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. 

Now, we can find the intersection points of these four lines:

- $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ give $x = 10, y = 0$.
- $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$ give $x = 0, y = 10$.
- $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$ give $x = 0, y = -10$.
- $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$ give $x = -10, y = 0$.

These intersection points are the vertices of the square with side length 10. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the answer is $\boxed{100}$.

Here is a python code to calculate the area of the polygon:
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    side_length = 10
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area
