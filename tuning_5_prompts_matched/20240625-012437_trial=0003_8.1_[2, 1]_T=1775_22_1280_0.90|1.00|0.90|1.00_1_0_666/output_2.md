Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



This problem cannot be solved directly with Python's standard library. However, we can solve it by hand and provide the answer as a numerical value.

The equation $ | |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100} $ has 4 distinct solutions. The expression $ | |x - 1| - 2| $ is a "double absolute value" which has a piecewise interpretation:

- If $ |x - 1| - 2 \geq 0 $, then $ ||x - 1| - 2| = |x - 1| - 2 $
- If $ |x - 1| - 2 < 0 $, then $ ||x - 1| - 2| = 2 - |x - 1| $

So, we have two cases to consider:

1. When $ |x - 1| - 2 \geq 0 $, the equation becomes $ |x - 1| - 2 = \frac{m}{100} $, which simplifies to $ |x - 1| = \frac{m}{100} + 2 $. This is equivalent to two separate cases:

   - When $ x - 1 \geq 0 $, the equation becomes $ x - 1 = \frac{m}{100} + 2 $. Solving for $ x $ gives $ x = \frac{m}{100} + 3 $.
   
   - When $ x - 1 < 0 $, the equation becomes $ -(x - 1) = \frac{m}{100} + 2 $, which simplifies to $ x = 1 - \frac{m}{100} - 2 $, or $ x = - \frac{m}{100} - 1 $.

2. When $ |x - 1| - 2 < 0 $, the equation becomes $ 2 - |x - 1| = \frac{m}{100} $, which simplifies to $ |x - 1| = 2 - \frac{m}{100} $. This is equivalent to two separate cases:

   - When $ x - 1 \geq 0 $, the equation becomes $ x - 1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100} $, which simplifies to $ x = 3 - \frac{m}{100} $.
   
   - When $ x - 1 < 0 $, the equation becomes $ -(x - 1) = 2 - \frac{m}{100} $, which simplifies to $ x = -1 + \frac{m}{100} $.

Solving the equations above, we find the solutions to be $ x = 3 - \frac{m}{100} $, $ x = - \frac{m}{100} - 1 $, $ x = 3 - \frac{m}{100} $, and $ x = -1 + \frac{m}{100} $.

For the original equation to have 4 distinct solutions, the expressions in the solutions above must not be equal for any values of $ m $. Comparing the expressions pairwise, we find that the expressions are equal when $ m = 200 $.

Therefore, the equation has 4 distinct solutions for $ m = 200 $. So, the answer is $\boxed{1}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. Write the four cases for the given equation in the problem, they are basically all the possible scenarios for how many times either `x - 1` and/or `x - 2` can be negative.
2. Analyze each case and how it corresponds ot the right hand side of the equation, which is a function of m.
3. Solve the resulting equations for m to find out for which values of m each case has 4 distinct solutions.
4. Count the number of integer solutions found for m.

So the steps are:

- Initialize a counter for the number of valid m values
- For each case, solve the equation and count the number of distinct solutions
- Increment the counter if the number of solutions is equal to 4

All the work is done in the solve_equations function so we just need to run it and print the result.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:


The function is defined with four distinct solutions. The expression inside the absolute value, $|x-1|-2$, needs to be of the form $-n, 0, n$ to result in $4$ distinct solutions. Because of the absolute value, we will have two cases to handle here. So the conditions for $m$ can be written as:

For $x < 1$, the equation becomes $-(x-1)-2 = \frac{m}{100}$, which yields $x = 1+\frac{m}{100}$. This satisfies the condition $x<1$ as long as $\frac{m}{100} < 1$ or $m < 100$.

For $x \geq 1$, the equation becomes $(x-1)-2 = \frac{m}{100}$, which yields $x = 1+\frac{m}{100} + 2 = \frac{m+200}{100}$. This satisfies the condition $x \geq 1$ as long as $\frac{m+200}{100} \geq 1$ or $m \geq -200$.

By combining the cases, the conditions for $m$ is $-200 \leq m < 100$. The possible number of integers that satisfy this condition is $100-(-200)+1 = 301$. 

So, there are $\boxed{301}$ possible values for $m$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

def count_valid_values():
    # Define the variable
    m = symbols('m')

    # Define the conditions
    conditions = [-200, 100 - 1]

    # Count the number of valid values
    count = conditions[1] - conditions[0] + 1

    return count

result = count_valid_values()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 300

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output

The number of possible values for $m$ is $\boxed{301}$.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



$\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$

If we write out the casework, we get the following four equations:

(1) $x - 1 - 2 = \frac{m}{100} \implies x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$

(2) $-(x - 1) - 2 = \frac{m}{100} \implies x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$

(3) $-(x - 1) - 2 = -\frac{m}{100} \implies x = 1 + \frac{m}{100}$

(4) $x - 1 - 2 = -\frac{m}{100} \implies x = 1 - \frac{m}{100}$

Notice that equations (1) and (4) are equal, but (2) and (3) are equal as well.

Let's plot these four functions to see how we can achieve 4 distinct solutions:

[asy]
size(200);
real f(real x){
  return (x - 1) - 2;
}
real g(real x){
  return -(x - 1) - 2;
}
real h(real x){
  return -(x - 1) + 2;
}
real k(real x){
  return (x - 1) + 2;
}

draw(graph(f,-1,3), blue);
draw(graph(g,-1,3), red);
draw(graph(h,-1,3), green);
draw(graph(k,-1,3), magenta);
draw((-1,0)--(3,0), EndArrow);
draw((0,-3)--(0,3), EndArrow);
layer();
[/asy]

We can see that 4 distinct solutions can be achieved if we choose $\frac{m}{100}$ such that it is less than 1.

Also, we can see that the range of $m$ is from 0 to 100.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the equation is the number of integers from 0 to 100, which is $\boxed{101}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We need to find a number $m$ such that the equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions. This means we are looking for a total of 8 solutions, four for the positive case ($|x - 1| - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$) and four for the negative case ($|x - 1| - 2 = - \frac{m}{100}$).

2. For each case, we can split the absolute value equation into two separate cases, one for $x - 1 \geq 0$ and one for $x - 1 < 0$.

3. Let's start with the positive case $|x - 1| - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$. When $x - 1 \geq 0$, we have $x - 1 - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$, or $x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$. When $x - 1 < 0$, we have $-(x - 1) - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$, or $x = 1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

4. Similarly, for the negative case $|x - 1| - 2 = - \frac{m}{100}$, when $x - 1 \geq 0$, we have $x - 1 - 2 = - \frac{m}{100}$, or $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$. When $x - 1 < 0$, we have $-(x - 1) - 2 = - \frac{m}{100}$, or $x = - \frac{m}{100}$.

5. To have four distinct solutions for each case, we need to find a value of $m$ such that the four resulting solutions for each case are all distinct. Let's analyze each case separately.

6. For the positive case, we have two solutions: $x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$ and $x = 1 - \frac{m}{100}$. To have four distinct solutions, we need $1 - \frac{m}{100} \neq 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $m = 0$. However, $m = 0$ is not a valid solution, as it would result in only one solution for the positive case.

7. For the negative case, we have two solutions: $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, $x = - \frac{m}{100}$. To have four distinct solutions, we need $3 - \frac{m}{100} \neq - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $m = 0$. Again, $m = 0$ is not a valid solution.

8. Therefore, there is no positive integer $m$ such that the equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions.

So, the answer is $\boxed{0}$, which means there is no valid solution for $m$.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



We have the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$

Notice that this equation can have 4 distinct solutions only if $\frac{m}{100} = 1$.

So, we need to solve $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=1$ step by step.

Step 1:
To simplify the equation, we can set $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = y$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ becomes $\vert y \vert=1$.

Step 2:
Solving $\vert y \vert=1$, we get $y=1$ and $y=-1$.

Step 3:
Substituting $y$ back into the equation, we get two equations:
1) $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 1$, which simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = 3$. Solving this equation, we get $x=4$ and $x=-2$.
2) $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -1$, which simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = 1$. Solving this equation, we get $x=2$ and $x=0$.

Step 4:
We need to check if all these solutions satisfy the original equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. We substitute each solution $x$ and check if $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=1$. 

All the solutions satisfy this condition.

Step 5:
We count the number of distinct solutions. Since each solution $x$ corresponds to one distinct solution, we count 4 distinct solutions.

So, the answer is $\boxed{4}$.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, let's consider the equation 
\[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\]

2. The left hand side is a piecewise defined function. We can split it into two cases:

   a. If $\vert x - 1 \vert - 2 \geq 0$, then we have $\vert x - 1 \vert - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$.
   b. If $\vert x - 1 \vert - 2 < 0$, then we have $2 - \vert x - 1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$.

3. Solving these equations, we can find the number of solutions for each case. Let's denote the number of solutions for case a as $n_a$ and for case b as $n_b$.

4. According to the problem, we need to find $m$ such that $n_a + n_b = 4$.

5. To find the number of solutions, we can use the properties of absolute value. 

6. We can see that for case a, we get two solutions: $x = 1 + \frac{m}{100} + 2$ and $x = 1 - \frac{m}{100} + 2$.

7. For case b, we get two solutions: $x = 1 + \frac{m}{100} - 2$ and $x = 1 - \frac{m}{100} - 2$.

8. We need to find the range of $m$ for which these solutions are all distinct.

9. After analyzing the solutions, we can find that $n_a = n_b = 2$ for $m = 0$ and $m > 400$.

10. For $m = 0$, $n_a + n_b = 4$.

11. Now we only need to analyze the case $m > 400$.

12. For $m > 400$, both $x = 1 + \frac{m}{100} + 2$ and $x = 1 - \frac{m}{100} + 2$ are greater than $3$ and both $x = 1 + \frac{m}{100} - 2$ and $x = 1 - \frac{m}{100} - 2$ are less than $-1$.

13. Therefore, for $m > 400$, $n_a + n_b = 0$.

14. So the only $m$ that satisfies the conditions is $m = 0$.

15. So the answer is $\boxed{1}$.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



We have a complicated equation with multiple absolute values. Let's start by simplifying it:

1. We can ignore the $\frac{m}{100}$ term, as it will only shift the solutions by a constant value.
2. We can consider each absolute value separately and solve for the corresponding intervals.

For each interval, we solve the equation \[\vert x-1 \vert -2 = n\] or \[\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -n\] where $n$ is an integer from $1$ to $m$.

We can solve these equations by applying the definition of absolute value:

\[x - 1 - 2 = n \quad \text{or} \quad x - 1 - 2 = -n\]

\[x - 3 = n \quad \text{or} \quad x - 3 = -n\]

\[x = n + 3 \quad \text{or} \quad x = 3 - n\]

Now we need to find the number of integer solutions for $n$ in the interval $[1, m]$ for each interval. The number of solutions will depend on the endpoints $n + 3$ and $3 - n$ being integers.

Let's summarize the results for each interval:

Interval 1: $x < 1 - 2$
No solutions as this interval doesn't intersect with the interval for $n$.

Interval 2: $1 - 2 \leq x < 1 + 2$
For this interval, $n + 3$ is an integer, so there is one solution for each $n$ in the interval $[1, m]$.

Interval 3: $x \geq 1 + 2$
For this interval, $3 - n$ is an integer, so there is one solution for each $n$ in the interval $[1, m]$.

So, in total, we have $m$ solutions for each interval. 

Since we want the total number of solutions to be $4$, we require \[2m = 4\] giving us $m = 2$.

Therefore, there is $\boxed{1}$ positive integer $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:




From the equation, we have: $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$
Depending on the position of $x$, we have two possibilities:

1) If $x \geq 1$, the equation becomes: $\vert x -1 -2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, so $\vert x-3 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$. Thus, $x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$ or $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.

2) If $x < 1$, the equation becomes: $\vert -x +1 -2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, so $\vert -x -1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$. Thus, $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$ or $x = -\frac{m}{100} + 1$.

Now, let's analyze how many of these solutions are distinct:

- For $x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$ to be positive, we have $m > -300$.
- For $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ to be positive, we have $m < 300$.

Thus, $m$ must be in the interval $(-300, 300)$. However, we are looking for positive integers $m$, so we have $m \in [1, 300)$.

Also, note that for each value of $m$, we have two solutions, one for each equation. Thus, the total number of distinct solutions is $2m$.

Finally, we want to find how many values of $m$ make the equation have 4 distinct solutions. This means we want to find how many values of $m$ make $2m = 4$, that is $m = 2$.

However, this is not possible because $m$ must be in the interval $[1, 300)$. Thus, the equation does not have 4 distinct solutions for any positive integer $m$.

So, the answer is $\boxed{0}$.

Given $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ which has 4 distinct solutions, it is equivalent to that the equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2=\frac{m}{100}$ has 2 distinct solutions with positive value.

We know if $\vert x-1 \vert -2=\pm\frac{m}{100}$, it equals to:
1. $x - 1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ 
2. $x - 1 = -2 + \frac{m}{100}$
3. $-(x - 1) = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$
4. $-(x - 1) = -2 + \frac{m}{100}$

Hence, the two solution equation equals to:
1. $x - 1 - 2 =\frac{m}{100} \Rightarrow x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$
2. $x - 1 + 2 =\frac{m}{100} \Rightarrow x = 1 + \frac{m}{100}$
3. $x - 1 + 2 =-\frac{m}{100} \Rightarrow x = 1 - \frac{m}{100}$
4. $x - 1 - 2 =-\frac{m}{100} \Rightarrow x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$

The 4 distinct solutions require $1 - \frac{m}{100} \neq 3 + \frac{m}{100}$, then m should less than 50.

So, the integer solution of `m` is from 1 to 49. There are $\boxed{48}$ possible solutions.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Firstly, we have the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ that has 4 distinct solutions. The double absolute value structure on the left-hand side (LHS), can create two or four distinct solutions for the equation depending on the value of $\frac{m}{100}$. It's clear that the RHS ($\frac{m}{100}$) cannot be negative, hence $m$ must be a non-negative number. 

To have 4 distinct solutions, the LHS must be four times differentiable, i.e., it must change its sign four times in the x-interval of 4 distinct solutions. This can happen in two scenarios:

Scenario 1: The expression inside the innermost absolute value changes its sign once in the x-interval of 4 distinct solutions. This means that the sign of $(x-1)$ changes once in the x-interval of 4 distinct solutions. Thus, the innermost absolute value must be equal to a constant for 2 values of $x$ in the interval of the 4 distinct solutions. These points of the equality of the innermost absolute value are the points where the LHS changes its sign. 

Scenario 2: The expression inside the innermost absolute value changes its sign twice in the x-interval of 4 distinct solutions. This means that the sign of $(x-1)$ changes twice in the x-interval of 4 distinct solutions. Thus, the innermost absolute value must be equal to a constant for 4 different values of $x$ in the interval of the 4 distinct solutions. These points of the equality of the innermost absolute value are the points where the LHS changes its sign. 

If we analyze these scenarios, we will see that Scenario 1 is impossible to achieve because the absolute value of any real number cannot be equal to a constant for more than two different values of $x$. 

Therefore, it follows that the LHS must change its sign four times in the x-interval of 4 distinct solutions. This can only happen if the outermost absolute value changes its sign twice and the innermost absolute value changes its sign twice in each interval of the sign changes of the outermost absolute value. 

So, we must have the following scenarios:

1. The sign of $(x-1)$ changes twice in the x-interval where the LHS changes its sign. 

2. The sign of $(x-3)$ changes twice in the x-interval where the LHS changes its sign. 

3. The sign of $(x-5)$ changes twice in the x-interval where the LHS changes its sign. 

4. The sign of $(x-7)$ changes twice in the x-interval where the LHS changes its sign. 

For each of these scenarios, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. 

In conclusion, the number of positive integers $m$ that make the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have 4 distinct solutions is infinite. So, the answer is $\boxed{0}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:


1. We need to solve equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ for $m$ that would give 4 distinct solutions.
2. Based on the properties of abs function, one can notice that $x-1$ can be equal to $2+\frac{m}{100}$, $-(2+\frac{m}{100})$, $2-\frac{m}{100}$, or $-(2-\frac{m}{100})$.
3. This means we are looking for values of $m$, for which all 4 expressions are between $0<2-\frac{m}{100}<1<2+\frac{m}{100}<3$. This results in $m$ being in the set $\{1,2\}$.
4. Therefore, there are $\boxed{2}$ possible values for $m$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The given equation has four distinct solutions. When considering the equation $f(x) = m$, where $f$ is a certain nested absolute value function (in this case, $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$), the number of roots $m$ can take is determined by the number of times the graph of $y = f(x)$ intersects with $y = m$. For four roots, the graph needs to intersect with the line $y = m$ at four points.

Firstly, let's observe that the function $f(x)$ has a V-shape: it's a valley from $-\infty$ to $1$, then it's a mountain from $1$ to $+\infty$. Also, the "width" of the V is $4$, i.e., $f(x)$ is in $[2,6]$ for all real $x$.

To cover the whole number line with $f(x)$ intersecting with $y = m$ at $4$ points, let the value of $m$ varies from $0$ to $6$ (and not including $6$), or $0 \le m \le 6$. Such $m$ will make the equation $f(x) = m$ have 4 distinct solutions.

Finally, we return the number of such integer $m$, for which $0 \le m \le 6$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The equation is $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, and we want to find how many positive integers $m$ makes this equation have 4 distinct solutions.

2. First, let's change the equation to $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=<br> \frac{m}{100}$, because we want to find the number of $m$, so we need to consider the case that $m$ can be as big as possible.

3. Then, we can split the equation into two parts: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 <= \frac{m}{100}$ and $\vert x-1 \vert -2 >= -\frac{m}{100}$.

4. Solve these two inequalities, we get $x <= \frac{1}{100}m + 3$ and $x >= \frac{1}{100}m - 1$.

5. The solution to these two inequalities gives us the possible range of $x$.

6. For each $x$, we have four distinct solutions, so the total number of solutions is 4 times the number of possible $x$.

7. From the solution range of $x$, we can see that each time $m$ increases by 100, the number of solutions increases by 4.

8. Because $m$ starts from 0, and increases by 100 each time, the number of solutions is 4 times the number of times $m$ increases by 100.

9. Since we want the total number of solutions with 4 distinct solutions, the number of solutions should be 4.

10. Therefore, we need to find out how many times $m$ increases by 100, and the answer is $\boxed{4}$.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The given expression inside the absolute values is \[|\vert x-1 \vert - 2| = \frac{m}{100}\]
which is equivalent to \[
\begin{cases}
\vert x-1 \vert - 2 = \frac{m}{100} \\
\vert x-1 \vert - 2 = -\frac{m}{100}
\end{cases}
\]
Let's solve each case separately.

Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$
We split this absolute value equation into two cases:

Subcase 1.1: $x-1 - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$, i.e., $x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$

Subcase 1.2: $-(x-1) - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$, i.e., $x = - \frac{m}{100} + 1$

Case 2: $\vert x-1 \vert - 2 = -\frac{m}{100}$
We split this absolute value equation into two cases:

Subcase 2.1: $x-1 - 2 = -\frac{m}{100}$, i.e., $x = -\frac{m}{100} + 3$

Subcase 2.2: $-(x-1) - 2 = -\frac{m}{100}$, i.e., $x = \frac{m}{100} + 1$

In total, we have 4 different solutions for $x$:

$\bullet$ $x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$

$\bullet$ $x = - \frac{m}{100} + 1$

$\bullet$ $x = -\frac{m}{100} + 3$

$\bullet$ $x = \frac{m}{100} + 1$

In order for these 4 solutions to be distinct, the first and the third must be different from the second and the fourth. This happens when $\frac{m}{100} + 3 \neq - \frac{m}{100} + 1$ and $\frac{m}{100} + 3 \neq \frac{m}{100} + 1$. This implies that $\frac{m}{100} \neq -1$ and $\frac{m}{100} \neq 2$. 

Therefore, we get $m \neq -100$ and $m \neq 200$. So, the positive integers $m$ that satisfy the equation are the integers from 1 to 199, and from 201 to much much larger than 200. 

The problem asks for the number of such $m$'s. It turns out that there are $\boxed{198}$ integers that satisfy the equation.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



We want to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has $4$ distinct solutions.

First, let's analyze the equation. We can see that the right-hand side is a fraction with denominator $100$. So, the number $m$ must be a multiple of $100$.

On the left-hand side, we have an absolute value of an absolute value, which means that the expression inside the absolute value can be either positive or negative. So, we have two cases to consider:

1. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$
2. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$

Now, let's consider each case separately:

1. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$:

This equation can be rewritten as $\vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100} + 2$.

The absolute value of a number is equal to the number itself or its opposite. So, we have two sub-cases to consider:

1.1. $x-1 = \frac{m}{100} + 2$:

This equation can be rewritten as $x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$.

For this equation to have $4$ distinct solutions, the right-hand side must be greater than or equal to $3 + \frac{3}{100}$ and less than $1 - \frac{3}{100}$. This gives us the inequality $\frac{m}{100} + 3 \geq 3 + \frac{3}{100}$ and $\frac{m}{100} + 3 < 1 - \frac{3}{100}$.

Solving these inequalities, we get $m \geq 3$ and $m < 7$. So, $m$ can be $3, 4, 5, 6$.

1.2. $x-1 = -\frac{m}{100} - 2$:

This equation can be rewritten as $x = -\frac{m}{100} - 1$.

For this equation to have $4$ distinct solutions, the right-hand side must be less than $1 - \frac{3}{100}$ and greater than or equal to $3 - \frac{3}{100}$. This gives us the inequality $-\frac{m}{100} - 1 < 1 - \frac{3}{100}$ and $-\frac{m}{100} - 1 \geq 3 - \frac{3}{100}$.

Solving these inequalities, we get $m > 7$ and $m \leq 3$. But $m$ cannot be greater than $7$ and less than or equal to $3$ at the same time. So, there are no solutions in this sub-case.

2. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$:

This equation can be rewritten as $\vert x-1 \vert = -\frac{m}{100} + 2$.

But the absolute value of a number is always non-negative. So, this equation has no solutions.

So, the only case that gives us $4$ distinct solutions is the first case, and the values of $m$ that satisfy this case are $3, 4, 5, 6$. Therefore, there are $4$ positive integers $m$ that satisfy the conditions.

The answer is $\boxed{4}$.
