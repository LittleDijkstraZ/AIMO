Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



We can express $f(f(f(n)))$ as $8n - 7$ and $f(2n)$ as $2f(n) + 1$.

We can start by plugging in $n = 1$ into the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$ to get $f(f(f(1))) = 8(1) - 7$. Solving this equation gives us $f(f(f(1))) = -1$.

Now, we can plug in $n = f(1)$ into the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to get $f(2f(1)) = 2f(f(1)) + 1$. Solving this equation gives us $f(2f(1)) = 2(-1) + 1 = -1$.

We can then plug in $n = 2f(1)$ into the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$ to get $f(f(f(2f(1)))) = 8(2f(1)) - 7$. Solving this equation gives us $f(f(f(2f(1)))) = 16f(1) - 7$.

Since $f(f(f(2f(1)))) = f(f(f(1))) = -1$, we have $-1 = 16f(1) - 7$. Solving this equation gives us $f(1) = 1$.

Finally, we can plug in $n = 100$ into the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$ to get $f(f(f(100))) = 8(100) - 7$. Solving this equation gives us $f(f(f(100))) = 793$.

But we also know that $f(f(f(100))) = f(f(f(50))) = f(f(25)) = f(13)$.

We can plug in $n = 50$ into the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to get $f(2(50)) = 2f(50) + 1$. Solving this equation gives us $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.

We can plug in $n = 25$ into the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to get $f(2(25)) = 2f(25) + 1$. Solving this equation gives us $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.

We can plug in $n = 13$ into the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$ to get $f(f(f(13))) = 8(13) - 7$. Solving this equation gives us $f(13) = 8(13) - 7$.

So, $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2(2f(25) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(8(13) - 7) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(104 - 7) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(97) + 1) + 1 = 2(194) + 1 = 388 + 1 = 389$.

So, $f(100) = \boxed{389}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



We can see that we can solve the problem by repeatedly applying the function $f$ to 100, and that the second equation provides a way to simplify the computation at each step. 

Let's first apply the second equation to simplify $f(100)$ into a more computable form. 

We know that $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ for all positive integers $n$, so we can substitute $n = f(100)$ to get:

$f(2f(100)) = 2f(f(100)) + 1$,

However, from the first equation, we know that $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, so we can substitute $n = 100$ to get:

$f(f(f(100))) = 8*100 - 7 = 793$.

We can simplify the equation above as:

$f(2f(100)) = 2*793 + 1 = 1587$.

Now we can substitute $n = 1587$ into the second equation again to get:

$f(2*1587) = 2f(1587) + 1$.

The left side of this equation simplifies to $f(3174) = 2f(1587) + 1$.

This equation shows that to compute $f(3174)$, we need to know the value of $f(1587)$. 

We can use the same strategy to reduce the argument of $f$ until we are left with an argument that we know the value of, and that is 0, because if $f(n) = 0$, we have $f(f(n)) = n$ and $f(f(f(n))) = 2n - 1$, so the first equation is satisfied for $n = 1$, and $f(1) = 0$.

So, we start with $f(3174)$ and repeatedly apply the reduction step until we reach $f(0)$.

Let's write a small script to compute $f(100)$:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def compute_f_100():
    n = 100
    while n > 0:
        n = 2 * n + 1
    return n // 2

result = compute_f_100()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS ['']

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output

```

The output is not correct because we didn't implement the logic correctly. Let's correct it:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def compute_f_100():
    n = 100
    while n > 0:
        n = 2 * n + 1
        n = 2 * n - 1
        n = n // 2
    return n

result = compute_f_100()

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. From the first condition we have $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. Let's assume $f(n) = x$. So, $f(x) = 8n - 7$.
2. Now, let's analyze the second condition, $f(2n) = 2f(n)+1$. We know that $n = f(x)$, so $f(2(f(x))) = 2f(f(x))+1$. 
3. Substitute $f(x) = 8n - 7$ into the equation, thus getting $f(2(8n - 7)) = 2(8n - 7) + 1$.
4. Simplify the equation, then, $f(16n - 14) = 16n - 14$. So $x = 16n - 14$. 
5. We can easily see that $f(n) = 16n - 14$ satisfy both conditions. 

Now, we have to find the value of $f(100)$. Substitute $n = 100$ into the function, thus getting $f(100) = 16*100 - 14 = 1586$.

The answer is $\boxed{1586}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:


We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. 

We can't directly calculate $f(100)$ from these two equations because we don't know the function $f$. But, we can figure out the values of $f(1)$, $f(2)$, $f(4)$ and $f(8)$ using the second equation.

From $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can substitute $n=1$ to find $f(2)$:
$f(2)=2f(1)+1$.

We also know $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. So we can substitute $n=2$ to find $f(4)$:
$f(4)=4f(2)+1=4(2f(1)+1)+1=8f(1)+5$.

We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, so substituting $n=4$ we get:
$f(8)=8f(4)+1=8(8f(1)+5)+1=64f(1)+41$.

We also know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, so substituting $n=8$ we get:
$f(16)=8f(8)+1=8(64f(1)+41)+1=512f(1)+337$.

But from the second equation we can derive another equation: $f(n)=2f(n/2)+1$ when $n$ is even. 

So we can get $f(16)$ from $f(8)$:
$f(16)=2f(8)+1=2(64f(1)+41)+1=128f(1)+83$.

From $f(16)=512f(1)+337$ and $f(16)=128f(1)+83$, we get:
$512f(1)+337=128f(1)+83$, solved for $f(1)$ gives $f(1)=\boxed{2}$.

Now we can find $f(100)$ using the first equation:
$f(100)=2f(50)+1=2(2f(25)+1)+1=4f(25)+3$.

Again using the second equation, we can get $f(25)$ from $f(50)$:
$f(25)=2f(50)+1=2(2f(25)+1)+1=4f(25)+3$.

Solving the above equation for $f(25)$ gives $f(25)=3$.

Substituting $f(25)=3$ into the equation $f(100)=4f(25)+3$, we get $f(100)=4*3+3=15$.

So the answer is $\boxed{15}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



We are given two functions, $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. The aim is to find the value of $f(100)$.

Notice a thing, in the function $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, $n$ is multiplied by 2. This means, if we keep on applying this function, the value would keep on increasing.

However, in the function $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, the value of $n$ is multiplied by 8 and then 7 is subtracted. This means, if we keep on applying this function, the value would keep on increasing, but it would increase much faster than in the previous function.

Given the speed of increase, we can hypothesize that, since applying the first function increases the value much slower than the second, applying the first function multiple times would result in reaching a point where the second function could be applied once and still end up with a value smaller than it could have been if the first function were applied fewer times.

This means we can apply the first function until we reach a point where the second function can be applied once and still result in a value smaller than it could have been if the first function were applied fewer times.

Let's apply the first function multiple times to reach such a point:

- Apply the first function once: $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, which implies that $f(f(n)) = \frac{8n-7}{8} = n - \frac{7}{8}$.
- Apply the first function again: $f(f(n)) = n - \frac{7}{8}$, which implies that $f(n) = \frac{n - \frac{7}{8}}{8} = \frac{n}{8} - \frac{7}{64}$.
- Apply the first function again: $f(n) = \frac{n}{8} - \frac{7}{64}$, which implies that $n = 8f(n) + \frac{7}{64}$.

Now, let's see if $n = 8f(n) + \frac{7}{64}$ is smaller than it could have been if the first function were applied fewer times:

- Apply the second function once: $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.

Notice that the first function was applied twice, which in the end ended up with a smaller value than it could have been if the first function were applied only once.

Since we have hypothesized that applying the first function multiple times would result in reaching a point where the second function could be applied once and still end up with a value smaller than it could have been if the first function were applied fewer times, we can confirm this by continuing to apply the first function and see if the second function can still be applied once and still result in a smaller value.

We see that applying the first function twice ended up with a value smaller than it could have been if the first function were applied only once, and since we have hypothesized that applying the first function multiple times would result in reaching a point where the second function could be applied once and still end up with a value smaller than it could have been if the first function were applied fewer times, we can confirm this by continuing to apply the first function and see if the second function can still be applied once and still result in a smaller value.

After applying the first function twice, we get $n = 8f(n) + \frac{7}{64}$. We can see that applying the second function once would result in a value smaller than it could have been if the first function were applied fewer times.

At this point, we can apply the second function once and get the desired result of $f(100)$.

So, let's apply the second function once to get $f(100)$:

$f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ where $n=100$, we get $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.

Now, let's apply the first function twice to get $f(50)$:

- Apply the first function once: $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, which implies that $f(f(n)) = 8n - 7$.
- Apply the first function again: $f(f(n)) = 8n - 7$, which implies that $f(n) = \frac{8n - 7}{8} = n - \frac{7}{8}$.
- Apply the first function again: $f(n) = n - \frac{7}{8}$, which implies that $n = 8f(n) + \frac{7}{8}$.

Substitute $n = 100$ into the equation $n = 8f(n) + \frac{7}{8}$, we get $100 = 8f(100) + \frac{7}{8}$.

Solve for $f(100)$, we get $f(100) = \frac{100 - \frac{7}{8}}{8} = \frac{79}{64}$.

Since $f(100)$ should be a positive integer, let's round $f(100)$ up to the nearest integer, which is $1$.

So, the final answer is $\boxed{1}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



From the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we can infer that the function $f$ applies three times to $n$ to get to its final value $8n-7$. 

We have another equation, $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, which defines how the function $f$ behaves for even inputs. 

We are given that $f(100)$ is the task that we are supposed to find. 

Let's start by applying the function $f$ twice on 100: $f(f(100))$. 

Using the second equation, we know that $f(2*100)=2f(100)+1$. Therefore, $f(200)=2f(100)+1$. 

Now, let's solve $f(200)$ for $f(100)$ using the first equation: $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. 

Putting $n=200$, we get $f(f(f(200)))=8*200-7=1600-7=1593$. 

We know that $f(200)=2f(100)+1$, so we can substitute it into the first equation to get $f(f(1593))=1593$. 

Now, we can use the second equation again, $f(2*f(100)+1)=2f(f(100))+1$. 

So, $f(2*f(100)+1)=2f(f(100))+1=1593$. 

Solving this equation for $f(100)$ would give us the final answer. However, this equation is quite complex and it is not straightforward to solve it directly using sympy. 

Therefore, we will try another approach. 

We know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ and $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. 

Let's consider the case when $n=100$. We have $f(2*100)=2f(100)+1$, which simplifies to $f(200)=2f(100)+1$. 

We can substitute $n=200$ in the first equation to get $f(f(f(200)))=8*200-7=1600-7=1593$. 

So, $f(f(200))=1593$. 

Using the second equation again, we get $f(2*f(100)+1)=1593$. 

Solving this equation for $f(100)$ would give us the final answer. 

Now, let's find the solution using sympy:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solve

def calculate_f():
    # Define symbols
    f100, f200 = symbols('f100 f200')

1. First, we are given the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. We can simplify this to $f(f(n))=4n+1$.
2. Then, we are given the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.
3. We can substitute $f(n)$ from the first equation to the second equation, which gives us $f(2n)=2(4n+1)+1$.
4. Simplify this to $f(2n)=8n+3$.
5. Now, we can substitute $n=4n$ into the equation $f(2n)=8n+3$, which gives us $f(8n)=8*4n+3$.
6. Simplify this to $f(8n)=32n+3$.
7. We know that $f(f(n))=4n+1$, so we can substitute $f(n)=4n+1$ into the equation $f(8n)=32n+3$, which gives us $f(32n+3)=32n+3$.
8. Now, we need to calculate $f(100)$. We know that $100=8*12+4$, so $f(100)=f(8*12+4)$.

3. Use the calculated values of f(n) to find f(100).

Since Sympy is not needed to solve this problem, let's do it with Python script:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def calculate_value():
    # Define the initial condition for f(f(f(n)))
    initial_condition = [0, 1, 5]

    # Since f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7, we can derive that f(n) = 1 when n = 1
    values = [1]

    # Use the equation f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1 to calculate f(n) stepwise
    for i in range(2, 101):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            values.append(2 * values[len(values) - 1] + 1)
        else:
            # When n is odd, calculate f(f(f(n))) using the initial condition
            values.append(8 * (i // 2) + 1)

    # Return the value of f(f(f(n)))
    return values[100]

result = calculate_value()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS Traceback: line 21, in calculate_value

IndexError: list index out of range

FAIL


INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
Traceback: line 21, in calculate_value
    return values[100]
IndexError: list index out of range

FAIL

```
The index error occurs because our loop only calculated up to 100, but we were trying to access the 101st element in the list. Let's fix this by calculating f(n) up to 200 and using the formula f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7 for odd n.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def calculate_value():
    # Define the initial condition for f(f(f(n)))
    initial_condition = [0, 1, 5]

    # Since f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7, we can derive that f(n) = 1 when n = 1
    values = [1]

    # Use the equation f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1 to calculate f(n) stepwise
    for i in range(2, 201):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            values.append(2 * values[len(values) - 1] + 1)
        else:
            # When n is odd, calculate f(f(f(n))) using the initial condition
            values.append(8 * i + 1)

    # Calculate f(100) using the derived formula
    f_100 = values[100 - 1]

    # Return the value of f(f(f(n)))
    return f_100

result = calculate_value()
print(result)
```

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. Notice that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. Given that we don't know what kind of function $f(n)$ is, it's hard to directly compute $f(n)$ from this equation. However, we can try to find $f(f(n))$ from it, which is equal to $f((8n-7)/8)$. 

2. Another equation we have is $f(2n) = 2f(n)+1$. By substituting $f(n)$ in the first equation with $2f(n)+1$, we get $f(2f(n)+1) = 8n - 7$, which gives us another equation. 

3. Notice that the right hand side of both equations (in step 1 and 2) is always a positive odd number, given that $n$ is a positive integer. Thus, so would be the left hand sides. But the left hand side of the second equation implies that $f(n)$ is always even. 

4. Combining these results, we can see that $f(n)$ must always be a positive odd number. 

Now, we are given that $f(100) = ?$. Let's try to find $f(100)$ step by step.

5. According the equation by step 2, we can get $f(2*100) = 2*f(f(100))+1$.

6. Given with the equation by step 1, we know that $f(f(f(100))) = 8*100 - 7 = 793$.

7. Thus we can get $f(200) = 2*793+1=2*793 = 1586$.

8. Substituting $f(100)$ into the equation from step 2, we get $f(200) = 2f(f(100))+1 = 1586$, so we have $2f(100)+1 = 1586$, and $f(100) = 1586/2 - 1/2 = 792.5 - 0.5 = 792$.

So, the answer is $\boxed{792}$.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1) Since we need to find $f(f(f(n)))$, where $n = 100$, we can set $n = 100$ to begin with.

2) We are given that $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. Therefore, $f(2 \cdot 100) = 2f(100) + 1$.

3) However, from the first equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we know that $f(f(100)) = 8 \cdot 100 - 7$.

4) Now we can substitute step 2 into the first equation to get $f(f(f(100))) = f(800 - 7)$.

5) As a result, we can equate the expressions from steps 3 and 4 to solve for $f(100)$: $8 \cdot 100 - 7 = f(800 - 7)$, so $f(100) = 8 \cdot 100 - 7$.

Finally, we can implement the above steps in Python script:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We can infer that f(1) = 3 because f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 and f(f(f(1))) = f(f(3)) = f(9) and f(9) = 8*1 - 7 = 1.
2. Then f(3) = 1 because f(f(f(3))) = 8*3 - 7 = 19 and f(f(f(3))) = f(f(19)) = f(1) = 1.
3. From f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1, we can infer that f(2) = 5.
4. We can also infer that f(6) = 9 and f(9) = 6 because f(f(f(6))) = 8*6 - 7 = 43 and f(f(f(6))) = f(f(43)) = f(?) = 6 and f(f(f(9))) = 8*9 - 7 = 67 and f(f(f(9))) = f(f(67)) = f(?) = 9.
5. From these results, we can infer that f(43) = 6 and f(67) = 9.
6. Now, we can infer that f(86) = 129 and f(129) = 86 because f(f(f(86))) = 8*86 - 7 = 687 and f(f(f(86))) = f(f(129)) = f(?) = 86 and f(f(f(129))) = 8*129 - 7 = 1027 and f(f(f(129))) = f(f(86)) = f(?) = 129.
7. From these results, we can infer that f(1027) = 129 and f(687) = 86.
8. Finally, we can calculate f(100) by finding the sequence of values that f(100) would go through based on the given functions. We know that f(100) = f(f(687)) = f(?) = 86.

So, the answer is $\boxed{86}$.

Oops, our code didn't return the correct answer. Let's try again:

We missed one small but important detail in our solution. We assumed that f(n) will always be <= n for all n. However, from f(f(f(100))) = f(?) = 86, we can see that f(100) > 100. This goes against our assumption. So, we need to revise our solution to take this into account.

Let's start from the beginning:

1. We can still infer that f(1) = 3 because f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 and f(f(f(1))) = f(f(3)) = f(9) and f(9) = 8*1 - 7 = 1.
2. Then f(3) = 1 because f(f(f(3))) = 8*3 - 7 = 19 and f(f(f(3))) = f(f(19)) = f(1) = 1.
3. From f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1, we can infer that f(2) = 5.
4. We can also infer that f(6) = 9 and f(9) = 6 because f(f(f(6))) = 8*6 - 7 = 43 and f(f(f(6))) = f(f(43)) = f(?) = 6 and f(f(f(9))) = 8*9 - 7 = 67 and f(f(f(9))) = f(f(67)) = f(?) = 9.
5. From these results, we can infer that f(43) = 6 and f(67) = 9.
6. Now, we can infer that f(86) = 129 and f(129) = 86 because f(f(f(86))) = 8*86 - 7

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. If we set $n = 1$ in the second equation, we have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.
2. Let's denote $f(1)$ as $a$. So we have $f(2) = 2a + 1$.
3. Now let's apply the first equation twice. We have $f(f(f(2))) = 8*2 - 7 = 9$.
4. We know that $f(f(f(2))) = f(f(2a + 1)) = f(2f(a) + 1)$.
5. Now we substitute $f(2)$ from step 2 into this equation. So we have $f(2f(a) + 1) = f(2a + 1) = 9$.
6. This implies that $f(f(a) + 1) = 9$.
7. We substitute $f(a)$ as $a$ into this equation. So we have $f(a + 1) = 9$.
8. From the second equation, we have $f(1) = 2f(1) + 1$. This implies $f(1) = -1$.
9. Substituting $f(1)$ as $-1$ into equation 7, we get $f(0) = 9$.
10. Now we substitute $f(0) = 9$ into the first equation. So we have $f(f(f(0))) = 8*0 - 7 = -7$.
11. This implies that $f(9) = -7$.
12. Substituting $f(9)$ as $-7$ into the second equation, we get $f(18) = 2f(9) + 1 = 2*(-7) + 1 = -13$.
13. Substituting $f(18)$ as $-13$ into the second equation, we get $f(36) = 2f(18) + 1 = 2*(-13) + 1 = -25$.
14. Substituting $f(36)$ as $-25$ into the second equation, we get $f(72) = 2f(36) + 1 = 2*(-25) + 1 = -50$.
15. Substituting $f(72)$ as $-50$ into the second equation, we get $f(144) = 2f(72) + 1 = 2*(-50) + 1 = -100$.
16. Substituting $f(144)$ as $-100$ into the second equation, we get $f(288) = 2f(144) + 1 = 2*(-100) + 1 = -200$.
17. Substituting $f(288)$ as $-200$ into the second equation, we get $f(576) = 2f(288) + 1 = 2*(-200) + 1 = -400$.

From steps 14 to 17, we can see that the value of $f(n)$ is getting closer to $-400$. If we continue the process, we will find that $f(100)$ will also be close to $-400$. Therefore, we can approximate $f(100)$ as $-400$.

So the result is $\boxed{-400}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



To solve this problem, we can use functional equations and mathematical reasoning. We don't have to use any complex or complicated libraries or functions, as the problem seems to be simple enough.

Let's break it down:

1. We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. This means that applying the function three times gives us the same result as $8n-7$.

2. We also know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. This means that when we double $n$, the result is twice the value of the function at $n$ plus one.

We can use these two equations to find the value of $f(100)$.

Let's start by applying the function to 100 three times:

$$f(f(f(100))) = 8 \cdot 100 - 7 = 800 - 7 = 793$$

Now, we know that $f(f(f(100))) = 793$. But from the first equation, we know that $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. So we can set up the equation $793 = 8n - 7$ and solve for $n$:

$$8n - 7 = 793$$
$$8n = 793 + 7$$
$$8n = 800$$
$$n = \frac{800}{8}$$
$$n = 100$$

So, when we apply the function three times to 100, we get 793. This means that $f(793) = 100$.

Now, we can use the second equation to find the value of $f(793)$:

$$f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$$
$$f(793) = 2f(396.5) + 1$$

But we know that $f(793) = 100$, so we can substitute that in:

$$100 = 2f(396.5) + 1$$
$$99 = 2f(396.5)$$
$$f(396.5) = \frac{99}{2}$$

Now we can substitute this back into the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$:

$$f(793) = 2f(396.5) + 1$$
$$100 = 2 \cdot \frac{99}{2} + 1$$
$$100 = 99 + 1$$

So we have found that $f(100) = 100$.

The answer is $\boxed{100}$.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ can be used to express $f(n)$ in terms of $n$. Let's denote $f(n)$ by $x$ for simplicity. The equation changes to $f(x) = 8n - 7$. By the second given condition, we know that $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1 = 2x + 1$. We are interested in finding $f(100)$, so we substitute $n = 50$ into the equation to get $f(x) = 8*50 - 7 = 393$.

2. Now, we can substitute $x = 393$ into the equation $f(2n) = 2x + 1$ to get $f(n) = 2*393 + 1 = 787$.

3. Finally, we can substitute $n = 50$ into the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to get $f(787) = 8*50 - 7 = 393$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. It might be tempting to use `n = symbols('n')` to define $n$ in Sympy, but note that $n$ is already a built-in function, so you cannot use it as a variable name. Instead, let's denote $f(n)$ with the symbol `f_n`.

2. From the given conditions, we can see that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. These are recursive relations which resemble the functional equations.

3. Let's substitute $n = 1$ in the first equation. We get $f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = 1$. So, the minimum $n$ for which the first equation holds is $n = 3$ because $f(3) = 1$.

4. Now let's try to find the function $f(n)$ using this equation. We can see that $f(f(f(n)))$ is equivalent to $f(f(n)^2)$. Therefore, we have $f(f(n)^2) = 8n - 7$.

5. Now, let's substitute $n = 2$ in the second equation. We get $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$. We don't know the value of $f(2)$ yet, but we can express it in terms of $f(1)$. From $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, we get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.

6. Now, let's substitute $n = 1$ in the second equation. We get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. We know that $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$ from the previous step, so we can equate these two expressions to find the value of $f(1)$.

7. From $f(f(n)^2) = 8n - 7$, we can substitute $n = 1$ to find $f(1)$. We get $f(1) = 1$.

8. Now, let's substitute $f(1) = 1$ in the equation $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. We get $f(2) = 2*1 + 1 = 3$.

9. Now, let's substitute $f(2) = 3$ in the equation $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$. We get $f(4) = 2*3 + 1 = 7$.

10. Now, let's substitute $n = 4$ in the first equation. We get $f(f(f(4))) = 8*4 - 7 = 25$.

11. We know that $f(f(f(4))) = 25$, $f(f(4)) = 25$ and $f(4) = 7$. So, let's substitute $n = 7$ in the second equation. We get $f(14) = 2f(7) + 1 = 2*25 + 1 = 51$.

12. Now, let's substitute $n = 14$ in the first equation. We get $f(f(f(14))) = 8*14 - 7 = 109$.

13. We know that $f(f(f(14))) = 109$, $f(f(14)) = 109$ and $f(14) = 51$. Let's substitute $n = 51$ in the second equation. We get $f(102) = 2f(51) + 1 = 2*109 + 1 = 219$.

14. Finally, let's substitute $n = 102$ in the first equation. We get $f(f(f(102))) = 8*102 - 7 = 809$.

15. We know that $f(f(f(102))) = 809$, $f(f(102)) = 809$ and $f(102) = 219$. Let's substitute $n = 219$ in the second equation. We get $f(438) = 2f(219) + 1 = 2*809 + 1 = 1619$.

So, $f(100) = \boxed{1619}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:




1. Initially, we don't know the explicit formula for $f(n)$. However, we can set $n = f(n)$ in the first equation and substitute $f(f(n))$ into it. This will result in a simple equation which can help us find the function.

2. With the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we set $n=f(n)$, so the equation becomes $f(f(f(f(n))))=8f(n)-7$. 

3. Then we substitute $f(f(n))$ into the equation with the second equation provided. The equation becomes $f(2f(f(n)) + 1) = 8f(n) - 7$.

4. Now, let's substitute $2f(f(n)) + 1$ into the equation with the second equation provided: $f(8f(n) - 7) = 2f(2f(f(n)) + 1) + 1$.

5. This will lead to another equation $f(8f(n) - 7) = 2f(8f(f(n)) - 7) + 1$. It's a bit tricky to solve this equation directly, but we can see a pattern here. 

To find the function $f(n)$, we need to find a $f(n)$ that satisfies this equation. 

Let's assume $f(n)$ is a linear function, i.e., $f(n)=kn+b$. Substituting this into the equation gives $f(8kn+8b-7)=2f(8kn+8b-7)+1$, which simplifies to $f(8kn+8b-7)=1$. 

Now, we can solve the equation $kn + b = 1$ for $k$ and $b$. Here we have a system of linear equations: 

1. $k = 8k$ 
2. $b - 7 = 1$

Solving this system of equations gives $k = 0$ and $b = 8$. Hence, the function $f(n)$ is a constant function with $f(n) = 8$.

Finally, we need to find $f(100)$, which is $8$ in this case.

```python

def find_f_100():
    f_n = 8
    return f_n

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, we can see that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ gives us some clues about the function $f$, since it involves a nested function with $f(n)$ three times.

2. The second condition, $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, is a recurrence relation that helps us understand the behavior of the function $f$.

3. Based on these two conditions, we can start by calculating $f(1)$ and $f(2)$.

4. Given $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$, we can deduce that $f(1)=n$ is a root of the equation $f(f(f(n)))=n$, since $f(f(f(1)))=1$ and $f(1)=1$.

5. Applying the second condition, we have $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Since $n=1$, we get $f(2)=2f(1)+1=2*1+1=3$.

6. Now, we can use $f(2)$ to find $f(4)$, $f(8)$, etc., by repeatedly applying the second condition. As an example, $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2*3+1=7$.

7. Similarly, we can find $f(8)$, $f(16)$, etc., by doubling the previous result and adding 1.

8. Notice that, based on the first condition, we have $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. This means that $f(n)$ must be a number that, when substituted into the function $f(f(f(n)))$ three times, results in $8n-7$.

9. Based on the recurrence relation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can find $f(100)$ by repeatedly doubling and adding 1 to $f(50)$, $f(25)$, etc., until we reach $f(1)$.

10. As we have calculated, $f(1)=1$. Now, we can find $f(2)=3$, $f(4)=7$, $f(8)=15$, and so on.

11. To find $f(100)$, we can simply double $f(50)$ and add 1, then double and add 1 to $f(25)$, and so on, until we reach $f(1)$. 

12. Using the recurrence relation, we can calculate $f(100)$ as follows:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def calculate_f_100():
    f_1 = 1
    f_2 = 2 * f_1 + 1

    f_100 = 2 * f_8 + 1
    return f_100

f_100 = calculate_f_100()

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



We have two conditions given:
1. $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$
2. $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$

First, let's simplify the first condition. In order to get rid of the $f(f(n))$ term, we can consider $n = f(m)$ for some $m$. Then, $f(f(f(m)))$ becomes $f(f(n))$ or $f(f(f(m)))$. Substituting $n = f(m)$ into the first condition, we get:

$f(f(f(f(m)))) = 8f(m) - 7$.

But, from the second condition, $f(f(f(f(m)))) = f(2f(f(m))) = 2f(f(f(m))) + 1$. Hence, we get:

$2f(f(f(m))) + 1 = 8f(m) - 7$,
or
$2f(f(f(m))) = 8f(m) - 8$.

So, the first condition simplifies to:

$f(f(f(m))) = 4f(m) - 4$.

Now, we can use the second condition to get some information about $f(m)$. If we set $n = m$ in the second condition, we get:

$f(2m) = 2f(m) + 1$.

But from the first condition, $f(2m) = 8m - 7$. Hence, we get:

$8m - 7 = 2f(m) + 1$,
or
$f(m) = 4m - 4$.

Since this holds for any $m$, we can say that $f(n) = 4n - 4$ for all $n$. 

Now, substituting $n = 100$ into $f(n) = 4n - 4$, we get $f(100) = 4 \times 100 - 4 = 396$.

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{396}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The given function has two conditions, but we are trying to find $f(100)$. The first condition is $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, so we can't use it directly to calculate $f(100)$. 
2. However, we can use the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to simplify the problem. We can see that $f(100)$ is $2f(50)+1$. Then $f(50)$ is $2f(25)+1$. 
3. We keep applying the second condition, and we get $f(100) = 2(2(2(2f(12.5))+1)+1)+1$.
4. But we can't go on applying the second condition on $f(12.5)$ because $f$ accepts only integer values.
5. So we need to use the first condition to substitute $f(12.5)$. We can rewrite $f(12.5)$ as $f(2f(6.25))$.
6. And we know that $f(6.25)$ is $2f(3.125)+1$. Now we have $f(12.5)$ in a form that we can use the second condition on.
7. We keep applying this process until we get $f(100)$ in terms of $f(1)$.
8. Then we can use the first condition to substitute $f(1)$, and we get $f(100)$.

Let's write a Python program to achieve this:

```python

After finding the value of `f_100`, we can easily calculate the value of `f(100)` from the equation. Since we are looking for the positive integer value, we will ignore the negative sign and divide the numerator by 64.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def calculate_f_100():

The value of $f(100)$ is $0$. However, it doesn't match our expectation. Let's analyze the steps and find the error.

We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. But in our steps, we applied the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ three times. This means we are assuming $f(n)$ is a linear function. However, from the first condition, we know that $f(f(f(n)))$ is not necessarily equal to $f(n)$ for $n \neq 1$. 

So we need to use a different approach. Instead of trying to calculate $f(100)$ directly, let's use the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to find a pattern.

We know that $f(100)$ is the result of applying the function $f$ three times on 100. Let's start by finding the results of applying the function $f$ twice on 100:

- $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$
- $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$
- $f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1$
- $f(12.5) = 2f(6.25) + 1$
- $f(6.25) = 2f(3.125) + 1$
- $f(3.125) = 2f(1.5625) + 1$
- $f(1.5625) = 2f(0.78125) + 1$
- $f(0.78125) = 2f(0.390625) + 1$
- $f(0.390625) = 2f(0.1953125) + 1$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We are given two equations: $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. The first one is a recursive one, and the second one is a linear one.

2. To solve for $f(100)$, we need to plug 100 into the function $f(n)$, which seems recursive at first. However, we can notice that there is a pattern in the recursive function. If we plug 1 into the recursive function, we'll get $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$, which means $f(1)=1$.

3. Now, we can plug 2 into the recursive function and we'll get $f(f(f(2)))=8*2-7=9$, which means $f(2)=9$.

4. Then, we plug 4 into the recursive function and we'll get $f(f(f(4)))=8*4-7=21$, which means $f(4)=21$.

5. As we can see, the result of plugging $2^n$ into the recursive function is $8*2^n-7$, which means $f(2^n)=8*2^n-7$.

6. Now, we can plug 100 into the function $f(n)$, which is $f(2^2*5^2)$. According to our pattern, we have $f(2^2*5^2)=8*2^2*5^2-7=8*4*25-7=8*100-7=793$.
