Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, we need to know that $|a|$ denotes the absolute value of $a$. The equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, which means either the first term is zero, or the second term is zero, or both are zero. 

So, we have two sets of equations:
1. $|x + y| - 10 = 0$, $|x - y| - 10 = 0$, $|x| - 8 = 0$, and $|y| - 8 = 0$.
2. Either the first term or the second term is zero.

Let's solve the first set of equations:

1. $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ implies $|x + y| = 10$, so $x + y = \pm 10$.
2. $|x - y| - 10 = 0$ implies $|x - y| = 10$, so $x - y = \pm 10$.
3. $|x| - 8 = 0$ implies $|x| = 8$, so $x = \pm 8$.
4. $|y| - 8 = 0$ implies $|y| = 8$, so $y = \pm 8$.

From 1 and 2 we can find the possible combinations of $x$ and $y$:
$(x, y) = (8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(2, 8)$, $(2, -8)$, $(-2, 8)$, and $(-2, -8)$.

These points are the vertices of a square with side length 16. To find the area of this square, we can use the formula for the area of a square, which is $side^2$. Therefore, the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

The final answer is $\boxed{256}$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The equation is equivalent to $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. The only way all four of these equations can be satisfied is if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Plotting these four points on a coordinate plane, we see that they form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

```python

def area_of_polygon():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :

```
The area of the convex polygon is 256.
The answer is $\boxed{256}$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The equation is satisfied if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This means that either $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The absolute value equations break down into four cases:
1. $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
2. $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
3. $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
4. $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.
These equations define the lines and axes that form the polygon.
The polygon is a square with side length 16 (since the distance from $(8,8)$ to $(-8, -8)$ is 16 in both the x and y directions).
The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: 256
So, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $\boxed{256}$
