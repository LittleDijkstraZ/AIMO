Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:


The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either of the terms must be zero. This gives us four absolute value equations to solve:

1. $|x + y| - 10 = 0$,
2. $|x - y| - 10 = 0$,
3. $|x| - 8 = 0$,
4. $|y| - 8 = 0$.

Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon:

1. For equation 1, $|x + y| = 10$, so $x + y = \pm 10$.
2. For equation 2, $|x - y| = 10$, so $x - y = \pm 10$.
3. For equation 3, $|x| = 8$, so $x = \pm 8$.
4. For equation 4, $|y| = 8$, so $y = \pm 8$.

By solving these systems of equations, we find the vertices of the polygon:
\[
(\pm 8, 0), (0, \pm 8), (\pm 10, \pm 0)
\]

These points form a square with side length 16. The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of the polygon is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The equation given in the problem is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. This expression is zero if and only if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This occurs if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

The second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. This expression is zero if and only if both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This occurs if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersection of these lines form a square with side length 10 (from the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$), so the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100.

Here is the Python code that calculates the area:
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    side_length = 10
    area = side_length**2
    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 100

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
100
```
The area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is $\boxed{100}$.

 The provided equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero, or the second expression is zero, or both are zero.

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. For this expression to be zero, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the conditions for a square with side length 10 centered at the origin.

The second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. For this expression to be zero, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This is a square with side length 16 centered at the origin.

The intersection of these two squares forms a smaller square with side length 8 centered at the origin. The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$. So the area of the convex polygon is 64 square units.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    side_length = 8
    area = side_length**2
    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

The area of the convex polygon is 64 square units. The answer is $\boxed{64}$.

Assistant:

 The equation given is a product of two terms equals to zero. This means that either the first term equals to zero or the second term equals to zero.
The first term is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, and it equals to zero when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
The second term is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$, and it equals to zero when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The solutions to the first equation are all points $(x, y)$ such that the sum of their absolute values is 10, and the solutions to the second equation are all points $(x, y)$ such that the absolute values of their individual coordinates are 8.
The points satisfying these conditions form a square with side length 16 (since the maximum absolute value of a coordinate is 8 for both x and y), so the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$.

Assistant:

 The expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives $x = \pm 10$ and $y = 0$ or $x = 0$ and $y = \pm 10$.
Similarly, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
The intersections of these points are $(8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, and $(-8, -8)$. These four points form a square with side length $16$.
The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is true if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The first two equations imply $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which describe two lines in the coordinate plane.
The second two equations imply $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which describe two more lines in the coordinate plane.
The intersection points of these four lines form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
So, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.

The first term is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. This term equals zero if and only if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which further implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, -2)$, and $(-8, 2)$.

The second term is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. This term equals zero if and only if both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which further implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$.

Therefore, the points satisfying the equation are the vertices of two squares: one with side length 16 and the other with side length 16. The convex polygon formed by these points is a rectangle with length 16 and width 16. The area of this rectangle is therefore $16 \times 16 = 256$. 

So the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units.
The answer is: $256$
