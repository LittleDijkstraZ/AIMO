Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, observe that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get four lines: $y = -x + 10$, $y = -x - 10$, $y = x + 10$, and $y = x - 10$.

For the second case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

Now, we plot these lines on the coordinate plane and find the vertices of the polygon. The vertices are $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$. These vertices form a square with side length 16.

Finally, we calculate the area of the square. The area of a square is the square of the length of its side, so the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is $256$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solve

def calculate_area():
    # Define the variables
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # Solve the equations
    solutions1 = solve([abs(x + y) - 10, abs(x - y) - 10], [x, y])
    solutions2 = solve([abs(x) - 8, abs(y) - 8], [x, y])

    # Calculate the vertices of the polygon
    vertices = [(-8, 8), (-8, -8), (8, 8), (8, -8)]

    # Calculate the area of the square
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length**2

    return area

result = calculate_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, we need to understand that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So, the equation we have is equivalent to two separate equations:

$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$$
$$((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$

For the first equation to be true, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us four equations:

1) $x + y = 10$
2) $x + y = -10$
3) $x - y = 10$
4) $x - y = -10$

For the second equation to be true, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us four more equations:

5) $x = 8$
6) $x = -8$
7) $y = 8$
8) $y = -8$

Now we can solve these equations:

1) From equation (1) and (5), we get $y = 10 - x = 10 - 8 = 2$.
2) From equation (2) and (6), we get $y = -10 - x = -10 - (-8) = -2$.
3) From equation (3) and (7), we get $x = 10 + y = 10 + 8 = 18$, but $x = 18$ doesn't satisfy equation (7), so this solution doesn't exist.
4) From equation (4) and (8), we get $x = -10 + y = -10 + 8 = -2$, but $x = -2$ doesn't satisfy equation (8), so this solution doesn't exist.

So the only possible solution is the point $(x, y) = (8, 2)$.

The other three points can be found by similar analysis:

1) From equation (1) and (7), we get $x = 10 - y = 10 - 8 = 2$.
2) From equation (2) and (8), we get $x = -10 + y = -10 + 8 = -2$.
3) From equation (3) and (5), we get $y = 10 - x = 10 - 2 = 8$.
4) From equation (4) and (6), we get $y = -10 + x = -10 + 2 = -8$.

So the other three points are $(x, y) = (2, 8)$, $(x, y) = (-2, -8)$, and $(x, y) = (-2, 8)$.

Now we have the four vertices of the square: $(8, 2)$, $(2, 8)$, $(-2, -8)$, and $(-2, 8)$. The side length of the square is the distance between $(8, 2)$ and $(2, 8)$, which is $\sqrt{(8 - 2)^2 + (2 - 8)^2} = \sqrt{36 + 36} = \sqrt{72} = 6\sqrt{2}$.

The area of the square is the side length squared, so the area is $(6\sqrt{2})^2 = 72$.

The answer is: $72$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We are given a system of equations: $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$
2. For the product to be equal to zero, either one of the factors must be zero. So we have two cases:
   a. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
   b. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
3. From case (a), we get $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$. 
4. From case (b), we get $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. 
5. So the points that satisfy the system of equations are: $(\pm 10, \pm 10)$ and $(\pm 8, \pm 8)$. 
6. The convex polygon formed by these points is a square with side length 16 (from the points $(\pm 8, \pm 8)$).
7. The area of a square is given by side length squared, so the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

The area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$

We are given an equation: $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. The equation equals to zero if and only if either of the two products equals to zero. This gives us two sets of equations:

1) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

2) $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first set of equations:

1a) $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ implies $x + y = \pm 10$.
1b) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ which implies $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

For the second set of equations:

2a) $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ implies $x - y = \pm 10$.
2b) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ which implies $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

Combining these results, we see that the points satisfying the original equation are:

1) $(8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.
2) $(8, 2)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(8, -2)$, and $(-8, 2)$.
3) $(2, 8)$, $(-2, -8)$, $(2, -8)$, and $(-2, 8)$.

These points form a rectangle with side lengths $10$ and $16$. The area of this rectangle is $10 \times 16 = 160$. So the area of the convex polygon is $160$.

Now let's write a python script to calculate the area of the polygon:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    # side lengths of the rectangle
    length = 10
    width = 16

    # calculate the area of the rectangle
    area = length * width

    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 160

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
160
```

The area of the convex polygon is $160$.
The answer is: $160$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm10$ and $x - y = \pm10$. Solving these systems of equations, we get the four vertices of the square: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$.

Similarly, the expression $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm8$ and $y = \pm8$. So we get another square with vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The convex polygon formed by the intersection of these two squares is a smaller square with side length 6 (since $8 - 2 = 6$). Therefore, the area of this convex polygon is $6^2 = 36$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 36. The answer is: $\boxed{36}$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So, the equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ must hold. 

1. If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the four lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. The region enclosed by these lines is a square with side length 20. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.

2. If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. The region enclosed by these lines is a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

The total area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of these two squares, which is $400 + 256 = 656$. So the area of the convex polygon is 656.

However, this problem might have a misunderstanding since the product of two numbers can be zero even if both numbers are not zero. For example, if we have the equation $(x - 1)(x - 2) = 0$, this equation equals to zero when $x = 1$ or $x = 2$. So, in our problem, we must consider both conditions separately and then sum up the areas.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    # The area of the square formed by the lines x + y = 10, x + y = -10, x - y = 10, and x - y = -10
    area1 = 20**2

    # The area of the square formed by the lines x = 8, x = -8, y = 8, and y = -8
    area2 = 16**2

    # The total area of the convex polygon
    total_area = area1 + area2

    return total_area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 656

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
656
```
The area of the convex polygon is 656. Since the problem statement asks for a positive integer, we can take the result as it is. The answer is $\boxed{656}$.
