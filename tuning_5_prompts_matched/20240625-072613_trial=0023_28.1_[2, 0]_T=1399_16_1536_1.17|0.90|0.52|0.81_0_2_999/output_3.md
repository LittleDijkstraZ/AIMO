Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The equation $AB = 0$ is equivalent to the two conditions $A = 0$ and $B = 0$. In this problem, the equation is a product of two polynomials that should be equal to zero, hence it implies that each factor must be zero. Therefore, we have the following four conditions:
   a. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
   b. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
   c. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
   d. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

2. Each of the above conditions implies that $|\cdot|$ equals $10$ or $8$. Specifically, from conditions a and b, we have $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$, which represent two lines parallel to the x and y axis, respectively. From conditions c and d, we have $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$, which represent two lines parallel to the x and y axis, respectively.

3. The four lines intersect at the following points: $(8, 0), (0, 8), (-8, 0), (0, -8), (0, 0)$. Plotting these points in the coordinate plane, we see that they form a square with side length $16$.

4. The area of this square is the square of its side length, so the area is $16^2 = 256$. 

The result of the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{256}$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The equation involves absolute value functions, which makes it a bit tricky to solve directly. However, we can notice that the product of two expressions is zero if and only if at least one of the expressions is zero. Therefore, the points that satisfy the equation must satisfy either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

Each of these equations implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$. These equations describe 8 lines in the plane, and the points that satisfy any of them form a square with side length 16. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$. 

We can write this solution as a Python function:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is $\boxed{256}$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The equation is satisfied if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This means that either $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The absolute value equations break down into four cases:
1. $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
2. $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
3. $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
4. $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.
These equations define the lines and axes that form the polygon.
The polygon is a square with side length 16 (since the distance from $(8,8)$ to $(-8, -8)$ is 16 in both the x and y directions).
The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: 256
So, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $\boxed{256}$
