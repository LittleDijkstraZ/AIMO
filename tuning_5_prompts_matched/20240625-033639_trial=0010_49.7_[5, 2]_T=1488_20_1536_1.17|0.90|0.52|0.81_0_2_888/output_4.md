 To find $f(100)$, we can use the function definition to build up a value for $f(100)$ iteratively. The definition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ tells us that to find $f(n)$ we must find a value $m$ such that $f(m)=n$. Using the second definition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can express any even number $2n$ in terms of $f$. Let's apply these facts to find $f(100)$.

First, notice that $8\cdot100-7=793$. So $f(f(f(100)))=793$ means that $f(m)=100$, where $m$ is a value such that $f(f(m))=793$.

Now, using the second definition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can express $793$ as an even number plus $1$. The largest even number less than $793$ is $792$. We have $792=2\cdot396$. Thus, $793=792+1=2\cdot396+1=2\cdot(2\cdot198)+1=2^3\cdot(2\cdot99)+1=2^4\cdot99+1$.

Therefore, we can define $m$ as $f(99)$. Then, $f(f(m))=f(f(99))=793$. Now we need to find $f(99)$.

Again using the second definition, we have $f(198)=2f(99)+1$. From the result above, $793=2^4\cdot99+1=2\cdot(2^3\cdot99)+1=2\cdot(2\cdot(2^2\cdot99))+1=2\cdot(2\cdot(2\cdot(2\cdot99)))+1=2\cdot(2\cdot(2\cdot f(198)))+1$. So $793=2\cdot(2\cdot(2\cdot f(198)))+1$, which simplifies to $793=8\cdot f(198)+1$, or $792=8\cdot f(198)$, and therefore $f(198)=99$.

So now we know $f(198)=99$, and we can find $f(99)$ using the second definition: $f(198)=2f(99)+1$, so $99=2f(99)+1$, and therefore $98=2f(99)$, and $f(99)=49$.

Finally, we have $f(99)=49$, and now we can find $f(100)$. Using the second definition again, we have $f(200)=2f(100)+1$. But we know $f(200)=f(f(f(100)))=793=2^4\cdot99+1=2\cdot(2^3\cdot99)+1=2\cdot(2\cdot(2^2\cdot99))+1=2\cdot(2\cdot(2\cdot f(200)))+1$, so $793=2\cdot(2\cdot(2\cdot f(200)))+1$, which simplifies to $792=8\cdot f(200)$, and therefore $f(200)=99$. Then, $f(200)=2f(100)+1$, so $99=2f(100)+1$, and therefore $98=2f(100)$, and $f(100)=49$.

Therefore, $f(100)=\boxed{49}$. The answer is: $49$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



If we set $n = 2$ in the second equation, we have $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$.
If we set $n = f(2)$ in the first equation, we have $f(f(f(f(2)))) = 8f(2) - 7$.
By substituting $f(f(f(2))) = f(4)$ from the previous equation, we have $f(f(4)) = 8f(2) - 7$.
If we substitute $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$ into the previous equation, we have $f(2f(2) + 1) = 8f(2) - 7$.
This implies that for $n = f(2)$, the function $f$ also satisfies the first equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$.

Now let's set $n = 1$ in the second equation, we have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.
If we set $n = f(1)$ in the first equation, we have $f(f(f(f(1)))) = 8f(1) - 7$.
By substituting $f(f(f(1))) = f(2)$ from the previous equation, we have $f(f(2)) = 8f(1) - 7$.
If we substitute $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$ into the previous equation, we have $f(2f(1) + 1) = 8f(1) - 7$.
This implies that for $n = f(1)$, the function $f$ also satisfies the first equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$.

From the above analysis, we can see that the function $f$ satisfies the first equation for all positive integers $n$.

Now let's set $n = 1$ in the first equation, we have $f(f(f(1))) = 8 - 7 = 1$, so $f(f(1)) = 1$.
If we set $n = f(1)$ in the second equation, we have $f(2f(1)) = 2f(f(1)) + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3$.
So $f(2) = 3$.

By substituting $n = 2$ in the second equation, we have $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2*3 + 1 = 7$.

Continuing in this way, we can find that $f(8) = 15$, $f(16) = 31$, and so on.

We observe that $f(2^k) = 2^k - 1$ for all positive integers $k$.

Now we want to calculate $f(100)$, which is equivalent to finding the power of 2 closest to 100. The largest power of 2 less than 100 is $2^6 = 64$. So we can express 100 as $2^6 + 36$.

By the second equation, we have $f(100) = f(2^6 + 36) = 2f(2^6) + 1 = 2*(2^6 - 1) + 1 = 2*63 + 1 = 127$.

So the value of $f(100)$ is 127.
The answer is: $127$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Step 1: We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. We want to find $f(100)$, so we can substitute $n=50$ into this equation, because $f(50) = 100$. So, $f(f(f(50)))=8*50-7=393$. We also know that $f(f(f(50)))=f(f(100))$ from the substitution. So, $f(f(100))=393$.

Step 2: Now we know $f(100)$ and we can substitute it into the second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. If we let $n=50$, then $f(100)=2f(50)+1$. We already know $f(100)=393$ and $f(50)=100$ from step 1, so we can substitute these values in and get $393=2*100+1$, which is true. So our values for $f(50)$ and $f(100)$ are consistent with each other and the second equation.

Step 3: Now we can substitute $n=50$ into $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ again to find $f(f(50))=8*50-7=393$. But we know $f(f(50))=f(100)$ from step 1, so $f(100)=393$.

Step 4: So finally, we have $f(100)=393$. So the answer is $\boxed{393}$. However, this does not seem to be correct, since we cannot have a function that gives 393 when we plug in 100. 

Let's reconsider the problem:

The first equation is given as $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. By substituting $n=1$, we get $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$. That is, $f(f(f(1)))=1$. Since $f(f(f(1)))$ equals 1, it means that the function $f$ when applied three times to 1 gives 1. The only possible function that satisfies this condition is the identity function, i.e., $f(x) = x$ for all $x$.

Let's verify that this function satisfies all the given conditions:

1. For the first condition, $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, if $f(x) = x$, then $f(f(f(n))) = f(f(n)) = f(n) = n$. But $8n - 7 \neq n$ for any $n$, so the identity function does not satisfy the first condition. Therefore, there must be a mistake in our reasoning.

2. For the second condition, $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. If $f(x) = x$, then $f(2n) = 2n$ and $2f(n) + 1 = 2n + 1$. Since $2n = 2n + 1$, the identity function also does not satisfy the second condition.

So it seems that our initial assumption that the function is the identity function is incorrect. Let's try another approach.

Let's assume $f(1) = a$. From the first equation, we have $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$, so $f(a) = 1$. Again, from the first equation, we have $f(f(f(a)))=8a-7=1$, so $f(1) = 8a - 8$. But we know that $f(1) = a$, so we have $a = 8a - 8$, which implies $a = 1$. So $f(1) = 1$.

Now let's try to find $f(2)$. From the second equation, we have $f(2*1)=2f(1)+1$, so $f(2) = 2*1 + 1 = 3$. Similarly, we can find $f(3) = 5$, $f(5) = 9$, and so on. It seems that the function is defined as $f(n) = 2n - 1$ for all positive integers $n$.

Let's check if this function satisfies both conditions:

1. For the first condition, $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. If $f(n) = 2n - 1$, then $f(f(f(n))) = f(f(2n - 1)) = f(4n - 3) = 8n - 7$, which is equal to $8n - 7$. So the function $f(n) = 2n - 1$ satisfies the first condition.

2. For the second condition, $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. If $f(n) = 2n - 1$, then $f(2n) = 4n - 1$ and $2f(n) + 1 = 2(2n - 1) + 1 = 4n - 1$. So the function $f(n) = 2n - 1$ also satisfies the second condition.

Therefore, the function $f(n) = 2n - 1$ is the solution to the given problem. Now we can find $f(100)$ by substituting $n = 50$ into $f(n) = 2n - 1$: $f(100) = 2*100 - 1 = 199$. So the value of $f(100)$ is 199. The answer is: $f(100) = 199$.

However, we have a mistake in our calculations:

The function $f(n) = 2n - 1$ gives $f(100) = 2*100 - 1 = 199$. But when we substitute this into the first equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we get $f(f(f(100)))=8*100-7=793$, which does not equal 199. So the function $f(n) = 2n - 1$ does not satisfy both conditions simultaneously.

This problem seems to be flawed, as no function can satisfy both conditions simultaneously. It appears that there must be a mistake in the problem itself,

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



For the function $f$, we are given two equations:
1. $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$
2. $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$

To calculate $f(100)$, we can use the second equation to reduce $f(100)$ to a simpler form. Notice that $100 = 2*50$, so we have:
$$f(100) = 2f(50) + 1.$$

But now we need to know $f(50)$. Using the same trick with $50 = 2*25$, we get:
$$f(50) = 2f(25) + 1.$$

To get $f(25)$, we can use the first equation with $n=25$:
$$f(f(f(25))) = 8*25 - 7 = 193.$$

Since $f(f(f(25))) = 193$, we can set $f(25) = x$ and solve the equation $f(x) = 193$:
$$f(x) = 193.$$

So, we have:
$$f(25) = x.$$

Substitute this into the equation $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$:
$$f(50) = 2x + 1.$$

Now, substitute this into the equation $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$:
$$f(100) = 2(2x + 1) + 1 = 4x + 3.$$

We still need to find the value of $x$. To do this, we can go back to the equation $f(f(f(25))) = 193$ and solve it. 

Let's set $f(25) = x$, then we have $f(x) = 193$. From the second equation, we know that $f(2x) = 2f(x) + 1 = 2*193 + 1 = 387$. And from the first equation, we have $f(f(f(25))) = f(f(x)) = 193$. So we can set $f(f(x)) = 193$:
$$f(f(x)) = 193.$$

This gives us $f(193) = 193$.

Now, substitute $x = 193$ into the equation $f(100) = 4x + 3$:
$$f(100) = 4*193 + 3 = 772 + 3 = 775.$$

But this is not possible because $f(100)$ is supposed to be a value in the range of the function $f$, which means it should be a natural number. The value $775$ is not a natural number.

Let's go back and check our work. We made a mistake in the equation $f(100) = 4x + 3$. The correct equation should be:
$$f(100) = 2(2x + 1) + 1 = 4x + 3.$$

Substituting $x = 193$ into this equation gives:
$$f(100) = 4*193 + 3 = 772 + 3 = 775.$$

This still doesn't work because $775$ is not a natural number. 

Let's try another approach. Since $f(f(f(25))) = 193$, we can set $f(25) = x$, then we have $f(x) = 193$. From the second equation, we know that $f(2x) = 2f(x) + 1 = 2*193 + 1 = 387$. And from the first equation, we have $f(f(f(25))) = f(f(x)) = 193$. So we can set $f(f(x)) = 193$:
$$f(f(x)) = 193.$$

Now, let's solve this equation for $x$. We know that $f(x) = 193$, so we can substitute this into the equation $f(f(x)) = 193$:
$$f(193) = 193.$$

This means $193$ is a fixed point of the function $f$. Now, let's go back to the equation $f(f(f(25))) = 193$. We know that $f(25) = x$, and $f(x) = 193$. Since $193$ is a fixed point of $f$, we can conclude that $x = 193$.

Finally, substitute $x = 193$ into the equation $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$, we get:
$$f(100) = 2(2*193 + 1) + 1 = 2*387 + 1 = 774 + 1 = 775.$$

Again, this doesn't work because $775$ is not a natural number. 

Let's try a different approach. From the first equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we can set $n = 25$, then we have $f(f(f(25))) = 8*25 - 7 = 200$. We know that $f(25) = x$, and from the second equation, we know that $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1 = 2x + 1$. And from the first equation, we have $f(f(f(25))) = 200$. So we can set $f(f(f(25))) = 200$:
$$f(f(f(25))) = 200.$$

Now, let's solve this equation for $x$. We know that $f(25) = x$, and $f(f(f(25))) = 200$. So we can substitute $f(25) = x$ into the equation $f(f(f(25))) = 200$:
$$f(f(x)) = 200.$$

And since $f(x) = 193$, we can

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First we need to find the value of $f(1)$ from the equation $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1$.
2. Then we can find the value of $f(2)$ from the equation $f(2*1)=2f(1)+1$, so $f(2)=2*f(1)+1=2*1+1=3$.
3. Next, we can find the value of $f(3)$ from the equation $f(f(f(3)))=8(3)-7=19$, but we know $f(f(f(3)))=f(f(2))=f(3)$ because $f(1)=1$, so $f(3)$ must be a number such that $f(f(3))=19$. Let's denote $x=f(3)$ and solve the equation $f(f(x))=19$. Because $f(f(f(1)))=1$ and $f(f(f(2)))=f(f(3))=19$, we can infer that the function $f$ doubles its argument and subtracts 1. So $f(x)=2x-1$. Substituting this into the equation $f(f(x))=19$, we get $f(2x-1)=19$. By the same reasoning, $f(2x-1)=2(2x-1)-1=4x-3$. So we solve the equation $4x-3=19$, getting $4x=22$ and $x=5.5$, which is not an integer. This seems to contradict our previous inference that $f$ doubles its argument and subtracts 1. Let's rethink our reasoning.
4. We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, and we also know that $f(f(f(1)))=1$, so $f(1)=1$. This means that the function $f$ does indeed double its argument and subtract 1.
5. Now we can use the equation $f(2*1)=2f(1)+1=2*1+1=3$ to find that $f(2)=3$.
6. Similarly, we can find $f(3)$ using the equation $f(f(f(3)))=8(3)-7=19$, and because $f(1)=1$, $f(2)=3$, we have $f(3)=5$.
7. Now we can find the value of $f(100)$ by repeatedly applying the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We know $f(1)=1$, $f(2)=3$, $f(3)=5$, and we can continue this process until we reach $f(100)$. This might be tedious, but it's important to note that this is a recursive process and can be easily implemented using a loop in Python.

Here is the code to find $f(100)$:

```python

def find_f_100():
    f = {1: 1}

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Firstly, we can see that the second condition implies that $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$, thus $f(1)$ must be an integer. And $f(f(f(1))) = 8 - 7 = 1$, thus $f(1)$ equals to 1. Using the second condition, we have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 3$, $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 7$, and $f(8) = 2f(4) + 1 = 15$. 

Secondly, we can compute $f(f(f(2)))$ and compare it to $8*2 - 7 = 9$. But we already know that $f(f(f(1))) = 1$, thus $f(3) \neq 3$ which contradicts with the second condition. So we must change the initial value of $f(1)$. After some trials, we find that when $f(1) = 1$, $f(3) = 4$, and $f(6) = 8$. Then we calculate $f(f(f(2)))$ and get $f(f(f(2))) = f(4) = 7 = 8*2 - 7$, which is consistent with the first condition. Therefore, we have confirmed that $f(1) = 1$, $f(2) = 3$, $f(3) = 4$, $f(4) = 7$, $f(6) = 8$, and so on.

Now we can calculate $f(100)$. We find that $100 = 2^2 * 5^2$, then use the second condition:

$$f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2(2f(25) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(2f(12.5) + 1) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(2(2f(6.25) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1.$$

But $6.25 = 5^2/2^2$, thus $f(6.25) = f(5^2/2^2) = f((5/2)^2) = 2f(5/2) + 1 = 2(2f(1.25) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(2f(0.625) + 1) + 1) + 1$.

And $0.625 = 5^3/2^3$, thus $f(0.625) = f(5^3/2^3) = f((5/2)^3) = 2f(5/2) + 1 = 2(2f(1.25) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(2f(0.625) + 1) + 1) + 1$.

We find a pattern that $f(x)$ is an odd number when $x$ is a half of a power of $5$. Therefore, $f(0.625) = 1$, and then $f(1.25) = 3$, $f(2.5) = 7$, $f(5) = 15$, and so on. Finally, we get:

$$f(100) = 2(2(2(2*15 + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(2*31 + 1) + 1) + 1 = 2(2*63 + 1) + 1 = 2*127 + 1 = 255.$$

But this result contradicts with the fact that $f(n)$ should be less than $n$ for all $n$. So we must have made a mistake in our reasoning or calculation. 

Let's reconsider the problem. The second condition $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ suggests that $f(n)$ is an odd number. However, the first condition $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$ seems to imply that $f(n)$ can only be an even number because the right side of the equation is always odd. This contradiction implies that our original assumption that $f(1) = 1$ is incorrect. 

So let's try another possible value for $f(1)$. If we let $f(1) = 2$, then $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 5$, $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 11$, and $f(8) = 2f(4) + 1 = 23$. Then we calculate $f(f(f(2)))$ and get $f(f(f(2))) = f(11) = 8*2 - 7 = 9$, which is consistent with the first condition. Therefore, we have confirmed that $f(1) = 2$, $f(2) = 5$, $f(4) = 11$, $f(8) = 23$, and so on.

Now we can calculate $f(100)$. We find that $100 = 2^2 * 5^2$, then use the second condition:

$$f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2(2f(25) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(2f(12.5) + 1) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(2(2f(6.25) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1.$$

But $6.25 = 5^2/2^2$, thus $f(6.25) = f(5^2/2^2) = f((5/2)^2) = 2f(5/2) + 1 = 2(2f(1.25) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(2f(0.625) + 1) + 1) + 1$.

And $0.625 = 5^3/2^3$, thus $f(0.625) = f(5^3/2^3) = f((5/2)^3) = 2f(5/2) + 1 = 2(2f(1.25) + 1) + 1 = 2

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, we have the equation f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7. If we try to substitute f(f(n)) = 2f(n) + 1, we get f(2f(n) + 1) = 8n - 7. 
2. Now, let's make another substitution: let x = f(n), then the equation becomes f(2x + 1) = 8(f^-1(x)) - 7. 
3. Now, let's find the value of f(1). By setting n = 1 in the original equation, we get f(f(f(1))) = 1, and since f(f(1)) = 2f(1) + 1, we can substitute this into the equation to get f(2f(1) + 1) = 1. 
4. Setting x = f(1) in the equation above, we get f(2x + 1) = 1. Trying out different integer values for x, we find that f(1) = 1.
5. Now, we can use the second given equation to find f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 3.
6. Repeating this process, we can find f(3) = 2f(2) + 1 = 7, f(4) = 2f(3) + 1 = 15, and so on. 
7. By observing the pattern, we find that f(n) = 2^(n-1) - 1 for n > 1.
8. Finally, we can find f(100) = 2^(100-1) - 1.

Now, let's write a Python script to calculate the value:

```python

def f(n):
    return 2**(n-1) - 1

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 This problem seems to be a bit tricky to solve directly. However, we can make a small observation. If we set $n = 1$ in the second equation, we get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. Since $f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = -1$, we know that $f(1) = -1$ because $f$ only takes natural number values. Thus, $f(2) = 2*(-1) + 1 = -1$.
But if $f(2) = -1$, then $f(f(f(2))) = f(-1) \neq 8*2 - 7 = 9$. This contradicts with the first condition. So it seems our assumption that $f(1) = -1$ is wrong.
Let's try another approach. Notice that $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. If we set $n = 2$, we get $f(f(f(2))) = 8*2 - 7 = 9$. This means $f(9) = 2$. Similarly, if we set $n = 9$, we get $f(f(f(9))) = 8*9 - 7 = 55$. This means $f(55) = 9$. We can keep going like this and try to find out the value of $f(100)$. 
It seems like $f(n)$ is increasing very quickly. Let's try to find a pattern. 
Notice that $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. If we set $n = 3$, we get $f(f(f(3))) = 8*3 - 7 = 17$. This means $f(17) = 3$. If we set $n = 17$, we get $f(f(f(17))) = 8*17 - 7 = 129$. This means $f(129) = 17$. And so on...
It seems like $f(n)$ keeps increasing and getting more and more complicated to compute. But we are given that $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. If we set $n = 1$, we get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2*1 + 1 = 3$. This matches our previous result that $f(2) = 3$. If we set $n = 2$, we get $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2*3 + 1 = 7$. This also matches our previous result that $f(4) = 7$. 
We can keep going like this and try to find out the value of $f(100)$. 

To do this, we can write a simple python program to compute $f(100)$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def f(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    elif n % 2 == 0:
        return 2 * f(n // 2) + 1
    else:
        return f((n - 1) // 2)

result = f(100)
print(result)
```

The value of $f(100)$ is $31$. Therefore, $f(100) = 31$. The answer is: $31$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:


1. Since we know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we can calculate $f(f(100))$ by setting $n=50$, then $f(f(50)) = 8*50 - 7 = 393$.
2. Now we need to calculate $f(393)$. We don't know how to do that directly, but we do know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. So we can substitute $n = 196.5$ (which is $50/2$), we get that $f(196.5) = 2f(98.25) + 1$.
3. But wait, 98.25 isn't a positive integer, so we can't use this equation directly. But we can use $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ again with $n=49$ (which is $50/2$ rounded down), then we get $f(98) = 2f(49) + 1$.
4. And we can use $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ again with $n=33$ (which is $49/2$ rounded down), then we get $f(f(33)) = 8*33 - 7 = 262$.
5. Then we can calculate $f(262)$ by using $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we get $f(262) = 2f(131) + 1$.
6. We can use $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ with $n=85.625$ (which is $131/2$), then we get $f(f(85.625)) = 8*85.625 - 7 = 685$.
7. Then we can calculate $f(685)$ by using $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we get $f(685) = 2f(342.5) + 1$.
8. And we can use $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ again with $n=114$ (which is $342/2$ rounded down), then we get $f(f(114)) = 8*114 - 7 = 907$.
9. Then we can calculate $f(907)$ by using $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we get $f(907) = 2f(453.5) + 1$.
10. We can use $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ with $n=150$ (which is $453/2$ rounded down), then we get $f(f(150)) = 8*150 - 7 = 1193$.

12. And we can use $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ again with $n=298$ (which is $596/2$ rounded down), then we get $f(f(298)) = 8*298 - 7 = 2379$.
13. Then we can calculate $f(2379)$ by using $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we get $f(2379) = 2f(1189.5) + 1$.
14. We can use $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ with $n=397$ (which is $1189/2$ rounded down), then we get $f(f(397)) = 8*397 - 7 = 3169$.
15. Then we can calculate $f(3169)$ by using $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we get $f(3169) = 2f(1584.5) + 1$.
16. And we can use $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ again with $n=792$ (which is $1584/2$ rounded down), then we get $f(f(792)) = 8*792 - 7 = 6331$.
17. Then we can calculate $f(6331)$ by using $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we get $f(6331) = 2f(3165.5) + 1$.
18. We can use $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ with $n=983$ (which is $3165/2$ rounded down), then we get $f(f(983)) = 8*983 - 7 = 7859$.

20. And we can use $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ again with $n=1964$ (which is $3928/2$ rounded down), then we get $f(f(1964)) = 8*1964 - 7 = 15707$.
21. Then we can calculate $f(15707)$ by using $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we get $f(15707) = 2f(7853.5) + 1$.
22. We can use $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ with $n=2649$ (which is $7853/2$ rounded down), then we get $f(f(2649)) = 8*2649 - 7 = 21187$.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:


1. $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, meaning $f$ applied three times to any $n$ gives $8n-7$.
2. $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, meaning $f$ of $2n$ is $2$ times $f(n)$ plus $1$.
3. To calculate $f(100)$, we can use the second equation to get $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$.
4. Then, using the first equation, we substitute $n = 100$ into $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to get $f(f(f(100)))=8*100-7=793$.
5. From $f(f(f(100)))=793$, we can say $f(100)$ is a number $x$ such that $f(x) = 793$.
6. Now, we substitute $n = 100$ into $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to get $f(200)=2f(100)+1$.
7. We know from step 3 that $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$, so we have the equation $2f(100) + 1 = 793$.
8. To solve this equation for $f(100)$, we can use sympy to find the value.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, notice that applying the second equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ iteratively, we have
$$f(4n) = 2f(2n) + 1 = 2(2f(n) + 1) + 1 = 4f(n) + 3,$$
and
$$f(8n) = 2f(4n) + 1 = 2(4f(n) + 3) + 1 = 8f(n) + 7.$$

We also know from the problem statement that $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. Let $f(n) = x$, then $f(f(x)) = f(x)$ and $f(f(f(x))) = f(f(x)) = f(x)$, so we have $f(x) = 8n - 7$ if we substitute $x = f(n)$ into $f(f(f(n)))$.

Now comparing $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$ and $f(8n) = 8f(n) + 7$, we can conclude that $f(n) = 8n - 7$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

To verify, we can substitute $f(n) = 8n - 7$ into the original two conditions:
1) $f(f(f(n))) = f(f(8n - 7)) = f(8(8n - 7) - 7) = f(64n - 63 - 7) = f(64n - 70) = 8(64n - 70) - 7 = 512n - 567 - 7 = 512n - 574$. On the other hand, $8n - 7$ is the value of $f(n)$. Then, $512n - 574 = 8n - 7$ is true for all $n$.
2) $f(2n) = 8(2n) - 7 = 16n - 7 = 2(8n - 7) + 1 = 2f(n) + 1$. The equation holds for all $n$.

Therefore, $f(n) = 8n - 7$ is the solution to the function. To find $f(100)$, we simply calculate $f(100) = 8*100 - 7 = 800 - 7 = 793$.

Finally, the value of $f(100)$ is 793. Therefore, the answer is:
$$f(100) = \boxed{793}.$$

1. Let's denote $g(n) = f(n) - 1$. Then the function $g(n)$ satisfies $g(g(g(n))) = 8n - 8$.
2. It can be observed that $g(n) = 2n - 1$ satisfies the equation from step 1.
3. Substituting $g(n) = 2n - 1$ into the equation for $f(n)$ gives $f(n) = 2n$.

Furthermore, it implies that $f(n)$ can only be 1, 3, or 5 (since those are the only numbers that, when triplicated and 7 subtracted from the result, will give a natural number).

Second, note that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ implies that the function $f$ is strictly increasing (as $f(2n)$ is always greater than $f(n)$).

Combining these two observations, we can deduce that $f(n)=2n-3$ for all $n$. To prove this, we just need to substitute $f(n)=2n-3$ into the two given equations and verify that they hold true.

So, now we can calculate $f(100)$ simply by substituting $n=100$ into $f(n)=2n-3$:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def calculate_f_100():
    n = 100
    f_n = 2 * n - 3
    return f_n

result = calculate_f_100()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 197

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
197
```
So, $f(100) = 197$. The answer is: $197$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



We have the function $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, which tells us that three nested applications of the function $f$ to any natural number $n$ is equivalent to $8n-7$.

We also have the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, which tells us how the function $f$ behaves when the input is multiplied by 2.

Let's start by plugging in $n=1$ into the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we get $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$.

Because $f(f(f(1)))=1$, and from the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can see that if we input $1$ into $f$, the output will be multiplied by 2 and then add 1. So $f(1)$ must be $0$, because $2*f(1)+1=1$ implies $f(1)=0$.

Now let's find $f(2)$ using the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Plugging in $n=1$, we get $f(2)=2f(1)+1=2*0+1=1$.

Using the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, if we input $n=2$, we get $f(f(f(2)))=8*2-7=9$. But we know that $f(f(f(2)))=f(f(1))=f(0)=1$, because $f(f(1))=f(0)$, $f(0)$ from the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, implies that if we input $0$ into $f$, the output will be multiplied by 2 and then add 1, so $f(0)=0$, and $f(f(0))=f(0)=0$, therefore $f(f(f(2)))=0$. This contradiction tells us that our assumption that $f(1)=0$ is wrong.

Let's go back and modify our previous steps. From $f(f(f(1)))=1$, and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we get $f(1)=1$.

Then we find $f(2)$ again using the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, plugging in $n=1$, we get $f(2)=2f(1)+1=2*1+1=3$.

Now let's find $f(4)$ using the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Plugging in $n=2$, we get $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2*3+1=7$.

Now let's find $f(8)$ using the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Plugging in $n=4$, we get $f(8)=2f(4)+1=2*7+1=15$.

We can see that $f(2^k)=2^k-1$ for $k=1,2,3,...$.

Now let's find $f(100)$, since $100=2^2*5^2$, we can use the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ repeatedly to find $f(100)$.

We have $f(100)=f(2*2*5*5)=2f(2*5*5)+1=2f(2*25)+1=2[2f(25)+1]+1=2[2[2f(5)+1]+1]+1=2[2[2[2f(1)+1]+1]+1]=2[2[2[2*1+1]+1]+1]=2[2[2*3+1]+1]=2[2*7+1]=2*15=30$.

So the value of $f(100)$ is 30. The answer is: $30$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. Since we want to compute $f(100)$, let's substitute $n=50$ into the function. We have $f(f(f(50)))=8*50-7=393$. So, $f(f(50))=393$.

2. Now, let's substitute $n=25$ into the function $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We have $f(50)=2f(25)+1$.

3. Similarly, let's substitute $n=12.5$ (not a valid input for a function defined on natural numbers) into the function $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. We have $f(f(12.5))=8*12.5-7=93$.

4. Now, let's substitute $n=12.5$ into the function $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We have $f(25)=2f(12.5)+1$.

5. We can keep substituting values into the functions until we find $f(100)$.

6. However, note that the function $f(n)$ is defined only on natural numbers, so we cannot directly substitute decimal values. Let's try a different approach.

7. Notice that the function $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ is a recursive function. We can express $f(f(n))$ in terms of $n$ and substitute that into the equation to get $f(n)$ in terms of $n$.

8. Let's try solving $f(f(n))$ for $n$. From $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we have $f(f(n)) = \frac{8n-7}{f(n)}$.

9. Substituting this into $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we get $\frac{8(2n)-7}{f(2n)} = 2f(n) + 1$. Simplifying, we get $f(2n) = \frac{16n - 7}{2}$.

10. Now, we can check if $f(100)$ satisfies this equation. We have $f(100) = \frac{16*100 - 7}{2} = 793$.

11. We can substitute $n=50$ into the function $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to check if $793$ is indeed the correct value of $f(100)$. We have $f(f(f(50)))=8*50-7=393$.

12. Substituting $n=25$ into the function $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we have $f(50)=2f(25)+1$. Since $f(25)$ is half of $50$, we can substitute $f(25)=25$ into this equation to get $f(50) = 2*25+1 = 51$.

13. Now, substituting $n=50$ into the function $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we have $f(f(f(50)))=8*50-7=393$.

14. Substituting $n=50$ into the function $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we have $f(100)=2f(50)+1$. Substituting $f(50)=51$ into this equation, we get $f(100) = 2*51+1 = 103$.

15. However, this does not match our previous result of $793$. What went wrong?

16. Let's go back and retrace our steps. We made a mistake in step 2, where we assumed that $f(25)=25$. Instead, let's substitute $n=12.5$ into the function $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to get $f(f(12.5))=8*12.5-7=93$.

17. Substituting $n=12.5$ into the function $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we have $f(25)=2f(12.5)+1$. Substituting $f(12.5)=93$ into this equation, we get $f(25) = 2*93+1 = 187$.

18. Now, substituting $n=25$ into the function $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we have $f(f(f(25)))=8*25-7=193$.

19. Substituting $n=25$ into the function $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we have $f(50)=2f(25)+1$. Substituting $f(25)=187$ into this equation, we get $f(50) = 2*187+1 = 375$.

20. Now, substituting $n=50$ into the function $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we have $f(f(f(50)))=8*50-7=393$.

21. Substituting $n=50$ into the function $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we have $f(100)=2f(50)+1$. Substituting $f(50)=375$ into this equation, we get $f(100) = 2*375+1 = 751$.

22. However, this still does not match our previous result of $793$. What went wrong now?

23. Let's retrace our steps one more time. We made a mistake in step 5, where we assumed that $f(50)=375$. Instead, let's substitute $n=25$ into the function $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We have $f(50)=2f(25)+1$.

24. Substituting $n=25$ into the function $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we have $f(50)=2f(25)+1$. Substituting $f(25)=187$ into this equation,

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."

Assistant:


This problem requires the use of mathematical logic and problem-solving skills. It is not straightforward to directly implement a program to solve this problem. Therefore, we will use a recursive approach to solve this problem.

Let's start by calculating $f(100)$ using the provided equations:

We know that $f(f(f(100))) = 8*100 - 7 = 793$.

Now let's calculate $f(f(100))$ by setting $n = f(100)$:

We know that $f(f(100)) = \frac{793 + 7}{2} = 400$.

Now let's calculate $f(100)$ by setting $n = 100$ in the second equation:

We know that $f(2*100) = 2f(100) + 1$, so $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$.

But we also know that $f(200) = 400$ from the previous step. So we have:

$$2f(100) + 1 = 400 \implies 2f(100) = 399 \implies f(100) = \frac{399}{2} = 199.5$$

But the function $f$ only takes natural number values, so $f(100)$ cannot be a fraction. This means that we must have made a mistake in our calculations. Let's reevaluate the problem.

We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. Let's set $n=100$:

$$f(f(f(100))) = 8*100 - 7 = 793$$

Now let's set $n = f(100)$, and say that $f(100) = a$. We then have:

$$f(f(a)) = \frac{793 + 7}{2} = 400$$

And then setting $n = a$ in the second equation, we have:

$$f(2a) = 2f(a) + 1 = 2a + 1$$

So we know that $f(2a) = 2a + 1 = 400$. Solving for $a$ we get:

$$2a = 400 - 1 = 399 \implies a = \frac{399}{2} = 199.5$$

But we have already established that $f(100)$ cannot be a fraction. We must have made another mistake. Let's re-evaluate the problem again.

We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Let's set $n=50$:

$$f(f(f(50))) = 8*50 - 7 = 393$$

Now let's set $n = f(50)$, and say that $f(50) = a$. We then have:

$$f(f(a)) = \frac{393 + 7}{2} = 200$$

And then setting $n = a$ in the second equation, we have:

$$f(2a) = 2f(a) + 1 = 2a + 1$$

So we know that $f(2a) = 2a + 1 = 200$. Solving for $a$ we get:

$$2a = 200 - 1 = 199 \implies a = \frac{199}{2} = 99.5$$

But again, we have a problem. $f(50)$ cannot be a fraction. Let's try again.

We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Let's set $n=25$:

$$f(f(f(25))) = 8*25 - 7 = 193$$

Now let's set $n = f(25)$, and say that $f(25) = a$. We then have:

$$f(f(a)) = \frac{193 + 7}{2} = 100$$

And then setting $n = a$ in the second equation, we have:

$$f(2a) = 2f(a) + 1 = 2a + 1$$

So we know that $f(2a) = 2a + 1 = 100$. Solving for $a$ we get:

$$2a = 100 - 1 = 99 \implies a = \frac{99}{2} = 49.5$$

But $f(25)$ cannot be a fraction. Let's be careful. We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. Let's set $n=25$:

$$f(f(f(25))) = 8*25 - 7 = 193$$

Now let's set $n = f(25)$, and say that $f(25) = a$. We then have:

$$f(f(a)) = \frac{193 + 7}{2} = 100$$

And then setting $n = a$ in the second equation, we have:

$$f(2a) = 2f(a) - 1$$

So we know that $f(2a) = 2f(a) - 1 = 100$. Solving for $a$ we get:

$$2f(a) = 100 + 1 = 101 \implies f(a) = \frac{101}{2} = 50.5$$

But $f(25)$ cannot be a fraction. We must have made another mistake. Let's re-evaluate the problem again.

We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)-1$. Let's set $n=25$:

$$f(f(f(25))) = 8*25 - 7 = 193$$

Now let's set $n = f(25)$, and say that $f(25
