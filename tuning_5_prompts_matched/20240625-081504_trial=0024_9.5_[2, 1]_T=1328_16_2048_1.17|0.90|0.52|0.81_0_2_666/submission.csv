1,246d26,Each of the three-digits numbers $111$ to $999$ is coloured blue or yellow in such a way that the sum of any two (not necessarily different) yellow numbers is equal to a blue number. What is the maximum possible number of yellow numbers there can be?,0.0
2,2fc4ad,"Let the `sparkle' operation on positive integer $n$ consist of calculating the sum of the digits of $n$ and taking its factorial, e.g. the sparkle of 13 is $4! = 24$. A robot starts with a positive integer on a blackboard, then after each second for the rest of eternity, replaces the number on the board with its sparkle. For some `special' numbers, if they're the first number, then eventually every number that appears will be less than 6. How many such special numbers are there with at most 36 digits?",1.0
