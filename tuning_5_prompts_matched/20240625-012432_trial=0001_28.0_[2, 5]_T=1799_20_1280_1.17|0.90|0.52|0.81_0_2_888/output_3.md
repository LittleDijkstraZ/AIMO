Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of them is zero. Hence, $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$ or $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. 

The first equation implies that $|x+y| = 10$ and $|x-y| = 10$, and the second equation implies that $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. 

The four lines given by $|x+y| = 10$, $|x-y| = 10$, $|x| = 8$, and $|y| = 8$ form a rectangle. The length of the rectangle is 16 (from $-8$ to $8$ in both $x$ and $y$), and the width is 20 (from $-10$ to $10$ in both $x+y$ and $x-y$). 

The area of the rectangle is therefore $16 \times 20 = 320$. 

The answer is: $320$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

 This problem is a bit complex, but we can break it down into smaller steps to solve it.

Step 1: We first recognize that the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is true if and only if either one of the two factors is equal to zero. This gives us two sets of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

Step 2: Solving the first set of equations, we find that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = \vert y \vert = 8$. This means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x, y = \pm 8$. These give us the vertices of a square with side length 10: $(8, 2), (8, -2), (-8, -2), (-8, 2)$.

Step 3: Solving the second set of equations, we find that $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = \vert y \vert = 8$. This means $x - y = \pm 10$ and $x, y = \pm 8$. These give us the same vertices as before, but in a different order.

Step 4: Since the equation defines a square with side length 10, the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The given equation implies that at least one of the terms $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2$ must be zero for the entire product to be zero.

2. If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $|x+y| = 10$, which implies $x+y = \pm 10$.
3. If $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $|x-y| = 10$, which implies $x-y = \pm 10$.
4. If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $|x| = 8$, which implies $x = \pm 8$.
5. If $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $|y| = 8$, which implies $y = \pm 8$.

The solutions $x+y = \pm 10$, $x-y = \pm 10$, $x = \pm 8$, $y = \pm 8$ enclose the following points in the coordinate plane:

(8, 2), (8, -2), (2, 8), (-2, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8), (8, 8), (-8, 2), (-8, -2), (2, -8), (-2, -8)

The points form a rectangle with length 16 and width 10. So, the area is $16*10 = 160$.
The answer is: $160$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



- The given equation is zero when either of the factors is zero.
- The first factor is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, which is zero when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These conditions define a square with side length 20.
- The second factor is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$, which is zero when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These conditions define a square with side length 16.
- The solution of the problem then is the intersection of these two squares. That is a smaller square inside the larger one.
- The side length of the smaller square is the difference of the side lengths of the larger and smaller squares, which is $20 - 16 = 4$.
- The area of a square is the side length squared, so the area of the convex polygon is $4^2 = 16$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The given expression is equal to zero, so either the first factor is zero or the second factor is zero. If we analyze the factors separately, we get the following four conditions:

1. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$.
2. $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.

Now, let's solve each condition separately:

1. For the first condition, $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us the four lines $x + y = \pm10$ and $x - y = \pm10$.
2. For the second condition, $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us the four lines $x = \pm8$ and $y = \pm8$.

Now, let's plot these lines on a coordinate plane and find the intersection points:

The intersection points are the vertices of the polygon. There are 16 intersection points: 4 from the lines $x + y = \pm10$ and $x - y = \pm10$, and 4 from the lines $x = \pm8$ and $y = \pm8$.

Now, let's find the area of the polygon. The polygon is a square with side length 16 (the distance between the lines $x = \pm8$). The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256.
The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The problem is asking for the area of a polygon formed by the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the given equation. The equation is equal to zero if either of the factors is zero. This means that we need to find the points $(x, y)$ that make either of the two factors equal to zero.

The factors are $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$, and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2$. Setting each of these to zero gives us the possible points that satisfy the equation.

The solutions to $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ are when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$. These are the equations of two lines.

Similarly, the solutions to $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ are when $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$. These are the equations of two more lines.

The solutions to $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ are when $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = 8$ or $x = -8$. These are the equations of two vertical lines.

And the solutions to $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ are when $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. These are the equations of two horizontal lines.

These lines form a rectangle with side lengths $16$ and $20$, so the area of the polygon is $16 \times 20 = 320$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 320 square units. The answer is: $320$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second one is. So, we can break this problem down into two parts:

1. Find the points that satisfy $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. Find the points that satisfy $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The first equation is zero when both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means the points are of the form $(x, y)$ such that the distance between $(x, y)$ and the origin $(0, 0)$ is 10. These points form a square with side length 20.

The second equation is zero when both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. This implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. These points form a square with side length 16.

The convex polygon formed by the union of these two sets of points is a larger square with side length 20, but with the smaller square of side length 16 removed from its center.

The area of a square is given by the square of its side length. So the area of the larger square is $20^2 = 400$, and the area of the smaller square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $400 - 256 = 144$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 144 square units. The answer is: $144$

 The given equation is equal to zero if and only if both factors are equal to zero. Therefore, we have two sets of equations to solve:

1. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$
2. $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$

For the first set of equations, we have:
$\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these systems of equations, we get the following four points: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$.

For the second set of equations, we have:
$\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these systems of equations, we get the following four points: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

Combining all these points, we find that the polygon is a square with side length 16. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. So, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We have a product of two functions equaling zero, so one of them must be zero. This gives us two cases to consider: 

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

2. In Case 1, both terms must be zero. That means:

$\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$

This forms a square with side length 20.

3. In Case 2, both terms must be zero. That means:

$\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$

This forms a square with side length 16.

4. To find the area of the convex polygon, we add the areas of the two squares. The area of a square is side length squared, so:

Area = $(20^2) + (16^2) = 400 + 256 = 656$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 656 square units. The answer is: $656$

   $$(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$$

4. The intersection of the regions defined by the above two equations is the square with side length 8 (the smaller square inside the larger square).

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Step 1: Notice that the product of two numbers equals zero if and only if at least one of the numbers equals zero. This implies that we have two separate conditions: $ (|x + y| - 10)^2 = 0 $ and $(|x - y| - 10)^2 = 0 $, and $ (|x| - 8)^2 = 0 $ and $ (|y| - 8)^2 = 0 $.

Step 2: Simplify each of the conditions, remembering that the absolute value function $|u|$ equals $u$ if $u \geq 0$ and $-u$ if $u < 0$. 

For the first condition, $ (|x + y| - 10)^2 = 0 $, it simplifies to $|x + y| = 10$, which means $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.

For the second condition, $(|x - y| - 10)^2 = 0$, it simplifies to $|x - y| = 10$, which means $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.

For the third condition, $ (|x| - 8)^2 = 0$, it simplifies to $|x| = 8$, which means $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.

For the fourth condition, $ (|y| - 8)^2 = 0$, it simplifies to $|y| = 8$, which means $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

Step 3: Combine all these conditions to find the vertices of the polygon.

By analyzing the conditions, we can find the vertices of the polygon as follows:

$(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

Step 4: Use a formula for the area of a polygon given its vertices.

We can use the Shoelace Formula to compute the area of the polygon. The Shoelace Formula states that if the vertices of a polygon are $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), \ldots, (x_n, y_n)$ in clockwise order, then the area of the polygon is given by:

$$\frac{1}{2} |(x_1y_2 + x_2y_3 + \cdots + x_ny_1) - (y_1x_2 + y_2x_3 + \cdots + y_nx_1)|.$$

Step 5: Plug in the coordinates of the vertices into the formula and compute the area.

By plugging the coordinates $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$ into the Shoelace Formula, we get the area as:

$$\frac{1}{2} |(8 \cdot 8 + 8 \cdot (-8) + (-8) \cdot 8 + (-8) \cdot (-8)) - (8 \cdot (-8) + (-8) \cdot 8 + 8 \cdot 8 + (-8) \cdot (-8))| = 0.$$

The area of the polygon is 0, but that doesn't make sense for a polygon. 

Step 6: Recheck the steps.

It turns out we made a mistake in Step 3: The conditions $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ (and similarly for the negative cases) actually lead to the same point $(5, 5)$, not $(8, 8)$ as we initially thought. The same applies to the points $(5, -5)$, $(-5, 5)$, and $(-5, -5)$.

Step 7: Recalculate the area with the correct vertices.

Using the Shoelace Formula again with the vertices $(5, 5)$, $(5, -5)$, $(-5, 5)$, and $(-5, -5)$, we get the area as:

$$\frac{1}{2} |(5 \cdot 5 + 5 \cdot (-5) + (-5) \cdot 5 + (-5) \cdot (-5)) - (5 \cdot (-5) + (-5) \cdot 5 + 5 \cdot 5 + (-5) \cdot (-5))| = 100.$$

The area of the polygon is 100 square units.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import Rational

def polygon_area():
    # Vertices of the polygon
    vertices = [(5, 5), (5, -5), (-5, 5), (-5, -5)]

    # Shoelace Formula
    x, y = zip(*vertices)
    area = abs(sum(x[i]*y[i+1] - y[i]*x[i+1] for i in range(len(x)-1)) + x[len(x)-1]*y[0] - y[len(y)-1]*x[0]) / 2

    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
0.0
```
This is not correct as the area of the polygon is non-zero. Let's recalculate.

After checking and rechecking our work, we realized we made a mistake in Step 3: The conditions $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ (and similarly for the negative cases) actually lead to the same point $(5, 5)$, not $(8, 8)$ as we initially thought. The same applies to the points $(5, -5)$, $(-5, 5

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Since the product of two numbers equals zero if and only if at least one of the numbers equals zero, the equation in the problem is equivalent to the system of equations
\begin{align*}
(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 &= 0, \\
(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 &= 0.
\end{align*}

From the first equation, we get $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies that both $x$ and $y$ are equal to either $5$ or $-5$. 

From the second equation, we get $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that both $x$ and $y$ are equal to either $8$ or $-8$.

The intersection of these two sets of solutions is the set consisting of all points $(x, y)$ equal to one of the pairs $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, $(-5,-5)$, $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, or $(-8,-8)$.

The eight points form a square with side length $10$, so its area is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



A product of two or more numbers is equal to zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. This means that we can break down the problem into two separate cases:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \text{ or } (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \text{ or } (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From case 1, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. 
From case 2, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

For $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, the points $(x, y)$ lie on a square with side length $20$ centered at the origin. Similarly, for $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, the points $(x, y)$ also lie on a square with side length $20$ centered at the origin. For $\vert x \vert = 8$, the points $(x, y)$ lie on a square with side length $16$ centered at the origin. For $\vert y \vert = 8$, the points $(x, y)$ also lie on a square with side length $16$ centered at the origin.

The intersection of all these squares is a square with side length $16$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$.

So the answer is $\boxed{256}$.

Here is the whole code for reference:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    # The intersection of all these squares is a square with side length 16.
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. So, the numerical answer is 256.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The given equation implies that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

2. The only way the first expression can be zero is if both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.

3. Solving this system of equations, we find that the vertices of the polygon are $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0)$.

4. The second expression can only be zero if $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

5. However, this does not give us any additional vertices, as they are already included in the first case.

6. Therefore, the vertices of the polygon are $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0)$.

7. This forms a square with side length 10.

8. The area of the square is $10 \times 10 = 100$.

So the area of the polygon is 100.
The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:


The given expression is zero when at least one of the factors is zero. This gives us four cases to consider:
1. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.
2. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 \neq 0$.
3. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x \vert - 8 \neq 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.
4. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 \neq 0$ and $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.

For case 1, $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$ imply that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So, the points are $(\pm 8, \pm 8)$.

For case 2, $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert \neq 8$ imply that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = 0$ or $y = \pm 16$. So, the points are $(\pm 8, 0)$ and $(\pm 8, \pm 16)$.

For case 3, $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert \neq 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$ imply that $x = 0$ or $x = \pm 16$ and $y = \pm 8$. So, the points are $(0, \pm 8)$ and $(\pm 16, \pm 8)$.

For case 4, $\vert x + y \vert \neq 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$ imply that $x = 0$ or $x = \pm 16$ and $y = 0$ or $y = \pm 16$. So, the points are $(0, 0)$, $(0, \pm 16)$, $(\pm 16, 0)$, and $(\pm 16, \pm 16)$.

By plotting these points on a coordinate plane, we find that they form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$
