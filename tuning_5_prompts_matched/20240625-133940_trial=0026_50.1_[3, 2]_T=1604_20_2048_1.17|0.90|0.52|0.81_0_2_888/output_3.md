Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Since the expression is equal to zero, one of the factors must be zero. So we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, so $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.

Case 2: $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, so $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.

Case 3: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies $\vert x \vert = 8$, so $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.

Case 4: $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies $\vert y \vert = 8$, so $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

Now let's analyze the intersections of these lines:

The intersections of Case 1 and Case 2 give us the vertices of the polygon. For example, the intersection $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ gives us the point $(10,0)$. Similarly, we can find the other vertices: $(0,10)$, $(-10,0)$, and $(0,-10)$.

Now let's plot these points and connect them to form the polygon. The resulting polygon is a square with side length 10.

To find the area of the square, we simply square the length of one of its sides: area = $10^2 = 100$.

The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We notice that the given equation is a product of two expressions. The product is zero if either of the expressions is zero. This gives us two cases to consider: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

2. From $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. Because of the absolute value, this equation actually represents two lines: $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.

3. Similarly, from $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which represents two more lines: $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.

4. From $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert x \vert = 8$, which gives us two lines: $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.

5. Finally, from $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us two lines: $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

6. These lines form a square with side length $10$ (the distance from $10$ to $-10$ or from $8$ to $-8$).

7. The area of a square is the square of its side length, so the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $100$.

Let's write this in python:
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    # The side length of the square is the distance from 10 to -10 or from 8 to -8
    side_length = 10

    # The area of a square is the square of its side length
    area = side_length**2

    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 100

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
100
```
The area of the convex polygon is $100$. The answer is: $100$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, we recognize that the equation is true if either of the two factors is zero. This gives us two systems of equations to solve:

1. $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x| - 8 = 0$ and $|y| - 8 = 0$.
2. $|x-y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x| - 8 = 0$ and $|y| - 8 = 0$.

Each of these systems simplifies to $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us a total of four points: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

Now we need to visualize these points on a coordinate plane and find the area of the resulting square. The distance between any two points is $16\sqrt{2}$ (using the distance formula), so the side length of the square is $16$. Therefore, the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The given expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

Now, this expression equals zero if and only if both of its factors equal zero. Thus, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

In the first case, $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the four lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. The polygon formed by these lines is a square with side length 10. So its area is $10^2 = 100$.

In the second case, $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So we get the four lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. The polygon formed by these lines is also a square with side length 16. So its area is $16^2 = 256$.

However, since the first case forms a square with a larger area than the second, the polygon formed by the solutions to the original equation is actually the square formed by the first case, which has an area of 100.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100.

Let's put this all into code:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Abs

def area_of_polygon():
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # Case 1: (|x + y| - 10)^2 + (|x - y| - 10)^2 = 0
    case1 = (Abs(x + y) - 10)**2 + (Abs(x - y) - 10)**2

    # Case 2: (|x| - 8)^2 + (|y| - 8)^2 = 0
    case2 = (Abs(x) - 8)**2 + (Abs(y) - 8)**2

    # The polygon is the square formed by case 1
    side_length = 10
    area = side_length**2

    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 100

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
100
```

The area of the convex polygon is $100$. The answer is: $100$
