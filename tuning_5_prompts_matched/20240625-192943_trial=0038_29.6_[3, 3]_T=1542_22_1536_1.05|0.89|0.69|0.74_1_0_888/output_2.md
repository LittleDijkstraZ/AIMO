Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



We are asked to find for how many values of $m$ the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions.

We can rewrite the equation as $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 \pm \frac{m}{100}$. This equation will have four distinct solutions if and only if $2 - \frac{m}{100} > 0$ and $2 + \frac{m}{100} > 0$.

So, we have two inequalities: $2 - \frac{m}{100} > 0$ and $2 + \frac{m}{100} > 0$.

Solving these inequalities, we get $m < 200$ and $m > -200$. Since $m$ is a positive integer, we have $0 < m < 200$.

The number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality is $200 - 1 = 199$.

So, the answer is $\boxed{199}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, let's consider the equation $ \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$

The graph of this equation will be two 'V' shaped graphs with slopes of +1 and -1. Each 'V' will be centered at $(1,2)$ and will have a 'height' of $\frac{m}{100}$.

For the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, the 'V's must intersect the x-axis at 4 different points. This will happen when the 'height' of the 'V's is greater than 2 (the distance from the x-axis to the center of the 'V').

Therefore, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $\frac{m}{100} > 2$, or $m > 200$.

Let's use python to find this:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def count_m():
    # Define the range of m
    m_values = range(201, 10000)

    # Count the number of m values
    count = len(m_values)

    return count

result = count_m()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 9799

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
9799
```
The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $ \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is $\boxed{9799}$.

The problem is asking for how many positive integers $m$ the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. 

First, let's analyze the equation. The absolute value function $\vert x \vert$ creates a "V" shape when graphed, with the point of the "V" at the origin. Therefore, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a "bump" in the graph that goes from $x=1-2$ to $x=1+2$, and the height of the bump is $2$. 

Now, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is asking where the graph intersects the line $y=\frac{m}{100}$. This line is a horizontal line that moves up as $m$ increases. 

The graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has $4$ distinct solutions for the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ when the height of the "bump" $\frac{m}{100}$ is between $0$ and $2$. 

Therefore, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $0<\frac{m}{100}<2$. Multiplying all sides of the inequalities by $100$ gives $0<m<200$. 

The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are $1, 2, 3, ..., 199$. There are $\boxed{199}$ such integers.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



We want to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. 

First, let's look at the expression on the left side, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. It's the absolute value of the absolute value of $(x-1)$ minus $2$. Since the absolute value function is symmetric about the x-axis, and the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is the composition of two absolute value functions, it will have a V-shape with two "humps" in the shape of the letter "V". The "humps" are symmetric about the line $x=1$.

The right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, is a horizontal line that intersects the x-axis at $m=0$. As $m$ increases, the line shifts upwards.

We are interested in finding the values of $m$ for which the line $\frac{m}{100}$ intersects the "humps" of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ at exactly $4$ points. 

This will occur when the line is strictly between the two humps and crosses one hump from below and the other from above. This will happen twice for each hump, once as the line shifts upwards and once as it shifts downwards. Therefore, we will have $4$ solutions for each hump.

Since the "humps" of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ are symmetric about the line $x=1$, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ solutions is equal to the number of times the line $\frac{m}{100}$ intersects the "hump" on the right of the line $x=1$. 

To find the number of such intersections, we need to find the range of $m$ for which the line $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between the two humps of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ on the right of the line $x=1$. 

This can be done by analyzing the "humps" of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ on the right of the line $x=1$. We can observe that the "humps" are symmetric about the line $x=3$. The left "hump" is at $x=3$ and the right "hump" is at $x=5$. 

Therefore, the line $\frac{m}{100}$ intersects the "humps" of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ on the right of the line $x=1$ when $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $3$. 

This happens when $m$ is strictly between $100$ and $300$. 

Since we are looking for positive integers $m$, the possible values of $m$ are the integers from $101$ to $299$. 

Therefore, there are $299-101+1 = 199$ positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

The answer is $\boxed{199}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



We have the equation $f(x)=\left\vert \left\vert x-1 \right\vert -2 \right\vert=\frac{m}{100}$. This is a 4-choice question. Since the absolute function is always non-negative, the LHS is also non-negative. Thus, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be non-negative, which implies that $m\geq0$. Also, we can rewrite $f(x)$ as 

$f(x) = \left\{
  \begin{array}{ll}
    -(x-1)-2 & : x < 1\\
    (x-1)-2 & : 1 \leq x < 3\\
    -(x-1)-2 & : x \geq 3
  \end{array}
\right.$

This is a 4-choice question. We can see that $f(x)$ has 3 different cases for $x$.

To find the number of distinct solutions for $f(x) = \frac{m}{100}$, we can look at the graphs of $y = f(x)$ and $y = \frac{m}{100}$. Since we are looking for 4 distinct solutions, we are looking for the intersection of the graphs in 4 different regions.

In order for the function to have 4 distinct solutions, the value $\frac{m}{100}$ must fall in the gaps between the cases of $f(x)$. Thus, we need $\frac{m}{100} \leq 1$. This means that $m \leq 100$. Also, since the cases of $f(x)$ are separated by 2 units, we need at least 2 units of space to accommodate 4 distinct solutions. Thus, $2 \leq \frac{m}{100} \leq 1$. This implies $200 \leq m \leq 100$.

Now we need to count the number of integer values for $m$ that satisfy the above conditions. Since $m$ is a positive integer and $200 \leq m \leq 100$, there are $100 - 200 + 1 = 101$ values for $m$. However, we need to subtract the values that give less than 4 distinct solutions.

Looking at the graph, we see that the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ can only fall exactly at the transition points (1, 2, and 3) for $f(x)$ to have less than 4 distinct solutions. Thus, there are 3 values for $m$ that give less than 4 distinct solutions.

Therefore, the number of values for $m$ that give 4 distinct solutions is $101 - 3 = 98$.

Thus, the answer is $\boxed{98}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The first step is to understand that the absolute value function $\vert x-1 \vert$ is equivalent to $x-1$ when $x \geq 1$ and $1-x$ when $x < 1$. 

2. The inner absolute value $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ will be zero when $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$, one when $1 < x < 3$, and zero again when $x = 3$. This gives us three intervals for $x$: $x < 1$, $1 \leq x < 3$, and $x \geq 3$.

3. For $x < 1$, the equation becomes $\vert -x+1 -2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\vert -x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$. This has two solutions: $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$. 

4. For $1 \leq x < 3$, the equation becomes $\vert x-1 -2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\vert x-3 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$. This has two solutions: $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$. 

5. For $x \geq 3$, the equation becomes $\vert x-1 -2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\vert x-3 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$. This has one solution: $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$. 

6. We are looking for four distinct solutions. This can happen in two ways: either the two solutions from the first interval and the two solutions from the second interval are distinct, or the solution from the first interval and the two solutions from the second interval are distinct. 

7. The two solutions from the first interval are distinct when $-1 - \frac{m}{100} < -1 + \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $m > 100$. The two solutions from the second interval are distinct when $3 - \frac{m}{100} < 3 + \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $m > 0$. 

8. Therefore, for $m > 100$, the four solutions are distinct. We need to count how many such $m$ exist. The answer is $\boxed{99}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Given equation is 
\[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\]

This is a piecewise function with 4 cases, so we need to solve each separately and count the number of distinct solutions.

Let's denote `abs(x-1)` as `y`, we then have:

Case 1: If `y >= 2`, we have `abs(y - 2) = m/100`. Solving this gives us `y = 2 + m/100` or `y = 2 - m/100`. But since `y = abs(x-1) >= 0`, we only accept the solution `y = 2 + m/100`. Substituting `y` back, we get `x = 1 + 2 + m/100 = 3 + m/100`. 

Case 2: If `1 <= y < 2`, we have `2 - y = m/100`. Solving this gives us `y = 2 - m/100`. But this case is not possible because it leads to `x = 1 + 2 - m/100 = 3 - m/100`, which is less than 1, thus contradicting with our assumption `1 <= y < 2`. 

Case 3: If `y < 1`, we have `y - 2 = m/100`. Solving this gives us `y = 2 + m/100`. But this case is also not possible because it leads to `x = 1 + 2 + m/100 = 3 + m/100`, which is greater than 1, thus contradicting with our assumption `y < 1`. 

So, the only valid case is `y = 2 + m/100`, which gives `x = 3 + m/100`. 

To have 4 distinct solutions, we need `m` to be a positive integer such that `3 + m/100` has 4 distinct roots. This is the case when `m` varies from 1 to 300. 

So, the number of such `m` is `300`.

Let's now implement this in python:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def count_m():
    # Initialize counter
    count = 0

    # Loop through possible values of m
    for m in range(1, 301):
        # Calculate x
        x = 3 + m/100

        # Check if x has 4 distinct roots
        if len(set(range(int(x - 0.5), int(x + 0.5)))) == 4:
            count += 1

    return count

result = count_m()
print(result)
```

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



In general, the equation $||x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ will have four distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100} \geq 2$ (for the outermost absolute value, we have a spread of 4, so it must encompass the entire domain of the innermost absolute value; for the latter, a spread of 2 is all that is needed).  Thus, the number of such integers $m$ is $\left\lfloor\frac{200}{1}\right\rfloor = 200$.

But, we have to remove one such $m$ (namely, $m=200$) since that leads to three solutions (in addition to the four solutions we count in the "general" case), because $|x-1|-2$ is reduced to $0$ at $x=3$, which nullifies the outermost absolute value.  This leaves $200-1=\boxed{199}$ as our final answer.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def count_solutions():
    """
    Count the number of positive integers m for which the equation ||x-1|-2|=m/100 has four distinct solutions.
