Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



We can see that this is a product of two equations, and each of them represents a circle on the XY-plane. In order for the product to be zero, one of the equations should be zero, meaning that we are looking for the intersection points of these circles.

The equations are the following:

1. $(|x + y| - 10)^2 = 0$ which simplifies to $|x + y| = 10$.
2. $(|x - y| - 10)^2 = 0$ which simplifies to $|x - y| = 10$.
3. $(|x| - 8)^2 = 0$ which simplifies to $|x| = 8$.
4. $(|y| - 8)^2 = 0$ which simplifies to $|y| = 8$.

The first two equations represent two circles in the XY-plane, each with a radius of 10, one centered at (0, 0) and the other at (0, 0) but with the y-values negated. The last two equations represent two more circles, each with a radius of 8, one centered at (0, 0) and the other at (0, 0) but with the x-values negated.

The intersection points of these four circles represent the vertices of the polygon we are looking for. To find these intersection points, we can use the method of solving systems of equations.

Let's find the intersection points of the circles centered at (0, 0):

1. $(x + y)^2 = 100$
2. $(x - y)^2 = 100$
3. $x^2 + y^2 = 64$
4. $x^2 + y^2 = 64$

From the first and the third equations, we can see that they are equal, so we can eliminate them from the system. We can then simplify the remaining equations to:

1. $x + y = 10$
2. $x - y = 10$
3. $x^2 + y^2 = 64$

Now we can solve the first two equations for x and y:

From equation 1, we have $x = 10 - y$. Substituting this into equation 2, we get:

$10 - y - y = 10$

Solving for y, we find that $y = 0$. Substituting this back into the equation for x, we find that $x = 10$.

So one intersection point is at (10, 0).

By symmetry, the other intersection points will be at (0, 10), (0, -10), and (-10, 0).

Thus, the polygon we are looking for is a square with side length of 20 units. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$ square units.

The answer is $\boxed{400}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, we see that the equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. That means either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

2. Let's analyze the first term $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$. 
   This equation simplifies to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. 
   The solutions of these equations are four lines passing through points $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, and $(0, -10)$.

3. Now let's analyze the second term $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. 
   This equation simplifies to $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. 
   The solutions of these equations are four lines passing through points $(8, 0)$, $(-8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, and $(0, -8)$.

4. The intersection points of these lines are $(8, 0)$, $(-8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, and $(0, -8)$. 

5. The figure formed by these points is a square with side length $16$ (since it's a square, we can use the Pythagorean theorem: $8^2 + 8^2 = 16^2$). 

6. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{256}$ square units.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The equation is given by $F(x,y) = ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. We are asked to find the area of the convex polygon that this equation encloses.

2. Notice that this is the product of two terms. The first term, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$, equals to $0$ if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The second term, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2$, equals to $0$ if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

3. The first set of conditions $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ implies that the polygon is a square with side length $10$.

4. The second set of conditions $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ implies that the polygon is a square with side length $8$.

5. The area of the square formed by the first set of conditions is $10^2 = 100$ square units. The area of the square formed by the second set of conditions is $8^2 = 64$ square units.

6. Therefore, the total area of the convex polygon is $100 + 64 = 164$ square units.

Here is the Python code to calculate the area of the polygon:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    # Area of the square formed by the first set of conditions
    area1 = 10**2

    # Area of the square formed by the second set of conditions
    area2 = 8**2

    # Total area of the convex polygon
    total_area = area1 + area2

    return total_area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 164

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
164
```
The area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{164}$ square units.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, let's break this down:

1. The expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ means that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us two lines: $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$.

2. Similarly, the expression $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ means that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

Now, let's find the intersection points:

1. Intersection of $x + y = 10$ and $x = 8$: Substituting $x = 8$ into the first equation, we get $y = 10 - 8 = 2$. So, the intersection point is $(8, 2)$.

2. Intersection of $x + y = 10$ and $y = 8$: Substituting $y = 8$ into the first equation, we get $x = 10 - 8 = 2$. So, the intersection point is $(2, 8)$.

3. Intersection of $x + y = 10$ and $x = -8$: Substituting $x = -8$ into the first equation, we get $y = 10 + 8 = 18$. So, the intersection point is $(-8, 18)$.

4. Intersection of $x + y = 10$ and $y = -8$: Substituting $y = -8$ into the first equation, we get $x = 10 + 8 = 18$. So, the intersection point is $(18, -8)$.

5. Intersection of $x - y = 10$ and $x = 8$: Substituting $x = 8$ into the second equation, we get $y = 8 - 10 = -2$. So, the intersection point is $(8, -2)$.

6. Intersection of $x - y = 10$ and $y = 8$: Substituting $y = 8$ into the second equation, we get $x = 10 + 8 = 18$. So, the intersection point is $(18, 8)$.

7. Intersection of $x - y = 10$ and $x = -8$: Substituting $x = -8$ into the second equation, we get $y = -8 - 10 = -18$. So, the intersection point is $(-8, -18)$.

8. Intersection of $x - y = 10$ and $y = -8$: Substituting $y = -8$ into the second equation, we get $x = 10 - 8 = 2$. So, the intersection point is $(2, -8)$.

Now, let's plot these points and find the area of the convex polygon:

1. Plot the points $(8, 2)$, $(2, 8)$, $(-8, 18)$, $(18, -8)$, $(8, -2)$, $(18, 8)$, $(-8, -18)$, and $(2, -8)$.

2. Connect these points in order to form a convex polygon.

3. Calculate the area of this polygon using the shoelace formula.

Let's do this in python:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Rational, simplify

def shoelace_formula(points):
    # Calculate the area using the shoelace formula
    area = 0
    for i in range(len(points)):
        area += points[i][0] * points[(i + 1) % len(points)][1]
        area -= points[i][1] * points[(i + 1) % len(points)][0]
    area = abs(area) / 2
    return area

# Define the points
points = [(8, 2), (2, 8), (-8, 18), (18, -8), (8, -2), (18, 8), (-8, -18), (2, -8)]

# Calculate the area
area = shoelace_formula(points)
print(area)
```

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We can see that the given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so we need to set each factor to zero and solve the resulting equations.

2. The first expression is $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which gives us $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

3. The second expression is $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which gives us $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

4. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon, which are $(8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(8, -8)$.

5. Plotting these points on a coordinate plane, we can see that they form a square with side length $16$.

6. The area of a square is given by the square of its side length, so the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{256}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The given equation is a product of two quadratic expressions. The product of two factors equals zero if at least one of the factors equals zero. Therefore, we need to solve two separate equations:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

Now, let's solve each equation:

1. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10$
   This gives us two equations: $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$

2. $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x - y \vert = 10$
   This gives us two equations: $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$

3. $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8$
   This gives us two equations: $x = 8$ and $x = -8$

4. $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert y \vert = 8$
   This gives us two equations: $y = 8$ and $y = -8$

Now we have a system of equations:

1. $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$
2. $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$
3. $x = 8$ or $x = -8$
4. $y = 8$ or $y = -8$

By solving this system of equations, we find the following vertices of the polygon: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The polygon is a square with side length $16$. Therefore, the area of the polygon is $16^2 = 256$.

The answer is $\boxed{256}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We have the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

2. This equation is equal to 0 when either of the factors is equal to 0. So, we have two cases:
   a. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
   b. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

3. In case (a), $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This is a system of linear equations, and its solution forms a square with side length 20.

4. In case (b), $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This is a system of linear equations, and its solution forms a square with side length 16.

5. The convex polygon formed by the union of the solutions to cases (a) and (b) is the square with side length 20.

6. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.

So, the answer is $\boxed{400}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The problem requires us to find the area of a polygon that satisfies the given condition. We can rewrite the condition as a system of inequalities that represent the constraints for the points (x, y) inside the polygon.

2. Let's start by considering the term $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. This term equals to 0 if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us two pairs of linear inequalities: $x + y \geq 10$ and $x + y \leq -10$, and $x - y \geq 10$ and $x - y \leq -10$.

3. Similarly, considering the term $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$, we get two more pairs of linear inequalities: $x \geq 8$ and $x \leq -8$, and $y \geq 8$ and $y \leq -8$.

4. The intersection of all these inequalities represents the polygon we are looking for. The vertices of the polygon are the points where the constraints intersect. We can find these points by solving the systems of linear equations formed by the pairs of inequalities.

5. To find the area of the polygon, we can divide it into triangles and find the area of each triangle using the coordinates of their vertices. Then, we can sum up the areas of these triangles.

Let's solve the problem using Python and Sympy library:

```python

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, we see that the problem is asking for the area of the polygon defined by the points $\left(x, y\right)$ that satisfy the given condition.

2. We can notice that the left part of the equation defines the square of the absolute difference between $\vert x \pm y \vert$ and 10, and the right part defines the square of the absolute difference between $\vert x \vert$ and $\vert y \vert$ and 8. 

3. Therefore, the polygon is defined by the points that satisfy at least one of these conditions: $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

4. These conditions define a rectangle with vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

5. To find the area of this rectangle, we simply multiply the lengths of its sides. The side lengths are both $8 + 8 = 16$, so the area is $16 \times 16 = 256$.

6. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{256}$.

16_User:

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



If we consider each of the two products separately, we see that each one equals to zero if and only if at least one of its terms is equal to zero. 

We need to solve the following four inequalities:

1. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$
2. $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$
3. $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$
4. $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$

Solving 1 and 2 will give us the vertical lines, and solving 3 and 4 will give us the horizontal lines.

So our script should look like this:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Abs, solveset, S

def calculate_area():
    # Define the variables
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # Solve the inequalities
    solutions_1 = solveset(Abs(x + y) - 10, x, domain=S.Reals)
    solutions_2 = solveset(Abs(x - y) - 10, x, domain=S.Reals)
    solutions_3 = solveset(Abs(x) - 8, x, domain=S.Reals)
    solutions_4 = solveset(Abs(y) - 8, y, domain=S.Reals)

    # Calculate the area
    area = (max(solutions_1.args[0].args[1], 0) - min(solutions_1.args[0].args[0], 0)) * (max(solutions_2.args[0].args[1], 0) - min(solutions_2.args[0].args[0], 0))

    return area

result = calculate_area()
print(result)
```

The error we got is because we're trying to calculate the maximum and minimum of a variable rather than a number. We need to use `Max` and `Min` from `sympy.solvers` module instead. Let's correct the script:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Abs, solveset, S, Max, Min

def calculate_area():
    # Define the variables
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # Solve the inequalities
    solutions_1 = solveset(Abs(x + y) - 10, x, domain=S.Reals)
    solutions_2 = solveset(Abs(x - y) - 10, x, domain=S.Reals)
    solutions_3 = solveset(Abs(x) - 8, x, domain=S.Reals)
    solutions_4 = solveset(Abs(y) - 8, y, domain=S.Reals)

    # Calculate the area
    area = (Max(solutions_1.args[0].args[1], 0) - Min(solutions_1.args[0].args[0], 0)) * (Max(solutions_2.args[0].args[1], 0) - Min(solutions_2.args[0].args[0], 0))

    return area

result = calculate_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS (Max(0, y) + 10)*Max(0, -y)

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
(Max(0, y) + 10)*Max(0, -y)
```
The output doesn't look right because we're getting expressions like `Max(0, y)` which are not numbers. This is because Sympy doesn't know the maximum value of `y`. We need to tell it the interval where `y` can be. Let's modify the script:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Abs, solveset, S, Max, Min, Interval

def calculate_area():
    # Define the variables
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # Solve the inequalities
    solutions_1 = solveset(Abs(x + y) - 10, x, domain=S.Reals)
    solutions_2 = solveset(Abs(x - y) - 10, x, domain=S.Reals)
    solutions_3 = solveset(Abs(x) - 8, x, domain=S.Reals)
    solutions_4 = solveset(Abs(y) - 8, y, domain=S.Reals)

    # Calculate the area
    area = (Max(solutions_1.args[0].args[1], 0) - Min(solutions_1.args[0].args[0], 0)) * (Max(solutions_2.args[0].args[1], 0) - Min(solutions_2.args[0].args[0], 0))

    return area

result = calculate_area()
print(result)
``````output

CODE RESULTS (Max(0, y) + 10)*Max(0, -y)

INTERMEDIATE OUT :

(Max(0, y) + 10)*Max(0, -y)
```
The output is still not right. This is because the `Max` function in Sympy doesn't work with real numbers. We need to use the `piecewise` function from Sympy's `core` module to define a piecewise function. Let's modify the script:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Abs, solveset, S, Max, Min, Interval, Piecewise

def calculate_area():
    # Define the variables
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # Solve the inequalities
    solutions_1 = solveset(Abs(x + y) - 10, x, domain=S.Reals)
    solutions_2 = solveset(Abs(x - y) - 10, x, domain=S.Reals)
    solutions_3 = solveset(Abs(x) - 8, x, domain=S.Reals)
    solutions_4 = solveset(Abs(y) - 8, y, domain=S.Reals)

    # Calculate the area
    area = (Max(solutions_1.args[0].args[1], 0) - Min(solutions_1.args[0].args[0], 0)) * (Max(solutions_2.args[0].args[1], 0) - Min(solutions_2.args[0].args[0], 0))

    return area

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



- We have a system of equations, which are the conditions for the points to be inside the convex polygon. 
- We know that the area of the polygon is 0 if the polygon is a degenerate polygon, meaning it has a "hole" or is a single point. 
- In this case, we are given that the points satisfy one of the two conditions (the product of two quadratic equations is 0), which means that either one of the conditions must be true for all the points in the polygon. 
- This tells us that the polygon must be a line segment (since one of the conditions is absolute value which makes a V-shape) or a point. 
- If it's a line segment, we can find its length and multiply it by the width (which is 8 for both x and y) to get the area. 
- If it's a point, the area is 0. 

Now, let's write the code to solve it.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Abs, solve

def polygon_area():
    # Define the variables
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # Define the conditions
    condition1 = (Abs(x + y) - 10)**2 + (Abs(x - y) - 10)**2
    condition2 = (Abs(x) - 8)**2 + (Abs(y) - 8)**2

    # Solve the system of equations
    solutions = solve((condition1, condition2), (x, y))

    # Calculate the length of the line segment
    length = max(solutions) - min(solutions)

    # Calculate the area of the polygon
    area = length[0] * 8

    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS Traceback: line 19, in polygon_area
    length = max(solutions) - min(solutions)
ValueError: max() arg is an empty sequence

FAIL


INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
Traceback: line 19, in polygon_area
    length = max(solutions) - min(solutions)
ValueError: max() arg is an empty sequence

FAIL

```
This is not the correct solution. Let's take a step back and look at the conditions.

We have two conditions:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From the second condition, we can see that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that the points are in a square with side length 16.

Now, let's look at the first condition. If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, this means that both $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points are in a square with side length 20 centered at the origin.

Since the first condition is satisfied by all points in the square with side length 20, and the second condition is satisfied by all points in the square with side length 16, the polygon is the intersection of these two squares.

Therefore, the area of the polygon is the area of the smaller square, which is $(16/2)^2 = 64$ square units.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{64}$ square units.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, we need to know that $|x|$ is a absolute value of $x$. That is, it always returns a positive value.

2. We are given a equation: $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$

3. We know that a product equals zero if any of its factors equals zero. Therefore, we can set each factor equal to zero:

   a. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
   b. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
   c. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
   d. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

4. Solving these equations, we get:
   a. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$
   b. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$
   c. $\vert x \vert = 8$
   d. $\vert y \vert = 8$

5. From c and d, we get $x = 8$ or $x = -8$ and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

6. Now, let's analyze these four points: $(8,8), (8,-8), (-8,8), (-8,-8)$. We can see that they form a square with side length 16.

7. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{256}$ square units.
