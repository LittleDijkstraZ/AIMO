Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either of the terms must be zero. This means we can consider two cases:

1) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us four lines in the coordinate plane.

From the second case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us four more lines in the coordinate plane.

The intersection of these lines form a square with side length 16. To find the area of this square, simply square the length of its side, we get $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solve, simplify

def area_of_polygon():
    # Side length of the square
    side_length = 16

    # Area of the square
    area = side_length**2

    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is $256$.
The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

Each of these equations imply specific conditions on $x$ and $y$. Therefore, the solution set of the given equation is the union of the solution sets of these four equations.

1. Solve $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$: This gives $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, or $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.

2. Solve $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$: This gives $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, or $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.

3. Solve $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$: This gives $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.

4. Solve $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$: This gives $\vert y \vert = 8$, or $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

Now, we can plot these lines and find the vertices of the polygon:

- The lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, $x - y = -10$, $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$ form a octagon.

To find the vertices of this octagon, we can simply solve the system of equations formed by the intersections of these lines:

- Intersection of $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ gives $(x, y) = (5, 5)$.
- Intersection of $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$ gives $(x, y) = (0, 10)$.
- Intersection of $x + y = 10$ and $x = 8$ gives $(x, y) = (8, 2)$.
- Intersection of $x + y = 10$ and $y = 8$ gives $(x, y) = (2, 8)$.
- Intersection of $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$ gives $(x, y) = (5, -5)$.
- Intersection of $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$ gives $(x, y) = (0, -10)$.
- Intersection of $x + y = -10$ and $x = -8$ gives $(x, y) = (-8, -2)$.
- Intersection of $x + y = -10$ and $y = -8$ gives $(x, y) = (-2, -8)$.

Thus, the vertices of the octagon are $(5, 5)$, $(0, 10)$, $(8, 2)$, $(2, 8)$, $(5, -5)$, $(0, -10)$, $(-8, -2)$, and $(-2, -8)$.

The area of the octagon can be found using the formula for the area of a square and then subtracting the areas of the four triangles that make up the square:

- The side length of the square is the distance between $(5, 5)$ and $(0, 10)$, which is $\sqrt{(5 - 0)^2 + (5 - 10)^2} = \sqrt{25 + 25} = \sqrt{50} = 5\sqrt{2}$.
- The area of the square is therefore $(5\sqrt{2})^2 = 50$.
- The area of each triangle is $0.5 * base * height = 0.5 * 5 * 5 = 12.5$.
- There are four triangles, so the total area of the triangles is $4 * 12.5 = 50$.
- The area of the octagon is therefore $50 - 50 = 0$.

However, we made a mistake in the calculation of the side length of the square. The correct side length should be the distance between $(5, 5)$ and $(5, -5)$, which is $\sqrt{(5 - 5)^2 + (5 - (-5))^2} = \sqrt{0 + 100} = 10$. So the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$.

Then the area of the octagon is $100 - 4 * 12.5 = 100 - 50 = 50$.

The area of the convex polygon is therefore 50 square units.

Here is the entire script:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, sqrt, simplify

def polygon_area():
    # Coordinates of the vertices
    vertices = [(5, 5), (0, 10), (8, 2), (2, 8), (5, -5), (0, -10), (-8, -2), (-2, -8)]

    # Calculate the side length of the square
    side_length = sqrt((vertices[0][0] - vertices[3][0])**2 + (vertices[0][1] - vertices[3][1])**2)

    # Calculate the area of the square
    square_area = side_length**2

    # Calculate the area of the triangles
    triangle_area = 0.5 * 5 * 5 * 4

    # Calculate the area of the octagon
    octagon_area = square_area - triangle_area

    return octagon_area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

The area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{50}$ square units.
The output should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression, so we have made an error in our calculation. Let's re-evaluate the problem:

The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

Each of these equations imply specific conditions on $x$ and $y$. Therefore, the solution set of the given equation is the union of the solution sets of these four equations.

1. Solve $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$: This gives $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, or $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.

2. Solve $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$: This gives $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, or $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The equation given in the problem is a product of two expressions equal to zero. Therefore, either the first expression equals zero or the second expression equals zero (or both).

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. This expression equals zero if and only if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This happens if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, and their reflections across the x and y axes.

The second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. This expression equals zero if and only if both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This happens if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$, and their reflections across the x and y axes.

These lines form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)

The area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 This problem is asking for the area of the region defined by the points $\left(x, y\right)$ that satisfy the given equation.

The equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. For the product of two numbers to be zero, either one of the numbers must be zero. Thus, we have two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or 
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

In the first case, we have $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.

In the second case, we have $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

These lines form a square with side length 16, and the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$
