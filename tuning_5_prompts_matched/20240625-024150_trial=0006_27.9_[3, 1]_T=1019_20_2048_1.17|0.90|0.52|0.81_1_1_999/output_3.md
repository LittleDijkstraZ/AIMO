This problem seems to have a mistake in the input equations. The equations given in the problem do not lead to a valid polygon. The abs() function in the equations results in a discontinuous function, which leads to multiple isolated points (instead of a connected region) when plotted in the xy-plane.

The method fails because the Sympy library is unable to solve the absolute value equations directly. 

This problem can be solved more efficiently by manually analysing the conditions. 

The equation is satisfied when either of the factors is equal to 0. 

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$: This occurs when $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$. These equations define a square with side length 10.

2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$: This occurs when $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. These equations define a square with side length 16.

The intersection of these two squares is a square with side length 8.

So, the total area of the polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares, which is $10^2 + 8^2 = 164$.

The answer is $\boxed{164}$.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. 

This equation is equal to 0 if and only if at least one of the factors is equal to 0. 

Hence, we have the following four cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

Solving each of these equations, we get the following pairs of points:

1. $(x, y) = (10, 10)$ or $(x, y) = (-10, -10)$
2. $(x, y) = (10, -10)$ or $(x, y) = (-10, 10)$
3. $(x, y) = (8, 8)$
4. $(x, y) = (8, 8)$

Plotting these points on the coordinate plane, we see that they form a square with side length 20. 

The area of this square is $20^2 = \boxed{400}$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 First, we need to analyze the given equation:

$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$

This equation equals to zero when either of the two factors is zero. So we have two cases:

1) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first case, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, it means that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This forms a square with side length of 20, and its area is $20^2 = 400$.

For the second case, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, it means that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This forms a square with side length of 16, and its area is $16^2 = 256$.

However, we need to consider that the two squares intersect with each other, forming a smaller square with side length of 8 (since $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ are part of the solutions for the first case). The area of this smaller square is $8^2 = 64$.

Therefore, the total area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares minus the area of the smaller square, which is $400 + 256 - 64 = 592$.

So, the answer is $\boxed{592}$.

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation implies that one of the following conditions must be satisfied:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
3. Both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
4. Both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

Let's analyze each condition and find the corresponding points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the conditions.

1. For $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$. Similarly, for $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ which means $x = 8$ or $x = -8$. Combining these results, we have four possible pairs of $(x, y)$: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -18)$, $(-8, 18)$, and $(-8, -2)$.

2. Similarly, for $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$. Similarly, for $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert y \vert = 8$ which means $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. Combining these results, we have four possible pairs of $(x, y)$: $(2, -6)$, $(2, 18)$, $(-2, -18)$, and $(-2, 6)$.

3. For both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ which gives us $x = 10$ and $y = 0$. The pair is $(10, 0)$.

4. For both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $x = 8$ and $y = 8$. The pair is $(8, 8)$.

These pairs of $(x, y)$ are the vertices of the polygon. We can now draw the polygon and find its area. The polygon is a square with side length $20$ units. The area of the square is $20^2 = 400$ square units.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{400}$ square units.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

 This problem is a special case of an identity which states that for any two real numbers $a$ and $b$, 
$$(a^2 - 2ab + b^2)(x^2 + y^2) = (ax + by)^2 - 2ab(x^2 + y^2).$$ 
Applying this identity to the given equation and simplifying, we get
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$
Since the equation equals zero, one of the factors must be zero. This gives us four cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert y \vert = 8$.

Solving these four cases, we find that the points $(x, y)$ must lie within a square with side length $20$ centered at the origin. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{400}$.

 We will analyze the problem and think about how to solve it. The points satisfying the equation are the points where the product of two quadratic expressions is zero. This means that either of the quadratic expressions must be zero at those points. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

Let's solve each case separately:

For case 1, we have four lines:
- $x + y = 10$
- $x + y = -10$
- $x - y = 10$
- $x - y = -10$

For case 2, we have four lines:
- $x = 8$
- $x = -8$
- $y = 8$
- $y = -8$

These lines enclose a rectangle with vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(8, -8)$.

The area of this rectangle is $(8 - (-8)) \times (8 - (-8)) = 16 \times 16 = 256$ square units.

So the answer is $\boxed{256}$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

 First, we observe that the product of two numbers is equal to zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is equal to zero. Therefore, we have two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

Let's consider the first case:

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
If $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.

These two conditions form a square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$, and its center is at the origin $(0,0)$.

Similarly, the conditions $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ form a square with side length $16$ and its center is also at the origin $(0,0)$.

The convex polygon is the intersection of the two squares, which is a square with side length $10$ and area $100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{100}$.

 The given equation implies that the product of two equations is zero, which means that each of them must be zero. We can split the given equation into two separate equations:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

The first equation implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm10$ and $x - y = \pm10$. Solving these four equations gives us the vertices of the polygon.

The second equation implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm8$ and $y = \pm8$. Solving these four equations gives us the vertices of the polygon.

However, due to the absolute values, there will be overlapping vertices in the solution of the first equation and the second equation. The overlapping vertices are the solutions of the system of equations $x + y = 10$, $x - y = 10$, $x = 8$, and $y = 8$. Solving this system gives us the overlapping vertices.

Finally, the area of the convex polygon can be calculated using the shoelace formula.

Let's implement this in Python:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solve, Abs

def shoelace_area():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # Solve the first equation
    solutions1 = solve([Abs(x + y) - 10, Abs(x - y) - 10], (x, y))

    # Solve the second equation
    solutions2 = solve([Abs(x) - 8, Abs(y) - 8], (x, y))

    # Remove overlapping vertices
    solutions = [s for s in solutions1 if s not in solutions2]

    # Calculate the area using the shoelace formula
    area = 0
    for i in range(len(solutions)):
        area += solutions[i][0]*solutions[(i+1)%len(solutions)][1] - solutions[i][1]*solutions[(i+1)%len(solutions)][0]
    area = abs(area) / 2

    return area

result = shoelace_area()
print(result)
```
