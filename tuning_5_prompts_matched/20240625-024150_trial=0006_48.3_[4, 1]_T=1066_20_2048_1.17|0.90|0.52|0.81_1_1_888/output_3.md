Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 To solve this problem, we need to first understand the equation and the conditions that it imposes on the points (x, y). Then, we'll use this understanding to analyze the shape of the polygon.

The equation is given as:

$((|x+y|-10)^2+(|x-y|-10)^2)((|x|-8)^2+(|y|-8)^2)=0$

This equation is satisfied if either of the following conditions holds:

1. $(|x+y|-10)^2+(|x-y|-10)^2=0$
2. $(|x|-8)^2+(|y|-8)^2=0$

Let's analyze these conditions:

1. For the first condition, we have $|x+y|=10$ and $|x-y|=10$. This means that for any point (x, y) satisfying this condition, the sum of the absolute values of x and y is 10. This represents a square with side length 10 and a vertex at the origin (0, 0).

2. For the second condition, we have $|x|=8$ and $|y|=8$. This means that for any point (x, y) satisfying this condition, the absolute values of x and y are both 8. This represents a square with side length 16 and a vertex at the origin (0, 0).

Now, we can see that the points that satisfy the equation enclose a convex polygon which is the intersection of the two squares. Therefore, the shape of the polygon is a square with side length equal to the smaller of the two squares, which is 10.

The area of a square with side length 10 is $10^2 = 100$ square units.

So, the answer is $\boxed{100}$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The expression will be equal to 0 when either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
Setting each of these to 0, we get the following 8 possible solutions for $(x, y)$: 
$(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8), (10, 0), (-10, 0), (0, 10), (0, -10)$

Plotting these points on a coordinate plane, we can see that they form a square with side length 16. 

To calculate the area of the square, we use the formula $s^2$, where $s$ is the length of a side of the square. Therefore, the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The given equation can be rewritten as a product of two terms equals to zero. Therefore, the solution set is the union of the solutions of the two separate equations: 
\begin{align*}
&(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0,\\
&(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0.
\end{align*}

These equations both represent the solutions of a set of four lines in the coordinate plane. The first equation corresponds to the lines $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. The second equation corresponds to the lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. The solutions to these equations form a rectangle with vertices at $(\pm 8, \pm 8)$.

[python]
from sympy import symbols, simplify, Abs

def area_of_rectangle():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    x, y = symbols('x y')
    # The width and height of the rectangle are each 16 units (8 to each side)
    width = 16
    height = 16

    # The area of the rectangle is the product of the width and height
    area = simplify(width * height)

    return area

result = area_of_rectangle()
print(result)
[/python]

The area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{256}$ square units.

Assistant:

 This problem is a bit too difficult for a text-based environment like a forum or StackOverflow. However, it might be a good fit for a more advanced mathematical software like Mathematica, MATLAB, or even a CAS like Sympy. 

Here's a start: Rewrite the absolute value terms as piecewise expressions. Consider the case where $x$ is in the interval $[0,1]$ and $y$ is in the interval $[2,3]$ and show that the expression equals $0$. Similarly, for the other cases. Once you've done that, it might be more feasible to determine the vertices of the polygon and finally calculate the area.

If you're looking to apply the solution of this problem to a programming environment, I recommend using a math software like Mathematica or MATLAB.
