Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So, we have two cases to consider:

   a) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
   b) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

2. For each case, we get the following equations:

   a) i) $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, ii) $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
   b) i) $\vert x \vert = 8$, ii) $\vert y \vert = 8$.

3. Solving the absolute value equations in each case:

   a) i) $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
   ii) $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
   b) i) $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
   ii) $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

4. Combining all the solutions, we get the vertices of the polygon:

   $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(2, 8)$, $(2, -8)$, $(-2, 8)$, $(-2, -8)$.

5. Plotting these points on the coordinate plane and connecting them with line segments, we get a square with side length 16.

6. To find the area of the square, we use the formula for the area of a square, which is $side^2$. So, the area of the polygon is $16^2 = 256$.

So the answer is: $256$

Here is the entire python script:
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solve

def calculate_area():
    # Define the variables
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # Solve the absolute value equations
    solutions_x = solve([abs(x) - 8, abs(x) + 8])
    solutions_y = solve([abs(y) - 8, abs(y) + 8])

    # Combine all the solutions
    vertices = [(x_val, y_val) for x_val in solutions_x for y_val in solutions_y]

    # Plot the points and calculate the area of the square
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length**2

    return area

result = calculate_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $\boxed{256}$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Firstly, notice that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. This gives us two separate equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For equation 1, both terms need to be zero:

$\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

For equation 2, both terms need to be zero:

$\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

So the four vertices of the polygon are the intersections of the pairs of lines:

1. $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$.
2. $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$.
3. $x = 8$ and $y = 8$.
4. $x = -8$ and $y = -8$.

Solving these system of equations, we find the vertices:

1. $(5, 5)$,
2. $(-5, -5)$,
3. $(8, 8)$,
4. $(-8, -8)$.

The polygon is a square with side length $10$, so its area is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $\boxed{100}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The equation $ab = 0$ is true if and only if either $a = 0$ or $b = 0$. Therefore, the given equation is satisfied if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. Each of these equations implies that either $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The solutions to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ are the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$. Similarly, the solutions to $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ are the lines $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$, the solutions to $\vert x \vert = 8$ are the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$, and the solutions to $\vert y \vert = 8$ are the lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

These lines enclose a square with side length 16 (the distance between the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$), so the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: 256.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ implies that either one of the two factors is zero. This happens when either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, or when $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. 

For $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$. Similarly, for $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = \pm 10$. And for $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$. And for $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = \pm 8$. 

These conditions define a square with vertices at $(\pm 8, \pm 8)$. The side length of the square is $16$, so the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. 

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $256$.

    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)

The area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$
