Assistant:

 The given equation is satisfied if and only if at least one of the factors is zero. This happens when:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

These conditions define a square with side length 16. The vertices of the square are the points where the absolute values are equal to their bounds, i.e., $(8,8), (8,-8), (-8,8),$ and $(-8,-8)$. The area of the square is the side length squared, which is $16^2 = 256$. So, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, hence either one of the terms must be zero. Thus, we have two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10 \Rightarrow x + y = \pm 10$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8 \Rightarrow x = \pm 8$
3. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert y \vert = 8 \Rightarrow y = \pm 8$

From case 1 and case 2, the vertices of the polygon are $(8, 2), (8, -2), (-8, 2), (-8, -2)$.
From case 1 and case 3, the vertices of the polygon are also $(2, 8), (2, -8), (-2, 8), (-2, -8)$.

The polygon is a square with side length $16$, so its area is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$

Assistant:

 The problem involves finding the area of a polygon formed by the points that satisfy a given equation. However, instead of solving the problem directly, we can simplify it by analyzing the equation itself. 

The equation is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. A product of two terms equals zero if and only if one or both of the terms are zero. Thus, we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This will happen if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ are on the lines $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(\pm 10, 0)$, $(0, \pm 10)$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This will happen if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ are on the lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. These lines form a square with vertices at $(\pm 8, 0)$, $(0, \pm 8)$.

Comparing the two cases, we see that the square is completely contained within the rectangle. Therefore, the polygon formed by the points that satisfy the given equation is the square with vertices at $(\pm 8, 0)$, $(0, \pm 8)$. The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$. The answer is: $64$

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, which means that either one of the terms is zero or both are zero. If both terms are zero, then $|x+y|=10$, $|x-y|=10$, $|x|=8$, and $|y|=8$. The solutions to these equations are $x=\pm8$, $y=\pm8$, and $x=y=\pm10$. These are the vertices of a rectangle with sides of length 16 and 20. Therefore, the area of the rectangle is $16 \times 20 = 320$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 320.

Here is a Python code that calculates the area of the polygon:
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    # Calculate the side lengths
    side1 = 2 * 10
    side2 = 2 * 8

    # Calculate the area
    area = side1 * side2

    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

The area of the convex polygon is 320. The answer is: $320$

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.

If the first expression is zero, we have $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. Since squares of real numbers are always non-negative, the only way this equation can hold is if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) = 0$. This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only way this can happen is when both $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$. Solving these systems of equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(0, 10)$, $(10, 0)$, $(0, -10)$, and $(-10, 0)$.

Similarly, if the second expression is zero, we have $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = 8$ or $x = -8$ and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. This gives us the same vertices as before.

So the vertices of the polygon are $(0, 10)$, $(10, 0)$, $(0, -10)$, and $(-10, 0)$. These vertices form a square with side length $10$. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. So the area of the convex polygon is 100.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The equation $f(x, y) = (\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ defines the boundary of a shape. The points $(x, y)$ that satisfy $f(x, y) = 0$ are exactly the points on the boundary of this shape. The shape is a convex polygon because the boundary is a collection of straight line segments.
The area of this polygon is the area enclosed by the boundary of the shape.
To find the area of the polygon, we can simply find the area of the rectangle that encloses the shape and then subtract the areas of the four triangles outside the polygon.
The rectangle is formed by the points $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8),$ and $(-8, -8)$. The side lengths of the rectangle are $16$ in both the x and y directions. So the area of the rectangle is $16 \times 16 = 256$.
The four triangles outside the polygon are each right triangles with base and height of $8$ units. So the area of each triangle is $\frac{1}{2} \times 8 \times 8 = 32$. The total area of the four triangles is $4 \times 32 = 128$.
The area of the polygon is the area of the rectangle minus the area of the four triangles, which is $256 - 128 = 128$.
The answer is: $128$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The expression $AB = 0$ is true if and only if at least one of the factors is zero. Thus, the given equation is satisfied if at least one of the following two conditions is met:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first condition to hold, it must be that both $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These equations represent two lines in the plane: $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. These lines form a rectangle.

For the second condition to hold, it must be that both $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These equations represent four lines in the plane: $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. These lines form a square.

Therefore, the points satisfying both conditions encloses a square that is contained within the rectangle. The side length of the square is 8, so its area is $8^2 = 64$. The area of the convex polygon is the area of the square, namely 64. The answer is: $64$

The equation given in the problem is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$. 
If $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = \pm 10$. 
If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$. 
If $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = \pm 8$. 

These equations represent eight lines in the coordinate plane. The points that satisfy any of these equations form a square with side length 16. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of this square, which is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two terms, each of which is a square of a difference of absolute values. The product equals to zero if and only if at least one of the terms is zero. This gives us four equations to solve:
- $|x+y| - 10 = 0$,
- $|x-y| - 10 = 0$,
- $|x| - 8 = 0$,
- $|y| - 8 = 0$.

The solutions to the first two equations are lines $x+y=10$ and $x-y=10$. The solutions to the last two equations are lines $x=8$ and $y=8$. These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(8,0)$, $(0,8)$, $(-8,0)$, and $(0,-8)$. The sides of the rectangle are $16$ and $16$, so the area of the rectangle is $16*16 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $256$ square units.

Here is a Python code to calculate the area:
```python

def polygon_area():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length * side_length
    return area

result = polygon_area()

The area of the convex polygon is 256 square units.
The answer is: $256$.
