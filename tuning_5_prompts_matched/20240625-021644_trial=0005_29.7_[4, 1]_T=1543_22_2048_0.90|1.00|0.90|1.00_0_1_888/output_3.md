"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The area of the convex polygon can be found by multiplying the length of the base by the height and then dividing by 2.
The length of the base of the polygon is 16 (from -8 to 8 on the x-axis), and the height is also 16 (from -8 to 8 on the y-axis).
Therefore, the area of the polygon is (16 * 16) / 2 = 128 square units.
The answer is: $128$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 To solve this problem, we need to understand the conditions under which the equation is equal to zero, and then determine the shape of the polygon enclosed by these points.
First, let's observe the equation:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$
This equation is equal to zero if either of the two factors is equal to zero.

For the first factor to be zero, we need both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
This means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
Removing the absolute value signs, we have four equations: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.
Solving these equations, we obtain the vertices of the polygon as $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, and $(-5,-5)$.

For the second factor to be zero, we need both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
Removing the absolute value signs, we have four more vertices: $(8,0)$, $(-8,0)$, $(0,8)$, and $(0,-8)$.

Now we have a polygon with vertices at $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, $(-5,-5)$, $(8,0)$, $(-8,0)$, $(0,8)$, and $(0,-8)$.
This is a square with side length 10.

The area of a square with side length $s$ is $s^2$. So the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points satisfying the given equation is 100. The answer is: $100$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The problem statement asks for the area of the polygon enclosed by the points that satisfy the given equation. The equation is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The equation equals to zero if either of the two factors equals to zero. 
The first factor equals to zero if $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This forms a square with side length of 20.
The second factor equals to zero if $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. This forms a square with side length of 16.
Therefore, the polygon is the intersection of these two squares, which is a smaller square with side length of 8. The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$.
The answer is: $64$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The problem is asking for the area of the convex polygon formed by the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equation
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]
The equation is satisfied if either of the two factors is zero.
The first factor is zero when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
The second factor is zero when $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
These conditions form a square with side length 16.
The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
So, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 This problem is a bit tricky and requires some understanding of absolute value and how it interacts with equations.

The given equation is $$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$ 

For the product of two numbers to be zero, either one of them must be zero. Therefore, we have two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The absolute value functions $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$ give us the vertices of the square. The square has side lengths of 16 (since $\vert x \vert = 8$ implies $-8 \leq x \leq 8$, and the side length is $8 - (-8) = 16$).

To find the area of the square, we simply square the side length, so the area is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:


The problem statement asks us to provide a numerical answer for the area of a convex polygon that is enclosed by the points that satisfy the given equation. The equation is:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$
The equation is equal to zero if and only if either of the two factors is equal to zero. This implies that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. Each of these equations is satisfied by exactly four lines in the coordinate plane:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ gives $x + y = \pm 10$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ gives $x - y = \pm 10$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ gives $x = \pm 8$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ gives $y = \pm 8$.
The intersection points of these lines are the vertices of the polygon. By analyzing the possible combinations of signs, we find that the polygon is a square with side length 16. Therefore, the area of the polygon is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The expression is equal to $0$ if either of the factors is equal to $0$.
The first factor $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
This gives us two pairs of equations:
1) $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, which simplifies to $x = 10$ and $y = 0$.
2) $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$, which simplifies to $x = -10$ and $y = 0$.
The second factor $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
This gives us four more pairs of equations:
3) $x = 8$ and $y = 8$.
4) $x = 8$ and $y = -8$.
5) $x = -8$ and $y = 8$.
6) $x = -8$ and $y = -8$.
Plotting these points on a coordinate plane, we can see that they form a square with side length $16$.
The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two terms. The product equals to zero if and only if at least one of the terms equals to zero. Therefore, the solutions correspond to the sets of points that satisfy either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
Solving these equations, we find that the points satisfying the first two equations are of the form $(a, -a)$ and $(-a, a)$ for $a = 10$, and the points satisfying the last two equations are of the form $(8, b)$ and $(-8, b)$ for $b = 8$.
These points form a square with side length $20$, thus the area of the square is $20^2 = 400$. So the area of the convex polygon is $400$.

Here is a Python program to calculate the area of the convex polygon:

```python

def polygon_area():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    side_length = 20
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

The area of the convex polygon is $400$. The answer is: $400$

Assistant:

 The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ requires that both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These two equations are satisfied when $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four systems of equations, we find that the points that satisfy these conditions are $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, and $(-10, 0)$. 

Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ requires that $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are satisfied when $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these four systems of equations, we find that the points that satisfy these conditions are $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The graph of these points is a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
So, the area of the convex polygon is $256$.
The answer is: $256$
