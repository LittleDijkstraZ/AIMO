Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ can both be true only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

2. Solving the absolute value equations, we find four points: (8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), and (-8, -8).

3. The four points form a square with side length of 16.

4. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is $256$.

Here is the Python code to solve the problem:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    # The side length of the square
    side_length = 16

    # Calculate the area of the square
    area = side_length ** 2

    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{256}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, we need to recognize that the equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is true if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

2. The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that both $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x$ and $y$ are both in $[-10, 10]$.

3. The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that both $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x$ and $y$ are both in $[-8, 8]$.

4. Combining these two conditions, we find that the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the original equation must lie in the intersection of the two ranges, which is a square with side length 8 and centered at the origin.

5. The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 64. The answer is: $64$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, we notice that the product of two expressions equals to zero if and only if at least one of them equals to zero. Therefore, the equation given in the problem decomposes into two separate sets of equations:

1) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2) $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From the first set of equations we get:
1a) $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$.
From the second set of equations we get:
2a) $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

Now, we know that $\vert a \vert = b$ is equivalent to $a = b$ if $a \geq 0$, and $a = -b$ if $a < 0$. Applying this to the above equations, we get the following four sets of equations:

1b) $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x = \pm 8$.
2b) $x - y = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 8$.

We can solve these equations graphically or algebraically to get the intersections points. The intersections points are the vertices of the polygon. Once we have all vertices, we can calculate the area of the polygon.

Here is the Python code to solve this problem:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solve, simplify, Abs

def find_vertices():
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # Solve the equations
    solutions1 = solve([Abs(x + y) - 10, Abs(x) - 8], (x, y))
    solutions2 = solve([Abs(x - y) - 10, Abs(y) - 8], (x, y))

    # Combine the solutions
    vertices = solutions1 + solutions2

    # Simplify the vertices
    vertices = [(simplify(x), simplify(y)) for x, y in vertices]

    return vertices

vertices = find_vertices()
print(vertices)
```

CODE RESULTS [(-8, -2), (-8, 18), (8, -18), (8, 2), (-18, -8), (-2, 8), (2, -8), (18, 8)]

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
[(-8, -2), (-8, 18), (8, -18), (8, 2), (-18, -8), (-2, 8), (2, -8), (18, 8)]
```
Now we have the vertices of the polygon: $(-8, -2), (-8, 18), (8, -18), (8, 2), (-18, -8), (-2, 8), (2, -8), (18, 8)$.

To find the area of the polygon, we can use the Shoelace formula. The Shoelace formula is given by:

Area = $\frac{1}{2} |(x_1y_2 + x_2y_3 + ... + x_ny_1) - (y_1x_2 + y_2x_3 + ... + y_nx_1)|$.

Here are the coordinates of the vertices in order: $(-8, -2), (-8, 18), (8, -18), (8, 2), (-18, -8), (-2, 8), (2, -8), (18, 8)$.

We can apply the Shoelace formula:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def shoelace_formula(vertices):
    x, y = zip(*vertices)
    n = len(vertices)
    area = abs(sum(x[i]*y[(i+1)%n] - x[(i+1)%n]*y[i] for i in range(n))) / 2
    return area

area = shoelace_formula(vertices)
print(area)
```

CODE RESULTS 0

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
0
```
The area of the polygon is 0. However, this result is incorrect. The Shoelace formula gives the area of a polygon with vertices in clockwise or counterclockwise order. Since the vertices of the polygon form a square, it is obvious that they must be in a clockwise or counterclockwise order. So, we must have made a mistake in applying the formula.

Let's retrace our steps and try a different approach. The four equations we derived from the original equation represent the sides of a square, and the vertices of this square are the intersections of the sides. To find the vertices of the square, we can solve each pair of equations separately.

For example, to find the intersection of the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x = 8$, we can substitute $x = 8$ into the first equation to get $8 + y = 10$, which gives $y = 2$. So one vertex of the square is $(8, 2)$.

Similarly, we can find the other vertices as $(-8, -2)$, $(-8, 18)$, $(8, -18)$, and $(8, 2)$. This is the same set of vertices we got before, so we are confident that we have the correct vertices.

Now that we have the vertices, we can calculate the side length of the square. The side length is the distance between any two adjacent vertices. For example, the distance between $(8, 2)$ and $(-8, -2)$ is $\sqrt{(8 - (-8))^2 + (2 - (-2))^2} = \sqrt{16^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{256 + 16} = \sqrt{272} = 2\sqrt{68} = 2*2\sqrt{17} = 4\sqrt{17}$.

Since it's a square, all sides have the same length. Therefore, the area of the square is the side length squared, which is $(4\sqrt{17})^2 = 16*17 = 272$.

However, this area is incorrect as well. The equations we derived from the original equation do not represent the sides of a square. Let's retrace our steps and try a different approach.

The original equation is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. If both products in the equation are equal to zero, then each product must be equal to zero. So we have two sets of equations:

1) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2) $(\vert

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Thus the given equation is equivalent to the union of the following two sets of equations:

$$
\begin{cases}
((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0 \\
((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0
\end{cases}
$$

Solving the first set of equations, we find:

$$
\begin{cases}
\vert x + y \vert = 10 \\
\vert x - y \vert = 10
\end{cases}
$$

This gives the vertices of a square with side length 10 and diagonals of length $10\sqrt{2}$.

Solving the second set of equations, we find:

$$
\begin{cases}
\vert x \vert = 8 \\
\vert y \vert = 8
\end{cases}
$$

This gives the vertices of a square with side length 8 and diagonals of length $8\sqrt{2}$.

The combined convex polygon is the union of these two squares, which is a rectangle with sides of lengths 18 and 16.

The area of the rectangle is $18 \cdot 16 = 288$.

Therefore the area of the convex polygon is 288.
The answer is: $288$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The given equation is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. This equation equals to zero if either the first part or the second part equals to zero. This implies that either $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

2. These are the equations of four squares with side lengths 10 and 8. The four squares enclose a convex polygon.

3. To find the area of this convex polygon, we calculate the area of each square and sum them up. The area of a square is given by side length squared.

4. The side length of the first two squares is 10, so their areas are $10^2 = 100$. The side length of the last two squares is 8, so their areas are $8^2 = 64$.

5. Adding the areas of the four squares, the total area of the convex polygon is $100 + 100 + 64 + 64 = 332$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 332.

However, you were asking for the numerical answer, not the algebraic expression. The area of the convex polygon is 332. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{332}$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. In order for this equation to be equal to 0, either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.

If the first term is zero, we have $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This is only possible if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ are zero. This happens if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. These equations give us the lines $y = -x + 10$, $y = -x - 10$, $y = x + 10$, and $y = x - 10$.

If the second term is zero, we have $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This is only possible if both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2$ are zero. This happens if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. These equations give us the lines $y = 8$, $y = -8$, $x = 8$, and $x = -8$.

These lines form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: 256

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Step 1: To solve this problem, we first need to understand that the product of two expressions equals zero if and only if at least one of the expressions equals zero. Therefore, we can set each factor equal to zero and solve the resulting equations.

Step 2: We have two equations to solve: $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x - y| - 10 = 0$, which give $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$. The solutions to these equations are pairs of points that form a square with side length 20.

Step 3: Similarly, we have another two equations: $|x| - 8 = 0$ and $|y| - 8 = 0$, which give $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. The solutions to these equations are points that form a square with side length 16.

Step 4: The intersection of these two squares is the region we are interested in, which is a square with side length 8.

Step 5: The area of this square is the square of the side length, so the area is $8^2 = 64$.

Now, let's write a Python script to calculate the area:

```python

def area_of_polygon():

The equation $$ ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0 $$

is satisfied if either of the two following conditions is met:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, or
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The first condition is only satisfied if both $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the conditions for a square of side length $10$ centered at the origin.

The second condition is only satisfied if both $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which forms a square of side length $16$ centered at the origin.

The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for. It is a square of side length $10$ centered at the origin.

The area of a square with side length $s$ is $s^2$. Therefore, the area of our polygon is $10^2 = 100$.

The final answer is: $100$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The expression given in the problem is a product of two expressions equal to zero. According to the zero-product property, the product of two factors equals zero if and only if at least one of the factors is zero. Hence, we have two cases to consider:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

In case 1, both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ must be zero. This means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. By solving these equations, we find the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy case 1 are $(10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, $(-10, 0)$, and $(0, -10)$.

In case 2, both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2$ must be zero. This means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. By combining the solutions from both cases, we find the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the original equation are $(10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(0, -10)$, $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$. These points form a square with side length 20. The area of the square is side length squared, so the area is $20^2 = 400$.

So, the area of the convex polygon formed by the points is 400 square units.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 400. The answer is: $400$

2. Each term equaling zero implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
3. Solving each of these equations, we get the four points $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.
4. This forms a square with side length $16$. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256. Now let's write the entire script for solving the problem step by step:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    # From the equation, we know that |x+y| = 10 and |x-y| = 10, and |x| = 8 and |y| = 8
    # Solving these equations, we get the four points (8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), and (-8, -8)
    # This forms a square with side length 16
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is 256.
The answer is: $256$
