Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is of the form $(A)(B) = 0$. This means that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the points that satisfy the equation must satisfy either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$.

The equations $A = 0$ and $B = 0$ are:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, and
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first equation, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, to be true, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These conditions give us the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$, as well as the lines $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle.

For the second equation, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, to be true, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These conditions give us the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$, as well as the lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$. These lines form a square.

The intersection of the rectangle and the square is the convex polygon. The area of the square is $8 \times 8 = 64$. The area of the rectangle is $20 \times 20 = 400$. However, the intersection of the rectangle and the square is a smaller square with side length 10 (the shorter sides of the rectangle and the square). The area of this square is $10 \times 10 = 100$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of the smaller square, which is 100.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The expression $A \cdot B = 0$ is true if and only if $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Thus, the given equation is satisfied if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
For the first equation to be true, both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points lie on the lines $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.
For the second equation to be true, both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that the points lie on the lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
The points that satisfy the equation form a square with side length 16 (the maximum possible value of $x$ or $y$ from the lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$). The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$.

The equation $A \cdot B = 0$ is true if and only if $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. So, the given equation is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$, which gives us four lines in the coordinate plane.

The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$, giving us four more lines in the coordinate plane.

These lines enclose a rectangle with side lengths 16 and 20, so the area of the rectangle is $16 \times 20 = 320$. The answer is: $320$

Assistant:

 The equation given in the problem is a product of two terms equal to zero. Therefore, either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

The first term is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. This term is zero if and only if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) = 0$. This implies that $|x+y| = 10$ and $|x-y| = 10$. The only possible solutions to these equations are $x=5, y=5$ and $x=-5, y=-5$.

The second term is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. This term is zero if and only if both $(\vert x \vert - 8) = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8) = 0$. This implies that $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. The only possible solutions to these equations are $x=8, y=8$, $x=8, y=-8$, $x=-8, y=8$, and $x=-8, y=-8$.

The solutions to the first set of equations, $x=5, y=5$ and $x=-5, y=-5$, satisfy the second set of equations as well. Therefore, these points are the vertices of the polygon.

The polygon is a square with side length 10 units. To find the area of the square, we simply square the length of its side. The area of the square is $10^2 = 100$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units. The answer is: $100$

 The equation given in the problem is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

The first term is zero when $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. These equations simplify to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, $(-10, 0)$, and $(0, -10)$.

The second term is zero when $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. These equations simplify to $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, $(-8, 0)$, and $(0, -8)$.

The intersection of the two rectangles is a smaller square with side length 8 and vertices at $(8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, $(-8, 0)$, and $(0, -8)$. The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$. 

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 64 square units.

The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero, the second term is zero, or both are zero.

The first term is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. This term is zero if and only if both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

The second term is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. This term is zero if and only if both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

Solving these equations, we find that the points that satisfy these conditions are the vertices of a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

 The problem states that we need to find the area of a convex polygon formed by the points that satisfy the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

The equation equals to zero if and only if either of the two factors equals to zero. 

The first factor equals to zero when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two pairs of parallel lines in the coordinate plane, so they enclose a rectangle.

The second factor equals to zero when $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two pairs of parallel lines in the coordinate plane, so they enclose a square.

Therefore, the points that satisfy the equation form a rectangle with side lengths of 16 (from $\vert x \vert = 8$ to $\vert x \vert = -8$) and 20 (from $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ to $\vert x - y \vert = 10$). The area of the rectangle is therefore $16 \times 20 = 320$. The answer is: $\boxed{320}$.

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so it is zero when either of the expressions is zero. The equation is of the form $AB = 0$, where $A$ and $B$ are the two expressions. Therefore, either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. 

The expressions $A$ and $B$ are both of the form $((\vert x \pm y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. For these expressions to be zero, we need $\vert x \pm y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. 

From $\vert x \vert = 8$, we get $x = 8$ or $x = -8$. Similarly, from $\vert y \vert = 8$, we get $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. 

Now, consider the equation $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. Substituting the possible values of $x$ and $y$, we get the following solutions:
- For $x = 8$ and $y = 8$, we get $16 = 10$, which is not possible.
- For $x = 8$ and $y = -8$, we get $0 = 10$, which is not possible.
- For $x = -8$ and $y = 8$, we get $0 = 10$, which is not possible.
- For $x = -8$ and $y = -8$, we get $-16 = 10$, which is also not possible.

Similarly, considering the equation $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, we get the same results. 

However, if we consider the absolute values, we can see that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ implies that $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$, and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ implies that $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$. 

The possible solutions are:
- For $x = 8$ and $y = -8$, we get $x + y = 0$, which satisfies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. And $x - y = 16$, which satisfies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
- For $x = -8$ and $y = 8$, we get $x + y = 0$, which satisfies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. And $x - y = -16$, which satisfies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

So, the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equation are $(8, -8)$ and $(-8, 8)$. These two points form a line segment, and the area of this line segment is 0.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 0.
The answer is: $0$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is satisfied if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This means either $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
These absolute value equations can be rewritten as the following system of equations:
1. $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$
2. $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$
3. $x = 8$ or $x = -8$
4. $y = 8$ or $y = -8$

By solving these systems of equations, we find the following vertices for the polygon:
$(8, 2)$, $(8, -18)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, -18)$, $(10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(0, -10)$.

The polygon is an octagon with sides of length 16 and diagonals of length 20.
We can divide the octagon into 4 right triangles by drawing the diagonals from the center of the octagon to each vertex.
Each right triangle has legs of length 8 and 10, so its area is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot 8 \cdot 10 = 40$.
Since there are 4 right triangles, the total area of the octagon is $4 \cdot 40 = 160$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 160.
The answer is: $160$

 The problem statement is quite complex, but we can simplify it by recognizing that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So, we have two cases to consider:

1. Either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two squares in the coordinate plane.
2. Either $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two squares in the coordinate plane.

The intersection of these squares forms a square with side length 16. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$
