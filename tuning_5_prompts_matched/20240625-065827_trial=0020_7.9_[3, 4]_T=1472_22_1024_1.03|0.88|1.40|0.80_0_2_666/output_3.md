Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, which implies that each expression must be zero.
The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. Setting this equal to zero gives $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two perpendicular lines with slopes of 1 and -1 passing through the points $(0,10)$ and $(10,0)$, respectively, and the points $(0,-10)$ and $(-10,0)$, respectively.
The second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. Setting this equal to zero gives $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which are the equations of two perpendicular lines with slopes of 1 and -1 passing through the points $(8,0)$ and $(0,8)$, respectively, and the points $(-8,0)$ and $(0,-8)$, respectively.
The four lines intersect at the points $(0,8)$, $(0,-8)$, $(8,0)$, and $(-8,0)$, forming a square with side length 16. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$.

The python code to calculate the area of the square is:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def square_area():
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = square_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is $\boxed{256}$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The given equation is a product of two expressions, so for the product to be zero, either one of the expressions must be zero. That means either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first expression to be zero, it must be the case that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length 10.

For the second expression to be zero, it must be the case that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This forms a square with side length 16.

However, we are only interested in the intersection of the two squares, which is the smaller square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. So the area of the convex polygon is 100.

The answer is: $100$

Assistant:

 The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. In order for the product of two numbers to be zero, either one of the numbers must be zero. Therefore, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. If a square of a real number is zero, then the real number must be zero. Hence, either $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, or $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. These give us the following equations:

1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ which implies $x + y = \pm 10$ or $x + y = 0$.
2. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ which implies $x - y = \pm 10$ or $x - y = 0$.
3. $\vert x \vert = 8$ which implies $x = \pm 8$.
4. $\vert y \vert = 8$ which implies $y = \pm 8$.

The solutions to these equations are the vertices of the polygon. By plotting these vertices on a coordinate plane and connecting them with line segments, we can see that the polygon is a square with side length $16$. Therefore, the area of the polygon is $16^2 = 256$. So, the area of the polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. Let's consider each term separately:

1. The first term is zero when either $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x-y| - 10 = 0$. This means $|x+y| = 10$ or $|x-y| = 10$. These are the equations of two lines in the plane.
2. The second term is zero when either $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$. This means $|x| = 8$ or $|y| = 8$. These are the equations of two lines in the plane.

The intersection points of these lines form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output

The area of the convex polygon is $256$ square units. The answer is $\boxed{256}$.
