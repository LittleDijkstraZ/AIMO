Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



We are given the two equations:
1) $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$
2) $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$

And we need to calculate $f(100)$.

Notice that we cannot directly calculate $f(100)$ from the given equations. However, if we plug $n=100$ into equation 2, we get $f(200)=2f(100)+1$. This means that to find $f(100)$, we need to find a value for $f(200)$.

But we still cannot directly calculate $f(200)$ from the given equations. However, if we plug $n=200$ into equation 2, we get $f(400)=2f(200)+1$. This means that to find $f(200)$, we need to find a value for $f(400)$.

Let's continue this process until we reach a value that we can directly calculate from the given equations. 

If we plug $n=400$ into equation 2, we get $f(800)=2f(400)+1$. This means that to find $f(400)$, we need to find a value for $f(800)$.

If we plug $n=800$ into equation 2, we get $f(1600)=2f(800)+1$. This means that to find $f(800)$, we need to find a value for $f(1600)$.

If we plug $n=1600$ into equation 2, we get $f(3200)=2f(1600)+1$. This means that to find $f(1600)$, we need to find a value for $f(3200)$.

If we plug $n=3200$ into equation 2, we get $f(6400)=2f(3200)+1$. This means that to find $f(3200)$, we need to find a value for $f(6400)$.

If we plug $n=6400$ into equation 2, we get $f(12800)=2f(6400)+1$. This means that to find $f(6400)$, we need to find a value for $f(12800)$.

We can see a pattern here. We are doubling the value of $n$ in each step, and we need to find the corresponding value for $f(n)$ in each step.

However, we also notice that we cannot keep doubling $n$ indefinitely because we would need an infinite number of steps to reach $f(100)$. So we need to find a way to break this loop.

Notice that if we plug $n=6400$ into equation 1, we get $f(f(f(6400)))=8*6400-7$. This means that to find $f(f(f(6400)))$, we need to find a value for $f(6400)$.

But if we plug $n=f(6400)$ into equation 2, we get $f(2f(6400))=2f(f(6400))+1$. This means that to find $f(f(6400))$, we need to find a value for $f(f(6400))$.

So we have a loop: $f(f(f(6400)))=f(f(6400))$. This means that $f(6400)$ is a fixed point of the function $f$.

Now we need to find a value for $f(6400)$ that satisfies both equations.

We can use equation 1 to find that $f(6400)=3200$.

Then we can use equation 2 to find that $f(3200)=6400$.

So we have a pair of values $(6400, 3200)$ that satisfy both equations.

Since $f(6400)=3200$, we can plug this back into equation 2 to find that $f(3200)=6400$.

So we have another pair of values $(3200, 6400)$ that satisfy both equations.

We can continue this process to find more pairs of values that satisfy both equations.

However, we notice that the values in each pair are always equal to each other plus or minus a multiple of $6400$. This means that the function $f$ is periodic with a period of $6400$.

Now we can use this periodicity to find $f(100)$.

We know that $f(6400)=3200$. Since the period is $6400$, we have $f(6400+100)=f(6500)=3200+100=3300$.

So we have $f(100)=3300$.

So the answer is $\boxed{3300}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, and we want to find $f(100)$, so we can set $n = f(f(100))$.
2. According to the second condition, we have $f(2f(f(100)))=2f(f(100))+1$.
3. Substituting $n = f(f(100))$ into the first condition, we have $f(8f(f(100))-7)=2f(f(100))+1$.
4. Now we have a new function $g(x)=f(8x-7)$ such that $g(f(f(100)))=2f(f(100))+1$.
5. If we can find $f(f(100))$, we can easily calculate $f(100)$.

Now, let's try to find $f(f(100))$.

1. From the second condition, we have $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, so $f(200)=2f(100)+1$.
2. Substituting $n=100$ into the first condition, we have $f(f(f(100)))=8*100-7=793$.
3. So, $f(f(200))=793$.
4. Again, according to the second condition, we have $f(400)=2f(200)+1$.
5. Substituting $n=200$ into the first condition, we have $f(f(f(200)))=8*200-7=1583$.
6. So, $f(f(400))=1583$.
7. We can find that $f(f(400))$ is a multiple of $793$, and the only possibility is $f(f(400))=793*2=1586$, but $1586>1583$, so this possibility is not correct.
8. We can also find that $f(f(400))$ is a multiple of $2f(100)+1$, and the only possibility is $f(f(400))=2f(100)+1=1583$, so $2f(100)=1582$, $f(100)=791$.

So, $f(100)=\boxed{791}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Let's denote $f(n)$ as $F_n$. The problem statement is given by the following two equations:

$F_{F_{F_n}} = 8n - 7$  (Equation 1)

$F_{2n} = 2F_n + 1$  (Equation 2)

We need to find $F_{100}$.

Let's start with $F_1$. We know that $F_{F_1} = 8*1 - 7 = 1$, which means $F_1 = 1$ or $F_1 = 3$. However, since $F_{2n} = 2F_n + 1$, $F_1$ must be odd. Therefore, $F_1 = 1$.

Now, let's calculate $F_2$. From Equation 2, we have $F_2 = 2F_1 + 1 = 2*1 + 1 = 3$.

Then, we calculate $F_3 = F_{F_2} = F_3 = 8*2 - 7 = 9$.

Next, $F_6 = F_{F_3} = F_9 = 8*3 - 7 = 17$.

And $F_{12} = F_{F_6} = F_{17} = 8*6 - 7 = 45$.

Continuing this process, we can find that $F_{100} = F_{F_{45}} = F_{177}$.

To find $F_{177}$, we continue the process:

$F_{354} = F_{F_{177}} = F_{887} = 8*45 - 7 = 359$.

And so on...

Eventually, we can find that $F_{100} = F_{359} = F_{F_{1777}} = F_{14215} = 8*710 - 7 = 5679$.

So, the answer is $\boxed{5679}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, let's take the first condition: $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. This means that applying the function $f$ three times to $n$ gives us $8n-7$. Now let's take the second condition: $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. This means that if we take twice the value of $n$, the function $f$ applied to this gives us twice the value of $f(n)$ plus one. 

Now, let's try to apply these conditions to find $f(100)$. Since we are looking for $f(100)$, we can start with the first condition: $f(f(f(100)))=8(100)-7=793$. So, $f(f(100))$ is a number that when fed into the function three times gives us 793. 

Now, let's look at the second condition: $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. This means that if we apply $f$ to twice the value of $n$, we get twice the value of $f(n)$ plus one. This gives us some insight into how the function behaves. 

We can try to find a number that when we apply the function $f$ to it, we get $f(100)$. Let's call this number $n'$. So we have $f(n')=f(100)$. From the second condition, we know that if we apply $f$ to twice the value of $n'$, we get twice the value of $f(n')$ plus one. So we have $f(2n')=2f(n')+1=2f(100)+1$. 

Since we know that $f(f(f(100)))=793$, we can set up the equation $f(2n')=793$. Now we can try to solve for $n'$. Since we don't have a direct way to solve for $n'$, we can try to find a number that when we apply the function $f$ to it, we get 793. 

We can start by setting up the equation $f(f(n''))=793$. From the second condition, we know that if we apply $f$ to twice the value of $n''$, we get twice the value of $f(n'')$ plus one. So we have $f(2n'')=2f(n'')+1=2(793)+1=1587$. 

We can then solve for $n''$: $f(n'')=793$ and $f(2n'')=1587$. Since we know that $f(f(f(100)))=793$, we can set up the equation $f(2n'')=793$. Solving for $n''$ gives us $n''=100$. 

So we have found that $n'=n''=100$. Therefore, $f(100)=f(n')=f(100)$. 

Now we can use the second condition to find $f(100)$: $f(2(100))=2f(100)+1$. Solving for $f(100)$ gives us $f(100)=2(100)-1=199$. 

So the answer is $\boxed{199}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



We know that f(f(f(n)))=8n-7, and that f(2n)=2f(n)+1. 

Now, if we plug in f(2n) into the first equation, we get: f(2f(f(n)))=8f(f(n))-7. 

Now, let's replace n with f(n), so we get: f(2f(f(f(n))))=8f(f(f(n)))-7. 

But we know that f(f(f(n)))=8n-7, so we can replace the right side: f(2(8n-7))=8(8n-7)-7.

Simplifying this, we get: f(16n-14)=64n-61. 

Now, let's replace n with f(n) again: f(16f(f(n))-14)=64f(f(n))-61. 

We know that f(f(n))=8n-7, so we can replace it: f(16(8n-7)-14)=64(8n-7)-61. 

Simplifying this, we get: f(128n-136)=512n-511. 

Now, let's plug in n=f(n) into this equation, so we get: f(128f(f(n))-136)=512f(f(n))-511. 

We know that f(f(n))=8n-7, so we can replace it: f(128(8n-7)-136)=512(8n-7)-511. 

Simplifying this, we get: f(1024n-1032)=4096n-4095. 

So, we have the equation: f(1024n-1032)=4096n-4095. 

Now, let's solve it for f(100). 

We need to find the value of n such that 1024n-1032=100. 

Solving this equation, we get n=26. 

So, f(100)=4096*26-4095=106271. 

But since we need to output a positive integer, we take 106271%1000=271.

So, f(100)=271.

The answer is $\boxed{271}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First we need to understand what the function $f$ does. From the first equation, we can see that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. This means that if we apply the function $f$ three times to a number $n$, we get $8n-7$. The second equation is $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. This means that if we double a number $n$ and apply the function $f$ to the result, we get twice the result of applying the function $f$ to $n$, plus 1.

To find $f(100)$, we can use the second equation. We can start by setting $n=50$, which gives us $f(2*50) = 2f(50) + 1$. We know from the first equation that $f(f(f(50)))=8*50-7=393$, so $f(100)=393$. Now we can substitute this back into the equation to find $f(50)$: $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 \implies 393 = 2f(50) + 1 \implies f(50) = (393-1)/2 = 196$.

Now we can substitute $f(50)$ into the equation to find $f(25)$: $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1 \implies 196 = 2f(25) + 1 \implies f(25) = (196-1)/2 = 97.5$. But we know that $f(n)$ must be an integer, so there seems to be a problem here.

Let's go back and try to find a pattern in the function $f$. From the first equation, we can see that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. If we apply the function $f$ twice, we get $f(f(n))$. This means that $f(f(n))$ is the number that when $f$ is applied again, we get $8n-7$. From the second equation, we know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. If we apply the function $f$ to $2n$, we get $2f(n)+1$. This means that $f(2n)$ is the number that when divided by 2 gives $f(n)$ and we have 1 left over.

From this, we can see that $f(n)$ is always an odd number, and $f(2n)$ is always an even number. This means that $f(n)$ is always 1 less than $f(2n)$. We can use this to find $f(25)$. We know that $f(50)=196$, so $f(50)$ is 1 less than $f(100)=393$. Therefore, $f(25)=f(50)-1=195$.

Now we can substitute $f(25)$ into the equation to find $f(12.5)$: $f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1 \implies 195 = 2f(12.5) + 1 \implies f(12.5) = (195-1)/2 = 97$. But we know that $f(n)$ must be an integer, so there seems to be a problem here as well.

Let's go back and try to find a pattern in the function $f$ again. From the first equation, we can see that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. If we apply the function $f$ twice, we get $f(f(n))$. This means that $f(f(n))$ is the number that when $f$ is applied again, we get $8n-7$. From the second equation, we know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. If we apply the function $f$ to $2n$, we get $2f(n)+1$. This means that $f(2n)$ is the number that when divided by 2 gives $f(n)$ and we have 1 left over.

From this, we can see that $f(n)$ is always an odd number, and $f(2n)$ is always an even number. This means that $f(n)$ is always 1 less than $f(2n)$. We can use this to find $f(12.5)$. We know that $f(25)=195$, so $f(25)$ is 1 less than $f(50)=196$. Therefore, $f(12.5)=f(25)-1=194$.

Now we can substitute $f(12.5)$ into the equation to find $f(6.25)$: $f(12.5) = 2f(6.25) + 1 \implies 194 = 2f(6.25) + 1 \implies f(6.25) = (194-1)/2 = 96.5$. But we know that $f(n)$ must be an integer, so there seems to be a problem here as well.

Let's go back and try to find a pattern in the function $f$ again. From the first equation, we can see that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. If we apply the function $f$ twice, we get $f(f(n))$. This means that $f(f(n))$ is the

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



We are given two conditions:
1. $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$
2. $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$

Let's set $n=1$, then the first equation gives us $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$, the second equation gives us $f(2)=2f(1)+1=f(1)+1$.

Now, let's set $n=2$ in the second equation, we have $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2f(1)+2+1=2f(1)+3$.

Now, let's set $n=4$ in the first equation, we have $f(f(f(4)))=8*4-7=25$, since $f(f(f(4)))=f(f(2f(1)+3))=f(2f(2)+3)=f(2f(1)+3)$, we have $f(2f(1)+3)=25$.

Now, let's set $n=2f(1)+3$ in the second equation, we have $f(4f(1)+6)=2f(2f(1)+3)+1=2*25+1=51$.

Now, let's set $n=4f(1)+6$ in the first equation, we have $f(f(f(4f(1)+6)))=8*(4f(1)+6)-7=8f(1)+47$.

Since $f(f(f(4f(1)+6)))=f(f(51))=f(51)$, we have $f(51)=8f(1)+47$.

Now, let's set $n=51$ in the first equation, we have $f(f(f(51)))=8*51-7=399$.

Since $f(f(f(51)))=f(f(51))=f(51)$, we have $f(51)=399$.

So, we have $8f(1)+47=399$, solve this equation we get $f(1)=47$.

Now, let's set $n=100$ in the second equation, we have $f(200)=2f(100)+1$.

Since $f(200)=f(f(f(2f(1)+3)))=f(f(25))=f(51)=399$, we have $399=2f(100)+1$, solve this equation we get $f(100)=199$.

So, the answer is $\boxed{199}$.

4. Now, $f(2)=2f(1)+1=3$, $f(4)=2f(2)+1=7$, and $f(8)=2f(4)+1=15$.

5. Since $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we have $f(f(f(2)))=9$, so $f(f(2))=4$ and $f(2)=2$.

6. Therefore, we can conclude that $f(2n)=2f(n)$ if $n<5$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ if $n\geq5$.

7. To calculate $f(100)$, we first express $100$ in base $2$ to get $1100100$. This means $100=2^6+2^5+2^3+2^2$.

8. Therefore, $f(100)=f(2^6)+f(2^5)+f(2^3)+f(2^2)=2f(2^5)+2f(2^3)+2f(2^2)+2$.

9. Repeatedly applying the function, we get $f(100)=2f(32)+2f(8)+2f(4)+2=2(2f(16)+2f(4)+2)+2(2f(4)+2)+2(2f(2)+2)+2=2(2(2f(8)+2f(2)+2)+2(2f(2)+2)+2(2f(1)+2)+2)$.

10. Finally, $f(100)=2(2(2(2(2(2f(4)+2f(2)+2)+2(2f(2)+2)+2(2f(1)+2)+2)=2(2(2(2(2*7+2*3+2)+2(2*3+2)+2(2*1+2)+2)=2(2(2(2(14+6+2)+2(6+2)+2(2+2)+2)=2(2(2(24)+2(8)+2(4)+2)=2(2(48)+2(8)+2(4)+2=2(104)+2(8)+2(4)+2=208+16+8+2=\boxed{234}$.

This means $f(100)=234$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Let's find $f(1)$ using the second equation. We get $f(2)=2f(1)+1$. But we don't know the value of $f(1)$, so we can't solve it directly.

2. However, if we substitute $n=1$ into the first equation, we get $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$. So $f(f(f(1)))=1$. 

3. Now, we substitute $n=f(1)$ into the first equation, we get $f(f(f(f(1)))))=8*f(1)-7=1$. So $f(f(f(f(1))))=1$. 

4. Since $f(f(f(f(1))))=f(f(f(1)))$, we can get $f(f(f(1)))=1$. 

5. Now, we know $f(2)=2f(1)+1$, and $f(f(f(1)))=1$, we can get $f(1)=1$. 

6. Finally, we substitute $n=50$ into the second equation, we get $f(100)=2f(50)+1$. But we don't know the value of $f(50)$, so we can't solve it directly.

7. However, if we substitute $n=50$ into the first equation, we get $f(f(f(50)))=8*50-7=393$. So $f(f(f(50)))=393$. 

8. Now, we substitute $n=f(50)$ into the first equation, we get $f(f(f(f(50))))=8*f(50)-7=393$. So $f(f(f(f(50))))=393$. 

9. Since $f(f(f(f(50))))=f(f(f(50)))$, we can get $f(f(f(50)))=393$. 

10. Now, we know $f(100)=2f(50)+1$, and $f(f(f(50)))=393$, we can get $f(50)=393$. 

11. Finally, we substitute $n=50$ into the second equation, we get $f(100)=2f(50)+1=2*393+1=787$. 

So, the answer is $\boxed{787}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Firstly, we can observe that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. We can iterate this equation three times and get $f(f(f(f(n)))) = f(8n-7)$. By substitution, this can be further simplified to $f(f(8n-7)) = 8n-7$. 

Next, we can substitute $n=f(n)$ into the second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, which gives us $f(2f(n))=2f(f(n))+1$. 

If we set $f(n)=100$, then we can see that $f(f(n))=f(100)$, $f(2n)=f(200)$ and $f(2f(n))=f(200)$.

With the above two equations, we can see that $f(f(f(f(100)))) = f(8*100-7)$, and $f(f(200)) = 2f(100)+1$. 

If we continue this process, we can get the recursive function:
$f(n) = \frac{2f(n)+1}{2}$, $f(n) = \frac{2f(n)+1}{2}$, and so on.

Therefore, $f(100) = \frac{2f(100)+1}{2}$, which implies $f(100) = 1$. 

So, $f(100) = \boxed{1}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. From the second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we know that $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$. Now, $f(50)$ is unknown, so let's try to find it using the first equation.
2. We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, which means $f(f(f(50)))=8*50-7=393$. Let's substitute $n=50$ into this equation and find $f(50)$:
3. From the first equation, we know that $f(393) = 50$, so $f(f(f(50)))=393$ implies that $f(50) = f(f(393))$.
4. Now we know from the second equation that $f(393) = 2f(196.5) + 1$. Since $f(196.5)$ is not a natural number, we need to find another way.
5. Let's go back to the first equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and substitute $n=196.5$:
6. $f(f(f(196.5)))=8*196.5-7=1564$, so $f(f(196.5)) = f(1564)$.
7. Now we know from the second equation that $f(1564) = 2f(782) + 1$. Since $f(782)$ is not a natural number, we need to find another way.
8. Let's go back to the first equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and substitute $n=782$:
9. $f(f(f(782)))=8*782-7=6253$, so $f(f(782)) = f(6253)$.
10. Now we know from the second equation that $f(6253) = 2f(3126.5) + 1$. Since $f(3126.5)$ is not a natural number, we need to find another way.
11. Let's go back to the first equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and substitute $n=3126.5$:
12. $f(f(f(3126.5)))=8*3126.5-7=24997$, so $f(f(3126.5)) = f(24997)$.
13. Now we know from the second equation that $f(24997) = 2f(12498.5) + 1$. Since $f(12498.5)$ is not a natural number, we need to find another way.
14. Let's go back to the first equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and substitute $n=12498.5$:
15. $f(f(f(12498.5)))=8*12498.5-7=99983$, so $f(f(12498.5)) = f(99983)$.
16. Now we know from the second equation that $f(99983) = 2f(49991.5) + 1$. Since $f(49991.5)$ is not a natural number, we need to find another way.
17. Let's go back to the first equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and substitute $n=49991.5$:
18. $f(f(f(49991.5)))=8*49991.5-7=399923$, so $f(f(49991.5)) = f(399923)$.
19. Now we know from the second equation that $f(399923) = 2f(199961.5) + 1$. Since $f(199961.5)$ is not a natural number, we need to find another way.
20. Let's go back to the first equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and substitute $n=199961.5$:
21. $f(f(f(199961.5)))=8*199961.5-7=1599683$, so $f(f(199961.5)) = f(1599683)$.
22. Now we know from the second equation that $f(1599683) = 2f(799841.5) + 1$. Since $f(799841.5)$ is not a natural number, we need to find another way.
23. Let's go back to the first equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and substitute $n=799841.5$:
24. $f(f(f(799841.5)))=8*799841.5-7=6

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



From $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we can infer that the function $f$ applies 3 times to $n$ to get $8n-7$. This means that the function $f$ takes a number, applies it to the function twice, and then subtracts $7$. 

From $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can infer that the function $f$ takes twice a number, applies it to the function, and then multiplies it by 2 and adds 1. 

To find $f(100)$, we need to apply these two rules to $n$ = 100. 

First, we apply the rule $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to 100:
$f(f(f(100)))=8*100-7=800-7=793$. 

But $f(f(f(100)))=793$ does not match with the form of $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. 

Let's try another approach. Since $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ is a rule for all positive integers $n$, we can try some specific values to see if we can find a pattern. 

When $n=1$, $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$, and this does match with the form of $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. 

When $n=2$, $f(f(f(2)))=8*2-7=9$, and this also matches with the form of $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. 

When $n=3$, $f(f(f(3)))=8*3-7=17$, and this also matches with the form of $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. 

From these observations, we can infer that $f(n)$ always returns $2n+1$. 

Now we can calculate $f(100)$ by applying the rule $f(n)=2n+1$ to $n$ = 100:
$f(100)=2*100+1=200+1=201$. 

So the answer is $\boxed{201}$.
