 To solve the problem, we need to apply the two given conditions to find a pattern in the function $f$. 

First, let's consider the second condition $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. This implies that for any even number $n$, we can express it as $2k$ for some positive integer $k$, then $f(n) = f(2k) = 2f(k) + 1$. 

Now, let's apply the first condition $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. We can set $n = f(k)$ to get $f(f(f(f(k)))) = 8f(k) - 7$. But we know that $f(f(f(k))) = 8k - 7$, so we can write $f(8k - 7) = 8f(k) - 7$. 

From the second condition, we can see that $8k - 7$ is always an even number. So we can set $8k - 7 = 2m$ for some positive integer $m$. Then we can express $k$ in terms of $m$ as $k = \frac{2m + 7}{8}$.

Now we substitute $k$ into the equation $f(8k - 7) = 8f(k) - 7$, which gives us $f(2m) = 8f\left(\frac{2m + 7}{8}\right) - 7$.

We can see that $f(2m)$ is always an even number, so we can set $f(2m) = 2f(m) + 1$. Comparing this with the equation we just derived, we have $2f(m) + 1 = 8f\left(\frac{2m + 7}{8}\right) - 7$.

Simplifying this equation, we get $2f(m) + 1 = 8f\left(\frac{2m + 7}{8}\right) - 7$. We can see that $f(m)$ and $f\left(\frac{2m + 7}{8}\right)$ are related. This implies that the function $f$ is a linear function of the form $f(x) = ax + b$.

To find the values of $a$ and $b$, we can use the two conditions given in the problem. From the second condition, we have $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. Substituting $f(x) = ax + b$, we get $a(2n) + b = 2(an + b) + 1$. Simplifying this equation, we get $2an + b = 2an + 2b + 1$, which implies $b = 1$.

Now we can substitute $f(x) = ax + 1$ into the first condition $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. This gives us $a(a(a n + 1) + 1) + 1 = 8n - 7$. Expanding this equation and comparing coefficients, we find that $a = 3$.

So the function $f(x) = 3x + 1$. Now we can calculate $f(100) = 3*100 + 1 = 301$.

So the value of $f(100)$ is $301$. The answer is: $301$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



We know the function $f$ maps positive integers to positive integers and it has two defining conditions:
1. $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$
2. $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$

We want to calculate $f(100)$. To do this, we can use the second condition by repeatedly applying it to halve $100$.

First, we can find that $f(200) = 2f(100)+1$.
Then, we can find that $f(100) = \frac{f(200)-1}{2}$.

To find $f(200)$, we can again use the second condition: $f(400) = 2f(200)+1$.
And we know that $f(400) = 8*100-7 = 793$.

Now we can substitute this value to find $f(200)$: $f(200) = \frac{f(400)-1}{2} = \frac{793-1}{2} = 396$.

Finally, we can substitute $f(200)$ to find $f(100)$: $f(100) = \frac{f(200)-1}{2} = \frac{396-1}{2} = 197$.

So, $f(100) = 197$. The answer is: $197$

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Given that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we want to calculate $f(100)$.

Notice that the second equation helps us calculate the function of an even number, but the first equation helps us to find the function of the function of the function of any number. Therefore, let's first calculate $f(f(f(100)))$ using the first equation.

$f(f(f(100))) = 8*100 - 7 = 793$.

Let's denote $x = f(100)$, then according to the first equation we have $f(x) = 793$.

Now we need to find the value of $x$, or $f(100)$, to substitute into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. To do that, we need to find a number $n$ such that $2n = x$. Since $x$ is an even number (because it equals to $8*100 - 7 = 793$, which is an odd number minus an odd number, resulting in an even number), we can choose $n = x/2$.

Then according to the second equation, we have:

$$f(x) = 2f(n) + 1.$$

Substituting $f(x)$ with $793$ and $n$ with $x/2$, we get:

$$793 = 2f(x/2) + 1.$$

Rearranging the equation to solve for $f(x/2)$, we get:

$$f(x/2) = \frac{793 - 1}{2} = \frac{792}{2} = 396.$$

Now we substitute $x/2 = 396$, so $x = 2*396 = 792$.

Finally, let's substitute $x = 792$ into the first equation:

$$f(f(f(100))) = 8*100 - 7 = 793.$$

We found that $f(792) = 793$. 

However, we made a mistake in our previous calculation, the correct calculation should be:

$$f(f(f(100))) = 8*100 - 7 = 793,$$
$$f(x) = 2f(n) + 1 = 2f(\frac{x}{2}) + 1 = 2*396 + 1 = 793.$$

So we got $f(100) = 792$.

Now let's solve the problem using python:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def calculate_f_100():
    # Given f(f(f(n)))=8n-7 and f(2n)=2f(n)+1
    # We want to find f(100)
    # First, calculate f(f(f(100)))
    f_f_f_100 = 8 * 100 - 7
    # Then, find the value of x such that f(x) = f(f(f(100)))
    x = f_f_f_100
    # Use the second equation to find f(x/2)
    f_x_div_2 = (f_f_f_100 - 1) / 2
    # Substitute x/2 into the first equation to find f(100)
    f_100 = 2 * f_x_div_2
    return int(f_100)

result = calculate_f_100()
print(result)
```

The value of $f(100)$ is $792$. The problem asks for a positive numerical answer, so we output the numerical value $792$. The answer is: $792$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."

To solve this problem, we first need to analyze the given function and conditions.

The second condition $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ tells us that $f(n)$ is an increasing function. 

The first condition $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$ tells us that applying the function $f$ three times to $n$ gives $8n - 7$.

Let's start by evaluating the function at $n = 1$. We have $f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = 1$, so $f(f(1)) = 1$.

Now, applying the second condition with $n = 1$, we get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2*1 + 1 = 3$.

Again, applying the second condition with $n = 2$, we get $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2*3 + 1 = 7$.

Applying the first condition with $n = 1$, we get $f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = 1$, so $f(f(1)) = 1$, and since $f(1) = 1$, we have $f(1) = 1$.

Now, applying the first condition with $n = 2$, we get $f(f(f(2))) = 8*2 - 7 = 9$, so $f(f(3)) = 9$. Since $f(3) = 3$, we have $f(3) = 3$.

Similarly, applying the first condition with $n = 3$, we get $f(f(f(3))) = 8*3 - 7 = 17$, so $f(f(7)) = 17$. Since $f(7) = 7$, we have $f(7) = 7$.

We can continue this process to find the values of $f(n)$ for other values of $n$. However, it seems that this method is not very efficient. Instead, let's try to guess the form of the function and see if it satisfies the given conditions.

Based on the values we found, we can guess that $f(n) = 2n - 1$. Let's check if this guess satisfies the given conditions.

For the first condition, we have $f(f(f(n))) = f(f(2n - 1)) = f(2(2n - 1) - 1) = f(4n - 3) = 8n - 7$. So the first condition holds for $f(n) = 2n - 1$.

For the second condition, we have $f(2n) = 2(2n) - 1 = 4n - 1 = 2(2n - 1) + 1 = 2f(n) + 1$. So the second condition also holds for $f(n) = 2n - 1$.

Therefore, the function $f(n) = 2n - 1$ is the solution that satisfies both conditions. Now we can find $f(100)$ by substituting $n = 100$ into the function:

$f(100) = 2*100 - 1 = 199$.

So the value of $f(100)$ is 199.

Let's write a program to confirm our solution:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def f(n):
    return 2 * n - 1

f_100 = f(100)
print(f_100)
```

CODE RESULTS 199

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
199
```
The value of $f(100)$ is 199, which confirms our solution.
The answer is: $199$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."

To solve this problem, we need to find the value of $f(100)$ using the given conditions. We can start by trying to find a pattern in the function $f(n)$.

From the second condition, we know that $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. If we substitute $n = f(n)$ into this equation, we get $f(2f(n)) = 2f(f(n)) + 1 = 2f(n) + 1$. So, we have $f(2n) = f(2f(n))$. This implies that the function $f(n)$ doubles its argument. 

Now, let's try to find $f(100)$ using the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. If we substitute $n = 100$, we get $f(f(f(100)))=8(100)-7 = 793$. 

Now, we know that $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$ and $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$, and so on. We can keep applying the doubling operation until we reach $f(1)$, and then we can use the first condition to find $f(1)$.

Let's calculate the value of $f(1)$ using the first condition. If we substitute $n = 1$, we get $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7 = 1$. Since $f(f(f(1)))=1$, we know that $f(1)$ must be a number such that $f(f(f(1)))=1$. By trying different values, we find that $f(1) = 1$ satisfies this condition.

Now that we have found $f(1) = 1$, we can use the doubling operation to find $f(2) = 2(1) + 1 = 3$, $f(4) = 2(3) + 1 = 7$, $f(8) = 2(7) + 1 = 15$, and so on. 

Continuing this process, we can find that $f(100) = 793$. So the answer is $\boxed{793}$.

Here is a python code to calculate f(100):
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def f(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return 2 * f(n // 2) + 1

f_100 = f(100)
print(f_100)
```

CODE RESULTS 127

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output

```
The python code above gives an incorrect value for $f(100)$. The issue is that the python code is not correctly implementing the doubling operation for odd numbers. Let's modify the code to handle this case as well.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def f(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    elif n % 2 == 0:

For $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, the only possible value of $f(n)$ that we can figure out with $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ is by assuming $f(n)$ to be linear, i.e., $f(n) = kn$ for some integer $k$. Let's put this in the given equation:

$$f(f(f(n)))=f(f(kn))=f(2kn)=2f(kn)+1=2(kn)+1=2kn+1.$$

And we have $8n-7$ on the right-hand side. If we equate the two expressions:

$$2kn+1=8n-7,$$

which simplifies to $2kn=8n-8$ and finally to $k=4$. So we have $f(n) = 4n$. Now we substitute $n=100$ into the function $f(n)$:

$$f(100) = 4*100 = 400.$$

So the result is: $f(100) = 400$. The answer is: $\boxed{400}$

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."

 We notice that if we plug in $n = 1$ into the second equation, we get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. But we don't know the value of $f(1)$, so we can't directly compute $f(100)$ using the second equation.
However, if we plug in $f(n)$ into the first equation in place of $n$, we get $f(f(f(f(n)))) = 8f(n) - 7$. This means that if we let $m = f(n)$, we have $f(f(f(m))) = 8m - 7$. But from the second equation, we know that $f(f(m)) = 2f(m) + 1$, so we have $f(2f(m) + 1) = 8m - 7$.
Setting $m = 1$, we have $f(3) = 1$. Setting $m = 2$, we have $f(5) = 3$. Setting $m = 3$, we have $f(7) = 5$.
Notice that the sequence of values we are computing, 3, 5, 7, ..., are all odd numbers. And the values we are assigning to them, 1, 3, 5, ..., are all one less than the sequence of odd numbers.
This suggests that $f(n) = 2n - 1$ might be the function we are looking for. Let's check if it satisfies both conditions.
For the first condition, we have $f(f(f(n))) = f(2(2n - 1) - 1) = f(4n - 3) = 2(4n - 3) - 1 = 8n - 7$. So $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$.
For the second condition, we have $f(2n) = 2(2n - 1) + 1 = 4n - 2 + 1 = 4n - 1 = 2f(n) + 1$. So $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$.
Thus, $f(n) = 2n - 1$ is the function that satisfies both conditions. Now we can compute $f(100)$.
We have $f(100) = 2(100) - 1 = 200 - 1 = 199$.
Therefore, the value of $f(100)$ is 199. The answer is: $199$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



We are given two conditions:
1. $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$
2. $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$

To find $f(100)$, we first need to find a general expression for $f(n)$. We can do this by iterating through the second condition. If we set $n=2$, we get $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$. Similarly, we can find that $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$, and from the first condition we know that $f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = -1$, and thus $f(1) = -1$ (since $f$ maps only to positive integers, we can infer that $f(1) = 1$ because $f(f(f(1))) = -1$ implies that $f(f(1)) = 1$ and $f(1) = 1$).

Now we can substitute $f(1) = 1$ into $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$ to get $f(2) = 3$. We can then substitute $f(2) = 3$ into $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$ to get $f(4) = 7$.

We can continue this process to find a general expression for $f(n)$. We notice that $f(2^k) = 2^k + 1$ for positive integer $k$. So if $n$ is an odd number, say $n = 2k+1$, then $f(n) = 2f(2k+1) + 1$. And if $n$ is a power of $2$, say $n = 2^k$, then $f(n) = 2^k + 1$.

Now we can compute $f(100)$. $100 = 2^2 \cdot 5^2$, and since $f(2^k) = 2^k + 1$, we have $f(100) = f(2^2) = 2^2 + 1 = 5$.

Therefore, the value of $f(100)$ is 5. The answer is: $\boxed{5}$

 The given function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:
1. $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$
2. $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$

We want to find the value of $f(100)$.

From the first equation, we know that $f(f(f(100))) = 793$. This implies that $f(100)$ must be the number $x$ such that $f(x) = f(f(f(100)))/8 + 7/8$.

Then, from the second equation, we know that $f(2 \cdot f(f(f(100)))/8 + 7/8) = 2f(f(f(100)))/8 + 7/4 + 1$.

Since we know that $f(f(f(100)))=793$, we can substitute it into the equation to get $f(2 \cdot f(f(f(100)))/8 + 7/8) = 2 \cdot 793/8 + 7/4 + 1 = 199$.

So, we need to find the number $x$ such that $f(x) = 199$. We can use the second equation to find $f(2x)$:

$f(2x) = 2f(x) + 1 = 2 \cdot 199 + 1 = 399$.

So, we need to find the number $x$ such that $f(x) = 199$. We can keep using the second equation to find $f(2x)$, until we find a value of $x$ that is less than 100.

Let's keep doing this:

$f(398) = 2f(199) + 1 = 2 \cdot 199 + 1 = 399$.

$f(199) = 199$.

So, the number $x$ we are looking for is $x = 199$. Therefore, $f(100) = 199$.

So the value of $f(100)$ is 199. The answer is: $\boxed{199}$
