Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



We can separate the problem into 2 equations, since it's a product equal to zero:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first equation, since both terms are positive, the only way this can equal zero is if both terms are simultaneously zero. Therefore, $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

For the second equation, it's the same logic, both terms are positive, so they must be simultaneously zero. Therefore, $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

Now we have 4 equations:
1. $x + y = 10$
2. $x + y = -10$
3. $x - y = 10$
4. $x - y = -10$
5. $x = 8$
6. $x = -8$
7. $y = 8$
8. $y = -8$

The first 4 equations describe the lines in the coordinate plane, and the last 4 describe the horizontal and vertical lines.

When these lines are plotted on a graph, they form a square with side length 10 units (since $x$ and $y$ are both restricted to be within 8 units of 0, and since the square is centered at (0,0) these restrictions translate to a side length of 10 for the square).

Therefore, the area of the polygon is the area of the square, which is side length squared, or $10^2 = \boxed{100}$ square units.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Firstly, we can rewrite the equation as $ (|x + y| - 10)^2 + (|x - y| - 10)^2 = 0$ and $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$. This is because the product of two numbers is zero if and only if one or both of the numbers are zero.

Now, let's break down the equations into several parts:

1. For the first equation $(|x + y| - 10)^2 + (|x - y| - 10)^2 = 0$, it can be simplified as $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$. This is the equation of a square with side length 20.

2. For the second equation $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$, it can be simplified as $|x| = 8$ or $|y| = 8$. This is the equation of a rectangle with side length 16.

Now, let's find the intersection points of these two figures:

1. The intersection points of the square and the rectangle are the points that satisfy both equations. The square has 4 vertices at $(10, 10)$, $(10, -10)$, $(-10, 10)$, and $(-10, -10)$, while the rectangle has 4 vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

2. The intersection points of the square and the rectangle are $(10, 10)$, $(10, -10)$, $(-10, 10)$, and $(-10, -10)$.

Now, let's calculate the area of the convex polygon:

1. The area of the square is $20^2 = 400$.

2. The area of the rectangle is $16^2 = 256$.

3. The area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the square and the rectangle, which is $400 + 256 = 656$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{656}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We can rewrite the equation as $\vert x + y \vert = 10 \lor \vert x - y \vert = 10 \lor \vert x \vert = 8 \lor \vert y \vert = 8$. 

2. The absolute value $\vert x \vert = 8$ can be split into two separate equations: $x = 8 \lor x = -8$. Similarly for $y$, we have $y = 8 \lor y = -8$. 

3. Combining all these equations together, we can form a square with vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$. 

4. The distance between any two adjacent vertices is $16$ (e.g. the distance between $(8, 8)$ and $(8, -8)$), so the side length of the square is $16$.

5. The area of the square is then $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{256}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



- The given expression is a product of two expressions, equal to zero. So either one of the expressions must be zero, or both of them are zero.
- If either $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions of these two equations are the lines $x = -y + 10$ and $x = y + 10$ respectively.
- If either $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions of these two equations are the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$, and the lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$ respectively.
- The intersection of the lines $x = -y + 10$, $x = y + 10$, $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$ and $y = -8$ forms a square with side length $8$ (because the distance between $x = -y + 10$ and $x = y + 10$ is $10$, and the distance between $x = 8$ and $x = -8$ or $y = 8$ and $y = -8$ is $8$).
- The area of the square is $8^2 = 64$.

So the answer is $\boxed{64}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The given equation is a product of two quadratic expressions equated to zero. This means that either of the quadratic expressions should be zero for the equation to be valid. 

2. Let's denote $u = |x+y|$ and $v = |x - y|$. The equations $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$ are equivalent to $|x + y| + |x - y| = 16$ and $|x + y| - |x - y| = 16$ respectively.

3. Solving the system of equations $u = 10$ and $v = 10$ along with $u + v = 16$ and $u - v = 16$ we get the possible values of $(x, y)$ as $(0, 8)$, $(8, 0)$, $(-8, 0)$, and $(0, -8)$. These form the vertices of the polygon.

4. Each of the equations $|x+y| = 10$, $|x-y| = 10$, $|x| = 8$, and $|y| = 8$ represent a pair of lines. The intersection of these lines form the sides of the polygon.

5. The area of the polygon can be found by dividing the polygon into triangles and rectangles, and calculating the area of these shapes.

Let's calculate the area using sympy.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solve, Abs

def area_of_polygon():
    # Define the variables
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # Define the equations
    eq1 = Abs(x + y) - 10
    eq2 = Abs(x - y) - 10
    eq3 = Abs(x) - 8
    eq4 = Abs(y) - 8

    # Solve the system of equations
    solutions = solve([eq1, eq2, eq3, eq4], (x, y))

    # Find the vertices of the polygon
    vertices = set(solutions)

    # Calculate the area
    # In this case, the polygon is a square with side length 16, so the area is 16*16
    area = 16**2

    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

The area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{256}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We can see that the given equation is a product of two quadratic terms equal to zero. Therefore, each term should be equal to zero. We can split the problem into two parts: solve (|x + y| - 10) = 0 and (|x| - 8) = 0.

2. For the first equation, |x + y| = 10, we have two cases: x + y = 10 or x + y = -10. Similarly, for the second equation, |x| = 8, we have two cases: x = 8 or x = -8.

3. Now we have a total of 4 equations to solve:
   a. x + y = 10 and x = 8
   b. x + y = 10 and x = -8
   c. x + y = -10 and x = 8
   d. x + y = -10 and x = -8

4. We can solve these equations by substituting x in terms of y (or vice versa) and find the points (x, y) that satisfy these equations.

5. Finally, we plot these points on a graph and connect them to form a polygon. The area of this polygon is the solution to the problem.

```python

This is a common error when trying to solve an equation with the SymPy library, specifically with the solve function. This function is designed to solve for a single variable in an equation, but in this case we are trying to solve for two variables simultaneously. 

To solve this, we need to use a different method. Let's try to solve this problem analytically instead of using numerical methods. 

From the first equation |x + y| = 10, we can see that the points (x, y) lie on the lines x + y = 10 and x + y = -10. Similarly, from the second equation |x| = 8, we can see that the points (x, y) lie on the lines x = 8 and x = -8.

Now we can plot these lines on a graph and find the intersection points. The polygon formed by these intersection points will be the solution to the problem.

The lines x + y = 10 and x = 8 intersect at the point (8, 2), and the lines x + y = 10 and x = -8 intersect at the point (-8, 18). Similarly, the lines x + y = -10 and x = 8 intersect at the point (8, -18), and the lines x + y = -10 and x = -8 intersect at the point (-8, -2).

The polygon formed by these intersection points is a rectangle with side lengths 16 and 20. Therefore, the area of this rectangle is 16 * 20 = 320.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{320}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The given equation is a bit complicated, but it can be simplified by taking into account that $(a-b)^2=0$ if and only if $a=b$. Therefore, the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is equivalent to the system of equations:

   $$\begin{cases} 
   \vert x + y \vert = 10 \\
   \vert x - y \vert = 10 \\
   \vert x \vert = 8 \\
   \vert y \vert = 8 
   \end{cases}$$

2. This system of equations defines a rectangle centered at the origin with side lengths of 16 and 20 units. The points satisfying the system are the vertices of the rectangle.

3. Since we are asked to find the area of the convex polygon enclosed by these points, the area of the rectangle is the solution to the problem.

4. The area of a rectangle is given by the product of its side lengths, so the area of the rectangle is $16 \times 20 = 320$.

The answer is $\boxed{320}$.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



- We are asked to solve the problem and find the area of the convex polygon formed by the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the given equation.

- To solve this problem, we can use Python's sympy library to simplify and solve the equation.

Let's start with the equation:

\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0\]

From this equation, we can see that the product of two terms is zero, so each term must be zero. Therefore, we have two separate equations:

\[(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0\]
\[(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0\]
\[(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0\]
\[(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0\]

Each of these equations is in the form $\vert a \vert - b = 0$, which simplifies to $\vert a \vert = b$. Therefore, we have four more equations:

\[x + y = 10\]
\[x - y = 10\]
\[x = 8\]
\[y = 8\]

Now, let's solve these equations:

1. For the first equation, $x + y = 10$, we can see that it represents a line in the $xy$-plane with slope $-1$ and $y$-intercept $10$.
2. For the second equation, $x - y = 10$, it also represents a line in the $xy$-plane with slope $1$ and $y$-intercept $-10$.
3. For the third equation, $x = 8$, it represents a vertical line at $x = 8$.
4. For the fourth equation, $y = 8$, it represents a horizontal line at $y = 8$.

Now, let's find the intersection points of these lines:

1. Intersection of $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$: Solving these equations simultaneously gives $x = 10$ and $y = 0$.
2. Intersection of $x + y = 10$ and $x = 8$: Solving these equations simultaneously gives $x = 8$ and $y = 2$.
3. Intersection of $x + y = 10$ and $y = 8$: Solving these equations simultaneously gives $x = 2$ and $y = 8$.
4. Intersection of $x - y = 10$ and $x = 8$: Solving these equations simultaneously gives $x = 8$ and $y = -2$.
5. Intersection of $x - y = 10$ and $y = 8$: Solving these equations simultaneously gives $x = 18$ and $y = 8$.

So, the intersection points are $(10, 0)$, $(8, 2)$, $(2, 8)$, $(8, -2)$, and $(18, 8)$. These points form a convex polygon, and we can find its area using the Shoelace Formula.

The Shoelace Formula states that if the vertices of a polygon are given by $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$, ..., $(x_n, y_n)$, then the area of the polygon is given by:

\[\frac{1}{2} \left| \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i y_{i+1} - \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i+1} y_i \right|\]

where the indices are taken modulo $n$.

Let's apply the Shoelace Formula to our polygon:

\[A = \frac{1}{2} \left| (10 \cdot 0) + (8 \cdot 2) + (2 \cdot 8) + (8 \cdot -2) + (18 \cdot 8) - (0 \cdot 8) - (2 \cdot 10) - (-2 \cdot 18) - (8 \cdot 2) - (8 \cdot 8) \right|\]

\[A = \frac{1}{2} \left| 0 + 16 + 16 - 16 + 144 - 0 - 20 + 36 - 16 - 64 \right|\]

\[A = \frac{1}{2} \left| 96 \right|\]

\[A = 48\]

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{48}$ square units.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, let's denote $A = \vert x + y \vert - 10$, $B = \vert x - y \vert - 10$, $C = \vert x \vert - 8$, and $D = \vert y \vert - 8$. So, our equation can be rewritten as $A^2 B^2 C^2 D^2 = 0$. For the product to be zero, at least one of the variables must be equal to zero. 

1. If $A = \vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
2. If $B = \vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, then $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
3. If $C = \vert x \vert - 8 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
4. If $D = \vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, then $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

Now, let's solve each of these cases separately:

1. If $x + y = 10$, we can express $y = 10 - x$. Similarly, we can express $y = -10 - x$ if $x + y = -10$. Also, we have $y = x - 10$ if $x - y = 10$, and $y = -x + 10$ if $x - y = -10$. 

2. If $x = 8$, we can express $y$ as $y = (10 - x) = 2$ if $x + y = 10$, and $y = (-10 - x) = -18$ if $x + y = -10$. Also, we have $y = (x - 10) = -2$ if $x - y = 10$, and $y = (10 + x) = 20$ if $x - y = -10$. 

3. If $x = -8$, we can express $y$ as $y = (10 - x) = 18$ if $x + y = 10$, and $y = (-10 - x) = 2$ if $x + y = -10$. Also, we have $y = (x - 10) = 20$ if $x - y = 10$, and $y = (10 + x) = -2$ if $x - y = -10$.

Now, let's draw these points in a coordinate plane and connect them to form a polygon.

The resulting polygon is a square with side length $20$ (the distance between points $(8,2)$ and $(-8,2)$). The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{400}$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, we can see that the given equation is the product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

The first term is zero when $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$. The second term is zero when $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. 

Let's consider the first case, when $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$. This gives us four equations: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon: $(5, 5)$, $(5, -5)$, $(-5, 5)$, and $(-5, -5)$. 

Now, let's consider the second case, when $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. This gives us four more equations: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon: $(8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, $(-8, 0)$, and $(0, -8)$. 

Now, we have all the vertices of the polygon: $(5, 5)$, $(5, -5)$, $(-5, 5)$, and $(-5, -5)$ and $(8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, $(-8, 0)$, and $(0, -8)$. 

To find the area of the polygon, we can divide it into two triangles and one rectangle. The triangle formed by the vertices $(5, 5)$, $(5, -5)$, and $(0, 0)$ has base 10 and height 5, so its area is $0.5 * 10 * 5 = 25$. The triangle formed by the vertices $(-5, 5)$, $(-5, -5)$, and $(0, 0)$ also has base 10 and height 5, so its area is also 25. The rectangle formed by the vertices $(8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, $(-8, 0)$, and $(0, -8)$ has length 16 and width 16, so its area is $16 * 16 = 256$. 

Therefore, the total area of the polygon is $25 + 25 + 256 = 306$. 

So the answer is $\boxed{306}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, we have to understand the given equation. It's a product of two quadratic terms equaling zero. This means that either of the terms should be zero for the whole equation to be zero.

2. Now, let's look at each term individually. The absolute value function can be split into two cases based on the value inside the absolute value:
   - if the value is non-negative, the absolute value is the same as the value inside.
   - if the value is negative, the absolute value is the negation of the value inside.

3. So, we can split each term into two cases and solve for each case separately.

4. After solving for each case, we can plot these points on a graph and visualize the polygon.

5. Finally, we can calculate the area of the polygon.

Now, let's write a Python program to solve the problem:

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, we need to determine the conditions for which the equation holds. The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is true if either of the following conditions is true:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first condition, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, the only way this can be true is if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. We can solve these equations to get the coordinates of the vertices of the polygon.

For the second condition, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, the only way this can be true is if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. We can also solve these equations to get the coordinates of the vertices of the polygon.

Finally, we can calculate the area of the polygon using the coordinates of the vertices. The vertices of the polygon form a square with side length 20 (from $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$), so the area of the polygon is $20^2 = 400$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{400}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The given equation is a product of two terms set equal to zero. Therefore, this equation is satisfied if and only if either the first term is equal to zero, or the second term is equal to zero. 

The first term is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, which equals to zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. 

The second term is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$, which equals to zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. 

Let's draw the graphs of these four equations:

1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$: This is a square with vertices at $(10, 0), (0, 10), (-10, 0)$ and $(0, -10)$.

2. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$: This is also a square with vertices at $(10, -0), (-10, 0), (0, 10)$ and $(0, -10)$.

3. $\vert x \vert = 8$: This is a line segment on the x-axis from $(-8, 0)$ to $(8, 0)$.

4. $\vert y \vert = 8$: This is a line segment on the y-axis from $(0, -8)$ to $(0, 8)$.

The intersection points of these lines are the vertices of the polygon. There are 8 vertices in total: $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8)$ and $(-8, -8)$.

Now, let's calculate the area of the polygon. The polygon is formed by joining these vertices in a clockwise order, starting from the vertex $(8, 8)$. The vertices are connected as follows: $(8, 8)$ to $(8, -8)$ to $(-8, -8)$ to $(-8, 8)$ back to $(8, 8)$. 

The area of the polygon is the sum of the areas of the four right triangles formed by the vertices. Each triangle has a base and height of 16 units (the distance between the vertices of the squares). Therefore, the area of each triangle is $\frac{1}{2} \times 16 \times 16 = 128$ square units. 

Since there are four such triangles, the total area of the polygon is $4 \times 128 = 512$ square units.

The answer is $\boxed{512}$.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We have a system of equations with absolute values, and we know that if we multiply two equations, the result is zero if and only if at least one of the equations is zero.

2. This implies that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

3. The equations $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ give us $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

4. The equations $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ give us $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

5. The solutions to these equations are as follows:

    For $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, we get the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

    For $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, we get the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

6. These lines enclose a rectangle with side lengths $20$ and $16$, so the area of this rectangle is $20 \times 16 = 320$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{320}$.
