Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The given equation is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

2. The only way for this equation to hold true is if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, or if both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

3. If either of the above conditions hold true, then the entire left-hand side of the equation will be zero.

4. If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which implies that $x + y = \pm 10$.

5. Similarly, if $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies that $x - y = \pm 10$.

6. And if $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$, which implies that $x = \pm 8$.

7. And if $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that $y = \pm 8$.

8. From these equations, we can see that the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the given equation are the vertices of a square with side length 16 (since the absolute values range from -8 to 8).

9. The area of a square is given by side length squared, so the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $\boxed{256}$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero, or the second term is zero. This will give us two systems of equations to solve.

1. Solve $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. Solve $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For each system of equations, we will have four equations:

1.1. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$.
1.2. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.
1.3. $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$.
1.4. $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.

Solving each of these four systems of equations, we will get the coordinates of the vertices of the polygon.

Then, we will calculate the area of the polygon using the shoelace formula or other methods.

Finally, we will output the area of the polygon.

Here is the complete Python script:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Abs, solve, simplify

def calculate_area():
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # Solve the systems of equations
    solutions1 = solve([Abs(x + y) - 10, Abs(x) - 8], (x, y))
    solutions2 = solve([Abs(x - y) - 10, Abs(y) - 8], (x, y))

    # Combine the solutions
    solutions = solutions1 + solutions2

    # Calculate the area of the polygon using the shoelace formula
    area = 0
    for i in range(len(solutions)):
        x1, y1 = solutions[i]
        x2, y2 = solutions[(i + 1) % len(solutions)]
        area += x1*y2 - x2*y1
    area = abs(area / 2)

    return simplify(area)

result = calculate_area()

It seems there is a mistake in the Python script above. We should not simply set the absolute values equal to the given numbers and solve the resulting system of equations. We need to consider all possible cases for the absolute values. 

Let's correct the Python script and re-calculate the area:

```python

from sympy import symbols, Abs, solve, simplify

def calculate_area():
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # Solve the systems of equations
    solutions1 = solve([(x + y) - 10, (x) - 8], (x, y)) + solve([-(x + y) - 10, -(x) - 8], (x, y))
    solutions2 = solve([(x - y) - 10, (y) - 8], (x, y)) + solve([-(x - y) - 10, -(y) - 8], (x, y))

    # Combine the solutions
    solutions = solutions1 + solutions2

    # Calculate the area of the polygon using the shoelace formula
    area = 0
    for i in range(len(solutions)):
        x1, y1 = solutions[i]
        x2, y2 = solutions[(i + 1) % len(solutions)]
        area += x1*y2 - x2*y1
    area = abs(area / 2)

    return simplify(area)

result = calculate_area()
print(result)
```

Oops, the last error message means we can't add two dictionaries together. So we should revise our strategy to solve the absolute value equations.

We know that $|x| = a$ has two solutions $x = a$ and $x = -a$. So we can rewrite the absolute value equations into two separate equations and solve them separately.

Let's correct the Python script and re-calculate the area:

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The expression equals to zero when either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. 

This gives us the following possibilities:

1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10 \Rightarrow x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
2. $\vert x - y \vert = 10 \Rightarrow x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
3. $\vert x \vert = 8 \Rightarrow x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
4. $\vert y \vert = 8 \Rightarrow y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

This gives us a total of 16 equations. Let's solve them:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solve

def solve_equations():
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # Solve each equation
    solutions = []
    solutions.extend(solve(x + y - 10, (x, y)))
    solutions.extend(solve(x + y + 10, (x, y)))
    solutions.extend(solve(x - y - 10, (x, y)))
    solutions.extend(solve(x - y + 10, (x, y)))
    solutions.extend(solve(x - 8, x))
    solutions.extend(solve(x + 8, x))
    solutions.extend(solve(y - 8, y))
    solutions.extend(solve(y + 8, y))

    return solutions

result = solve_equations()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS [(10 - y, y), (-y - 10, y), (y + 10, y), (y - 10, y), 8, -8, 8, -8]

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
[(10 - y, y), (-y - 10, y), (y + 10, y), (y - 10, y), 8, -8, 8, -8]
```

So we have the following points:

1. $(10 - y, y)$ for $-8 \leq y \leq 8$
2. $(-y - 10, y)$ for $-8 \leq y \leq 8$
3. $(y + 10, y)$ for $-8 \leq y \leq 8$
4. $(y - 10, y)$ for $-8 \leq y \leq 8$
5. $(8, y)$ for $-8 \leq y \leq 8$
6. $(-8, y)$ for $-8 \leq y \leq 8$
7. $(x, 8)$ for $-8 \leq x \leq 8$
8. $(x, -8)$ for $-8 \leq x \leq 8$

These points form a rectangle with side lengths of 16 and 16, so the area of the rectangle is $16 \times 16 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def calculate_area():
    # Side lengths of the rectangle
    length = 16
    width = 16

    # Calculate the area
    area = length * width

    return area

result = calculate_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```

So, the area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of them is zero. Thus, the equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. 

For the first equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) = 0$. This implies that either $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two lines in the coordinate plane, forming a rectangle.

For the second equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, either $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. This implies that either $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two lines in the coordinate plane, forming a square.

The intersection of these two figures is a square, with side length equal to 10 (the length of the side of the rectangle). To find the area of this square, we simply square the length of one of its sides. Thus, the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    # The side length of the square is 10
    side_length = 10

    # The area of the square is the side length squared
    area = side_length ** 2

    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 100

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
100
```
The area of the convex polygon is $100$ square units. The answer is $\boxed{100}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of them is zero. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to the system of equations:

$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0,$$
$$((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$

The second equation implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $-8 \leq x, y \leq 8$.

The first equation implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives four cases to consider:

1. $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, which gives $x = 10$ and $y = 0$.
2. $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$, which gives $x = 0$ and $y = 10$.
3. $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$, which gives $x = 0$ and $y = -10$.
4. $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$, which gives $x = -10$ and $y = 0$.

So the vertices of the polygon are $(10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, and $(-10, 0)$. These points form a square with side length $20$. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $400$. The answer is: $400$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is: $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$

We know that the product of two factors is zero if and only if at least one of the factors is zero. Therefore, we have two separate cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10$, and 
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8 \text{ and } \vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

For the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. The set of points satisfying this equation forms a square with side length 10 and vertices at $(5, 5)$, $(5, -5)$, $(-5, -5)$, and $(-5, 5)$.

For the second case, we have $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us a total of 4 points: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$.

The combination of these two cases forms a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. So the area of the convex polygon is $100$.

Now let's write the Python code to calculate the area:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    # The side length of the square
    side_length = 10

    # Calculate the area of the square
    area = side_length ** 2

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 100

INTERMEDIATE OUT :

The area of the convex polygon is $100$.
The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The expression $A = ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ equals $0$ if and only if at least one of the factors equals $0$. This translates into four conditions: $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$. 

The solutions to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ are the points on the four lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.
The solutions to $\vert x \vert = 8$ are the points on the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$, and the solutions to $\vert y \vert = 8$ are the points on the lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

Plotting these eight lines, we get a square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$. Therefore, the area of the square is $(10\sqrt{2})^2 = 200$.

The answer is: $\boxed{200}$

4. From these two equations, we can deduce that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.
5. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0)$.

6. Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
7. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
8. From these two equations, we can deduce that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
9. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$.

10. The polygon is a square with side length 10, so its area is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $100$. The answer is: $100$
