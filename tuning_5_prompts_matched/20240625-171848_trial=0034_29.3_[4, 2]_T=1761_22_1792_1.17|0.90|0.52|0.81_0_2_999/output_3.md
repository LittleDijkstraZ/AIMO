Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The problem is asking us to solve an equation where the product of two quadratic expressions equals zero. This means that either of the quadratic expressions must be zero, and hence the points satisfying the equation must lie on the loci defined by each of the quadratic expressions being zero.

Let's analyze the two quadratic expressions separately:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$: This expression is minimized when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the four lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$: This expression is minimized when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So, we get the four lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 10 (the distance between the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$ or $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$). The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units. 

Now, let's write the python script to calculate the area of the square:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def square_area():
    side_length = 10
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = square_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 100

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
100
```
The area of the convex polygon is $100$. The answer is $\boxed{100}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, let's consider the multiplication of two expressions, both of which are zero when $x=0$. Therefore, in order for the whole equation to be zero, either one of the expressions must be zero. That is, we need to solve the equations:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From the second equation, we can deduce that both $|x|$ and $|y|$ must be equal to $8$. This gives us the points $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$ and $(-8, -8)$. These are the corners of a square with side length $16$.

Next, let's consider the first equation. For this equation to be zero, both $|x+y|$ and $|x-y|$ must be equal to $10$. This is actually a system of two equations:

1. $|x+y| = 10$
2. $|x-y| = 10$

From these, we can deduce that the values of $x$ and $y$ must satisfy either:

1. $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$
2. $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$
3. $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$
4. $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$

Solving these system of equations gives us the points $(5, 5)$, $(5, -5)$, $(-5, 5)$ and $(-5, -5)$. These are exactly the same points we obtained from the second equation.

So the entire set of points satisfying the equation is the set of points which are either $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$ or $(-8, -8)$ or $(5, 5)$, $(5, -5)$, $(-5, 5)$ or $(-5, -5)$. These points form a square with side length $16$.

Finally, we calculate the area of the square which is the square of the side length, so $Area = 16^2 = 256$. So the area of the polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$

This problem seems too complex to be solved directly by writing Python programs. Instead, let's think about the problem step by step.

First, let's look at the equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. The only way for the sum of two squares to be 0 is if both squares are 0. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us two equations: $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0)$.

Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us the vertices: $(8, 0), (-8, 0), (0, 8), (0, -8)$.

Now, we can plot these vertices on a coordinate plane and observe that they form a square with side length $10$. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $100$. The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We need to find the points (x, y) that satisfy the given equation. This equation equals to zero if and only if both the first and the second terms are zero.
2. For the first term, we have two cases to consider: (|x + y| - 10) = 0 or (|x - y| - 10) = 0. This means |x + y| = 10 or |x - y| = 10.
3. Similarly, for the second term, we have two cases: |x| - 8 = 0 or |y| - 8 = 0. This means |x| = 8 or |y| = 8.

By analyzing the above cases, we can find the boundary lines of the polygon. The vertices of the polygon are the intersection points of these lines.

After finding the vertices, we can calculate the area of the polygon using the shoelace formula or other methods.

Here is a simple python script to calculate the area:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Abs, solve, simplify

def calculate_area():
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # Find the vertices of the polygon
    vertices = [(-10, 0), (0, -10), (0, 10), (10, 0), (8, 8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8), (8, -8)]

    # Calculate the area using the shoelace formula
    area = 0
    for i in range(len(vertices)):
        x1, y1 = vertices[i]
        x2, y2 = vertices[(i + 1) % len(vertices)]
        area += x1 * y2 - x2 * y1
    area = abs(area / 2)

    return simplify(area)

result = calculate_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 192.000000000000

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output

The area of the convex polygon is 192. So the final answer is: 192.

print(192)

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 To solve this problem, we first need to understand the equation and its implications. The equation is a product of two quadratic expressions equaling zero, so it equals zero if either of the expressions equals zero. This means that either:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$,
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first expression to equal zero, both terms must be zero, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This results in the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

For the second expression to equal zero, both terms must be zero, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This results in the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersection points of these lines are $(8,8)$, $(-8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, and $(-8,-8)$. These points form a square with side length $16$. To find the area of this square, we square the side length, so the area is $16^2 = 256$.

The answer is: $256$.

Here is a Python program that computes the area:
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_square():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = area_of_square()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{256}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, let's denote $A = |x+y| - 10$ and $B = |x - y| - 10$. The equation becomes $AB \cdot |x|^2 \cdot |y|^2 = 0$. This equation equals to zero if and only if one of the following conditions is satisfied:

1. $A = 0 \Rightarrow |x+y| = 10$.
2. $B = 0 \Rightarrow |x - y| = 10$.
3. $|x| = 8$.
4. $|y| = 8$.

So the points that satisfy the equation lie on the following lines:

1. $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
2. $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
3. $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
4. $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

These lines form a square with side length $20$. Therefore, the area of the square is $20^2 = 400$. The answer is: $\boxed{400}$.

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, which means that each expression must be zero for the entire product to be zero. Thus, we have two systems of equations to solve:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
For the first system, we have:
1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$
2. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$
For the second system, we have:
3. $\vert x \vert = 8$
4. $\vert y \vert = 8$
From 3 and 4, we have $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
From 1 and 2, we have $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these systems of equations, we find that the four vertices of the polygon are $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$. This is a square with side length $16$. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. Thus, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

 To find the area of the convex polygon formed by the set of points that satisfy the given condition, we first need to understand the conditions under which the product equals zero. The product of two numbers equals zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first case, we have:

$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \implies \vert x + y \vert = 10 \implies x + y = \pm 10$.

$(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \implies \vert x - y \vert = 10 \implies x - y = \pm 10$.

These two equations give us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. The intersection points of these lines are: $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, and $(-10, 0)$. These points form a square with side length 10 units.

For the second case, we have:

$(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \implies \vert x \vert = 8 \implies x = \pm 8$.

$(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \implies \vert y \vert = 8 \implies y = \pm 8$.

These two equations give us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. The intersection points of these lines are: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$. These points form a square with side length 16 units.

The area of the convex polygon is the union of the areas of the two squares. The side length of the smaller square is 10 units, so its area is $10^2 = 100$ square units. The side length of the larger square is 16 units, so its area is $16^2 = 256$ square units. The area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares, which is $100 + 256 = 356$ square units. The answer is: $356$
