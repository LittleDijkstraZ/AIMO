 The problem asks for how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions.

To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of values of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly four distinct solutions.

The expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is equal to $\frac{m}{100}$ for exactly four distinct values of $x$ when $\frac{m}{100}$ is between $0$ and $2$. This is because the maximum value of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is $2$, and it equals $0$ at $x=1$ and $x=3$, and it equals $2$ at $x=5$ and $x=7$. So, the expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is equal to $\frac{m}{100}$ exactly four times when $0 \le \frac{m}{100} \le 2$. This means that $0 \le m \le 200$.

The number of positive integers $m$ in this range is $200$. Therefore, there are $200$ positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly four distinct solutions. The answer is: $200$.

The equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions when the right side, $\frac{m}{100}$, is equal to $1$. Therefore, we set $\frac{m}{100} = 1$ and solve for $m$:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

def find_m():
    m = symbols('m')
    equation = Eq(m / 100, 1)
    solution = solve(equation, m)
    return solution[0]

m = find_m()
print(m)
```

INTERMEDIATE OUT :

100
```
The value of $m$ that makes the equation have four distinct solutions is $100$. Therefore, there is $1$ positive integer $m$ that satisfies the given condition. The answer is: $1$
