Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, which means that either one of the expressions must be zero for the entire product to be zero. So we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

In the first case, we have $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle.

In the second case, we have $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines also form a rectangle.

The rectangle formed by the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$ has side lengths 16 and 16. Therefore, its area is $16 \times 16 = 256$.

The rectangle formed by the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$ also has side lengths 16 and 16. Its area is also $16 \times 16 = 256$.

Since the two rectangles coincide, the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points satisfying the given equation is 256. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{256}$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if either both of the factors are zero. 
The factor $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ is zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. 
This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. 
Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$. 
The other factor $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ means that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us the same vertices. 
So, the points satisfying the equation form a square with side length 16. 
The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$

The expression $ab = 0$ is true if and only if $a = 0$ or $b = 0$. Therefore, the given equation is satisfied if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
From $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
From $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
From $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

The points that satisfy these conditions form a square with side length $20$. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$. The answer is: $400$.

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two lines forming a rectangle.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two lines forming a square.

The rectangle has side lengths of 20 (from $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$) and the square has side lengths of 16 (from $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$). The intersection of the rectangle and the square is the convex polygon we are looking for.

The area of the rectangle is $20 \times 20 = 400$ and the area of the square is $16 \times 16 = 256$. The convex polygon is the intersection of the rectangle and the square, so its area is the area of the square (256) because it is entirely contained within the rectangle.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

    # Side lengths of the square
    side_square = 16
