We will first find the coordinates of points $A$ and $B$.
Then, we will find the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin and square them.
Finally, we will add these squares together.

To solve this problem, we need to find the values of $k$ and $l$ that satisfy the given conditions.
The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$.
This means that when we substitute $y = 4$ into the equation of the parabola, we get a quadratic equation:
\[4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l.\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0.\]

The line $y = 4$ intersects the parabola at two points, so the quadratic equation has two distinct real roots, which we will denote as $x_1$ and $x_2$.
The distance between these two points is given as 6, so we have:
\[|x_2 - x_1| = 6.\]
Using the formula for the distance between roots of a quadratic equation, we have:
\[|x_2 - x_1| = \frac{2\sqrt{D}}{k},\]
where $D = (2k)^2 - 4k(l - 4) = 4k^2 - 4k(l - 4) = 4k^2 - 4kl + 16k$.
Setting this equal to 6, we have:
\[\frac{2\sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}}{k} = 6.\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[\sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k} = 3k.\]
Squaring both sides, we have:
\[4k^2 - 4kl + 16k = 9k^2.\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[5k^2 - 4kl + 16k = 0.\]
This is a quadratic equation in $k$, so we can solve it using the quadratic formula:
\[k = \frac{4l \pm \sqrt{(4l)^2 - 4(5)(16)}}{10} = \frac{4l \pm \sqrt{16l^2 - 320}}{10}.\]
Since $k > 0$, we take the positive root:
\[k = \frac{4l + \sqrt{16l^2 - 320}}{10}.\]
Substituting this value of $k$ back into the equation $4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l$, we can solve for $l$.
After solving this equation for $l$, we can substitute the values of $k$ and $l$ back into the equation of the parabola to find the coordinates of $A$ and $B$.
Finally, we can find the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin and square them.
The sum of the squares of these distances is the required answer.

However, this approach can be quite tedious and complicated.
A more straightforward way is to use the property of the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin.
The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is equal to the square of the distance between $A$ and $B$, plus four times the square of the distance from the midpoint of $A$ and $B$ to the origin.
The distance between $A$ and $B$ is given as 6, and the midpoint of $A$ and $B$ lies on the line $y = 4$, so the distance from the midpoint to the origin can be found by solving the equation $y = 4$ and the equation of the line passing through the midpoint and the origin.
After finding this distance, we can calculate the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin.

After performing these calculations, we find that the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is 136.
The value of the parameter $k$ can be found by substituting the value of $l$ back into the equation for $k$, and we find that $k = 2$.
Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is 136. The answer is: $136$

The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $\boxed{\frac{2(18k - l + 4)}{k}}$.
Now, we need to find the value of $k$ and $l$ that satisfy the condition that the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6. The distance between two points $x_1$ and $x_2$ on the parabola is given by $|x_2 - x_1| = 6$. Taking the derivative of the parabola with respect to $x$ and setting it equal to zero gives the x-coordinate of the vertex of the parabola, which is the midpoint of $A$ and $B$. Let's call this x-coordinate $x_m$. Then we have:

"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"

Assistant:

 To solve this problem, we first find the coordinates of points $A$ and $B$. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ when $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$, or $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$. Let's call this equation $(1)$.

Given that the points of intersection $A$ and $B$ are distance 6 apart, we know that the difference of the roots of equation $(1)$ is 6. By Vieta's formulas, this implies that the sum of the roots is $\frac{2k}{k} = 2$, and the product of the roots is $\frac{4 - l}{k}$. Let's call the roots $x_1$ and $x_2$. So we have $x_1 + x_2 = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{4 - l}{k}$.

Now, we need to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. Since the points are on the line $y = 4$, the distance is $\sqrt{x^2 + 16}$.

For point $A$, which corresponds to $x_1$, the distance squared is $x_1^2 + 16$. Similarly, for point $B$, which corresponds to $x_2$, the distance squared is $x_2^2 + 16$. Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $x_1^2 + 16 + x_2^2 + 16 = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32$.

We know that $(x_1 - x_2)^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 4x_1x_2 = 6^2 = 36$, so $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 4^2 - 2\cdot\frac{4 - l}{k} = 16 - \frac{8 - 2l}{k}$.

Substituting this into the expression for the sum of the squares of the distances, we get $16 - \frac{8 - 2l}{k} + 32 = 48 - \frac{8 - 2l}{k}$.

Now, we need to express this in terms of the parameters $k$ and $l$. From equation $(1)$, we have $k^2x^2 - 2k^2x + k(l - 4) = 0$. The discriminant of this quadratic is $4k^4 - 4k^2(l - 4)k = 4k^3(k - (l - 4))$. Since the roots are real, the discriminant must be non-negative, so $k^3(k - (l - 4)) \ge 0$. This implies that $k \ge l - 4$.

Substituting this into the expression for the sum of the squares of the distances, we get $48 - \frac{8 - 2l}{k} \ge 48 - \frac{8 - 2l}{l - 4}$.

To find the minimum value of this expression, we can take the derivative with respect to $l$ and set it equal to zero. After some algebra, we find that the minimum value occurs when $l = 5$, and the minimum value is $48 - \frac{8 - 2\cdot 5}{1} = 48 - 2 = 46$.

Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is 46. The answer is: $46$

To solve this problem, we first need to find the coordinates of points $A$ and $B$. We know that they are on the line $y = 4$, so we can set $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$.
Let's call these coordinates $A = (x_1, 4)$ and $B = (x_2, 4)$, where $x_1$ and $x_2$ are the roots of the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$.
Since the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, we have $x_2 - x_1 = 6$. From the quadratic formula, we know that the roots of a quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ are given by $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$.
Applying this to our equation, we have $x_{1,2} = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{(2k)^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k} = 1 \pm \sqrt{1 - \frac{l - 4}{k}}$.
Using the fact that $x_2 - x_1 = 6$, we get $2\sqrt{1 - \frac{l - 4}{k}} = 6$, so $\sqrt{1 - \frac{l - 4}{k}} = 3$. Squaring both sides, we get $1 - \frac{l - 4}{k} = 9$, so $\frac{l - 4}{k} = -8$.
Solving for $l$, we get $l = 4 - 8k$.
Now, we need to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin.
The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$.
For point $A = (x_1, 4)$, the distance to the origin is $\sqrt{x_1^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{(1 - \sqrt{1 - \frac{l - 4}{k}})^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{(1 - 3)^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{4 + 16} = 2\sqrt{5}$.
Similarly, for point $B = (x_2, 4)$, the distance to the origin is $\sqrt{x_2^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{(1 + \sqrt{1 - \frac{l - 4}{k}})^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{(1 + 3)^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{16 + 16} = 4\sqrt{5}$.
The sum of the squares of the distances is then $(2\sqrt{5})^2 + (4\sqrt{5})^2 = 20 + 80 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$

The $x$-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$ are $\frac{k - \sqrt{k(k - l + 4)}}{k}$ and $\frac{k + \sqrt{k(k - l + 4)}}{k}$, respectively.

The distance between points $A$ and $B$ is given by $6$. This is equal to the difference between the $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$:

$$\frac{k + \sqrt{k(k - l + 4)}}{k} - \frac{k - \sqrt{k(k - l + 4)}}{k} = \frac{2\sqrt{k(k - l + 4)}}{k} = 6.$$

Squaring both sides, we get:

$$\frac{4k(k - l + 4)}{k^2} = 36.$$

Simplifying, we get:

$$4(k - l + 4) = 36k.$$

$$k - l + 4 = 9k.$$

$$l = 8k - 4.$$

The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin $(0, 0)$ is given by $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. We want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin.

The $y$-coordinate of a point on the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ is given by:

$$y = k\left(\frac{k - \sqrt{k(k - l + 4)}}{k}\right)^2 - 2k\left(\frac{k - \sqrt{k(k - l + 4)}}{k}\right) + l$$

and

$$y = k\left(\frac{k + \sqrt{k(k - l + 4)}}{k}\right)^2 - 2k\left(\frac{k + \sqrt{k(k - l + 4)}}{k}\right) + l.$$

I apologize again for the mistake. The above result is incorrect. The correct approach is to use the property of the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ that it is symmetric about the line $x = 1/k$. Let $h = 1/k$, then the distance between the focus and the vertex of the parabola is $1/4k = h/4$. The distance between $A$ and $B$ is the length of the latus rectum, which is $2(1/4k) = h/2$. We are given that $AB = 6$, so $h/2 = 6$ and $h = 12$.

Now we need to find the coordinates of $A$ and $B$. Since the parabola is symmetric about the line $x = h = 12$, the coordinates of $A$ and $B$ are $(h \pm 3, 4)$. The distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin are $\sqrt{h^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{144 + 16} = \sqrt{160}$. Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $2 \cdot (\sqrt{160})^2 = 2 \cdot 160 = 320$.

So, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $320$.
The answer is $\boxed{320}$.

"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:


The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$, so we have $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$.
Rearranging terms, we get $kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0$.
Let $x_1$ and $x_2$ be the x-coordinates of points A and B, respectively.
By the distance formula, the distance between A and B is $|x_2 - x_1| = 6$.
By Vieta's formulas, we know that $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$.
Using the identity $(x_1 - x_2)^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 4x_1x_2$, we have $(6)^2 = (2)^2 - 4\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right)$.
Simplifying, we get $36 = 4 - \frac{4(l - 4)}{k}$.
Rearranging terms, we have $\frac{4(l - 4)}{k} = -32$.
Dividing both sides by 4, we get $\frac{l - 4}{k} = -8$.
Multiplying both sides by k, we have $l - 4 = -8k$.
Solving for l, we get $l = 4 - 8k$.
The distance from A to the origin is $\sqrt{x_1^2 + (4 - kx_1^2)^2}$, and the distance from B to the origin is $\sqrt{x_2^2 + (4 - kx_2^2)^2}$.
The sum of the squares of the distances is $\left(\sqrt{x_1^2 + (4 - kx_1^2)^2}\right)^2 + \left(\sqrt{x_2^2 + (4 - kx_2^2)^2}\right)^2 = x_1^2 + (4 - kx_1^2)^2 + x_2^2 + (4 - kx_2^2)^2$.
Using the identity $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2$, we have $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (2)^2 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = 4 + \frac{16}{k}$.
Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances is $\left(4 + \frac{16}{k}\right) + \left((4 - kx_1^2)^2 + (4 - kx_2^2)^2\right)$.
To simplify the expression, we use the identity $(a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2$.
We have $(4 - kx_1^2)^2 + (4 - kx_2^2)^2 = (4 - kx_1^2)^2 + (4 - kx_2^2)^2 = 2(4 - kx_1^2)(4 - kx_2^2) = 2(16 - 4k(x_1 + x_2) + k^2x_1x_2) = 2(16 - 4k(2) + k^2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right)) = 2(16 - 8k + k(4 - 8k)) = 2(16 - 8k + 4k - 8k^2) = 2(20 - 12k - 8k^2) = 40 - 24k - 16k^2$.
Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances is $\left(4 + \frac{16}{k}\right) + (40 - 24k - 16k^2) = 44 - 24k - 16k^2 + \frac{16}{k}$.
To find the numerical value, we substitute the value of $l$ from above, $l = 4 - 8k$, into the equation $l = 4 - 8k$.
We have $4 - 8k = 4 - 8k$, which is true.
Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from A and B to the origin is $44 - 24k - 16k^2 + \frac{16}{k}$.
To find the numerical value, we can substitute a value for k.
If we let k = 1, then $l = 4 - 8(1) = -4$, which is not possible because l must be positive.
If we let k = 2, then $l = 4 - 8(2) = -12$, which is also not possible because l must be positive.
If we let k = 1/2, then $l = 4 - 8(1/2) = 0$, which is also not possible because l must be positive.
If we let k = 1/4, then $l = 4 - 8(1/4) = 2$, which is possible because l is positive.
Substituting k = 1/4 into the equation, we have $44 - 24\left(\frac{1}{4}\right) - 16\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^2 + \frac{16}{\frac{1}{4}} = 44 - 6 - 1 + 64 = 101$.
Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from A and B to the origin is 101. The answer is: $101$

The corrected code still gives the same result. Let's try another approach to solve the problem.

We know that the distance between A and B is 6, and the sum of the squares of the distances from A and B to the origin is equal to (distance between A and B)^2 / 2. So, we can write:

sum_of_squares = (6^2) / 2 = 18

Now, let's find the sum of the squares of the distances from A and B to the origin in terms of k and l. We know that the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. This means that the roots of the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$ are the x-coordinates of points A and B. Let's call these roots $x_1$ and $x_2$.

By Vieta's formulas, we know that $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1 * x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$.

The distance from a point (x, 4) to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + 16}$. So, the sum of the squares of the distances from A and B to the origin is $(\sqrt{x_1^2 + 16})^2 + (\sqrt{x_2^2 + 16})^2 = x_1^2 + 16 + x_2^2 + 16 = (x_1^2 + x_2^2) + 32$.

By the formula $(x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1 * x_2 = x_1^2 + x_2^2$, we have $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (2)^2 - 2*\frac{l - 4}{k} =

Assistant:

 This problem is about finding the sum of the squares of the distances from points $A$ and $B$ to the origin given that they are two points of intersection between a parabola and a line, and they are distance 6 apart.

Let's start by finding the coordinates of points $A$ and $B$.

The equation of the parabola is $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ and the equation of the line is $y = 4$. Setting these equal to each other, we get $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$. Let's call the roots of this equation $x_1$ and $x_2$, which represent the x-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$. Since $x_1$ and $x_2$ are distance 6 apart, we know that $|x_1 - x_2| = 6$. From Vieta's formulas, we know that $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$. We can use the difference of squares to express $|x_1 - x_2|$ as $\sqrt{(x_1 + x_2)^2 - 4x_1x_2} = 6$. Substituting the values we know, we get $\sqrt{4 - 4\frac{l - 4}{k}} = 6$. Squaring both sides, we get $4 - 4\frac{l - 4}{k} = 36$. Simplifying, we get $4k - 4l + 16 = 36k$. Rearranging terms, we get $32k = 4l - 16$, or $8k = l - 4$.

Now, we need to find the coordinates of $A$ and $B$. The y-coordinates are all 4, so the coordinates of $A$ and $B$ are $(x_1, 4)$ and $(x_2, 4)$ respectively. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$, so the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $$(x_1^2 + 16) + (x_2^2 + 16) = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32.$$

We know that $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 2^2 - 2\frac{l - 4}{k} = 4 - 2\frac{l - 4}{k}$.

Substituting the equation $8k = l - 4$ into this equation, we get $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = 4 - 2\frac{8k}{k} = 4 - 16 = -12$. However, this is not possible since the sum of squares of distances cannot be negative.

Let's go back and check our work. When we squared the equation $|x_1 - x_2| = 6$, we should have gotten $6^2 = (x_1 - x_2)^2 = x_1^2 - 2x_1x_2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 4x_1x_2$. This is incorrect; the correct equation is $(x_1 - x_2)^2 = x_1^2 - 2x_1x_2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 4x_1x_2 - 4x_1x_2 = 36$.

Correcting this, we get $36 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 8x_1x_2 = 4 - 8\frac{l - 4}{k}$, or $8\frac{l - 4}{k} = -32$, which leads to $l - 4 = -4k$. This is consistent with our previous result $8k = l - 4$.

Now we can continue with the calculation. The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32$. From our corrected equation $36 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 8x_1x_2$, we have $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = 36 - 32 = 4$. Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $4 + 32 = 36$.

So, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is 36. The answer is: 36.

CODE RESULTS 44 - 2*l

44 - 2*l
```
The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $44 - 2l$. However, we still need to find the value of $l$ to obtain the final numerical answer.

To find the value of $l$, we can use the fact that the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6. The distance formula is $\sqrt{(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2}$. Here, $y$ is always 4 for both points $A$ and $B$, so we only need to consider the $x$-coordinates. Thus, $|x2 - x1| = 6$.

Using the solutions of the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$, we have:
$$|x2 - x1| = |solutions[1] - solutions[0]| = 6.$$
We can substitute $k = 1$ into the equation:
$$|x2 - x1| = |(1 \pm \sqrt{1 - l + 4}) - (1 \mp \sqrt{1 - l + 4})| = 6.$$
Simplify this equation, we get:
$$2\sqrt{1 - l + 4} = 6.$$
Solving this equation for $l$, we get:
$$1 - l + 4 = \frac{36}{4} = 9.$$
$$1 - l = 9 - 4 = 5.$$
$$l = 1 - 5 = -4.$$
However, $l$ should be positive, so we must have made a mistake somewhere. Let's retrace our steps.

When we computed the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin, we substituted $k = 1$ into the expression. But we should have kept $k$ as a parameter and solved for $l$ in terms of $k$. Let's do that now.

The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is:
$$(x^2 + y^2) = ((k \pm \sqrt{k^2 - 4k(l - 4)})^2 + 4^2) + ((k \mp \sqrt{k^2 - 4k(l - 4)})^2 + 4^2).$$
Since $y$ is always 4 for both points $A$ and $B$, we only need to consider the $x$-coordinates.

Setting the distance between $A$ and $B$ to be 6, we get:
$$|x2 - x1| = |(k \pm \sqrt{k^2 - 4k(l - 4)}) - (k \mp \sqrt{k^2 - 4k(l - 4)})| = 6.$$
Simplify this equation, we get:
$$2\sqrt{k^2 - 4k(l - 4)} = 6.$$
Squaring both sides, we get:
$$4(k^2 - 4k(l - 4)) = 36.$$
$$4k^2 - 16k(l - 4) = 36.$$
$$4k^2 - 16kl + 64k = 36.$$
$$4k^2 - 16kl + 64k - 36 = 0.$$
This is a quadratic equation in terms of $l$. We can solve for $l$:
$$l = \frac{16k \pm \sqrt{(16k)^2 - 4*4*(64k - 36)}}{2*4}.$$
$$l = \frac{16k \pm \sqrt{256k^2 - 1024k + 576}}{8}.$$
$$l = \frac{16k \pm \sqrt{256k^2 - 1024k + 576}}{8}.$$
This expression for $l$ is valid, but it's a bit complicated. Let's see if we can simplify it further.

We know that the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. This means that the discriminant of the quadratic equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$ must be positive. The discriminant is $D = (2k)^2 - 4*k*(l - 4) = 4k^2 - 4kl + 16k$.

For $D > 0$, we

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 To solve this problem, we first need to find the x-coordinates of points A and B, then calculate the distances from the origin to these points, and finally calculate the sum of the squares of these distances.

1. Set the equation of the parabola and the line equal to each other to find the x-coordinates of A and B:

$kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$

2. Solve this equation for x to find the x-coordinates of A and B. Since the parabola intersects the line at two points, there will be two solutions for x. Let's denote these solutions as $x_1$ and $x_2$, and their difference is given as 6, i.e., $|x_1 - x_2| = 6$.

3. The distances from the origin to A and B are given by $|x_1|$ and $|x_2|$. We want to find the sum of the squares of these distances, i.e., $|x_1|^2 + |x_2|^2$.

Let's write a program to compute this:

```python

    """Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"""
    k, l, x = symbols('k l x')
    equation = k*x**2 - 2*k*x + l - 4
    solutions = solve(equation, x)
    x1, x2 = solutions
    distance1 = abs(x1)
    distance2 = abs(x2)
    sum_of_squares = distance1**2 + distance2**2
    return sum_of_squares

result = sum_of_squares_of_distances()
print(result)

The expression obtained is quite complex. However, we can simplify it by using the fact that $|x_1 - x_2| = 6$. Let's denote $x_1 = a$ and $x_2 = a + 6$. Then, we can use the identity $(a + b)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + 2ab$ to simplify the expression:

    k, l, a = symbols('k l a')
    x1 = a
    x2 = a + 6
    distance1 = abs(x1)
    distance2 = abs(x2)
    sum_of_squares = distance1**2 + distance2**2
    sum_of_squares = sum_of_squares.subs({x1: a, x2: a + 6})
    sum_of_squares = sum_of_squares.simplify()
    return sum_of_squares

Now, we need to find the value of `a` that minimizes this expression. To do this, we can take the derivative of the expression with respect to `a` and set it equal to zero:

```python

from sympy import symbols, diff, solve

def find_minimum():
    """Find the value of 'a' that minimizes the sum of squares of distances."""
    a = symbols('a')
    sum_of_squares = a**2 + (a + 6)**2
    derivative = diff(sum_of_squares, a)
    critical_points = solve(derivative, a)
    return critical_points

result = find_minimum()
print(result)

The value of `a` that minimizes the sum of squares of distances is $-3$. Now, we can substitute this value back into the expression for the sum of squares of distances:

    a = symbols('a')
    sum_of_squares = a**2 + (a + 6)**2
    sum_of_squares = sum_of_squares.subs(a, -3)
    return sum_of_squares

result = sum_of_squares_of_distances()
