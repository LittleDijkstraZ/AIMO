(Note: The range of $m$ should be from $1$ to $100$, not $0$ to $100$, due to the condition $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, which implies $m$ must be a positive integer)

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We need to determine the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has 4 distinct solutions.

2. To solve this, we can use the property of absolute value that $||a|-|b|| \leq |a+b| \leq |a| + |b|$.

3. Applying this property to the given equation, we get \[||x-1|-2| = \left| x - 1 \right| - 2 \leq \frac{m}{100} \leq 2 - \left| x - 1 \right| + \left| x - 1 \right| - 2 = 0\]

4. Simplifying the inequality, we get \[0 \leq \frac{m}{100} \leq 0\]

5. The only way this inequality can hold is if $\frac{m}{100} = 0$, so $m = 0$.

6. However, the problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$, so $m = 0$ is not a valid solution.

7. Therefore, there are $\boxed{0}$ positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We are given the equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ and we need to find how many values of $m$ would make the equation have 4 distinct solutions.

2. Let's first consider the equation $|x-1|=2+\frac{m}{100}$. This will be true for the right side of the absolute value being greater than the value inside the absolute value (2), and the left side being positive. Thus, we have $2+\frac{m}{100}>0$, or $m>-200$. This corresponds to case where $x-1$ is positive.

3. Next, let's consider the equation $|x-1|=2-\frac{m}{100}$. This will be true for the right side of the absolute value being less than the value inside the absolute value (2), and the left side being positive. Thus, we have $2-\frac{m}{100}>0$, or $m<200$. This corresponds to case where $x-1$ is negative.

4. For each of these two cases, we will have two solutions for $x$, one for the positive case and one for the negative case. 

5. Therefore, we need to find how many values of $m$ satisfy both $m>-200$ and $m<200$. This is a simple arithmetic problem, and the answer is $200-(-200)-1=\boxed{400}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



In the end, we need to find the number of $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. The right side of the equation $\frac{m}{100}$ is a fixed value, while the left side $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a variable quantity that depends on $x$.

So we can start by analyzing the shape of the graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ versus $x$. The function $\vert x \vert$ has a V-shape, so $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ will also have a V-shape for each fixed $x$.

Now, we know that the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a maximum value of 2 and a minimum value of 0. The value of the function increases from 0 to 2 as $x$ increases from $1-2\sqrt{2}$ to $1+2\sqrt{2}$, and decreases from 2 to 0 as $x$ increases from $1+2\sqrt{2}$ to $+\infty$.

Now, we want the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ to have 4 distinct solutions, which means the right side of the equation $\frac{m}{100}$ should be greater than the minimum value of the left side and less than the maximum value of the left side.

Therefore, we should have $0<\frac{m}{100}<2$, which gives $0<m<200$. Since $m$ is a positive integer, the possible values of $m$ are $1,2,3,...,199$, which gives $\boxed{199}$ possible values for $m$.
