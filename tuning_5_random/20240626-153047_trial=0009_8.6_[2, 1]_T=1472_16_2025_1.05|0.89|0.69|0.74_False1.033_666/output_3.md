Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is satisfied when either of the two factors is zero. We have two cases:

1) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
This means that the points must lie on the lines $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.

2) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
This means that the points must lie on the lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 16.
The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256.

To compute this in Python, we can simply calculate $16^2$:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is $\boxed{256}$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The problem statement is incorrect. The expression should be equal to zero rather than enclose a polygon. Let's correct the problem and solve it.

The equation is:
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0\]

This equation is satisfied if either of the two factors is equal to zero. The factors are products of two separate expressions each squared, so they are both non-negative. The only way the product can be zero is if one of the factors is zero. Therefore, we have two separate cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
2. One of the factors is zero but the other is not zero.

In the first case, we have:
\[\vert x + y \vert = 10, \quad \vert x \vert = 8, \quad \vert x - y \vert = 10, \quad \vert y \vert = 8.\]
This gives us four equations:
\[x + y = \pm 10, \quad x = \pm 8, \quad x - y = \pm 10, \quad y = \pm 8.\]
Solving these equations, we find the vertices of the polygon:
\[(8, 2), (8, -2), (-8, 2), (-8, -2), (2, 8), (-2, 8), (2, -8), (-2, -8).\]

The polygon is a square with side length 16. The area of a square is the square of its side length, so the area of the polygon is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the polygon is 256 square units.

However, this solution seems to be incorrect. Let's reconsider the problem.

The equation is:
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0\]
If either of the two factors is zero, the product is zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. 

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which implies that $x + y = \pm 10$. Similarly, if $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies that $x - y = \pm 10$. If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$, which implies that $x = \pm 8$. If $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that $y = \pm 8$.

From the equations $x + y = \pm 10$, $x - y = \pm 10$, $x = \pm 8$, and $y = \pm 8$, we can find the vertices of the polygon:
\[(8, 2), (8, -2), (-8, 2), (-8, -2), (2, 8), (-2, 8), (2, -8), (-2, -8).\]
The polygon is a square with side length 16. The area of a square is the square of its side length, so the area of the polygon is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The corrected solution is consistent with the original problem statement.
The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The problem statement is a bit complicated, but we can simplify it by realizing that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So the equation is equivalent to one of the following two conditions:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From condition 1, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$, which gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

From condition 2, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us four more lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersection points of these lines are: $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$. These points form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So the area of the convex polygon is 256.

Here is a Python code to calculate the area of the square:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def square_area():
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = square_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$
