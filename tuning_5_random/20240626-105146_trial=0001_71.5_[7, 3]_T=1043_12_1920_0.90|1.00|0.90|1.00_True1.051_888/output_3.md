Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ can only be true when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x = 0$ and $y = 0$.

2. The expression $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ can only be true when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $-8 \leq x \leq 8$ and $-8 \leq y \leq 8$.

3. Therefore, the points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying the original equation are those that lie in the square with vertices at $\left(\pm8, 0\right)$, $\left(0, \pm8\right)$. The area of this square is $8^2 \times 4 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def find_area():
    # The vertices of the square are at (±8, 0) and (0, ±8)
    side_length = 8
    area = 4 * (side_length ** 2)
    return area

result = find_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is $256$. Thus, the answer is $\boxed{256}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $f(x, y) = (\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ describes a set of points that satisfy the equation. 
The points that satisfy $f(x, y) = 0$ are precisely the points on the lines $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$. 
These lines form a square with side length 16. 
The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256.

The entire script is as follows:
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solve, Rational, simplify

def area_of_polygon():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    # The lines |x + y| = 10, |x - y| = 10, |x| = 8, and |y| = 8 form a square with side length 16.
    # The area of this square is 16^2 = 256.
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length**2
    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is $256$.
The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which is possible only when $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$. This gives us a square with side length $20$.

2. The expression $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which is possible only when $-8 \le x \le 8$ and $-8 \le y \le 8$. This gives us a square with side length $16$.

3. The intersection of these two squares gives the convex polygon, which is also a square.

4. To find the area of this square, we multiply the side length by itself.

Now, let's put it together using Sympy.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Rational, simplify

def area_of_polygon():
    # Side length of the polygon
    side_length = 20 * 8 / 2

    # Calculate the area
    area = simplify(side_length ** 2)

    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 6400.00000000000

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
6400.00000000000
```
The area of the convex polygon is $6400$.
The answer is: $6400$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm10$ and $x - y = \pm10$. Solving these four equations, we get four vertices of the polygon: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$.

2. Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm8$ and $y = \pm8$. So the polygon is a square with side length 16.

3. To find the area of the square, we simply square the length of one side: $16^2 = 256$.

Now, let's write a python script to calculate the area:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$
