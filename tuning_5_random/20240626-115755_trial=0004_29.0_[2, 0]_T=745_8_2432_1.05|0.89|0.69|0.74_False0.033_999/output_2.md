Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. This means that the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, takes on the values $\pm\frac{m}{100}$ twice. 

We first consider the case where $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$. This equation simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, and then to two separate cases: $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $-(x-1) = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. Simplifying these gives $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Similarly, the case where $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$ gives $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

The four solutions are then $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$, $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$, and $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$. These are all distinct if and only if the four values $\pm\frac{m}{100}$ are all different. This is true if and only if $m=100$. Therefore, the only value of $m$ that makes the equation have four distinct solutions is $m=100$.

So the answer is $\boxed{1}$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation has four distinct solutions, which means the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be equal to one of the four values of $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|$ that give four distinct solutions.

The expression $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|$ can take on four distinct values: 0, 1, 2, and 3. This is because the inner absolute value $|\cdot|$ makes the function piecewise linear, and the outer absolute value $|\cdot|$ reflects the function over the x-axis.

Setting $\frac{m}{100}$ equal to each of these values, we find that $m$ must be one of the numbers $0*100$, $1*100$, $2*100$, or $3*100$, which are 0, 100, 200, and 300, respectively.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ is 4. The answer is: $4$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Step 1: Import necessary libraries.
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solve, Eq, Abs
from sympy import Rational
from itertools import count

def find_m():
    # Initialize counter
    count_solutions = 0

    # Iterate over possible values of m
    for m in count(1):
        # Define the equation
        x = symbols('x')
        equation = Eq(Abs(Abs(x - 1) - 2), Rational(m, 100))

        # Solve the equation
        solutions = solve(equation, x)

        # Check if there are 4 distinct solutions
        if len(solutions) == 4:
            count_solutions += 1

        # If we've found 4 solutions, stop the loop
        if count_solutions == 4:
            break

    return m

result = find_m()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 4

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
4
```
The number of positive integer $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $1$. Thus, the value of $m$ is $4$.
The answer is: $4$.
