Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The expression $A = ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is zero if and only if at least one of the factors is zero. This gives us four cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
3. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
4. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

In each case, we get four lines in the plane, and the polygon formed by the intersection of these lines is a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. The final answer is a positive integer, which is 256. So the answer is $\boxed{256}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



This problem is asking for the area of a region in the plane defined by a system of inequalities. To do this, we first need to solve the system of inequalities, which is the set of points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the given equation. Once we have the inequalities, we can find the enclosed polygon and calculate its area.

Step 1: We need to solve the equation $ ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0 $. For the product of two terms to be zero, either one or both terms must be zero. So we have two cases:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

Case 2: At least one of the terms $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2$ equals zero.

Step 2: Solve the equations in each case.

Case 1 gives us the system of inequalities:
$\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

Step 3: Solve the system of inequalities and find the vertices of the polygon.

We can rewrite the inequalities as:
$-10 \le x + y \le 10$, $-8 \le x \le 8$, $-10 \le x - y \le 10$, and $-8 \le y \le 8$.

The vertices of the polygon are the points where the inequalities intersect. We can find these points by solving the system of equations:

(1) $x + y = 10$, (2) $x + y = -10$, (3) $x - y = 10$, (4) $x - y = -10$, (5) $x = 8$, (6) $x = -8$, (7) $y = 8$, and (8) $y = -8$.

Step 4: Calculate the area of the polygon.

The vertices of the polygon are $(8,2)$, $(8,-2)$, $(-8,2)$, $(-8,-2)$, $(2,8)$, $(-2,8)$, $(2,-8)$, and $(-2,-8)$. 

Plotting these points, we can see that they form a square with side length 16. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solve

def area_of_polygon():
    # Define the variables
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # Solve the system of equations
    vertices = [(8, 2), (8, -2), (-8, 2), (-8, -2), (2, 8), (-2, 8), (2, -8), (-2, -8)]

    # Calculate the area of the square
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length**2

    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is $\boxed{256}$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, which means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.

The first term, $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, equals to zero when both $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This forms a square with side length of 20, centered at the origin.

The second term, $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$, equals to zero when both $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This forms a square with side length of 16, centered at the origin.

Therefore, the solution set of the given equation is the intersection of these two squares, which forms a smaller square with side length of 20 - 16 = 4, centered at the origin.

The area of this square is $4^2 = 16$.

    side_length = 20 - 16

The area of the convex polygon is 16 square units.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The problem statement implies that the expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ must both be true for any point $(x, y)$ that lies within the polygon.

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, -2)$, and $(-8, 2)$.

Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us another square with vertices $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$.

The intersection of these two squares is a 8x8 square. The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 64.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    side_length = 8
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output

The area of the convex polygon is $64$. The answer is $\boxed{64}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The equation $AB = 0$ implies that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. So we have two cases to consider:
   1.1) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
   1.2) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

2. In case 1.1), both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. Solving these equations, we get $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This is the equation of a square with side length $10$ and diagonals $10\sqrt{2}$. 

3. In case 1.2), both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. Solving these equations, we get $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This is a square with side length $8$ and diagonals $8\sqrt{2}$. 

4. To find the total area of the polygon, we need to add the areas of the two squares. The area of a square with side length $a$ is $a^2$. So, the area of the first square is $(10)^2 = 100$ and the area of the second square is $(8)^2 = 64$. 

5. Adding the two areas, the total area of the polygon is $100 + 64 = 164$.

So the area of the convex polygon is $164$. The answer is: $\boxed{164}$
