 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. 

For the first expression, we have $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This is only possible if both $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x$ and $y$ are both $5$ or both $-5$. This gives us a square with side length $10$ and area $100$.

For the second expression, we have $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This is only possible if both $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x$ is in the interval $[-8, 8]$ and $y$ is in the interval $[-8, 8]$. This gives us a square with side length $16$ and area $256$.

However, the first condition and the second condition cannot be true at the same time. The first condition requires that $x$ and $y$ are both $5$ or both $-5$, while the second condition requires that $x$ is in the interval $[-8, 8]$ and $y$ is in the interval $[-8, 8]$. The only point that satisfies both conditions is the origin $(0,0)$, but this point does not satisfy either of the conditions we derived from the equations.

Therefore, we can conclude that the only solution to the equation is the square with side length $10$ and area $100$. The area of the convex polygon is therefore $100$.

The answer is: $100$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The given equation is equal to zero if and only if both factors are equal to zero. The factors are
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$$ and $$((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2).$$

The first factor equals zero if and only if both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. These equations imply that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these equations are all points of the form $(x, y)$ where $x = \pm 10$ or $y = \pm 10$.

The second factor equals zero if and only if both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. These equations imply that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are all points of the form $(x, y)$ where $x = \pm 8$ or $y = \pm 8$.

The intersection of the solutions to these two sets of equations is the set of all points $(x, y)$ where $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$, i.e., the set of all points in the square with vertices at $(\pm 8, \pm 8)$. The area of this square is $8^2 \times 4 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points satisfying the given equation is 256.

The answer is: 256

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The expression equals zero if and only if at least one of the factors equals zero.

2. The factors are $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2$.

3. Each of these factors is a square, so they are nonnegative. Therefore, the only way for the product of these factors to be zero is if at least one of the factors is zero.

4. The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. Similarly, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

5. The solutions to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ are given by $x + y = \pm 10$. Similarly, we have $x - y = \pm 10$, $x = \pm 8$, and $y = \pm 8$.

6. Solving these equations, we find the vertices of the polygon to be $(8,0)$, $(-8,0)$, $(0,8)$, $(0,-8)$, $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

7. Now we need to find the area of the polygon. We can break it down into four right triangles and one square.

8. The square has side length 8, so its area is $8^2 = 64$.

9. Each right triangle has legs of length 8, so its area is $\frac{1}{2}(8)(8) = 32$.

10. The total area of the polygon is $64 + 4(32) = 64 + 128 = 192$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 192.
The answer is: $192$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The expression equals zero if either of the terms equals zero. So we have two cases to consider:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
2. One of the terms is undefined, e.g., when $x=0$ or $y=0$.

For the first case, we have:
1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$
2. This implies that $x = 8, -8$ and $y = 8, -8$
3. So the points are $(8,8), (8,-8), (-8,8), (-8,-8)$.

For the second case, when $x=0$ or $y=0$, the expression is also zero. However, these points are already included in the first case.

Now, let's plot these points on a coordinate plane and connect them to form a polygon:
1. We have a square with side length 16.
2. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $256$.

The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, we need to note that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So, we can set each factor equal to zero and solve for the variables.

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10 \Rightarrow x + y = \pm 10$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x - y \vert = 10 \Rightarrow x - y = \pm 10$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8 \Rightarrow x = \pm 8$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert y \vert = 8 \Rightarrow y = \pm 8$.

So, we have four pairs of equations:

Pair 1: $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$.
Pair 2: $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.
Pair 3: $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$.
Pair 4: $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$.

Solving these pairs of equations, we get the following vertices for the polygon:

Pair 1: $(5, 5)$.
Pair 2: $(0, 10)$.
Pair 3: $(0, -10)$.
Pair 4: $(5, -5)$.

These vertices form a square with side length $10$. The area of the square is $10^2 = 100$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $100$. The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



We are given the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ and we are asked to find the area of the convex polygon that the points enclose.

From the equation, we can see that the area of the polygon is determined by the points where either of the two factors equals zero.

1. The first factor equals zero when $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
2. The second factor equals zero when $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This means $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

Now, let's analyze these equations:

For the first factor, we have four cases to consider:

1.1. If $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, then $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
1.2. If $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, then $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.

For the second factor, we have two cases to consider:

2.1. If $\vert x \vert = 8$, then $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
2.2. If $\vert y \vert = 8$, then $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

Now, we can find the intersections of these lines to get the vertices of the polygon. There are 8 vertices in total:

1. $(8, 2)$
2. $(8, -2)$
3. $(-8, 2)$
4. $(-8, -2)$
5. $(2, 8)$
6. $(2, -8)$
7. $(-2, 8)$
8. $(-2, -8)$

The polygon is a square with side length of 16 units. To find the area, we simply square the side length: $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units.
The answer is: $256$

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The equation given in the problem is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either one of the expressions must be zero for the entire equation to be zero.

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, and the second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$.

For the first expression to be zero, both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ must be zero. This means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

For the second expression to be zero, both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2$ must be zero. This means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The solutions to these equations are the points that lie on the square with vertices at $(8,8)$, $(-8,8)$, $(-8,-8)$, and $(8,-8)$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of this square.

The side length of the square is the distance between $(8,8)$ and $(-8,8)$, which is 16. The area of the square is the square of the side length, so the area is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units.
