Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation has 4 distinct solutions, that means there are two segments of the piecewise function defined by the absolute value which have two distinct solutions each. The number of these segments defines $m$.

For $0 \leq x \leq 3$, the equation simplifies to $|\vert x-1 \vert - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$, which can be simplified to $|x - 3| = \frac{m}{100} + |x - 1 - 2|$, or $|x - 3| = \frac{m}{100} + |x - 3|$.

The absolute values on both sides of the equation can be eliminated, resulting in two equations:

1) $x - 3 = \frac{m}{100} + x - 3$, which simplifies to $0 = \frac{m}{100}$, and
2) $-(x - 3) = \frac{m}{100} + x - 3$, which simplifies to $-2x = \frac{m}{100}$, or $x = -\frac{m}{200}$.

The first equation simplifies to $0 = \frac{m}{100}$, and its only solution is $m = 0$. However, this does not result in two distinct solutions for the original equation, so we discard it.

The second equation simplifies to $x = -\frac{m}{200}$. For this equation to result in two distinct solutions, $-\frac{m}{200}$ must lie between 1 and 3. That means $1 < -\frac{m}{200} < 3$, or $-600 < m < -200$. However, $m$ must be a positive integer, so there are no solutions for this case.

For $x > 3$, the equation simplifies to $|x - 1 - 2 - \frac{m}{100}| = |x - 3 - \frac{m}{100}|$, or $|x - 3 - \frac{m}{100}| = |x - 3 + \frac{m}{100}|$.

This results in two equations:

1) $x - 3 - \frac{m}{100} = x - 3 + \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $0 = \frac{2m}{100}$, or $m = 0$. This again leads to no two distinct solutions for the original equation.

2) $x - 3 - \frac{m}{100} = -(x - 3 + \frac{m}{100})$, which simplifies to $2x = \frac{2m}{100}$, or $x = \frac{m}{100}$. For this equation to result in two distinct solutions, $\frac{m}{100}$ must lie between 1 and 3, or $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 3$, or $100 < m < 300$. So the possible values of $m$ are the integers from 101 to 299, inclusive. That means there are $299 - 101 + 1 = 199$ possible values of $m$.

So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 199.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def count_m():
    return 199

result = count_m()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 199

The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is $\boxed{199}$.The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 199. The answer is: 199.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ and we want to find the number of positive integer $m$ values for which this equation has 4 distinct solutions.

First, let's solve the equation for a given $m$ value. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have 4 distinct solutions when the right side $\frac{m}{100}$ falls into an interval where the graph of the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has 4 distinct segments.

The graph of the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a series of V-shaped segments, with each segment being a line segment of slope $\pm 1$ and a vertex at integer coordinates. The vertexes are located at $x = 1, 3, 5, 7, ...$ for the positive part of the function, and $x = 0, 2, 4, 6, ...$ for the negative part.

The right side of the equation $\frac{m}{100}$ must fall into the interval $(0, 2)$ for the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, because in this interval the graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has 4 distinct segments. Thus, $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which gives $0 < m < 200$. The possible integer values of $m$ in this interval are from 1 to 199, a total of 199.

Now, let's find out how many of these values of $m$ result in 4 distinct solutions. We can observe that the graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is symmetric about $x = 4$. When $m$ is in the interval $(0, 100)$, the number of distinct solutions is the same as when $m$ is in the interval $(100, 200)$, because the graphs are reflections of each other across $x = 4$.

Therefore, we only need to consider the interval $(0, 100)$. In this interval, $m$ must be a divisor of 100 to be a valid solution. The divisors of 100 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, and 100. For each of these values, the equation has 4 distinct solutions. Therefore, there are 9 values of $m$ in the interval $(0, 100)$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions.

So, the number of positive integer $m$ values for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 9.

The final solution is: $9$.
The answer is: $9$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions. This means that the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be equal to 2. This is because the absolute value function creates two branches, and the absolute value of a number can only be equal to a given number in two places. Therefore, for the equation to have four distinct solutions, $\frac{m}{100}$ must equal 2.

To find the value of $m$, we simply multiply both sides of the equation $ \frac{m}{100}=2$ by 100 to get $m=200$. 

So the positive integer $m$ that makes the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have four distinct solutions is 200.
The answer is: 200.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

Let's first consider the case where $\frac{m}{100}=2$, which implies $m=200$. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=2$ will have 4 distinct solutions.

For the case where $\frac{m}{100}=1$, which implies $m=100$, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=1$ will have 2 distinct solutions.

For the case where $\frac{m}{100}=0$, which implies $m=0$, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=0$ will have 1 distinct solution.

Therefore, the only value of $m$ that makes the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have 4 distinct solutions is $m=200$.
The answer is: $1$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The expression $| |x-1| - 2|$ will be equals to $\frac{m}{100}$ exactly 4 times for positive integer $m$. We want to count how many such $m$ exist.
2. We will examine the cases where the left part of the equation is positive and negative separately.
3. For the positive case, $|x-1| - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$. So, $|x-1| = \frac{m}{100} + 2$.
4. The expression $|x-1|$ will be equals to $\frac{m}{100} + 2$ exactly 2 times. So, we will have 2 solutions for each $m$.
5. For the negative case, $-(|x-1| - 2) = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $|x-1| - 2 = -\frac{m}{100}$. So, $|x-1| = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
6. The expression $|x-1|$ will be equals to $2 - \frac{m}{100}$ exactly 2 times. So, we will have 2 solutions for each $m$.
7. Combining both cases, we have 4 solutions for each $m$.
8. So, we want to count how many positive integer $m$ satisfy $0 < \frac{m}{100} + 2 < 4$ and $0 < 2 - \frac{m}{100} < 4$.
9. These inequalities simplify to $ -2 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$ and $-2 < -\frac{m}{100} < 2$.
10. The solutions for these inequalities are $0 < m < 200$.
11. Therefore, the number of positive integer $m$ that make the equation have 4 distinct solutions is the number of integers in the interval $(0, 200)$.
12. The number of such integers is $200 - 1 = 199$.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation has 4 distinct solutions is $199$. We print this number as the final result.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def count_m():
    return 199

result = count_m()

The number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation has 4 distinct solutions is $199$. The answer is: $199$
