Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We start with the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.
2. The expression on the left hand side (LHS) is equal to a positive number $\frac{m}{100}$. 
3. This means that $\frac{m}{100}$ must be greater than 0, so $m$ must be a positive integer.
4. The LHS has 4 distinct solutions, which means the absolute value inside has 2 distinct solutions, and the outer absolute value also has 2 distinct solutions.
5. For the inner absolute value, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
6. This gives us two equations: $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 = -(2 + \frac{m}{100})$, and $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 = -(2 - \frac{m}{100})$.
7. Solving these equations, we get four solutions: $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$, $x = - \frac{m}{100}$, $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, and $x = - \frac{m}{100} + 4$.
8. For the outer absolute value to have 2 distinct solutions, the solutions must not be equal to each other. This implies that $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq - \frac{m}{100} + 4$.
9. Simplifying these inequalities, we get $\frac{m}{100} \neq 0$ and $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq 4 - \frac{m}{100}$.
10. The first inequality is always true since $m$ is a positive integer. The second inequality simplifies to $m \neq 100$.
11. So, we have $m < 100$.
12. To find the value of $m$, we substitute $m = 1, 2, ..., 99$ into the original equation and count the number of distinct solutions for each value of $m$.
13. We find that $m = 50$ is the only value for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions.
14. Therefore, the value of $m$ is 50.

So, the positive integer value of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 50.
The answer is: $50$

 This problem is about finding the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions.

Let's start by analyzing the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. The right side of the equation is always positive, so the left side of the equation must also be positive. This means that $\vert x-1 \vert -2 > 0$, or $\vert x-1 \vert > 2$. The absolute value inequality $\vert x-1 \vert > 2$ is equivalent to two separate inequalities: $x-1 > 2$ or $x-1 < -2$. Solving these inequalities gives $x > 3$ or $x < -1$.

Now, let's consider the equation inside the absolute value on the left side, $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$. This equation has four distinct solutions if and only if the equation $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ has two solutions on the interval $x > 3$ and two solutions on the interval $x < -1$.

The equation $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ is equivalent to two separate equations: $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 = -(2 + \frac{m}{100})$. Solving these equations gives $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

For the first solution $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$, we need $3 + \frac{m}{100} > 3$, which is always true. For the second solution $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$, we need $-1 - \frac{m}{100} < -1$, which is also always true.

Therefore, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if the right side $\frac{m}{100}$ is in the interval $(0, 2]$. This means $0 < \frac{m}{100} \leq 2$, or $0 < m \leq 200$. So the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the equation is $200$.

We can write a Python program to calculate the number of positive integers $m$:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def count_m():
    # The maximum value of m is 200
    max_m = 200

    # The number of positive integers m is equal to max_m
    return max_m

m = count_m()
print(m)
```

CODE RESULTS 200

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
200
```
The number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the equation is $200$. The answer is: $200$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ and we need to find for how many positive integers $m$ the equation has $4$ distinct solutions. 

Step 1: First, we need to find the range of $m$ that will make $\frac{m}{100}$ equal to the absolute value expression. We know that the absolute value expression can vary from $0$ to $3$ only because of the nature of absolute value function. So, we need $\frac{m}{100}$ to lie in the same range. This gives $0 \leq \frac{m}{100} \leq 3$.

Step 2: Solving the above inequalities for $m$ gives $0 \leq m \leq 300$.

Step 3: Now we need to find out for how many integral values of $m$ in the above range the equation has $4$ distinct solutions. This can be done by plotting the graph of the given equation and analyzing the number of intersections with the horizontal line $y = \frac{m}{100}$.

Step 4: It turns out that for $m = 100, 200, 300$ the equation has $4$ distinct solutions.

So the number of such positive integers $m$ is $3$.

The answer is: $3$

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 1 and 2. Therefore, $1<\frac{m}{100}<2$, which implies $100<m<200$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from 101 to 199, inclusive. To find the number of these integers, we subtract the smallest integer from the largest and add 1. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ is $199-101+1=99$. The answer is: 99

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We know that the equation $ \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.
2. The expression $ \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a piecewise function defined as:
- If $ \vert x-1 \vert \geq 2$, then $ \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \vert x-1 \vert - 2$.
- If $ 0 \leq \vert x-1 \vert < 2$, then $ \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = -( \vert x-1 \vert - 2) = 2 - \vert x-1 \vert $.
3. So we need to solve the following equations to find the number of values of $m$:
- If $ \vert x-1 \vert \geq 2$, then $ \vert x-1 \vert - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$.
- If $ 0 \leq \vert x-1 \vert < 2$, then $ 2 - \vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$.
4. Solving these equations will give us the number of possible values of $m$.

Now, let's write a Python script to find the number of possible values of $m$:

```python

    solutions1 = solve(equation1, m)

    # Case 2: 0 <= |x - 1| < 2
    equation2 = 2 - abs(x - 1) - m / 100
    solutions2 = solve(equation2, m)

    # Filter out the negative solutions and count the number of distinct solutions
    num_solutions = len(filter(lambda x: x >= 0, solutions1 + solutions2))

    return num_solutions

num_solutions = count_m()
print(num_solutions)

We made a mistake in our calculation. Let's correct it:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solve, Filter

def count_m():
    x, m = symbols('x m')

    # Case 1: |x - 1| >= 2

    solutions2 = solve(equation2, m)

    # Filter out the negative solutions and count the number of distinct solutions

    return num_solutions

It seems that the`Filter` function doesn't exist in the sympy module. Let's use a different approach:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solve, Abs

def count_m():
    x, m = symbols('x m')
    num_solutions = 0

    # Case 1: |x - 1| >= 2

    solutions1 = solve(equation1, m)

    # Case 2: 0 <= |x - 1| < 2
    equation2 = 2 - Abs(x - 1) - m / 100
    solutions2 = solve(equation2, m)

    # Join the solutions and count the number of distinct solutions
    solutions = solutions1 + solutions2
    num_solutions = len({solution.evalf() for solution in solutions})

    return num_solutions

num_solutions = count_m()
print(num_solutions)
```

CODE RESULTS 2

The script correctly counts the number of possible values of $m$. Now we just need to print the result.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $2$. The answer is:

\[2\]

Assistant:

 The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly four distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ represents a family of piecewise linear functions, where the number of pieces is determined by the number of times the absolute value function is applied. In this case, the absolute value function is applied twice, so we expect to see four pieces in the graph.

The absolute value function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ will be zero at $x=1\pm2$, which gives us $x=3$ and $x=-1$. These are the points where the function changes its slope. Therefore, the equation will have four distinct solutions if $\frac{m}{100}$ falls strictly between $2$ and $1$, which gives $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$.

Multiplying all sides of the inequalities by $100$, we get $100 < m < 200$. The positive integers in this range are exactly the integers from $101$ to $199$, inclusive. To count the number of these integers, we subtract the smallest integer in the range from the largest integer in the range and add $1$ (because both endpoints are included). So the number of positive integers $m$ is $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$.
The value of $m$ is an integer, so we need to count the number of integers from 101 to 199. This can be done by subtracting the smallest integer in the range from the largest integer in the range and adding 1 (because both endpoints are included). So the number of positive integers $m$ is $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly four distinct solutions is 99.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions. This means that the expression inside the absolute value, $|x-1| - 2$, must be equal to $\frac{m}{100}$, $-\frac{m}{100}$, $\frac{m}{100}$ or $-\frac{m}{100}$ with the sign flipped in the middle two cases. This gives us four equations to solve:

1. $|x-1| - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$
2. $|x-1| - 2 = -\frac{m}{100}$
3. $-(|x-1| - 2) = \frac{m}{100}$
4. $-(|x-1| - 2) = -\frac{m}{100}$

These can be simplified to:

1. $|x-1| = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$
2. $|x-1| = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$
3. $|x-1| = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$
4. $|x-1| = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$

Now, we know that $|x-1|$ is always non-negative, so the second and third equations have no solutions because $2 - \frac{m}{100}$ could be negative, making the absolute value equal to a negative number, which is impossible.

So we only need to solve the first and fourth equations:

1. $|x-1| = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ has two solutions: $x = 1 + 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = 1 - (2 + \frac{m}{100})$.
2. $|x-1| = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ has two solutions: $x = 1 + (2 - \frac{m}{100})$ and $x = 1 - (2 - \frac{m}{100})$.

For the equation $|x-1| = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ to have distinct solutions, we need $2 + \frac{m}{100} > 0$, which implies $m < 200$. Similarly, for the equation $|x-1| = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ to have distinct solutions, we need $2 - \frac{m}{100} > 0$, which implies $m < 200$.

Therefore, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $0 < m < 200$ and the four solutions above are distinct. This can be done by iterating over all positive integers $m$ from 1 to 199 and checking if the four solutions are distinct. If they are, we increment a counter. The final value of the counter will be the desired answer.

Here is the entire Python script:

```python

def count_m():
    counter = 0
    for m in range(1, 200):

        sol12 = 1 - (2 + m / 100)
        sol21 = 1 + (2 - m / 100)
        sol22 = 1 - (2 - m / 100)

        # Check if the solutions are distinct
        if (sol11 != sol12 and sol11 != sol21 and sol11 != sol22 and sol12 != sol21 and sol12 != sol22 and sol21 != sol22):
            counter += 1
    return counter

result = count_m()

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, let's simplify the equation a bit. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions, which means that the expression $\vert x-1 \vert -2$ must be equal to either $-\frac{m}{100}$, $0$, $\frac{m}{100}$, or $2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
2. Let's solve the equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$. We have $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. Since the absolute value of a number is always non-negative, $2 - \frac{m}{100}$ must be non-negative, so we have $2 - \frac{m}{100} \geq 0$, which gives us $\frac{m}{100} \leq 2$, so $m \leq 200$.
3. Similarly, for the equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, and $2 + \frac{m}{100} \geq 0$, so $\frac{m}{100} \geq -2$, which gives us $m \geq -200$. But since $m$ is a positive integer, we only consider $m \geq 0$, so we have $m \geq 0$.
4. Combining the above two inequalities, we have $0 \leq m \leq 200$.
5. Now we need to find the values of $m$ for which the equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 0$, $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, and $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ each have 2 distinct solutions.
6. For the equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 0$, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$, which gives us two solutions: $x = 3$ and $x = -1$.
7. For the equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, and this equation will have 2 distinct solutions if and only if $2 + \frac{m}{100} > 0$, so $\frac{m}{100} > -2$, which gives us $m > -200$. But since $m$ is a positive integer, we only consider $m > 0$, so we have $m > 0$.
8. For the equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = 4 - \frac{m}{100}$, and this equation will have 2 distinct solutions if and only if $4 - \frac{m}{100} > 0$, so $\frac{m}{100} < 4$, which gives us $m < 400$.
9. Combining all the above conditions, we have $0 < m < 200$, and $m$ must be an integer, so the possible values of $m$ are the integers from 1 to 199.
10. To find the number of such integers, we simply subtract the smallest possible value of $m$ from the largest possible value of $m$, and then add 1. So the number of possible values of $m$ is $199 - 1 + 1 = 199$.

But wait, we made a mistake. We forgot to consider the equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ when $m = 200$. In this case, the equation becomes $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 2$, which simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = 4$, and this equation has 2 distinct solutions: $x = 5$ and $x = -3$. So we need to add 1 to our previous result.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is $199 + 1 = 200$.

Now let's write the python script:

```python

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"

 To solve this problem, we first need to analyze the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. The number of distinct solutions for $x$ depends on the value of $\frac{m}{100}$.

For $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ to be equal to a positive number, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be greater than 2. Therefore, $m > 200$.

Now, we consider the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. This equation has four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is less than 3 and greater than or equal to 2. Therefore, $200 \leq m < 300$.

The only positive integer $m$ that satisfies this condition is $m = 200$. Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ that makes the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have four distinct solutions. The answer is: $1$

 To solve this problem, we need to analyze the equation and determine for how many positive integers m the equation has 4 distinct solutions.

The equation is $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. The number of solutions depends on the value of $\frac{m}{100}$.

The expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, can be either positive or negative. We can consider two cases:

1. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 \geq 0$: In this case, we have $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$. Solving for $x$ gives us two equations: $x-1 -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $-(x-1) -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplify to $x-3 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $-x+1 -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, respectively. These further simplify to $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = 1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

2. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0$: In this case, we have $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = \frac{m}{100}$. Solving for $x$ gives us two equations: $-(x-1) +2 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $-(-(x-1)) +2 = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplify to $-x+1 +2 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $x-1 +2 = \frac{m}{100}$, respectively. These further simplify to $-x+3 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $x+1 = \frac{m}{100}$.

Now, we need to find the number of distinct solutions for each case. For the first case, we have two solutions: $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = 1 - \frac{m}{100}$. For the second case, we have two solutions: $x = -3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = 1 + \frac{m}{100}$. So in total, we have four solutions.

Now we need to find for how many positive integers m these solutions are distinct. This happens when $1 - \frac{m}{100} \neq 3 + \frac{m}{100}$, $-3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq 1 + \frac{m}{100}$, $-3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 + \frac{m}{100}$, and $1 + \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Simplifying these inequalities gives $m \neq 150$, $m \neq 100$, $m \neq 50$, and $m \neq 0$. The only positive integer that satisfies all these conditions is m = 50.

Therefore, there is only one value of m for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions, and that value is m = 50. The answer is: $1$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, we note that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 1$. This is because the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, takes on a maximum value of 2 and a minimum value of 0. For it to take on 4 distinct values, the right hand side must equal to $\frac{1}{2}$ of the distance between these two values. Therefore, we must have $\frac{m}{100} = 1$.

Solving this equation gives $m = 100$. 

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the given condition is 1. The answer is $\boxed{1}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



We are given the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ and want to find for how many values of $m$ the equation has exactly 4 distinct solutions. The equation is made up of two absolute values, which are tricky to deal with. However, we know that the number of solutions depends on the value of $\frac{m}{100}$, which must be a positive number. So we only need to consider the positive values of $m$.

To find out how many values of $m$ make the equation have exactly 4 distinct solutions, we can start by considering the possible values of $\frac{m}{100}$. Since $\frac{m}{100}$ is a positive number and must be less than 2 (because the absolute value is less than 2 on the left side of the equation), we know that $\frac{m}{100}$ can be any value in the interval $(0, 2)$.

Now we need to find how many such values of $\frac{m}{100}$ will make the equation have 4 distinct solutions. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to 1. Therefore, the number of values of $m$ that make the equation have 4 distinct solutions is 1.

So the answer is $1$.
The answer is: $\boxed{1}$

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. The absolute value function splits the equation into two cases. 
2. For each case, we have $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \pm \frac{m}{100}$.
3. Solving the two cases separately, we get $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
4. For each case, the absolute value function splits into two more cases.
5. For each of these four cases, we have $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, $x-1 = -2 - \frac{m}{100}$, $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, and $x-1 = -2 + \frac{m}{100}$.
6. Solving these equations for $x$, we get $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$, $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$, $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, and $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.
7. The four solutions are distinct if and only if the values of $\frac{m}{100}$ are distinct.
8. This is only possible if $-1 < \frac{m}{100} < 3$.
9. Multiplying through by 100, we have $-100 < m < 300$.
10. The positive integer values of $m$ in this range are 1 to 299.
11. Counting these values, we find that there are 299 possible values of $m$.

The value of $m$ that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions is a positive integer from 1 to 299. Therefore, there are 299 such values. The answer is: $299$.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:


1. First, we can easily see that the given equation has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $m = 200$.
2. To prove this, we need to examine the number of solutions for each possible value of $m$.
3. If $m < 200$, then $\frac{m}{100} < 2$, and the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert< 2$, which simplifies to $0 < \vert x-1 \vert < 4$. This gives us two cases: $0 < x-1 < 4$ and $-4 < x-1 < 0$. Solving these inequalities, we get $1 < x < 5$ and $-3 < x < 1$. The intersection of these two intervals gives $1 < x < 1$, which is an empty set, so we have no solutions in this case.
4. If $m = 200$, then $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert= 2$, which simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \pm 2$. Solving these two equations, we get $\vert x-1 \vert = 4$, which gives two solutions $x = 5$ and $x = -3$. And $\vert x-1 \vert = 0$, which gives one solution $x = 1$. Thus, we have 3 distinct solutions in this case.
5. If $m > 200$, then $\frac{m}{100} > 2$, and the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert> 2$, which simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert -2 > 2$ or $\vert x-1 \vert -2 < -2$. The first inequality gives $\vert x-1 \vert > 4$, which has no solutions. The second inequality gives $\vert x-1 \vert < 0$, which also has no solutions. So we have no solutions in this case.
6. Therefore, the only value of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is $m = 200$.

The answer is: $1$

Assistant:

 The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions. 

The expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ can take on three different values:

- If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 \geq 0$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \vert x-1 \vert - 2$. The equation becomes $\vert x-1 \vert - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$, which gives us two solutions: $x = 1 + 2 + \frac{m}{100} = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = 1 - 2 + \frac{m}{100} = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.
- If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0$ and $\vert x-1 \vert > 2$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = 2 - \vert x-1 \vert$. The equation becomes $2 - \vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, which gives us two solutions: $x = 1 + 2 - \frac{m}{100} = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = 1 - 2 + \frac{m}{100} = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$. However, these solutions are the same as the ones from the first case.
- If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0$ and $\vert x-1 \vert \leq 2$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = 2 - \vert x-1 \vert$. The equation becomes $2 - \vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, which gives us one solution: $x = 1 - 2 + \frac{m}{100} = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

So, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, which gives $m = 200$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions is $1$. The answer is: $1$
