 The equation $AB = 0$ holds if and only if at least one of $A$ or $B$ is zero. Therefore, the given equation is satisfied if and only if at least one of the following conditions holds:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first condition to hold, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$, which gives us the four lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

For the second condition to hold, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us the four lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersection of these lines form a square with side length $10$ (the maximum of $10$ and $8$). Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $10^2 = 100$.

```python

def area_of_polygon():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    side_length = max(10, 8)
    area = side_length**2
    return area

result = area_of_polygon()

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The given equation is the product of two terms equals zero. This means that either the first term equals zero or the second term equals zero. So the points satisfying the equation are either the points that make the first term zero or the points that make the second term zero.

2. Let's denote the first term as $A = (|x + y| - 10)^2 + (|x - y| - 10)^2$ and the second term as $B = (|x| - 8)^2 + (|y| - 8)^2$. Then the equation becomes $AB = 0$.

3. If $A = 0$, we have $(|x + y| - 10)^2 + (|x - y| - 10)^2 = 0$. The only way for the sum of two squares to be zero is if both squares are zero. That is, $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x - y| - 10 = 0$. This simplifies to $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$. Solving these equations gives $x = 10$ and $y = 0$. Similarly, if $B = 0$, we get $x = 8$ and $y = 8$.

4. Therefore, the points that satisfy the equation are $(10, 0)$ and $(8, 8)$. These two points form a line segment, which is a polygon with area zero. However, the problem asks for the area of a convex polygon, and a line segment is not convex.

5. To find the convex polygon, we consider the absolute value function $|x|$, which is defined as $x$ if $x \geq 0$ and $-x$ if $x < 0$. This means that $|x| - a = 0$ has solutions $x = a$ and $x = -a$. Applying this to our equations, we find that the points satisfying $A = 0$ are on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, and the points satisfying $B = 0$ are on the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$.

6. These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(8, 0)$, $(8, 8)$, $(0, 2)$, and $(10, 0)$. This rectangle is the convex polygon we are looking for.

7. To find its area, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle, which is length times width. The length is the difference in x-coordinates of the two opposite vertices, which is $10 - 8 = 2$. The width is the difference in y-coordinates of the two opposite vertices, which is $8 - 0 = 8$. Therefore, the area of the rectangle is $2 \times 8 = 16$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 16. The answer is: $\boxed{16}$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So the equation is equivalent to the system of equations:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first system of equations, we have:
1.1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$
For the second system of equations, we have:
2.1. $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$

Now, let's analyze the absolute value equations:
1.1.1. $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$ or $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$
2.1.1. $x = 8$ or $x = -8$ or $y = 8$ or $y = -8$

Solving this system of equations, we find the vertices of the polygon:
$(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(2, 8)$, $(-2, 8)$, $(2, -8)$, $(-2, -8)$

The polygon is a square with side length 16. The area of a square is side length squared, so the area is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $ ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is equal to zero if and only if either of the two factors is zero. This gives us two sets of equations:

1) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

2) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first set of equations, we have:

$\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$

These imply that $-10 \leq x+y \leq 10$, $-8 \leq x \leq 8$, $-10 \leq x-y \leq 10$, and $-8 \leq y \leq 8$. The intersection of these inequalities is a square with side length 8, so its area is $64$.

The second set of equations leads to the same solutions, so we don't need to consider it separately.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 64. The answer is: $64$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



We have the equation $F(x, y) = ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. The points $(x, y)$ that satisfy this equation are the ones that make either $F_1(x, y) = (\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $F_2(x, y) = (\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ true.

If $F_1(x, y) = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means $x + y = \pm10$ and $x - y = \pm10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square with side length 10.

If $F_2(x, y) = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $x = \pm8$ and $y = \pm8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square with side length 16.

To find the area of the convex polygon formed by these points, we just need to sum the areas of the two squares. The area of a square with side length $a$ is $a^2$, so the area of the first square is $10^2 = 100$ and the area of the second square is $16^2 = 256$. The total area is $100 + 256 = 356$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 356 square units. So the answer is $\boxed{356}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. Notice that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. That means the given equation is equivalent to:

$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$$ 

or

$$((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$ 

2. The first equation can be simplified to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This describes a square with side length 20.

3. The second equation simplifies to $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which describes a square with side length 16.

4. The area of the first square is $20^2 = 400$, and the area of the second square is $16^2 = 256$.

5. The total area of the polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares, which is $400 + 256 = 656$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 656. To calculate the area using Python, we can use the sympy library:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Rational

def calculate_area():
    # Calculate the area of the square with side length 20
    area_square1 = 20**2

    # Calculate the area of the square with side length 16
    area_square2 = 16**2

    # Calculate the total area
    total_area = area_square1 + area_square2

    return total_area

result = calculate_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 656

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
656
```
The area of the convex polygon is $656$. The answer is: $656$.

1. The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So, this equation is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

2. Each of these equations simplifies to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

3. Solving these equations gives us a system of lines and circles in the plane.

4. The intersection of these lines and circles forms a octagon.

5. To find the area of this octagon, we can divide it into 8 equilateral triangles, each with side length 8 (from the equations $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$).

6. The area of an equilateral triangle with side length s is $\frac{s^2 \sqrt{3}}{4}$.

7. So the area of the octagon is $8 \times \frac{8^2 \sqrt{3}}{4} = 128 \sqrt{3}$.

However, this is not a valid numerical answer as the question asks for the numerical area of the polygon. I apologize for the misunderstanding. Here is the correct solution:

The points satisfying the given equation enclose a square with side length 16 (from the equations $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$).

The area of a square with side length s is $s^2$.

So the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

Assistant:


The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero, which means that either of the expressions must be zero for the product to be zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
The solutions to these equations are the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The solutions to these equations are the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The points satisfying both cases are the intersections of these lines, forming a square with side length 16. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $\boxed{256}$
