The equation is given as $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
If the product of two numbers is zero, then at least one of the numbers must be zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives $x = y = 5$ or $x = -y = 5$. So the points are $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, and $(-5,-5)$.
If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So the points are $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.
The points $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, and $(-5,-5)$ form a square with side length 10, and the area is $10^2 = 100$. The points $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$ form a square with side length 16, and the area is $16^2 = 256$. The convex polygon formed by the union of these two squares is a rectangle with length 26 and width 10. The area of the rectangle is $26 \times 10 = 260$. So the area of the convex polygon is 260.
The answer is: $260$.

 The given equation is equal to zero, which means that at least one of the factors must be zero. 

Let's consider each factor:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \implies \vert x + y \vert = 10 \implies x + y = \pm 10$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \implies \vert x - y \vert = 10 \implies x - y = \pm 10$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \implies \vert x \vert = 8 \implies x = \pm 8$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \implies \vert y \vert = 8 \implies y = \pm 8$.

From these equations, we can deduce that the points that satisfy the equation are the vertices of a square with side length 10. The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units.

The answer is: $100$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, we need to understand that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So, the equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ must be true.

Now, let's analyze the first equation:

$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$

This equation is true if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

This means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.

Solving these equations, we get four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

Now let's analyze the second equation:

$(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

This equation is true if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

This means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

So we get four more lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersection of these lines form a square with side length 16.

The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $\boxed{256}$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The condition is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. The first equation implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x = \pm 5, y = \pm 5$. The second equation implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8, y = \pm 8$. So the points are $(8,8), (-8,8), (8,-8), (-8,-8), (5,5), (-5,5), (5,-5), (-5,-5)$. These points form a rectangle with side lengths 16 and 10. The area of this rectangle is $16 \times 10 = 160$.

Now let's write the python code to calculate the area:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def rectangle_area():
    # Calculate the length and width of the rectangle
    length = 16
    width = 10

    # Calculate the area of the rectangle
    area = length * width

    return area

result = rectangle_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 160

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
160
```
The area of the convex polygon is $160$.
The answer is: $160$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We have the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. This equation equals zero when either the first term or the second term equals zero.

2. For the first term to be zero, we need both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. Solving these equations gives us the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$.

3. For the second term to be zero, we need both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. Solving these equations gives us the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$.

4. These lines form a rectangle with vertices at (8,8), (8,-8), (-8,8), and (-8,-8).

5. The area of this rectangle is $(16)(16) = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256.

Now, let's write the entire script to accomplish this task:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Rational, simplify

def area_of_polygon():
    # Coordinates of the vertices of the rectangle
    vertices = [(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)]

    # Calculate the lengths of the sides of the rectangle
    length = max([abs(vertices[i][0] - vertices[j][0]) for i in range(4) for j in range(4) if i != j] + [abs(vertices[0][0])])
    width = max([abs(vertices[i][1] - vertices[j][1]) for i in range(4) for j in range(4) if i != j] + [abs(vertices[0][1])])

    # Calculate the area of the rectangle
    area = length * width

    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is $\boxed{256}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



We start with the equation: 
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0\]

This equation is satisfied if either of the two factors is zero. 

1. The first factor is zero when:
\[(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \text{ or } (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0\]
Which implies:
\[\vert x + y \vert = 10 \text{ or } \vert x - y \vert = 10\]
This represents a square with side length 20, centered at the origin.

2. The second factor is zero when:
\[(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \text{ or } (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0\]
Which implies:
\[\vert x \vert = 8 \text{ or } \vert y \vert = 8\]
This represents a square with side length 16, centered at the origin.

Now, we need to find the intersection of these two squares. The intersection of the two squares is a square with side length 16 (since 16 is smaller than 20), centered at the origin. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Rational, simplify

def calculate_area():
    # Side length of the square
    side_length = 16

    # Area of the square
    area = side_length**2

    return area

result = calculate_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is $\boxed{256}$.
