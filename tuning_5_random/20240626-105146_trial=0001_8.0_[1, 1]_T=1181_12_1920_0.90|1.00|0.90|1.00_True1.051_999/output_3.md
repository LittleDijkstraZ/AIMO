Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The expression $A(B)=0$ is equivalent to $A=0$ or $B=0$. So the equation is satisfied when either of the two following sets of equations are satisfied:

\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)=0\]
\[((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)=0\]
2. Each of the above equations implies that $|\cdot|=10$ or $|\cdot|=8$. The absolute values $|\cdot|$ can only take on values between 0 and positive infinity, so each of these equations implies that its argument is one of two values: $0$ or $8$ or $10$.

3. If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2=0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. That implies $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$, which we can solve to get four points: $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, and $(-5,-5)$.

4. If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2=0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$, yielding four more points: $(8,0)$, $(-8,0)$, $(0,8)$ and $(0,-8)$.

5. Thus the polygon is a square with side length $10$. The area is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



A product of two expressions is zero if at least one of the expressions is zero. So, we have two cases to consider:

1. $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$
2. $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$

For the first case, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solution to these equations is a square with side length $20$ centered at the origin.

For the second case, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solution to these equations is a square with side length $16$ centered at the origin.

The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for, which is a square with side length $16$ (the smaller one). The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $256$.
The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. If a product is equal to zero, then one of the factors must be zero. This translates to two separate cases:

   a) $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$
   b) $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$

2. In each case, the equation is a square of a difference equaling zero. This means the absolute value expression must be equal to zero. And the absolute value of a number is only zero when the number itself is zero. Therefore, we have:

   a) $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$
   b) $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$

3. The second case translates to two separate cases:

   a) $x = 8$ or $x = -8$
   b) $y = 8$ or $y = -8$

4. The first case translates to four separate cases:

   a) $x + y = 10$
   b) $x + y = -10$
   c) $x - y = 10$
   d) $x - y = -10$

5. Solve each of these equations to obtain the coordinates of the vertices of the polygon.

6. The polygon formed by these vertices is a square with side length 16 (since $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$).

7. The area of a square is the square of its side length, so the area of the polygon is $16^2 = 256$.

Thus, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The expression equals zero if and only if both factors equal zero. So we have two sets of equations to solve: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

2. From $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, so $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.

3. Similarly, from $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert x \vert = 8$, so $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.

4. Now we have a system of equations to solve. Using the combinations of the equations above, we get the vertices of the polygon: $(8,2)$, $(8,-18)$, $(-8,18)$, and $(-8,-2)$.

5. To find the area of the polygon, we can use the Shoelace Formula. The coordinates of the vertices are $(x_1, y_1) = (8,2)$, $(x_2, y_2) = (8,-18)$, $(x_3, y_3) = (-8,18)$, and $(x_4, y_4) = (-8,-2)$.

6. The Shoelace Formula states that the area (let's call it $A$) of a polygon with vertices $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), ..., (x_n, y_n)$ is given by:
\[A = \frac{1}{2} \vert (x_1 y_2 + x_2 y_3 + ... + x_n y_1) - (y_1 x_2 + y_2 x_3 + ... + y_n x_1) \vert.\]

7. Applying this formula to our points, we get:
\[A = \frac{1}{2} \vert (8 \cdot -18 + 8 \cdot 18 + -8 \cdot 2 + -8 \cdot -18) - (2 \cdot 8 + -18 \cdot -8 + 18 \cdot -8 + -2 \cdot 8) \vert.\]

8. After calculating the expression, we get:
\[A = \frac{1}{2} \vert (-144 + 144 - 16 + 144) - (16 + 144 - 144 - 16) \vert = \frac{1}{2} \vert 0 \vert = 0.\]

9. However, the area of a single point (the only point that satisfies both conditions) is zero. This doesn't make sense in the context of the problem.

10. Let's reevaluate the problem. The expression equals zero if either factor equals zero. So we have two separate cases to consider: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. 

11. For the first case, we get $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. This represents a set of lines in the plane, not a single point.

12. For the second case, we get $\vert x \vert = 8$, which also represents a set of lines in the plane.

13. The intersection of these two sets of lines is a rectangle with vertices at $(8,2)$, $(8,-18)$, $(-8,18)$, and $(-8,-2)$.

14. To find the area of the rectangle, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle: $A = length \times width$. The length is the distance between $(8,2)$ and $(-8,2)$, which is $16$. The width is the distance between $(8,2)$ and $(8,-18)$, which is $20$. So the area of the rectangle is $A = 16 \times 20 = 320$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 320. The answer is: $320$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so we can split it into two separate cases:
   - $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
   - $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
   - $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
   - $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

2. For each of the above equations, we can solve for x and y:
   - $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ gives us $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
   - $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ gives us $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
   - $\vert x \vert = 8$ gives us $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
   - $\vert y \vert = 8$ gives us $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

3. Combining the solutions from each equation, we have the following points:
   - $(8, 2)$, $(8, -10)$, $(-8, 10)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(2, 8)$, $(-10, 8)$, $(10, -8)$, $(-2, -8)$.

4. These points form a square with side length 16. The area of the square is therefore $16^2 = 256$.

The area of the convex polygon is 256. To confirm this using Python, you can use the `sympy` library to calculate the area of the square:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, simplify

def calculate_area():
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length**2
    return area

result = calculate_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:


If the product of two numbers is equal to zero, then at least one of the numbers must be zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. Let's analyze each case:
1. If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
2. If $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
3. If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
4. If $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.
Now, let's analyze the possible combinations:
1. If $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, then by solving the system of equations, we get $x = 10$ and $y = 0$.
2. If $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$, then by solving the system of equations, we get $x = 0$ and $y = 10$.
3. If $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$, then by solving the system of equations, we get $x = -10$ and $y = -20$.
4. If $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$, then by solving the system of equations, we get $x = -10$ and $y = 0$.
5. If $x = 8$ and $x - y = 10$, then we get $y = -2$.
6. If $x = 8$ and $x - y = -10$, then we get $y = 18$.
7. If $x = -8$ and $x - y = 10$, then we get $y = -18$.
8. If $x = -8$ and $x - y = -10$, then we get $y = 2$.
9. If $x = 8$ and $y = 8$, we get a solution, but it does not satisfy the condition $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
10. If $x = 8$ and $y = -8$, we get a solution, but it does not satisfy the condition $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
11. If $x = -8$ and $y = 8$, we get a solution, but it does not satisfy the condition $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
12. If $x = -8$ and $y = -8$, we get a solution, but it does not satisfy the condition $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
So, the combinations that satisfy all the conditions are: (10, 0), (0, 10), (-10, -2), and (-10, 0). These are the vertices of the polygon. The polygon is a square with side length 20. The area of the square is $20^2 = 400$. So the area of the convex polygon is 400.
The answer is: $\boxed{400}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



This problem requires understanding the properties of absolute values and how they interact with algebraic operations. It also requires knowledge of how to compute the area of a polygon.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how we can solve this problem using the Python programming language with the Sympy library:

Step 1: Import the necessary libraries

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Abs, solve, Eq, simplify
from sympy.geometry import Polygon, Point
```

Step 2: Define the symbols

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

x, y = symbols('x y')

Step 3: Define the equation

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

However, we realize we have a mistake in the code. The `Polygon()` function in Sympy geometry expects points to be of the type `Point` but we are supplying a list of tuples as points from the solve function. We need to convert these tuples into points before creating the polygon.

Corrected Code:

Step 1: Import the necessary libraries

```python

from sympy import symbols, Abs, solve, Eq, simplify
from sympy.geometry import Polygon, Point

The area of the polygon is 256 square units. Since the problem asks for a positive numerical answer, the answer is $\boxed{256}$.
The script to calculate the area of the polygon is provided below:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Abs, solve, Eq, simplify
from sympy.geometry import Polygon, Point

# Define the symbols
x, y = symbols('x y')

# Define the equation
equation = ((Abs(x + y) - 10)**2 + (Abs(x - y) - 10)**2) * ((Abs(x) - 8)**2 + (Abs(y) - 8)**2)

# Solve the equation for points where it equals zero
points_equations = solve(equation, (x, y))
points = [Point(p[0], p[1]) for p in points_equations]

# Create a polygon from the points
polygon = Polygon(*points)

# Calculate the area of the polygon
area = polygon.area
area = simplify(area)

# Print the area of the polygon
print(area)
```

## QUESTION 3 - 11 
- TIME_SPENT : 773 secs

11_User:

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The enunciation implies two conditions must be satisfied simultaneously: $ (|x+y| - 10)^2 = 0 \quad and \quad (|x| - 8)^2 = 0 $.

The first condition implies $|x+y| = 10$, that is $x+y = \pm 10$. Similarly, the second condition implies $|x| = 8$, that is $x = \pm 8$.

We have then four equations to solve: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x = 8$ and $x = -8$. 

Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -18)$, $(-8, 18)$, $(-8, -2)$.

Plotting these points on a graph and visualizing the polygon, we realize it's a rectangle having sides of lengths 18 and 20. The area will be given by the product of these lengths: $Area = 18 * 20 = 360$. 

So the area of the convex polygon is 360 square units.
The answer is: $360$
