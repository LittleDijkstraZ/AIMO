Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The equation $AB = 0$ implies that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. So we have two cases to consider:
   a. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
   b. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

2. For case (a) to be true, both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This forms a square with side length 10.

3. For case (b) to be true, both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This forms a square with side length 16.

4. The solution points are the intersection of the points satisfying case (a) and case (b). The convex polygon formed by these points is the intersection of the two squares, which results in a smaller square with side length 8.

5. The area of the square is side length squared, so the area of the convex polygon is $8^2 = 64$.

The area of the convex polygon is 64. The answer is: $64$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation involves absolute values, which can be challenging to handle directly in Sympy. Instead, we can consider the four cases separately:

1. When $x + y \geq 0$ and $x - y \geq 0$, we have $|x + y| = x + y$ and $|x - y| = x - y$. So the equation becomes
\[((x + y - 10)^2 + (x - y - 10)^2)((x - 8)^2 + (y - 8)^2) = 0.\]

2. When $x + y \geq 0$ and $x - y < 0$, we have $|x + y| = x + y$ and $|x - y| = -(x - y)$. So the equation becomes
\[((x + y - 10)^2 + (-(x - y) - 10)^2)((x - 8)^2 + (y - 8)^2) = 0.\]

3. When $x + y < 0$ and $x - y \geq 0$, we have $|x + y| = -(x + y)$ and $|x - y| = x - y$. So the equation becomes
\[((-(x + y) - 10)^2 + (x - y - 10)^2)((x - 8)^2 + (y - 8)^2) = 0.\]

4. When $x + y < 0$ and $x - y < 0$, we have $|x + y| = -(x + y)$ and $|x - y| = -(x - y)$. So the equation becomes
\[((-(x + y) - 10)^2 + (-(x - y) - 10)^2)((x - 8)^2 + (y - 8)^2) = 0.\]

These are the four cases. In all of them, the product of two squares equals zero, so each term must be zero. We can easily find the points that satisfy these conditions:

1. $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, which gives $x = 10$ and $y = 0$.
2. $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$, which gives $x = 0$ and $y = 10$.
3. $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$, which gives $x = 0$ and $y = -10$.
4. $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$, which gives $x = -10$ and $y = 0$.

These four points form a square with side length $20$. Therefore, the area of the square is $20^2 = 400$. The answer is: $400$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The equation $A \cdot B = 0$ is true if and only if at least one of the factors is zero. So, we have two cases to consider:
   a) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
   b) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
2. For the first case, $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These equations represent two pairs of parallel lines, which are the sides of a square with side length 10.
3. For the second case, $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$, which represent two pairs of parallel lines, which are the sides of another square with side length 8.
4. The intersection of these two squares forms a smaller square, which is the convex polygon we are looking for. The side length of this square is the difference of the side lengths of the two squares, which is $10 - 8 = 2$.
5. To find the area of this square, we square its side length, so the area is $2^2 = 4$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 4.

The answer is: $4$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The given equation is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. For the product of two expressions to be zero, both expressions must be zero. So, we have two cases to consider:

   a) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
   b) $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

2. In both cases, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

3. For case a), $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $|x + y| = 10$. The only possible combination of $x$ and $y$ that satisfies this is $x = 8$ and $y = 2$, or $x = -8$ and $y = -2$.

4. For case b), $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $|x - y| = 10$. The only possible combination of $x$ and $y$ that satisfies this is $x = 8$ and $y = -2$, or $x = -8$ and $y = 2$.

5. Combining both cases, we find that the points satisfying the given equation are $(8, 2)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(8, -2)$, and $(-8, 2)$. These points form a rectangle with side lengths 10 and 4.

6. The area of this rectangle is $10 \times 4 = 40$.

So the area of the convex polygon is $40$. The answer is: $40$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The problem involves the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ and we are asked to find the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points that satisfy this equation.

Since the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero, the equation is satisfied if either $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$ or $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

If $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$, which gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. The points that satisfy these equations form a rectangle with vertices at $(10,0)$, $(-10,0)$, $(0,10)$, and $(0,-10)$.

If $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$, which gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. The points that satisfy these equations form a rectangle with vertices at $(8,8)$, $(-8,8)$, $(-8,-8)$, and $(8,-8)$.

Therefore, the points that satisfy the original equation form the union of two rectangles, which is also a rectangle. The side lengths of the rectangle are the diagonals of the smaller rectangle, which can be found using the Pythagorean theorem: $\sqrt{8^2 + 8^2} = \sqrt{128} = 8\sqrt{2}$. Therefore, the area of the rectangle is the product of its side lengths, which is $(8\sqrt{2})^2 = 128$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $128$.

In python code, the calculation would look like this:
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import sqrt

def polygon_area():
    side_length = sqrt(8**2 + 8**2)
    area = side_length**2
    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 128

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
128
```
The area of the convex polygon is $128$. The answer is: $128$

Assistant:

 The given equation is equivalent to the product of two quadratic expressions being zero. This means that either one of the quadratic expressions must be zero for the product to be zero. Thus, we have two cases:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon.

Let's solve these cases:

Case 1:
The equation $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ represents a square with side length 10 centered at the origin. The vertices are at $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, and $(-5,-5)$.

The equation $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ also represents a square with side length 10 centered at the origin. The vertices are at $(5, -5)$, $(5,5)$, $(-5,-5)$, and $(-5,5)$.

The intersection of these two squares is the square with side length 10 centered at the origin, which is the polygon we are looking for.

Case 2:
The equation $\vert x \vert = 8$ represents a square with side length 16 centered at the origin in the x-direction. The vertices are at $(8,0)$, $(-8,0)$, $(0,8)$, and $(0,-8)$.

The equation $\vert y \vert = 8$ represents a square with side length 16 centered at the origin in the y-direction. The vertices are at $(0,8)$, $(0,-8)$, $(8,0)$, and $(-8,0)$.

The intersection of these two squares is the square with side length 16 centered at the origin, which is a larger square that contains the polygon from Case 1.

The area of the polygon from Case 1 is the area of a square with side length 10, which is $10^2 = 100$ square units.
The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The condition $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is true only if either $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$ or $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

2. The first equation is true only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations we get the vertices of the square as $(0,0)$, $(10,10)$, $(-10,-10)$, and $(10,-10)$.

3. The second equation is true only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations we get the vertices of the square as $(8,8)$, $(-8,8)$, $(-8,-8)$, and $(8,-8)$.

4. Therefore, the convex polygon enclosed by these points is a square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$. The area of a square is given by the square of its side length, so the area of this square is $(10\sqrt{2})^2 = 200$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $200$. We can print this result using Python:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import sqrt

def area_of_polygon():
    side_length = 10 * sqrt(2)
    area = side_length**2
    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 200

```output

The area of the convex polygon is $200$. The answer is $\boxed{200}$.

 The equation $AB = 0$ is equivalent to $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the given equation is satisfied if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
From the first two equations, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8,2)$, $(8,-2)$, $(-8,2)$, and $(-8,-2)$.
From the last two equations, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.
The points that satisfy the given equation are the vertices of a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$.
