The problem is to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $| |x-1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

The function $| |x-1| - 2|$ has 4 critical points at $x= -1, 1, 3, 5$. These divide the number line into 5 segments, and the function changes its shape on each segment.

For the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal to the difference between two consecutive critical values. The critical values are 0, 2, and 4, so the possible values of $\frac{m}{100}$ are 2-0=2 and 4-2=2.

Thus, $m$ must be equal to 200. There is only one positive integer $m$ that satisfies this condition, so the answer is $\boxed{1}$.

result = number_of_m()

 The number of distinct solutions to the equation $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|=\frac{m}{100}$ is 4. This means that the equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2=\pm\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. 

Let's analyze the two cases separately:

1. $\vert x-1 \vert -2=\frac{m}{100}$:
This equation can be rewritten as $\vert x-1 \vert =2+\frac{m}{100}$.
The absolute value equation splits into two cases:
Case 1a: $x-1 = 2+\frac{m}{100}$, which gives $x = 3+\frac{m}{100}$.
Case 1b: $x-1 = -(2+\frac{m}{100}) = -2-\frac{m}{100}$, which gives $x = -1-\frac{m}{100}$.
So for this case, we need the right-hand side of the equation to be positive, i.e., $2+\frac{m}{100} > 0$, or $m > -200$.

2. $\vert x-1 \vert -2=-\frac{m}{100}$:
This equation can be rewritten as $\vert x-1 \vert =2-\frac{m}{100}$.
The absolute value equation splits into two cases:
Case 2a: $x-1 = 2-\frac{m}{100}$, which gives $x = 3-\frac{m}{100}$.
Case 2b: $x-1 = -(2-\frac{m}{100}) = -2+\frac{m}{100}$, which gives $x = -1+\frac{m}{100}$.
So for this case, we need the right-hand side of the equation to be non-negative, i.e., $2-\frac{m}{100} \geq 0$, or $m \leq 200$.

Now we need to find the values of $m$ that satisfy both cases. From the two cases above, we can see that we need $-200 < m \leq 200$. 

Also, for the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, we need the two solutions for each case to be distinct, which implies that:
1. $3+\frac{m}{100} \neq -1-\frac{m}{100}$, i.e., $\frac{m}{100} \neq -4$, or $m \neq -400$.
2. $3-\frac{m}{100} \neq -1+\frac{m}{100}$, i.e., $\frac{m}{100} \neq -2$, or $m \neq -200$.

The values of $m$ that satisfy both conditions are the integers in the range $(-200, 200]$ excluding $-400$ and $-200$. There are exactly 198 such integers. So, the value of $m$ is 198. The answer is: $198$

Assistant:

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can have 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to the distance between the breakpoints of the piecewise linear function defined by $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. The breakpoints of this function occur at $x=1 \pm 2$, which gives $x=3$ and $x=-1$. The distance between these breakpoints is $3 - (-1) = 4$. Therefore, $\frac{m}{100} = 4$, which gives $m=400$. Hence, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions, and that is $m=400$. The answer is: 1

Assistant:

 The equation $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. Therefore, we need to solve the equation $\frac{m}{100} = 2$ for $m$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

def find_m():
    m = symbols('m')
    equation = Eq(m/100, 2)
    solution = solve(equation, m)
    return solution[0]

result = find_m()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 200

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
200
```
The value of $m$ for which the equation $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 200. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy this condition is 1. The answer is: $1$.
