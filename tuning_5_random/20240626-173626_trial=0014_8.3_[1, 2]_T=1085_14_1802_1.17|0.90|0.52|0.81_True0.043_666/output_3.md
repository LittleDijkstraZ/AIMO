Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, we need to realize that the expression is equals to 0 if and only if both of the terms are equals to 0. Therefore, we have four separate cases to solve: 
   a. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
   b. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
   c. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
   d. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
2. For each case, we can easily solve for the values of $x$ and $y$:
   a. $x = \pm 8$, $y = \pm 8$
   b. $x = \pm 8$, $y = \mp 8$
   c. $x = 0$, $y = \pm 10$
   d. $x = \pm 10$, $y = 0$
3. From these solutions, we can plot all these points in the coordinate plane and see the shape they form: it's a square with side length 16.
4. The area of the square is then $16^2 = 256$.

Here is the Python code to solve this problem:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_square():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = area_of_square()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the square is $256$ square units.
The answer is: $\boxed{256}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So in the given equation, the product of two terms is zero, which implies that at least one of the terms should be zero. This gives us two cases:
Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10$
Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8$
Similarly, for the second term, we get two more cases:
Case 3: $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x - y \vert = 10$
Case 4: $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert y \vert = 8$

Now, let's analyze these cases one by one:

Case 1: $|x + y| = 10$. This represents a pair of parallel lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.
Case 2: $|x| = 8$. This represents a pair of parallel lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.
Case 3: $|x - y| = 10$. This represents a pair of parallel lines $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.
Case 4: $|y| = 8$. This represents a pair of parallel lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

These four pairs of lines enclose a rectangle of dimensions 16x20. The area of this rectangle is 16 * 20 = 320. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon formed by these lines is 320 square units.
The answer is: $320$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The expression given in the problem is a product of two expressions equated to zero. This means that either of the expressions must be equal to zero for the entire product to be zero. So, we have two sets of equations to solve for $\left(x, y\right)$: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$; and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. Solving the first set of equations gives us $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$, which simplifies to $x = 0$ and $y = 0$. Similarly, solving the second set of equations gives us $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
3. Plotting these points on a coordinate plane, we see that they form a square with side length 10 (formed by the points $(0,8), (8,8), (8,0)$ and $(0,0)$). The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

Here's the python code to solve the problem:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    # The side length of the square is 10
    side_length = 10

    # The area of the square is side_length^2
    area = side_length**2

    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 100

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output

```
The area of the convex polygon is $100$. The answer is: $\boxed{100}$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:


The product of two numbers equals zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Thus, the given equation is equivalent to
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad ((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]
From the first equation we get
\[\vert x + y \vert = 10 \quad \text{and} \quad \vert x - y \vert = 10,\]which implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these system of equations gives $x = \pm 10, y = \pm 10$.
From the second equation we get
\[\vert x \vert = 8 \quad \text{and} \quad \vert y \vert = 8,\]which implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So the points in the polygon are: $(8, 8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8), (8, -8), (10, 10), (-10, 10), (-10, -10), (10, -10)$.
The polygon is a square with side length $16$, so its area is $16^2 = 256$. So the area of the polygon is $256$.

Oops! It seems like we're still having some problems with the solutions list. Let's try to solve the problem in a different way.

The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ implies that at least one of the two factors equals zero. This means that the points $(x, y)$ satisfying this equation must lie either on the set of points where $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or on the set of points where $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The first set of points is defined by the equations $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. These equations imply that $x = \pm 10, y = \pm 10$. 

The second set of points is defined by the equations $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

So the points in the polygon are: $(8, 8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8), (8, -8), (10, 10), (-10, 10), (-10, -10), (10, -10)$.

The polygon is a square with side length $16

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied only when at least one of the factors is zero. This implies that either $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$, $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$, or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.

From $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
From $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
From $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$, which implies $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
From $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, we have $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

The eight lines defined by these equations form a square with side length 16 (the distance between the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$, or $y = 8$ and $y = -8$). The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output

```
The area of the convex polygon is $256$ square units. The answer is $\boxed{256}$.
