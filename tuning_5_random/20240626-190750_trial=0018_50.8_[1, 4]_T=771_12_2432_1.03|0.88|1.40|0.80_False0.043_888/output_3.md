Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

 The given equation is equal to zero if and only if both factors are equal to zero. This means we have two sets of equations to solve:
1. $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x-y| - 10 = 0$
2. $|x| - 8 = 0$ and $|y| - 8 = 0$

Solving the first set of equations:
1. $|x+y| = 10$ implies $x+y = \pm 10$
2. $|x-y| = 10$ implies $x-y = \pm 10$

These equations describe a square with side length 20, centered at the origin. The vertices of the square are at the points $(\pm 10, 0)$, $(0, \pm 10)$.

Solving the second set of equations:
1. $|x| = 8$ implies $x = \pm 8$
2. $|y| = 8$ implies $y = \pm 8$

These equations describe a square with side length 16, centered at the origin. The vertices of this square are at the points $(\pm 8, 0)$, $(0, \pm 8)$.

The convex polygon formed by the intersection of these two squares is a smaller square with side length 16 (since the side length of the smaller square is limited by the first set of equations).

The area of the square is side length squared, so the area of the convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    """Calculate the area of the convex polygon formed by the intersection of the two squares described by the equations $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x-y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x| - 8 = 0$ and $|y| - 8 = 0$."""
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so one or both of the expressions must be zero for the equation to hold. That means we need to find the solution sets for each of the following:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From these, we get the following system of equations:
1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$
2. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$
3. $\vert x \vert = 8$
4. $\vert y \vert = 8$

From 3 and 4, we have $x = 8$ or $x = -8$, and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

From 1, when $x = 8$, we get $\vert y \vert = 2$, so $y = 2$ or $y = -2$.
When $x = -8$, we get $\vert y \vert = 2$, so $y = 2$ or $y = -2$.

From 2, when $y = 8$, we get $\vert x \vert = 2$, so $x = 2$ or $x = -2$.
When $y = -8$, we get $\vert x \vert = 2$, so $x = 2$ or $x = -2$.

So the vertices of the polygon are $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$.
This forms a square with side length 16. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or both $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. 

This means that the points that satisfy the equation are the points that satisfy $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$, or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. 

The points that satisfy $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$ are the vertices of a square with side length 10, centered at the origin, and with vertices on the lines $x=8$, $y=8$, $x=-8$, and $y=-8$. 

The points that satisfy $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$ are the vertices of a square with side length 10, centered at the origin, and with vertices on the lines $x+y=10$, $x-y=10$, $x+y=-10$, and $x-y=-10$. 

The union of these two squares is the convex polygon in question. 

The area of a square with side length $s$ is $s^2$, so the area of the convex polygon is $10^2 + 10^2 = 200$. 

So, the area of the convex polygon is 200.

```python

def polygon_area():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    side_length = 10
    area = 2 * side_length ** 2
    return area

result = polygon_area()

The area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{200}$. The answer is $\boxed{200}$.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

Let's consider the first term: $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$. This is only possible when both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. Solving these equations gives $x = \pm 10, y = 0$ or $x = 0, y = \pm 10$. These points form a square with side length $20$ and area $400$.

Now let's consider the second term: $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. This is only possible when both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. Solving these equations gives $x = \pm 8, y = \pm 8$. These points form a square with side length $16$ and area $256$.

However, the intersection of the two squares is a smaller square with side length $20 - 16 = 4$ and area $16$. To find the area of the convex polygon formed by the union of the two squares, we subtract the area of the intersection from the sum of the areas of the two squares.

So the area of the convex polygon is $400 + 256 - 16 = 640$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    # Areas of the two squares
    area1 = 400
    area2 = 256

    # Area of the intersection
    intersection_area = 16

    # Area of the convex polygon
    polygon_area = area1 + area2 - intersection_area

    return polygon_area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 640

The area of the convex polygon is $640$. The answer is: $640$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is equal to zero if and only if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ are zero or both $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2$ are zero.
This means that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
For $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, we have four cases: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x + y = 10$, and $x + y = -10$.
For $\vert x \vert = 8$, we have two cases: $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.
Similarly, for $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, we have four and two cases respectively.
By solving these equations, we find that the points are the vertices of a square with side length 16.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$.
