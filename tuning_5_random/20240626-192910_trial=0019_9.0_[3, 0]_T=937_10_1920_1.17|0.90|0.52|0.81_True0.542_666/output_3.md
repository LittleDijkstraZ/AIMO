Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equals to zero, which implies that each of the expressions must be zero. So we have:

1) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These two equations describe a square with side length 10.

From $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. These two equations describe a square with side length 16.

The intersection of these two squares is a smaller square with side length 8. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $8^2 = 64$.

```python

def area_of_polygon():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    side_length = 8
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 64

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
64
```
The area of the convex polygon is 64 square units. The answer is: $\boxed{64}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. Firstly, notice that the product of two numbers is equal to zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Thus we have two equations to solve: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

2. Solving these equations gives the system of equations $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$, which yield the following four equations: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x = 8$, and $x = -8$.

3. Graphing these equations on the coordinate plane, we find that they form a square with side length 10. The vertices of the square are $(8, 2)$, $(8, -18)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -18)$.

4. To find the area of the square, we simply square the length of one of its sides. The side length is 10 (the distance between $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$), so the area is $10^2 = 100$.

So the area of the polygon is 100. Let's print the result.

```python

print(100)

The area of the polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The given equation is $0 = 0$, which is always true. So we are looking for the set of all points $(x, y)$ such that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

2. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which gives us $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This set of equations forms the vertices of a square with side length 10 and diagonals of length $10\sqrt{2}$.

3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which gives us $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This set of equations forms a square with side length 16 and diagonals of length $16\sqrt{2}$.

4. The vertices of the square formed by the first set of equations are $(5, 5), (5, -5), (-5, 5), (-5, -5)$, and the vertices of the square formed by the second set of equations are $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$.

5. The intersection of these two squares forms a smaller square with side length 10 and diagonals of length $10\sqrt{2}$.

6. The area of the square is given by side length squared, which in this case is $10^2 = 100$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 100.

Python code:
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    # Side length of the smaller square
    side_length = 10

    # Area of the square
    area = side_length ** 2

    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 100

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
100
```
The area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{100}$.
The answer is: $100$
