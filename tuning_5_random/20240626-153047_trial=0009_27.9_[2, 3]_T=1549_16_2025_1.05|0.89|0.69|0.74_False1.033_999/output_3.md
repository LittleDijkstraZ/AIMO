Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ can only be true when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only way for this to be true is when $x = \pm10$ and $y = \pm10$.

2. Similarly, the expression $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ can only be true when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm8$ and $y = \pm8$.

3. Combining the two conditions, the points that satisfy both are $(\pm10, \pm10)$ and $(\pm8, \pm8)$. These points form a square with side length 20.

4. To find the area of the square, we use the formula for the area of a square, which is $side^2$. So the area is $20^2 = 400$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 400.

However, Sympy doesn't have any built-in function to calculate the area of a square directly. But we can still calculate it using Python code.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def square_area(side):
    return side**2

side_length = 20
area = square_area(side_length)
print(area)
```

CODE RESULTS 400

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
400
```
The area of the convex polygon is 400. The answer is: $400$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $f(x,y) = (\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ describes a set of points that satisfy the equation. 

This set of points encloses a convex polygon. The area of this polygon is what we want to find.

Let's break down the problem:

1. First, we notice that $f(x,y) = 0$ if and only if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. 

2. Each of these conditions implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$. 

3. These conditions imply that $-10 \le x + y \le 10$, $-8 \le x \le 8$, $-10 \le x - y \le 10$, and $-8 \le y \le 8$. 

4. Solving these inequalities, we find that $-18 \le x \le 18$ and $-18 \le y \le 18$. 

5. This is a square with side length 36, so its area is $36^2 = 1296$. 

So the area of the convex polygon is 1296. The answer is: $1296$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The given equation is a product of two terms, set to zero. This means that either of the terms must be zero for the entire expression to be zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

2. For the first case, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, this implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. This is the equation of a square with side length 20, centered at the origin.

3. For the second case, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, this implies that both $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which forms a square with side length 16, centered at the origin as well.

4. The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon we are interested in. To find its area, we simply need to find the area of the smaller square and subtract the area of the intersection (which is another square, but with side length equal to the difference of the side lengths of the two squares, i.e., 20 - 16 = 4).

5. The area of a square is given by the square of its side length, so the area of the larger square is $20^2 = 400$, and the area of the smaller square is $16^2 = 256$. The area of the intersection square is $4^2 = 16$.

6. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of the smaller square subtracted from the area of the larger square, plus the area of the intersection square: $400 - 256 + 16 = 160$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 160. The answer is: $160$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Step 1: The expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ equals $0$ if and only if both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. From these equations, we get $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only way these two equations can be true is if $|x|=|y|=10$.

Step 2: Similarly, the expression $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $|x|=|y|=8$.

Step 3: The only way both conditions can be satisfied at the same time is if $|x|=|y|=8$. The points that satisfy this condition form a square with side length 16.

Step 4: The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

It seems like our python script is not working as expected. We need to revise our approach. 

Let's revisit the steps:

Step 1: The expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ equals $0$ if and only if both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. From these equations, we get $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only way these two equations can be true is if $|x|=|y|=10$.

Step 2: Similarly, the expression $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $|x|=|y|=8$.

Step 3: The only way both conditions can be satisfied at the same time is if $|x|=|y|=8$. The points that satisfy this condition form a square with side length 16.

Step 4: The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    # The side length of the square is the maximum of |x| and |y|
    side_length = max(10, 8) * 2

    # The area of the square is the side length squared
    area = side_length**2

    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 400

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
400
```
The area of the convex polygon is 256. However, we made a mistake in our calculations. Let's correct it.

The correct calculation is as follows:

Step 1: The expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ equals $0$ if and only if both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. From these equations, we get $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $|x+y|=10$ and $|x-y|=10$. The only way this is possible is if $|x|=|y|=10/2=5$.

Step 2: Similarly, the expression $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $|x|=|y|=8$.

Step 3: The only way both conditions can be satisfied at the same time is if $|x|=|y|=8$. The points that satisfy this condition form a square with side length 16.

Step 4: The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

We apologize for the confusion and incorrect calculations in our initial attempt. The correct area of the convex polygon is indeed 256.

So the answer is $\boxed{256}$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:


This problem requires a careful analysis of the conditions given in the equation. We know that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From case 1, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length 10. The vertices of the square are $(0, 10)$, $(10, 0)$, $(0, -10)$, and $(-10, 0)$.

From case 2, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So we get another square with side length 16. The vertices of this square are $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The intersection of these two squares is a smaller square with side length 8 and vertices $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of this smaller square, which is $8^2 = 64$. The answer is: $64$

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We can see that the expression is zero if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

2. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

3. Solving these equations, we get the following vertices for the polygon: $(8,0)$, $(0,8)$, $(-8,0)$, $(0,-8)$, $(8,10)$, $(10,8)$, $(-8,-10)$, $(-10,-8)$, $(8,-10)$, $(10,-8)$, $(-8,10)$, and $(-10,8)$.

4. To find the area of the polygon, we can use the shoelace formula. The shoelace formula states that if the polygon vertices are $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), ..., (x_n, y_n)$ in order, then the area of the polygon is given by $\frac{1}{2} \vert (x_1y_2 + x_2y_3 + ... + x_ny_1) - (y_1x_2 + y_2x_3 + ... + y_nx_1) \vert$.

5. Applying the shoelace formula to our vertices, we get the area as $\boxed{512}$.
The answer is: $512$

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Step 1: Let's write down the equations:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$

The product of two factors equals zero if and only if one of the factors equals zero. Thus, we have two sets of equations:
$$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$$
$$(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$$

Step 2: Solving the equations in step 1:
The solutions of the first set of equations are:
$$x + y = \pm 10 \quad \text{and} \quad x - y = \pm 10$$
The solutions of the second set of equations are:
$$x = \pm 8 \quad \text{and} \quad y = \pm 8$$

Step 3: Plotting the solutions on a coordinate plane:
The solutions of the first set of equations are the lines $y = -x + 10$ and $y = x - 10$, and the lines $y = x + 10$ and $y = -x - 10$. The solutions of the second set of equations are the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$, and the lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$. These lines enclose a square with side length 20.

Step 4: Calculating the area of the square:
The area of the square is the side length squared, so the area is $20^2 = 400$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 400.

The answer is: $400$.
