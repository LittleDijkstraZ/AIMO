Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

The equation $AB=0$ is true if and only if $A=0$ or $B=0$. Therefore, the given equation is satisfied if either of the following two equations is satisfied:

1. $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$
2. $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$

For the first equation to be satisfied, we need both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. These four lines form a square with side length 20.

For the second equation to be satisfied, we need both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. These four lines form a square with side length 16.

Therefore, the points that satisfy the original equation are those that lie in the intersection of these two squares, which is a smaller square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

Here's a Python program to calculate the area:
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{256}$.
The answer is: $256$

 The equation given is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

For the product of two numbers to be zero, either one of them must be zero. This gives us two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

In the first case, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two lines in the plane, so they enclose a rectangle.

In the second case, either $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two circles in the plane, centered at the origin with radius 8.

The intersection of the rectangle and the square is the convex polygon that encloses the points that satisfy the given equation. The rectangle has side lengths of 20 units (since $|x+y| = 10$ and $|x-y| = 10$ implies $x+y = \pm 10$ and $x-y = \pm 10$), and the square has side lengths of 16 units (since $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$ implies $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$).

The area of the convex polygon is therefore the area of the rectangle minus the area of the square:
\[Area = (20)(20) - (16)(16) = 400 - 256 = 144.\]
The area of the convex polygon is 144 square units. The answer is: $144$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is $0$ if either of the two factors is $0$. So we have two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10 \Rightarrow x + y = \pm 10$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x - y \vert = 10 \Rightarrow x - y = \pm 10$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8 \Rightarrow x = \pm 8$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert y \vert = 8 \Rightarrow y = \pm 8$.

By solving these equations, we find that the vertices of the polygon are: $(8,8), (8,-8), (-8,8), (-8,-8)$.

Now, let's plot these points and find the area of the polygon:

[asy]
unitsize(1 cm);

pair A, B, C, D;

A = (8,8);
B = (8,-8);
C = (-8,-8);
D = (-8,8);

draw(A--B--C--D--cycle);

dot("$A(8,8)$", A, N);
dot("$B(8,-8)$", B, S);
dot("$C(-8,-8)$", C, S);
dot("$D(-8,8)$", D, N);
[/asy]

This is a square with side length $16$. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The equation given is equivalent to the product of two equations equaling zero:
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0\]
\[((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0\]

From the first equation, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.

From the second equation, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

The possible combinations of solutions are:
\[(x, y) = (8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8), (10, 0), (-10, 0), (0, 10), (0, -10), (-10, 0), (10, 0), (0, -10), (0, 10).\]

These points form a square with side length 16. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. So, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two expressions, which is equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero, or the second expression is zero. Let's consider each case:

1. If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

2. If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So we get the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(8,8)$, $(-8,8)$, $(-8,-8)$, and $(8,-8)$. The sides of this rectangle have lengths $16$ and $16$, so its area is $16 \times 16 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$
