Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ equals to zero if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$.
Similarly, the equations $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ imply $x - y = \pm 10$, $x = \pm 8$, and $y = \pm 8$, respectively.

Solving these equations, we find the vertices of the polygon: $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, $(-8,-8)$, $(10,0)$, $(0,10)$, $(-10,0)$, and $(0,-10)$.

The polygon is a square with side length 16. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

Here's a Python code to calculate the area:
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{256}$ square units.The answer is $\boxed{256}$.

 To solve this problem, we first need to understand the properties of the absolute value function and the equation given. The absolute value function $|x|$ is always non-negative and equals $x$ if $x \geq 0$ and $-x$ if $x < 0$. 

From the equation, we have two cases:
1. Either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. In other words, either $x + y = 10$ or $x - y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$ or $x - y = -10$. These are the equations of four lines in the coordinate plane.
2. Either $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. In other words, $x = 8$ or $x = -8$ or $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. These are the equations of four lines in the coordinate plane.

The intersection points of these lines form a square with side length 10, as shown below:

[asy]
unitsize(0.1 cm);
draw((-12,0)--(12,0),Arrow);
draw((0,-12)--(0,12),Arrow);
label("$x$",(12,0),S);
label("$y$",(0,12),E);
for (int i=-10; i<=10; ++i) {
draw((-12,i)--(12,i));
draw(i*dir(0)--(i*dir(180)));
}
draw((-10,-20)--(-10,20),red);
draw((10,-20)--(10,20),red);
draw((-20,-10)--(20,-10),red);
draw((-20,10)--(20,10),red);
draw((-8,-8)--(8,8),blue);
draw((8,-8)--(-8,8),blue);
draw((-8,8)--(8,-8),blue);
draw((8,8)--(-8,-8),blue);
label("$|x+y|=10$",(10,-22),red);
label("$|x-y|=10$",(-10,22),red);
label("$|x|=8$",(8,-10),blue);
label("$|y|=8$",(-10,8),blue);
[/asy]

The area of this square is $10 \times 10 = 100$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    side_length = 10
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The problem is asking for the area of a polygon formed by the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the given equation. The equation is a product of two terms, and it equals to zero if and only if at least one of the terms equals to zero. 

Let's analyze the terms separately:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which gives two lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which gives two lines $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x \vert = 8$, which gives two lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives two lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

These lines enclose a rectangle with vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$. The area of this rectangle is $16 \times 16 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256.
The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Step 1: Since we have a multiplication of two terms equal to zero, either term must be equal to zero for the whole expression to be zero. So, we have two equations:
\[(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0\]

Step 2: From these equations, we find that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us the system of equations:
\[x + y = \pm 10 \quad \text{and} \quad x - y = \pm 10\]

Step 3: Solving this system of equations, we find that the points satisfying these equations are $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, and $(-5,-5)$. These points are the vertices of a square.

Step 4: The side length of the square is $10$ (since the distance between $(5,5)$ and $(5,-5)$ is 10), so the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$.

Now, let's implement this in Python:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

def area_of_polygon():
    # Define the variables
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # Define the equations
    eq1 = Eq(abs(x + y) - 10, 0)
    eq2 = Eq(abs(x - y) - 10, 0)

    # Solve the equations
    solutions = solve((eq1, eq2), (x, y))

    # Calculate the side length of the square
    side_length = 20

    # Calculate the area of the square
    area = side_length**2

    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output

The area of the convex polygon is 100. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{100}$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The equation given is
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$
This equation is equal to zero if and only if either of the factors is zero. That is,
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad ((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$
The only way that the sum of two non-negative numbers can be zero is if both numbers are zero. Therefore, we have two cases:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad (\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad (\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
For the first case, $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$, and $x, y = \pm 8$. The possible combinations are:
$$(x, y) = (8, 2), (8, -2), (-8, 2), (-8, -2).$$
For the second case, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x - y = \pm 10$, and $x, y = \pm 8$. The possible combinations are:
$$(x, y) = (8, -2), (8, 2), (-8, -2), (-8, 2).$$
Therefore, the points are the same in both cases. These points form a square with side length $10$, centered at the origin. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    side_length = 10
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 100

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
100
```
The area of the convex polygon is 100 square units. The answer is: $100$
