Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ can be true only if both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This simplifies to $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0)$ and $(-10, 0)$.

Similarly, the expression $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ can only be true if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives the vertices $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8)$ and $(-8, -8)$.

Plotting these points, we see that they form a square with side length $20$. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.

So the area of the convex polygon is $400$. The answer is: $400$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We see that the equation is equal to zero if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

2. If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$.

3. If $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = \pm 10$.

4. If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$.

5. If $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = \pm 8$.

6. Now, we draw these lines on a graph and get a square with side length $16$.

7. To find the area of this square, we simply square the length of one side: $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the square is $256$. The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The equation given is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
For this equation to be true, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
If the first expression equals zero, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.
Solving these equations, we get four lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.
If the second expression equals zero, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
Again, we get four lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.
The eight lines intersect at the vertices of a square with side length 10.
The area of the square is $10^2 = 100$.
So, the area of the convex polygon is 100.
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    return 100

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

The area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, we need to consider the given equation:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$
This equation equals zero if and only if either of the two factors equals zero. So we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first case, we have:
- $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ which implies $x + y = \pm 10$.
- $\vert x \vert = 8$ which implies $x = \pm 8$.
- $\vert y \vert = 8$ which implies $y = \pm 8$.

Similarly, for the second case, we have:
- $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ which implies $x - y = \pm 10$.
- $\vert x \vert = 8$ which implies $x = \pm 8$.
- $\vert y \vert = 8$ which implies $y = \pm 8$.

The solutions from both cases form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. 

So the area of the convex polygon is 256.
The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. 

For the product of two terms to be zero, either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. So we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

For case 1, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8, \vert y \vert = 8$. This forms a square with side length 16.

For case 2, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8, \vert y \vert = 8$. This also forms a square with side length 16.

Therefore, the points satisfying the equation form two squares with side length 16. The area of each square is $16^2 = 256$, and since there are two squares, the total area is $2 * 256 = 512$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    # Side length of the square
    side_length = 16

    # Area of each square
    area_of_square = side_length ** 2

    # Total number of squares
    total_squares = 2

    # Total area of the polygon
    total_area = total_squares * area_of_square

    return total_area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 512

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
512
```
The area of the convex polygon is $512$ square units. The answer is: $512$.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either one of the expressions must be zero for the product to be zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$ or $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.

For the second case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x = 8$ or $x = -8$ or $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

The points $(x, y)$ that satisfy both cases are the intersections of these lines. These lines form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is $256$ square units. The answer is $\boxed{256}$.
