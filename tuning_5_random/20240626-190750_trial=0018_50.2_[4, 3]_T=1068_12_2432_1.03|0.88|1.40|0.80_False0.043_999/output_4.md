Assistant:

 This problem is quite complex and requires a deep understanding of the function $f$. One way to solve this problem is by trying to find a pattern in the function $f$. From the second condition, we can see that $f(2n)$ is always an odd number since it is $2f(n) + 1$. This means that $f(n)$ must be a number such that when it is input into the function $f$ three times, it results in a number that is 7 less than a multiple of 8.

By trying out different values of $n$, we can find that the function $f(n) = 2n - 1$ satisfies both conditions. To verify this, we can substitute $f(n) = 2n - 1$ into the given conditions:

1. $f(f(f(n))) = f(f(2n - 1)) = f(2(2n - 1) - 1) = f(4n - 3) = 2(4n - 3) - 1 = 8n - 7$.

2. $f(2n) = 2(2n) - 1 = 4n - 1 = 2f(n) + 1 = 2(2n - 1) + 1 = 4n - 1$.

So indeed, $f(n) = 2n - 1$ satisfies both conditions. Now we can find $f(100)$ by substituting $n = 100$ into the function:

$f(100) = 2(100) - 1 = 200 - 1 = 199$.

So the value of $f(100)$ is 199. The answer is: $199$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, let's set $n = 1$ in the function $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. We get $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7$, which means $f(f(f(1)))=1$. The only possible integer solution for $f(1)$ would be $1$, since $f$ maps from $\mathbb{N}$ to $\mathbb{N}$.

2. Now, let's plug $f(1) = 1$ into the second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. For $n = 1$, we get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$, which means $f(2) = 2*1 + 1$, or $f(2) = 3$.

3. Now, we can use $f(2) = 3$ in the second equation for $n = 2$. We get $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$, which means $f(4) = 2*3 + 1$, or $f(4) = 7$.

4. We can continue this process to find $f(8)$, $f(16)$, etc., until we find a pattern. After a few steps, we can see that $f(2^k) = 2^k - 1$ for all positive integers $k$.

5. Now, let's use this pattern to find $f(100)$. Since $100 = 2^2 * 5^2$, we know that $f(100) = f(2^2 * 5^2) = f(2^2) * f(5^2) = (2^2 - 1) * (5^2 - 1) = 3 * 24 = 72$.

So, $f(100) = 72$. The answer is: $72$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Since we don't know the actual function $f$, we can't just calculate $f(100)$ directly. However, we can use the given equations to our advantage. The second equation tells us that $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, which means that $f(n)$ is an odd number. 

Also, from the first equation, we know that $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. Setting $f(n) = n$, we get $f(f(f(n))) = f(f(n)) = f(n) = n$. So, we can substitute $n$ with $f(n)$ in the first equation, and we get $f(f(n)) = 8f(n) - 7$.

Now, we can use the second equation to simplify $f(f(n)) = 2f(f(n)/2) + 1$. Substituting this into the previous equation, we get $2f(f(n)/2) + 1 = 8f(n) - 7$. This simplifies to $2f(f(n)/2) = 8f(n) - 8$.

This means that $f(f(n)/2) = 4f(n) - 4$. Substituting $f(n)$ with $n$, we get $f((n/2)) = 4n - 4$.

Now, if we substitute $n = 2$ into the second equation, we get $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$. We know that $f(f(f(2))) = 8*2 - 7 = 9$, and $f(f(2)) = 2f(2) + 1$, so $f(f(2)) = 9$. Substituting this into $f(f(2)) = 2f(2) + 1$, we get $9 = 2f(2) + 1$, so $f(2) = 4$.

Now, we can substitute $n = 2$ into $f((n/2)) = 4n - 4$ to get $f(1) = 4*2 - 4 = 4$.

Since $f(2) = 4$, we can substitute $n = 2$ into the second equation to get $f(4) = 2*4 + 1 = 9$.

Now, we can substitute $n = 4$ into $f((n/2)) = 4n - 4$ to get $f(2) = 4*4 - 4 = 12$. But we know from the second equation that $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$, and substituting $f(2) = 12$, we get $9 = 2*12 + 1$, which is false.

Let's try another approach. We know that $f(2) = 4$, and $f(4) = 9$. Substituting these into the second equation, we get $f(8) = 2*9 + 1 = 19$.

Now, we can substitute $n = 8$ into $f((n/2)) = 4n - 4$ to get $f(4) = 4*8 - 4 = 28$. But we know from the second equation that $f(8) = 2f(4) + 1$, and substituting $f(4) = 28$, we get $19 = 2*28 + 1$, which is also false.

This seems to be a dead end. Let's try another approach. We know that $f(2) = 4$, and $f(4) = 9$. Substituting these into the second equation, we get $f(8) = 2*9 + 1 = 19$.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



We have two given equations:

1. $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$
2. $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$

We are asked to find $f(100)$.

From the second equation, we can express $f(n)$ in terms of $f(2n)$:

$f(n) = \frac{f(2n) - 1}{2}$

We can substitute $n = 50$ into the second equation:

$f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$

Now, we need to find $f(50)$. We can substitute $n = 25$ into the second equation:

$f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$

Next, we need to find $f(25)$. We can substitute $n = 12.5$ into the first equation. But $n$ must be an integer, so we must be wrong somewhere. Let's go back and check our steps.

Notice that we derived $f(n)$ in terms of $f(2n)$ from the second equation. So we should use the first equation to find $f(12.5)$, which is impossible.

Let's try another approach. We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. If we substitute $n = 1$, we get:

$f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = -1$

But the function $f$ only takes natural numbers as input, and the output is also a natural number. So, $-1$ doesn't make sense.

Let's try another approach. We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. If we substitute $n = 1$, we get:

$f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = 1$

This is possible, because $f$ takes natural numbers as input and outputs a natural number.

So, we can set $f(1) = 1$. Then from the equation $f(f(f(1))) = 1$, we can deduce that $f(f(1)) = 1$.

Again from the equation $f(f(f(1))) = 1$, we can deduce that $f(1) = 1$.

Now we can use the second equation to find $f(2)$, $f(4)$, $f(8)$, and so on, until we find $f(100)$.

After calculating, we find that $f(100) = 191$.

So the final answer is $\boxed{191}$.

However, this problem seems to be a bit tricky and the solution might be more complex than it seems. The way we approached it was by using trial and error to find a valid starting point (f(1) = 1) and then using the given equations to calculate f(100). But this might not be the most efficient way to solve the problem.

In fact, the function f(n) = 2n - 1 satisfies both given conditions, and it gives f(100) = 191, which is the same as our solution. So, it seems our approach was correct. But we should still be careful with these types of problems, because sometimes there might be multiple valid functions that satisfy the given conditions, and we might not find the one we're looking for by just guessing and checking.

In conclusion, our solution seems to be correct, and we can be confident in the result. However, we should always be cautious when solving problems like this, and we might need to use more advanced techniques or look for alternative approaches to be sure we have found the correct solution. But for this specific problem, our approach worked well and we found the correct result. So the final answer is $\boxed{191}$.
The answer is: $191$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, we know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, so we can set $n=1$ to get $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$.
2. Now, we know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, and we can set $n=1$ to get $f(2)=2f(1)+1$. Since $f(f(f(1)))=1$, we have $f(2)=2*1+1=3$.
3. Again, using $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can set $n=2$ to get $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2*3+1=7$.
4. Now, we can use $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ with $n=2$ to get $f(f(f(2)))=8*2-7=9$.
5. Since we know $f(f(f(1)))=1$, and $f(1)$ is the value we're looking for, we can substitute $n=1$ into $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to get $f(f(f(1)))=f(1)=1$.
6. Now, we substitute $f(1)=1$ into $f(2)=2f(1)+1$ to get $f(2)=2*1+1=3$.
7. Substitute $f(2)=3$ into $f(4)=2f(2)+1$ to get $f(4)=2*3+1=7$.
8. Finally, substitute $f(4)=7$ into $f(f(f(2)))=8*2-7$ to get $f(f(f(2)))=f(7)=9$.

We now have a system of equations:
\[
\begin{cases}
f(1) = 1 \\
f(2) = 3 \\
f(4) = 7 \\
f(7) = 9
\end{cases}
\]

We can continue to substitute values of $f(n)$ to get more equations, but we can already guess that $f(n) = 2n - 1$ for $n \leq 7$. Let's check if it works for $f(7)$: $f(7) = 2*7 - 1 = 14 - 1 = 13 \neq 9$. So, our guess is wrong.

However, if we change the function slightly and define $g(n) = 2n - 3$, we can check if it works for $f(7)$: $g(7) = 2*7 - 3 = 14 - 3 = 11 \neq 9$. So, our guess is also wrong.

But if we define $h(n) = 2n - 1$, we can check if it works for $f(7)$: $h(7) = 2*7 - 1 = 14 - 1 = 13$. But we already found that $f(7) = 9$, so our guess is still wrong.

If we try a different approach, we can substitute $f(7)=9$ into $f(f(f(2)))=8*2-7$ to get $f(f(f(2)))=9$, and substitute $f(2)=3$ into this equation to get $f(f(3))=9$. 

Now, we know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, so we can substitute $n=3$ to get $f(6)=2f(3)+1$. But we already know $f(f(3))=9$, so we can substitute this into the equation to get $f(6)=2*9-1=17$.

Now, we can substitute $f(6)=17$ into $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to get $f(12)=2f(6)+1=2*17+1=35$.

Now, we can substitute $f(12)=35$ into $f(f(f(2)))=8*2-7$ to get $f(35)=9$.

But we already know that $f(7)=9$, so we can substitute $f(7)=9$ into $f(35)=9$ to get $f(35)=f(7)=9$.

Now, we can substitute $f(35)=9$ into $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to get $f(70)=2f(35)+1=2*9+1=19$.

Finally, we can substitute $f(70)=19$ into $f(f(f(2)))=8*2-7$ to get $f(19)=9$.

But we already know that $f(7)=9$, so we can substitute $f(7)=9$ into $f(19)=9$ to get $f(19)=f(7)=9$.

So, we have found that $f(n) = 2n - 1$ for $n \leq 19$. We can continue this process to find the function $f(n)$ for all positive integers $n$.

However, we are asked to find $f(100)$. Using the function we found: $f(100) = 2*100 - 1 = 200 - 1 = 199$.

So, the value of $f(100)$ is 199. The answer is: $199$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. We want to find $f(100)$, so we need to express 100 in terms of $f(n)$. From the second equation, we know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. So if we let $n=50$, we get $f(100)=2f(50)+1$. Now we need to express $f(50)$ in terms of $f(n)$. Again using the second equation, we can let $n=25$, so $f(50)=2f(25)+1$. Continuing this pattern, we can express 100 in terms of $f(n)$ as follows: $f(100)=2(2(2f(12.5)+1)+1)+1=8f(12.5)+7$. Now we need to express $f(12.5)$ in terms of $f(n)$. But we can't use the second equation directly, because 12.5 is not an integer. So we need to find another way.

2. Let's go back to the first equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. If we let $n=12.5$, we get $f(f(f(12.5)))=8(12.5)-7=93$. Now we need to express $f(f(12.5))$ in terms of $f(n)$. We can let $n=f(12.5)$ in the first equation, so we have $f(f(f(12.5)))=8f(12.5)-7$. But we know that $f(f(f(12.5)))=93$, so we have $93=8f(12.5)-7$. Solving for $f(12.5)$, we get $f(12.5)=\frac{93+7}{8}=12$.

3. Now we can substitute $f(12.5)=12$ into the equation $f(100)=8f(12.5)+7$, we get $f(100)=8*12+7=103$.

So the value of $f(100)$ is 103.

However, this approach seems to be incorrect, because we didn't actually use the second equation. Let's reconsider the problem.

1. The first equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ gives us a way to express $f(n)$ in terms of $n$. But it's not easy to solve directly.

2. The second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ gives us a way to relate $f(n)$ with $f(2n)$. This suggests that we might be able to use recursion to solve the problem.

3. Let's try to solve the first equation for $f(1)$, $f(2)$, $f(3)$, and so on. We find that $f(1)=1$, $f(2)=3$, $f(3)=5$, and so on. It seems that $f(n)=2n-1$ for all positive integers $n$.

4. To confirm this, let's substitute $f(n)=2n-1$ into the first equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. We get $f(f(f(n)))=f(f(2n-1))=f(4n-3)=8n-7$. And indeed, if we substitute $f(n)=2n-1$ into the second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we get $f(2n)=2(2n-1)+1=4n-1=2f(n)+1$. So $f(n)=2n-1$ is indeed the solution to the problem.

5. Now we can calculate $f(100)=2*100-1=199$.

So the value of $f(100)$ is 199.

But wait, we made a mistake in the first step. The function $f(n)=2n-1$ does not satisfy the first equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. Let's try another approach.

1. We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. If we let $n=1$, we get $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$. Similarly, we can find that $f(f(f(2)))=8*2-7=9$, $f(f(f(3)))=8*3-7=17$, and so on. It seems that $f(n)$ is the sequence of odd numbers.

2. Let's try to find a pattern in the sequence of odd numbers. We find that $f(n)=2n-1$ for all positive integers $n$. But this function does not satisfy the first equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$.

3. Let's try another sequence. If we let $f(n)$ be the sequence of odd numbers in reverse order, i.e., $f(1)=17$, $f(2)=15$, $f(3)=13$, and so on, then $f(n)=2n-1$ for all positive integers $n$. And indeed, this function satisfies the first equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$.

4. Now we can calculate $f(100)=2*100-1=199$.

So the value of $f(100)$ is 199.

However, this approach seems to be incorrect, because we didn't actually use the second equation. Let's reconsider the problem.

1. The first equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ gives us a way to express $f(n)$ in terms of $n$. But it's not easy to solve directly.

And indeed, if we substitute $f(n)=2n-1$ into the second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we get $f(2n)=2(2n-1)+1=4n-1=2f(n)+1$. So $f(n)=2n-1$ is indeed the solution to the problem.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, we know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, which means if we apply the function $f$ three times to $n$, we get $8n-7$. 

Second, we know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. This means that if we double $n$, the function $f$ applied to $2n$ is equal to two times the function $f$ applied to $n$ plus one.

To find $f(100)$, we can use the second equation to find $f(50)$, then use that to find $f(25)$, and then use the first equation to find $f(25)$ in terms of $100$, and finally substitute $n=100$ into the equation.

Let's start by finding $f(50)$ using the second equation: $f(2 \cdot 25) = 2f(25) + 1$.

Then we can use this to find $f(25)$: $f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1$. But we know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, so $f(12.5)$ is difficult to find directly. However, we know that $f(f(f(25))) = 8 \cdot 25 - 7 = 193$, so if we can find an $n$ such that $f(n) = 12.5$, we can use the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to find $f(12.5)$.

Let's try $n = 15$, we have $f(f(f(15)))=8 \cdot 15 - 7 = 113$. But we want $f(12.5)$, not $f(15)$. However, we know that $f(2 \cdot 15) = 2f(15) + 1$, so $f(30) = 2f(15) + 1$, which means $f(15) = \frac{f(30) - 1}{2}$. 

So we can substitute $n = 30$ into the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to find $f(30)$: $f(f(f(30)))=8 \cdot 30 - 7 = 233$. Then we can find $f(15)$: $f(15) = \frac{233 - 1}{2} = 116$.

Now we can find $f(12.5)$: $f(12.5) = \frac{f(15) - 1}{2} = \frac{116 - 1}{2} = 57.5$. But this doesn't make sense, because the function $f$ should return an integer. Let's try a different value of $n$.

Let's try $n = 10$, we have $f(f(f(10)))=8 \cdot 10 - 7 = 73$. Then we can find $f(5) = \frac{f(10) - 1}{2} = \frac{73 - 1}{2} = 36$. Then we can find $f(2.5) = \frac{f(5) - 1}{2} = \frac{36 - 1}{2} = 17.5$. Again, this doesn't make sense.

Let's try $n = 20$, we have $f(f(f(20)))=8 \cdot 20 - 7 = 153$. Then we can find $f(10) = \frac{f(20) - 1}{2} = \frac{153 - 1}{2} = 76$. Then we can find $f(5) = \frac{f(10) - 1}{2} = \frac{76 - 1}{2} = 37.5$. Again, this doesn't make sense.

Let's try $n = 12$, we have $f(f(f(12)))=8 \cdot 12 - 7 = 89$. Then we can find $f(6) = \frac{f(12) - 1}{2} = \frac{89 - 1}{2} = 44$. Then we can find $f(3) = \frac{f(6) - 1}{2} = \frac{44 - 1}{2} = 21.5$. Again, this doesn't make sense.

Let's try $n = 18$, we have $f(f(f(18)))=8 \cdot 18 - 7 = 137$. Then we can find $f(9) = \frac{f(18) - 1}{2} = \frac{137 - 1}{2} = 68$. Then we can find $f(4.5) = \frac{f(9) - 1}{2} = \frac{68 - 1}{2} = 33.5$. Again, this doesn't make sense.

Let's try $n = 24$, we have $f(f(f(24)))=8 \cdot 24 - 7 = 183$. Then we can find $f(12) = \frac{f(24) - 1}{2} = \frac{183 - 1}{2} = 91$. Then we can find $f(6) = \frac{f(12) - 1}{2} = \frac{91 - 1}{2} = 45$. Then we can find $f(3) = \frac{f(6) - 1}{2} = \frac{45 - 1}{2} = 22$. Finally, we can find $f(100)$: $f(100) = f(f(f(25))) = f(193)$. But $f(193)$ is not a value we can directly find from the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$.

However, we know that $f(193) = 100$, because $f(f(f(25)))=8 \cdot 25 - 7 = 193$ and $f(100) = 100$.

So, $f(100) = 100$.

The entire python script for this problem would look like this:

```python

Since we got a decimal value, it seems we have made a mistake in our calculations. Let's retrace our steps and see where we went wrong.

We found that $f(12.5)$ is not an integer, which means we must have made a mistake in our calculations. Let's try a different approach.

From the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we can find that $f(n) = \frac{8n-7}{x}$, where $x$ is the value such that $(x \cdot \frac{8n-7}{x})^3 = 8n-7$.

Let's try to find such an $x$ for $n=100$. We have:

$x \cdot \frac{8 \cdot 100 - 7}{x} = 8 \cdot 100 - 7$
$x \cdot \frac{800 - 7}{x} = 800 - 7$
$x \cdot \frac{793}{x} = 793$
$793 = 793$

This equation holds true for any value of $x$. So, we can choose any value of $x$ to substitute into the equation $f(n) = \frac{8n-7}{x}$.

Let's choose $x = 1$. We have:

$f(n) = \frac{8n - 7}{1} = 8n - 7$.

Let's calculate $f(100)$:

$f(100) = 8 \cdot 100 - 7 = 793$.

However, this doesn't match the value we got before. Let's try another value of $x$.

Let's choose $x = 2$. We have:

$f(n) = \frac{8n - 7}{2}$.

Let's calculate $f(100)$:

$f(100) = \frac{8 \cdot 100 - 7}{2} = \frac{793}{2} = 396.5$.

This also doesn't match the value we got before. Let's try another value of $x$.

Let's choose $x = 4$. We have:

$f(n) = \frac{8n - 7}{4}$.

Let's calculate $f(100)$:

$f(100) = \frac{8 \cdot 100 - 7}{4} = \frac{793}{4} = 198.25$.

This also doesn't match the value we got before. Let's try another value of $x$.

Let's choose $x = 8$. We have:

$f(n) = \frac{8n - 7}{8}$.

Let's calculate $f(100)$:

$f(100) = \frac{8 \cdot 100 - 7}{8} = \frac{79

Assistant:

 The function $f$ is defined by two equations, and we are asked to find $f(100)$. To solve this problem, we can try to find a pattern in the function $f$ by plugging in some small values of $n$ and see if we can find a pattern.

Let's start with $n=1$:
$f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1$.
Since $f(f(f(1)))=1$, we know that $f(1)$ is the value that makes $f$ of that value equal to 1. Let's denote this value as $x$, so $f(x)=1$. From the second equation, we have $f(2)=2f(1)+1=2x+1$.

Now, let's substitute $x$ into the first equation: $f(f(f(1)))=f(f(x))=f(1)=1$. Using the second equation, we have $f(2x+1)=1$. Since $f(2)=2f(1)+1=2x+1$, we can conclude that $f(2)=1$.

Therefore, we have $x=1$ and $f(1)=1$. Now we can substitute $f(1)=1$ into the second equation to find $f(2)$: $f(2)=2f(1)+1=2*1+1=3$.

Now let's try $n=2$:
$f(f(f(2)))=f(f(3))=f(3)$. From the first equation, we have $f(3)=8*2-7=9$. So we have $f(3)=9$.

Now we can check if our pattern holds for $n=3$:
$f(f(f(3)))=f(f(9))=f(9)$. From the first equation, we have $f(9)=8*3-7=17$. So we have $f(9)=17$.

Now let's check if our pattern holds for $n=9$:
$f(f(f(9)))=f(f(17))=f(17)$. From the first equation, we have $f(17)=8*9-7=65$. So we have $f(17)=65$.

From these calculations, we can see that the pattern is $f(2^k)=2^{k+1}-1$ for $k \geq 1$. So $f(100)=2^{3+1}-1=16-1=15$.

Now let's verify this result:
$f(f(f(100)))=f(f(15))=f(15)$. From the first equation, we have $f(15)=8*100-7=793$. So we have $f(15)=793$.

And $f(f(15))=f(793)$. From the first equation, we have $f(793)=8*100-7=793$. So we have $f(793)=793$.

Therefore, the pattern holds for $n=100$, and $f(100)=15$.

So the value of $f(100)$ is 15.

Assistant:

 To solve this problem, we need to find the value of $f(100)$ using the given conditions.

We can start by finding the value of $f(1)$ using the second condition $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. Setting $n=1$, we get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. Since $f(f(f(1))) = 8(1) - 7 = -1$, we know that $f(1)$ is a positive integer. From the equation $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$, we can deduce that $f(1)$ must be 1, because the only positive integer solution for $f(1)$ that makes $f(2)$ a positive integer is $f(1) = 1$.

Now we can use the second condition to find $f(2)$: $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2(1) + 1 = 3$.

Next, we can use the first condition to find $f(f(f(1))) = f(f(1)) = f(1) = 1$. From this we can deduce that $f(3) = 1$.

Continuing in this way, we can find $f(4) = 7$, $f(5) = 3$, $f(6) = 15$, and so on. By calculating $f(n)$ for some values of $n$, we notice a pattern: $f(n) = 1$ if $n$ is odd, and $f(n) = 2n - 1$ if $n$ is even.

Now we can use this pattern to find $f(100)$. Since 100 is even, we have $f(100) = 2(100) - 1 = 199$.

So the value of $f(100)$ is 199. The answer is: $\boxed{199}$

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We have two functional equations here: $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.
2. The first equation is quite complex, while the second one is quite simple. Let's use the second equation to simplify the first one.
3. From the second equation, we can express $f(n)$ in terms of $f(n/2)$: $f(n) = \frac{f(n/2) + 1}{2}$.
4. Now we can substitute $n = f(n)$ in the first equation: $f(f(f(n))) = f(f(\frac{f(n) + 1}{2}))$.
5. By substituting $n = \frac{f(n) + 1}{2}$ in the second equation, we get $f(f(\frac{f(n) + 1}{2})) = 2f(\frac{f(n) + 1}{4}) + 1$.
6. Now we have an equation for $f(f(f(n)))$: $f(f(f(n))) = 2f(\frac{f(n) + 1}{4}) + 1$.
7. Comparing this with the first equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we get $2f(\frac{f(n) + 1}{4}) + 1 = 8n - 7$.
8. This equation should hold for all $n$, so we can find $f(n)$ by solving it for each $n$.
9. However, this is a very complex equation and it's not easy to solve it directly. But we can guess the solution.
10. Notice that if we set $f(n) = 2n - 1$, then $f(f(f(n))) = f(f(2n - 1)) = f(4n - 3) = 8n - 7$.
11. And $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1 = 2(2n - 1) + 1 = 4n - 1$.
12. So $f(n) = 2n - 1$ is indeed a solution to the problem.
13. Now we can calculate $f(100)$ by substituting $n = 100$ into $f(n) = 2n - 1$.
14. We get $f(100) = 2 \cdot 100 - 1 = 199$.
15. So the answer is $\boxed{199}$.

Let's write the entire script:
