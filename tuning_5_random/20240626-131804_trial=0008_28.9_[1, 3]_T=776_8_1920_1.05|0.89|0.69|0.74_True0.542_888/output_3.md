Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two terms, each of which is a square of a difference. If the product of two numbers is zero, then at least one of the numbers must be zero. Therefore, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

Each of these equations implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$. These equations represent 4 lines in the coordinate plane.

The lines $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ form a square with side length 10. The lines $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ form a square with side length 16.

The area of the convex polygon enclosed by these lines is the sum of the areas of the two squares, which is $10^2 + 8^2 = 100 + 64 = 164$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 164 square units. The answer is: $164$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, let's understand the problem. The equation is given as:

$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$

This equation is equal to zero if either of the two factors is equal to zero. This gives us two sets of equations:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From the first set of equations, we get the points $(8,8)$, $(-8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

From the second set of equations, we get the points $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

So the points that satisfy the equation are the vertices of a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

The first term is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, and the second term is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$.

For the first term to be zero, both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)$ must be zero, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This results in a square with side length 10.

For the second term to be zero, both $(\vert x \vert - 8)$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)$ must be zero, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This results in a square with side length 16.

The convex polygon formed by the intersection of these two squares is also a square, and its side length is the minimum of the side lengths of the two squares, which is 10.

The area of this square is side length squared, which is $10^2 = 100$. So the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units.

The python code to compute the area of the polygon is very simple:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    side_length = min(10, 16)
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 100

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
100
```
The area of the convex polygon is 100 square units. The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The condition $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $x = y = \pm 10$.
3. If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $x = y = \pm 8$.
4. Thus, the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the original condition are either $(10, 10)$, $(-10, -10)$, $(10, -10)$, $(-10, 10)$, $(8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, $(8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$.
5. Plotting these points on the coordinate plane, we find that they form a square with side length $20$.
6. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 400. The answer is: $400$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The given equation is $0$ only when both factors are $0$, i.e., $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

2. Solving these equations, we get:
   - For the first pair of equations, $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us four lines in the coordinate plane: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.
   - For the second pair of equations, $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us four lines in the coordinate plane: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

3. The intersection points of these lines form a square with side length $10$. 

4. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $100$. The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Step 1: Solving the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$

This equation equals to 0 if and only if at least one of the factors equals to 0. Therefore, we have two cases:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
This equation implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of a square with side length 10.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
This equation implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of a square with side length 16.

Step 2: Find the area of the convex polygon

The convex polygon is the union of two squares. The first square has side length 10 and area $10^2 = 100$, the second square has side length 16 and area $16^2 = 256$. The area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares, which is $100 + 256 = 356$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 356. However, it seems the problem asks for the numerical area, not the algebraic expression. Let's calculate the numerical area.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def calculate_area():
    # The area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares
    area = 10**2 + 16**2
    return area

result = calculate_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 356

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
356
```
The area of the convex polygon is $356$. The answer is $\boxed{356}$.
