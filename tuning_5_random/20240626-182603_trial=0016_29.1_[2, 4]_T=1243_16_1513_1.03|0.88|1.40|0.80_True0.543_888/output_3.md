Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The given expression equals zero if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

These conditions are equivalent to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The solutions to these conditions are as follows:

1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ give the lines $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.

2. $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ give the lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

The points that satisfy these conditions form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

Here is the python code to calculate the area:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so one or both of the expressions must be zero for the equation to hold. That means we need to find the solution sets for each of the following:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From these, we get the following system of equations:
1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$
2. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$
3. $\vert x \vert = 8$
4. $\vert y \vert = 8$

From 3 and 4, we have $x = 8$ or $x = -8$, and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

From 1, when $x = 8$, we get $\vert y \vert = 2$, so $y = 2$ or $y = -2$.
When $x = -8$, we get $\vert y \vert = 2$, so $y = 2$ or $y = -2$.

From 2, when $y = 8$, we get $\vert x \vert = 2$, so $x = 2$ or $x = -2$.
When $y = -8$, we get $\vert x \vert = 2$, so $x = 2$ or $x = -2$.

So the vertices of the polygon are $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$.
This forms a square with side length 16. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We are given the equation $ ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
2. This equation equals to zero if either of the two expressions equals to zero.
3. Therefore, we have two cases:
   a. $ ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$
   b. $ ((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$
4. For case (a) to be true, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us four lines in the coordinate plane: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.
5. For case (b) to be true, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us four lines in the coordinate plane: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.
6. The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 10 (the distance between the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$ or $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$).
7. The area of this square is the side length squared, which is $10^2 = 100$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

 The equation given is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. Let's analyze each term separately:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

The solutions to these equations give us the vertices of the polygon. By analyzing all possible combinations, we find that the polygon is a square with side length 16 (the maximum distance between two points satisfying the conditions). The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side, so the area of the polygon is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

The given equation is equal to zero, which means that either of the factors must be zero. If either of the factors is zero, it means that at least one of the terms inside the absolute value must be zero. This translates to the following system of equations:

1. $|x+y| - 10 = 0 \Rightarrow |x+y| = 10 \Rightarrow x+y = \pm 10$
2. $|x-y| - 10 = 0 \Rightarrow |x-y| = 10 \Rightarrow x-y = \pm 10$
3. $|x| - 8 = 0 \Rightarrow |x| = 8 \Rightarrow x = \pm 8$
4. $|y| - 8 = 0 \Rightarrow |y| = 8 \Rightarrow y = \pm 8$

From equations 1 and 2, we get the following four lines:
- $x + y = 10$
- $x + y = -10$
- $x - y = 10$
- $x - y = -10$

From equations 3 and 4, we get the following four lines:
- $x = 8$
- $x = -8$
- $y = 8$
- $y = -8$

The eight lines intersect at the following points:
- $(8, 2)$
- $(-8, 2)$
- $(8, -2)$
- $(-8, -2)$
- $(2, 8)$
- $(2, -8)$
- $(-2, 8)$
- $(-2, -8)$

These points form a square with side length of 8 units. The area of the square is side length squared, so the area of the polygon is $8^2 = 64$. The answer is: $64$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, we see that the product of two terms is zero if and only if at least one of them is zero. So, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. For $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. This gives us two lines: $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.
3. For $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us two lines: $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.
4. For $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$. This gives us two lines: $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.
5. For $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us two lines: $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

These lines form a rectangle with side lengths 16 and 20, so the area of the rectangle is $16 \times 20 = 320$. The answer is: $320$

The equation is $0$ if and only if at least one of the two factors is $0$.
For the first factor, we have $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x-y| - 10 = 0$, which implies $|x+y| = 10$ or $|x-y| = 10$. This gives us a rectangle with sides of length $20$ and $20$, so its area is $400$.
For the second factor, we have $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$, which implies $|x| = 8$ or $|y| = 8$. This gives us a square with side length $16$, so its area is $256$.
To find the area of the convex polygon, we take the minimum of the areas of the two rectangles, which is $400$. The answer is: $400$
