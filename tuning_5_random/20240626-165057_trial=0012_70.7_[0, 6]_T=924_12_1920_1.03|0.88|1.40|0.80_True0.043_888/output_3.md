Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The condition of the problem is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second one is zero.

2. Let's denote the first expression as $A = ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$ and the second one as $B = ((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. We have $A \cdot B = 0$, so either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$.

3. If $A = 0$, then $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This is possible only when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These equations describe a square with side length 10.

4. If $B = 0$, then $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This is possible only when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These equations describe a square with side length 16.

5. The convex polygon is the union of these two squares. Therefore, its area is the sum of the areas of these two squares.

6. The area of a square is the square of its side length. So the area of the first square is $10^2 = 100$, and the area of the second square is $16^2 = 256$.

7. Adding these two areas together gives the total area of the convex polygon: $100 + 256 = 356$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 356. The answer is: $356$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, notice that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to the union of the following two sets of points:

1. $\left(x, y\right)$ such that $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $\left(x, y\right)$ such that $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. This is the equation of a square with side length 20 and centered at the origin.

From $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This is the equation of a square with side length 20 and also centered at the origin.

From $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert x \vert = 8$. This is the equation of a square with side length 16 and centered at the origin.

From $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert y \vert = 8$. This is the equation of a square with side length 16 and also centered at the origin.

The intersection of the squares from the first set of points is a square with side length 10, and the intersection of the squares from the second set of points is also a square with side length 8.

Therefore, the convex polygon enclosed by the points is a square with side length 8. Its area is $8^2 = 64$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 64.
The answer is: $64$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. Therefore, either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

For the first term to be zero, either $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x - y| - 10 = 0$. This means $|x+y| = 10$ or $|x - y| = 10$. The solutions to these equations are all the points on the lines $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.

For the second term to be zero, either $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$. This means $|x| = 8$ or $|y| = 8$. The solutions to these equations are all the points on the lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(\pm 8, \pm 8)$, and sides parallel to the coordinate axes. The length and width of the rectangle are both 16 units, so the area of the rectangle is $16 \times 16 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units.

```python

def area_of_polygon():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    length = 16
    width = 16
    area = length * width
    return area

result = area_of_polygon()

The area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{256}$ square units. The answer is: $256$.

 To solve this problem, we need to understand that the expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ will be true if and only if either $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$ or $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

If $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$, then both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

If $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$, then both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So we get four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The four lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$ form a rectangle with vertices at $(8, 2)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(8, -2)$, and $(-8, 2)$. The four lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$ form a square with side length 16.

The area of the rectangle is $(16)(20) = 320$ and the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $320 + 256 = 576$. The answer is: $576$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, notice that the product of two terms is zero if and only if at least one of the terms is zero. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to the system of equations:
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0,\]
\[((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]
2. Each of the above equations is only satisfied when the absolute value expressions are zero, i.e.,
\[\vert x + y \vert = 10,\]
\[\vert x - y \vert = 10,\]
\[\vert x \vert = 8,\]
\[\vert y \vert = 8.\]
3. The solutions to $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ are simply $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.
4. The solutions to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ can be found by considering all possible combinations of signs for $x$ and $y$. This gives us a total of 16 solutions.
5. To find the area of the convex polygon, we can simply plot these points on a coordinate plane and observe the shape. The points form a square with side length 16.
6. The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side, so the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units.
The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation given is a product of two terms equals to zero, which means that at least one of the terms should be zero. Thus, we have two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x - y \vert = 10$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert y \vert = 8$.

From cases 3 and 4, we have $-8 \leq x, y \leq 8$. 

From cases 1 and 2, we have $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. 

Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the polygon:

$(8, 2), (8, -2), (-8, 2), (-8, -2), (2, 8), (-2, 8), (2, -8), (-2, -8)$.

Now, let's plot these points in a coordinate plane to visualize the polygon:

[asy]
unitsize(0.5 cm);

pair A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H;

A = (8,2); B = (8,-2); C = (-8,2); D = (-8,-2);
E = (2,8); F = (-2,8); G = (2,-8); H = (-2,-8);

draw(A--B--C--D--cycle);
draw(E--F--G--H--cycle);

dot("$A(8,2)$", A, N);
dot("$B(8,-2)$", B, S);
dot("$C(-8,2)$", C, N);
dot("$D(-8,-2)$", D, S);
dot("$E(2,8)$", E, E);
dot("$F(-2,8)$", F, E);
dot("$G(2,-8)$", G, W);
dot("$H(-2,-8)$", H, W);
[/asy]

The polygon is a square with side length 16. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import *

def polygon_area():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    # The side length of the square
    side_length = 16

    # The area of the square
    area = side_length**2

    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

The area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$
