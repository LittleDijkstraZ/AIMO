Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



If the product of two numbers equals zero, one of them has to be zero. Thus, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. The square of a number is zero only if the number itself is zero. Hence, we find the four conditions for the points which satisfy the problem:
1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$
2. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$
3. $\vert x \vert = 8$
4. $\vert y \vert = 8$

In order to find out what these conditions represent, consider the following:
1. and 2. describe the set of points at a distance of 10 from the line x=0 or y=0, which are the sides of a square.
3. and 4. describe the set of points at a distance of 8 from the origin. This is a circle with radius 8.
The polygon is the intersection of the square and the circle which is a 8 by 8 square. Thus, the area of the polygon is $8^2 = 64$ square units.

Now, we need to write the python program to calculate the area.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    # The polygon is a square with side length 8
    side_length = 8
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 64

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
64
```
The area of the polygon is 64 square units. The answer is: $64$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ equals zero if and only if either of the two factors is zero. This means that the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equation must satisfy either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This is only possible when $x = 5$ and $y = 5$, or $x = -5$ and $y = -5$.

The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This is only possible when $x = 8$ or $x = -8$, and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

So, the points that satisfy the equation are $(5, 5)$, $(-5, -5)$, $(8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(5, -5)$, and $(-5, 5)$. These eight points form a square with side length $10$, so the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So we can rewrite the equation as:
\[(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0\] or 
\[(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0.\]

From the first equation we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x = y$ and $x = -y$. From the second equation we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $x = 8$ or $x = -8$ and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. Therefore, the points that satisfy the equation are
\[(8,8), (8,-8), (-8,8), (-8,-8).\]

The points form a square with side length $16$, so the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $256$. The Python code to calculate the area of the square is:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def square_area():
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = square_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{256}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, let's observe the problem. The product of two factors is zero if and only if one or both of the factors are zero. So, we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \text{ or } (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This means $\vert x + y \vert = 10 \text{ or } \vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two lines in the plane.

2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \text{ or } (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This means $\vert x \vert = 8 \text{ or } \vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two more lines in the plane.

The intersection of these lines forms a rectangle with side lengths of 16 and 20 (since $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ gives $x + y = \pm 10$, so the rectangle has a height of 20 and a width of 16). The area of this rectangle is $16 \times 20 = 320$. So, the area of the convex polygon is 320.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solve, Abs

def area_of_polygon():
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # The points that satisfy the equation form a rectangle with side lengths of 16 and 20
    width = 16
    height = 20

    # Calculate the area of the rectangle
    area = width * height

    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 320

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
320
```
The area of the convex polygon is 320.
The answer is: $320$.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, we need to notice that the expression will be zero only if any of the terms in the multiplication is zero. That means either:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0) \text{ or } ((\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0) \text{ or } ((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0) \text{ or } ((\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0).$$

From this we can see that the absolute value expressions need to be equal to zero for each term to be zero. That means:
$$\vert x + y \vert = 10, \vert x - y \vert = 10, \vert x \vert = 8, \vert y \vert = 8.$$

The absolute value expressions can be zero only when the expressions inside them are zero:
$$x + y = \pm 10, x - y = \pm 10, x = \pm 8, y = \pm 8.$$

Solving these equations we get the vertices of the polygon:
$$\text{Vertices} = \{(8,0),(0,8),(8,-8),(0,-8),(-8,8),(8,8),(-8,0),(-8,-8),(0,8),(8,0)\}.$$

Now we need to plot these points and determine the shape of the polygon. By plotting these points, we see that they form a square with side length $16$. The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the polygon is $256$.

The answer is: $256$

Assistant:

 The problem is asking for the area of a polygon formed by the set of points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the given equation. The equation is of the form $A \cdot B = 0$, which implies that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Let's analyze the two cases separately.

1. For $A = 0$, we have $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us the equation for a square with side length 20.

2. For $B = 0$, we have $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us a square with side length 16.

The intersection of these two sets of points is the square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So the area of the convex polygon is 256.

Here's a python code to calculate the area of the polygon:
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    side_length_square1 = 20
    side_length_square2 = 16
    area_square1 = side_length_square1 ** 2
    area_square2 = side_length_square2 ** 2
    return area_square2

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$
