Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either of the terms must be zero. That is, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The first term being zero means that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$.

The second term being zero means that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the same vertices of the polygon.

So the polygon is a square with side length 16. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$.

This problem involves the use of absolute value function, which makes it complex to solve algebraically. However, we can simplify the problem by considering the conditions under which the product of two expressions can be zero.

The product of two expressions is zero if and only if at least one of the expressions is zero. Therefore, the given equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is true if and only if either:

1. $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$, or
2. $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

For the first case, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two lines in the plane, forming a rectangle.

For the second case, either $(\vert x \vert - 8) = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8) = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two lines in the plane, forming a square.

The intersection of the two rectangles and squares forms a smaller square inside the larger square. The side length of the smaller square is 10, as it is determined by the conditions $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ when $x = y = 5$. The area of a square is given by the square of its side length, so the area of the convex polygon is $10^2 = 100$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100.
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    side_length = 10
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 100

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
100
```
The area of the convex polygon is $100$ square units. The answer is: $100$.

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, which means that either of the expressions must be zero for the equation to hold. So we have two cases to consider:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10 \Rightarrow x + y = \pm 10$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x - y \vert = 10 \Rightarrow x - y = \pm 10$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8 \Rightarrow x = \pm 8$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert y \vert = 8 \Rightarrow y = \pm 8$.

From cases 1 and 2, we have the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. From cases 3 and 4, we have the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length 10. The area of the square is $10 \times 10 = 100$. So the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units.

Here's a Python function that calculates the area of the square:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_square():
    side_length = 10
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = area_of_square()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 100

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
100
```
The area of the convex polygon is $100$ square units.
The answer is $\boxed{100}$.
