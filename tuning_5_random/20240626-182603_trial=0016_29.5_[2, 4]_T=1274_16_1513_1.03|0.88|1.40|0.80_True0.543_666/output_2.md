Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, we need to understand the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. This function is a piecewise function that we can solve separately in different intervals. Let's solve it step by step:

1. For $x<1$, the equation becomes $\vert -(x-1) - 2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\vert -x + 1 - 2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert -x - 1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$. Then, it becomes $\vert x + 1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$. This equation has two solutions for $x$ in the interval $x<1$: $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

2. For $1 \leq x < 3$, the equation becomes $\vert x - 1 - 2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert x - 3 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$. This equation has two solutions for $x$ in the interval $1 \leq x < 3$: $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = 1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

3. For $x \geq 3$, the equation becomes $\vert x - 1 - 2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert x - 3 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$. This equation has two solutions for $x$ in the interval $x \geq 3$: $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = 1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

So, the total number of solutions is 4 when the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ is between 1 and 2 (exclusive), which means $\frac{m}{100}$ is in the interval $(1, 2)$. So we have $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Multiplying all sides of the inequalities by 100, we get $100 < m < 200$. Thus, the number of positive integer values of $m$ that satisfy this inequality is $200 - 100 - 1 = 99$.

Now, let's write the Python code to print the result:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def count_m():
    return 200 - 100 - 1

result = count_m()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 99

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
99
```
The number of positive integer values of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $99$. So, the answer is $\boxed{99}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. Let's denote the four solutions as $x_1$, $x_2$, $x_3$, and $x_4$.
2. We know that $| |x-1|-2|$ can take values of $0$, $m/100$, or $2m/100$ at $x=x_1$, $x_2$, $x_3$, and $x_4$, respectively.
3. We can start by solving the equation $| |x-1|-2|=0$, which gives us $|x-1|=2$, so $x=1\pm2$, so $x_1=-1$ and $x_2=3$.
4. Next, we solve the equation $| |x-1|-2|=m/100$, which gives us two equations: $|x-1|-2=m/100$ and $|x-1|-2=-m/100$.
5. The first equation leads to $|x-1|=2+m/100$, and the second equation leads to $|x-1|=2-m/100$.
6. Solving these equations gives us four solutions: $x_3=1+2+m/100=3+m/100$ and $x_4=1+2-m/100=3-m/100$ from the first equation, and $x_5=1+2-m/100=3-m/100$ and $x_6=1+2+m/100=3+m/100$ from the second equation.
7. However, we only consider the distinct solutions, so we ignore $x_5$ and $x_6$.
8. Now, we need to make sure that $x_3$, $x_4$ are distinct from $x_1$ and $x_2$. This gives us the conditions: $3+m/100 \neq -1$ and $3-m/100 \neq 3$.
9. Solving these conditions gives us $m \neq -100$ and $m \neq 0$.
10. Similarly, we can consider the equation $| |x-1|-2|=2m/100$, but this will lead to the same solutions.
11. Now, we need to count the number of positive integer values of $m$ that satisfy the conditions.

Let's write the code to find the solution:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def find_m():
    count = 0
    for m in range(1, 101):  # considering m from 1 to 100
        if m != 0 and m != 100:
            count += 1
    return count

result = find_m()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 99

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
99
```
The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $99$. Therefore, the value of $m$ for which the equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $99$. The answer is: $99$

 To solve this problem, we first need to understand the graph of the function $f(x) = ||x-1|-2|$. The function has a V-shape with two "humps" on the x-axis at $x = 1 \pm 2$, which are at $x = -1$ and $x = 3$. The distance between the humps is 2 units. The function $f(x)$ is equal to $\frac{m}{100}$ for 4 distinct values of $x$ if the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ falls strictly between the two humps. Therefore, we need to find the value of $m$ such that $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 1 and 3. This gives us the inequality $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 3$, which simplifies to $100 < m < 300$. The number of positive integers $m$ in this range is $300 - 100 - 1 = 199$. Therefore, there are 199 values of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions.

We can use Python to verify this answer:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def number_of_m():
    """
    Calculate the number of positive integers m for which the equation
    ||x-1|-2| = m/100 has 4 distinct solutions.
    Returns: the number of positive integers m.
    """
    lower_bound = 100
    upper_bound = 300
    m_values = list(range(lower_bound + 1, upper_bound))  # Exclude the bounds
    return len(m_values)

number_of_solutions = number_of_m()
print(number_of_solutions)
```

CODE RESULTS 199

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
199
```
The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $| |x-1|-2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 199. Therefore, the answer is $199$.
The answer is: $199$

 To solve this problem, we need to analyze the equation and determine for how many positive integers m the equation has 4 distinct solutions.

The equation is $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. The number of solutions depends on the value of $\frac{m}{100}$.

The expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, can be either positive or negative. We can consider two cases:

1. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 \geq 0$: In this case, we have $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$. Solving for $x$ gives us two equations: $x-1 -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $-(x-1) -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplify to $x-3 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $-x+1 -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, respectively. These further simplify to $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = 1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

2. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0$: In this case, we have $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = \frac{m}{100}$. Solving for $x$ gives us two equations: $-(x-1) +2 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $-(-(x-1)) +2 = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplify to $-x+1 +2 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $x-1 +2 = \frac{m}{100}$, respectively. These further simplify to $-x+3 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $x+1 = \frac{m}{100}$.

Now, we need to find the number of distinct solutions for each case. For the first case, we have two solutions: $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = 1 - \frac{m}{100}$. For the second case, we have two solutions: $x = -3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = 1 + \frac{m}{100}$. So in total, we have four solutions.

Now we need to find for how many positive integers m these solutions are distinct. This happens when $1 - \frac{m}{100} \neq 3 + \frac{m}{100}$, $-3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq 1 + \frac{m}{100}$, $-3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 + \frac{m}{100}$, and $1 + \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Simplifying these inequalities gives $m \neq 150$, $m \neq 100$, $m \neq 50$, and $m \neq 0$. The only positive integer that satisfies all these conditions is m = 50.

Therefore, there is only one positive integer m for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions, and the answer is $m = 50$. The answer is: $\boxed{50}$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, we note that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 1$. This is because the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, takes on a maximum value of 2 and a minimum value of 0. For it to take on 4 distinct values, the right hand side must equal to $\frac{1}{2}$ of the distance between these two values. Therefore, we must have $\frac{m}{100} = 1$.

Solving this equation gives $m = 100$. 

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the given condition is 1. The answer is: $1$
