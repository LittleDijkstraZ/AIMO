Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either one of the terms is zero or both are zero. 

For the first term, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, this is only possible when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives the vertices of the square as $(5, 5), (5, -5), (-5, -5), (-5, 5)$.

For the second term, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, this is only possible when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives the vertices of the square as $(8, 0), (0, 8), (-8, 0), (0, -8)$.

The two squares share the vertices $(0, 0)$ and $(8, 8)$, and $(8, -8)$. The area of the convex polygon is the union of the two squares, which is a larger square with side length $10$. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. 

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    # The side length of the larger square
    side_length = 10

    # The area of the square
    area = side_length ** 2

    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 100

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output

The area of the convex polygon is $100$. The answer is: $100$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if both of its factors are equal to zero. The first factor is zero if and only if either $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, and the second factor is zero if and only if either $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.
The solutions to $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ are $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$, and the solutions to $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$ are $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
The solutions to $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ are $x = 8$ or $x = -8$, and the solutions to $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$ are $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.
So the points that satisfy the equation are the intersections of the lines $x + y = 10, x + y = -10, x - y = 10, x - y = -10, x = 8, x = -8, y = 8, y = -8$.
The lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$ are parallel, as are the lines $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$. The lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$ are vertical lines, and the lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$ are horizontal lines.
The intersections of these lines form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100.
The answer is: $100$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



We have the equation $f(x, y) = 0$, where $f(x, y) = ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$.

From the equation, we see that $f(x, y) = 0$ if and only if either $g(x, y) = (\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $h(x, y) = (\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From $g(x, y) = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of a square with side length $20$.

From $h(x, y) = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of a square with side length $16$.

The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for. It's a square with side length $8$ (the smaller square from $h(x, y) = 0$). The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$.

So the area of the convex polygon is $64$.

The answer is: $64$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The expression equals 0 if either of the two factors equals 0. So, we have two cases:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
This case implies that both $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This only happens when $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$. This gives us a square with side length 20, and thus area $400$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
This case implies that both $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This only happens when $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us a square with side length 16, and thus area $256$.

However, the intersection of these two cases is the origin (0, 0), which is not included in either square. Thus, the area of the convex polygon formed by the union of these two squares is the sum of their areas minus the area of the intersection. The intersection is a single point (0, 0), which has area 0. So, the area of the convex polygon is $400 + 256 = 656$.

The answer is: $656$

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. This expression is zero if and only if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) = 0$. This means that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only way this can happen is if $x = y = 5$ or $x = -y = -5$.

The second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. This expression is zero if and only if both $(\vert x \vert - 8) = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8) = 0$. This means that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The only way this can happen is if $x = 8$ or $x = -8$, and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

So the points that satisfy the equation are the vertices of a square with side length 10, centered at the origin. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation given is a product of two terms equals to zero, which means that at least one of the terms should be zero. Thus, we have two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x - y \vert = 10$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert y \vert = 8$.

From cases 3 and 4, we have $-8 \leq x, y \leq 8$. 

From cases 1 and 2, we have $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. 

Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the polygon:

$(8, 2), (8, -2), (-8, 2), (-8, -2), (2, 8), (-2, 8), (2, -8), (-2, -8)$.

Now, let's plot these points in a coordinate plane to visualize the polygon:

[asy]
unitsize(0.5 cm);

pair A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H;

A = (8,2); B = (8,-2); C = (-8,2); D = (-8,-2);
E = (2,8); F = (-2,8); G = (2,-8); H = (-2,-8);

draw(A--B--C--D--cycle);
draw(E--F--G--H--cycle);

dot("$A(8,2)$", A, N);
dot("$B(8,-2)$", B, S);
dot("$C(-8,2)$", C, N);
dot("$D(-8,-2)$", D, S);
dot("$E(2,8)$", E, E);
dot("$F(-2,8)$", F, E);
dot("$G(2,-8)$", G, W);
dot("$H(-2,-8)$", H, W);
[/asy]

The polygon is a square with side length 16. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import *

def polygon_area():

    # The side length of the square
    side_length = 16

    # The area of the square
    area = side_length**2

 The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. 

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. This expression will be zero if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only possible solutions to these equations are $x = 0, y = \pm10$ and $x = \pm10, y = 0$. These points form a square with side length 10 units.

The second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. This expression will be zero if both $(\vert x \vert - 8) = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8) = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The only possible solutions to these equations are $x = \pm8, y = 0$ and $x = 0, y = \pm8$. These points form a square with side length 16 units.

Therefore, the points that satisfy the given equation are the points that lie on the square with side length 10 units. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$ square units.

```python

    # Side length of the square
