Assistant:

 The given equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.
We know that $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ can be either 0, 1, 2 or 3.
So we need to find the values of $m$ for which $\frac{m}{100}$ equals these values.
Setting $\frac{m}{100} = 0$, we get $m = 0$.
Setting $\frac{m}{100} = 1$, we get $m = 100$.
Setting $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, we get $m = 200$.
Setting $\frac{m}{100} = 3$, we get $m = 300$.
So the possible values of $m$ are $0$, $100$, $200$, and $300$.
However, the problem asks for positive integers $m$, so we discard $m = 0$.
Therefore, there are 3 positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions.
The answer is: $3$

 The equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $2$. This means that $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which is equivalent to $100 < m < 200$. Since $m$ is a positive integer, the number of possible values for $m$ is $200-100-1=99$. So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is $99$.

The answer is: $\boxed{99}$

 To solve this problem, we first need to understand the behavior of the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. The function $f(x)$ is a piecewise linear function with four linear segments. The graph of $f(x)$ is a V-shape with the vertex at $x=1$. The value of the function decreases from 2 to 0 as $x$ increases from 1 to 3, and then increases from 0 back to 2 as $x$ increases from 3 to 5.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if the value $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to the vertical distance between the graph of $f(x)$ and the $x$-axis, which is 2. Therefore, we have $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, which gives $m = 200$.

So, the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is $m = 200$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ is 1. The answer is: $1$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, let's define a function that finds the number of positive integers m such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

2. We will use the sympy library's `solve` function to find the roots of the equation.

3. The equation has 4 distinct solutions when the right-hand side of the equation is in the range $(0, 2)$. So we need to find the number of integer values of m for which $\frac{m}{100}$ is in this range.

4. This is equivalent to finding the number of integers m in the range $(0, 200)$ such that $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$.

5. Multiplying through by 100, we find that we need to count the number of integers m in the range $(0, 200)$ such that $0 < m < 200$.

6. This is simply $200 - 0 - 1 = 199$.

Let's write the code for this:

```python

def count_integers():
    return 200 - 1

result = count_integers()
print(result)
```

The number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is $199$. However, we must remember that the value of $m$ must be less than $200$ for the equation to have 4 distinct solutions. So the only value that satisfies this condition is $m = 100$. The value of $m$ should be an integer, not an algebraic expression, so let's calculate the number of integers in the range $(0, 200)$ that satisfy $0 < m < 200$.

```python

def count_integers():

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. Firstly, we know that a piecewise function can be used to simplify the absolute value function. So we can split the function into two cases: when $(x - 1) - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$ and when $-(x - 1) - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$. This will give us two equations:
   - $(x - 1) - 2 = \frac{m}{100} \Rightarrow x - 3 = \frac{m}{100} \Rightarrow x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$.
   - $-(x - 1) - 2 = \frac{m}{100} \Rightarrow -x + 1 - 2 = \frac{m}{100} \Rightarrow -x = \frac{m}{100} + 1 \Rightarrow x = -\frac{m}{100} - 1$.

2. Then we substitute $x$ into the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ and simplify it to get:
   - For the first equation, $\vert \vert \frac{m}{100} + 3 - 1 \vert - 2 \vert = \frac{m}{100} \Rightarrow \vert \vert \frac{m}{100} + 2 \vert - 2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$.
   - For the second equation, $\vert \vert -\frac{m}{100} - 1 - 1 \vert - 2 \vert = \frac{m}{100} \Rightarrow \vert \vert -\frac{m}{100} - 2 \vert - 2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$.

3. Notice that $\vert \frac{m}{100} + 2 \vert - 2$ will always be greater than or equal to 0, so we can simplify it to $\frac{m}{100} + 2 - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$. The second equation $\vert -\frac{m}{100} - 2 \vert - 2$ is always less than 0, so it's not possible to have 4 distinct solutions.

4. Therefore, we only need to consider the first equation $\vert \frac{m}{100} + 2 \vert - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$. This equation simplifies to $\frac{m}{100} + 2 - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$, which is obviously true.

5. So the original equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} + 2 - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$ is true. This means that the value of $m$ should be such that the equation $\frac{m}{100} = \frac{m}{100}$ is true. This is only possible when $m = 0$, but $m$ must be a positive integer, so we discard this case.

6. The only other possibility is that $m = 100$. Then the equation becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{100}{100}$, which simplifies to $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = 1$. This equation has 4 distinct solutions, as shown below:

7. Solving the equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 1$, we get $\vert x-1 \vert = 3$. This further simplifies to two cases: $x - 1 = 3$ and $x - 1 = -3$. Solving these gives us the solutions $x = 4$ and $x = -2$.

8. Solving the equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -1$, we get $\vert x-1 \vert = 1$. This further simplifies to two cases: $x - 1 = 1$ and $x - 1 = -1$. Solving these gives us the solutions $x = 2$ and $x = 0$.

So, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when $m = 100$.

So the positive integer $m$ is 100. The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, we need to understand that the equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ will have 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}=1$.
2. If we set $\frac{m}{100}=1$, we can solve for $m$ by multiplying both sides by 100 to get $m=100$.
3. Therefore, we can substitute $m=100$ back into the equation to check if it has 4 distinct solutions.
4. If we do this, we get $| |x-1|-2|=1$.
5. This equation can be solved by considering two cases:
   a. When $|x-1|-2=1$, we have $|x-1|=3$.
   b. When $|x-1|-2=-1$, we have $|x-1|=1$.
6. The solutions to $|x-1|=3$ are $x=4$ and $x=-2$.
7. The solutions to $|x-1|=1$ are $x=2$ and $x=0$.
8. Therefore, when $m=100$, the equation has 4 distinct solutions: $x=0, 2, 4$.

So, there is only one positive integer $m$ that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions, and that is $m=100$. The answer is: $1$

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. We want to find the value of $m$.

We can start by analyzing the number of solutions the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has based on the value of $\frac{m}{100}$.

The expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is always between 0 and 4, so $\frac{m}{100}$ must be in this range for the equation to have 4 distinct solutions. Therefore, $0 \leq \frac{m}{100} \leq 4$.

This implies that $0 \leq m \leq 400$. The possible values of $m$ are thus the integers from 0 to 400 inclusive.

To find the value of $m$ that gives 4 distinct solutions, we can iterate through all possible values of $m$ and count the number of distinct solutions for each $m$.

The script to do this in Python is:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solve, Eq

def count_solutions(m):
    x = symbols('x')
    equation = Eq(abs(abs(x - 1) - 2), m / 100)

    return len(set(solutions))

m_values = list(range(0, 401))
solution_counts = [count_solutions(m) for m in m_values]

m_value = [m for m in m_values if solution_counts[m_values.index(m)] == 4][0]

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. We want to find the value of $m$.

We can start by analyzing the number of solutions the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has based on the value of $\frac{m}{100}$.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, let's recall the definition of absolute value, that is $\vert x \vert = \begin{cases} 
x & \text{if } x \geq 0 \\
-x & \text{if } x < 0 
\end{cases}$. So, we have four cases to consider:

   - If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 > 0$, then we have $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \vert x-1 \vert -2$.
   - If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 0$, then we have $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \vert x-1 \vert -2$.
   - If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0$, then we have $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = 2 - \vert x-1 \vert$.

2. Let's consider each case separately:

   - If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 > 0$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \vert x-1 \vert -2$. The equation becomes $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$. Solving this equation will give us two more solutions than the original equation. So, we have a total of four distinct solutions if and only if this equation has two distinct solutions.
   
   - If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 0$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = 0$. The equation becomes $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$. This equation has two distinct solutions, but they are not what we want.
   
   - If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = 2 - \vert x-1 \vert$. The equation becomes $2 - \vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$. Solving this equation will give us no new solutions.

3. From step 2, we know that the equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ should have two distinct solutions. This equation can be rewritten as $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.

4. This equation has two distinct solutions if and only if $2 + \frac{m}{100} > 2$, which gives $\frac{m}{100} > 0$, or $m > 0$. And $2 + \frac{m}{100} > 0$, which gives $m < 200$. Therefore, $0 < m < 200$.

5. Also, $2 + \frac{m}{100} - (1 - 2) = \frac{m}{100} \neq 0$, which gives $m \neq 0$. So, we have $0 < m < 200$ and $m \neq 0$.

6. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy these conditions are the integers from 1 to 199. So, there are 199 such integers.

However, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly 4 distinct solutions. From step 2, we know that the equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ should have exactly two distinct solutions. This equation can be rewritten as $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.

7. This equation has two distinct solutions if and only if $2 + \frac{m}{100} > 2$, which gives $\frac{m}{100} > 0$, or $m > 0$. And $2 + \frac{m}{100} > 0$, which gives $m < 200$. Therefore, $0 < m < 200$.

8. Also, $2 + \frac{m}{100} - (1 - 2) = \frac{m}{100} \neq 0$, which gives $m \neq 0$. So, we have $0 < m < 200$ and $m \neq 0$.

9. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy these conditions are the integers from 1 to 199. But we need the equation to have exactly 4 distinct solutions. This happens when the equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ has exactly two solutions and the equation $2 - \vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$ has no new solutions. This happens when $\frac{m}{100

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, we notice that the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, should be a nonnegative number. This implies that $m$ should be a non-negative integer. Also, the left side of the equation, $| |x - 1| - 2 |$, should be a nonnegative number. This implies that $|x - 1| - 2 = k$, where $k$ is a nonnegative integer. We can solve this equation and obtain four different solutions if and only if $k = \frac{m}{100}$ takes on the values $0$, $1$, $2$, and $3$.

Now, we can solve this problem in Python:

We can see that the output contains both positive and negative values. However, the problem only asks for positive integers. So we need to filter out the negative values.

Let's modify the code to only return the positive integer solutions:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

def find_m():
    m = symbols('m')
    # The values of k
    k_values = [0, 1, 2, 3]
    # The corresponding values of m
    m_values = []
    for k in k_values:
        equation = Eq(abs(abs(1) - 2) - k, m/100)
        solutions = solve(equation, m)
        for sol in solutions:
            if sol > 0:
                m_values.append(sol)
    return m_values

result = find_m()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS [100]

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
[100]
```
The solution above tells us that there is only one value of $m$ that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions. But what is the value of $m$?

To find this, we can simply look at the code:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

def find_m():
    m = symbols('m')
    # The values of k
    k_values = [0, 1, 2, 3]
    # The corresponding values of m
    m_values = []
    for k in k_values:
        equation = Eq(abs(abs(1) - 2) - k, m/100)
        solutions = solve(equation, m)
        for sol in solutions:
            if sol > 0:
                m_values.append(sol)
    return m_values

result = find_m()
print(result[0])
``````output

CODE RESULTS 100

INTERMEDIATE OUT :

```

So, the value of $m$ that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions is 100. The answer is: $\boxed{100}$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. The number of solutions for this equation depends on the value of $m$. For example, when $m=0$, there is only one solution $x=1$. When $m=200$, there are three solutions. And when $m=400$, there are four solutions. So we need to find the value of $m$ such that the equation has four distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be rewritten as two separate equations: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.

For each of these equations, we need to solve for $x$ and count the number of distinct solutions. We can then increase the value of $m$ and repeat the process until we find the value of $m$ that results in four distinct solutions.

This can be done using Python and the sympy library, as follows:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Abs, solveset, S

def find_m():
    x, m = symbols('x m')
    equation1 = Abs(Abs(x - 1) - 2) - m/100
    equation2 = Abs(Abs(x - 1) - 2) + m/100

    # Create a set to store the solutions for each value of m
    solutions_set = set()

    for i in range(1001):
        solutions1 = solveset(equation1.subs(m, i), x, domain=S.Reals)
        solutions2 = solveset(equation2.subs(m, i), x, domain=S.Reals)

        # Combine the solutions from both equations
        solutions = solutions1.union(solutions2)

        # Count the number of distinct solutions
        num_solutions = len(solutions)

        # If the number of solutions is 4, add the value of m to the set
        if num_solutions == 4:
            solutions_set.add(i)

    return solutions_set

result = find_m()

Since the output is an empty set, there must be a mistake in the code. Let's go back and check the logic.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be rewritten as two separate equations: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.

For each of these equations, we need to solve for $x$ and count the number of distinct solutions. We can then increase the value of $m$ and repeat the process until we find the value of $m$ that results in four distinct solutions.

This can be done using Python and the sympy library, as follows:

    # Create a set to store the solutions for each value of m
    solutions_set = set()

    for i in range(1001):
        solutions1 = solveset(equation1.subs(m, i), x, domain=S.Reals)
        solutions2 = solveset(equation2.subs(m, i), x, domain=S.Reals)

        # Combine the solutions from both equations
        solutions = solutions1.union(solutions2)

        # Count the number of distinct solutions
        num_solutions = len(solutions)

        # If the number of solutions is 4, add the value of m to the set
        if num_solutions == 4:

It seems like there's an issue with the `solveset` function. Let's try another approach using a loop to check each value of $m$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The function $|\vert x - 1 \vert - 2|$ has a graph that is a V-shape with the points of the V at $x = 1 \pm 2$. This means that the equation $|\vert x - 1 \vert - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions exactly when $\frac{m}{100}$ is the distance from the top of one of the V's to the x-axis, or in other words, when $\frac{m}{100} = 2$.

So we have $m = 200$.

So the final answer is $\boxed{200}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. To have four distinct solutions, $m$ must be in the interval $(200/3, 200]$.
2. We need to find how many integers fall into this interval.
3. To do this, we can use the `ceiling` function to find the smallest integer greater than $200/3$, and the `floor` function to find the largest integer less than or equal to $200$.
4. Then we can find the number of integers in this interval by subtracting the smaller integer from the larger one and adding 1.

Now, let's do the calculations:

```python

from sympy import symbols, ceiling, floor

def count_positive_integers():

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, and we want to find how many positive integer values of $m$ will result in 4 distinct solutions to the equation.

Let's set $\frac{m}{100} = k$ for simplicity, then our equation becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=k$.

Now, let's think about the piecewise nature of the absolute value. There will be three cases to consider:

1. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 > 0$, then we have $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = k$, which simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = k+2$. This results in two equations: $x-1 = k+2$ and $x-1 = -(k+2)$.

2. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 0$, then we have $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$, which results in two equations: $x-1 = 2$ and $x-1 = -2$.

3. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0$, then we have $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -k$, which simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = 2-k$. This results in two equations: $x-1 = 2-k$ and $x-1 = -(2-k)$.

Now, we need to find the number of solutions for each value of $k$. Let's analyze each case:

1. If $k > 2$, then both $x-1 = k+2$ and $x-1 = -(k+2)$ will have two solutions. So, we have 4 distinct solutions in this case.

2. If $k = 2$, then $x-1 = 2$ has one solution and $x-1 = -2$ has another. So, we have 2 distinct solutions in this case.

3. If $0 < k < 2$, then both $x-1 = 2-k$ and $x-1 = -(2-k)$ will have two solutions. So, we have 4 distinct solutions in this case.

4. If $k = 0$, then $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$ has two solutions. So, we have 2 distinct solutions in this case.

5. If $k < 0$, then $\vert x-1 \vert = 2-k$ will have two solutions. So, we have 2 distinct solutions in this case.

From the analysis above, we can see that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=k$ will have 4 distinct solutions when $k > 2$ or $0 < k < 2$. In other words, $k$ can be any value in the open interval $(0, 2) \cup (2, +\infty)$. However, since $k = \frac{m}{100}$, $m$ must be a positive integer. The largest integer in the interval $(0, 2)$ is 1, and the smallest integer in the interval $(2, +\infty)$ is 3. Therefore, the only positive integers $m$ that will result in 4 distinct solutions to the equation are 1, 3. So, there are 2 such values of $m$. The answer is: $2$.
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import *

def count_solutions():
    m = symbols('m')
    # Count the number of solutions for m=1 and m=3
    num_solutions_1 = count_roots(Abs(Abs(symbols('x')-1)-2) - 1/100, domain=S.Reals)
    num_solutions_3 = count_roots(Abs(Abs(symbols('x')-1)-2) - 3/100, domain=S.Reals)

    return num_solutions_1, num_solutions_3

num_solutions_1, num_solutions_3 = count_solutions()
print(num_solutions_1, num_solutions_3)
```

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The problem asks for how many positive integers $m$ the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

We know that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can have at most $4$ distinct solutions because the absolute value function $\vert x \vert$ can take on two values for a given $x$, and the equation has two absolute value functions. Therefore, the maximum number of solutions is $2 \times 2 = 4$.

We also know that for the equation to have exactly $4$ distinct solutions, the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be such that it splits the absolute value function into two separate cases that each have two distinct solutions.

To have exactly $4$ distinct solutions, the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ splits into two separate cases that each have two distinct solutions. This means that the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be chosen carefully to create the desired effect.

After analyzing the problem and thinking about the possible values of $m$ that would result in exactly $4$ distinct solutions, we find that $m=200$ is the only value that would result in the desired outcome.

Therefore, the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $m=200$. The answer is: 1

Assistant:

 The given equation is $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, and we want to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that this equation has 4 distinct solutions.

The absolute value function makes the equation piecewise, so we need to consider different cases for the value of $x$. We can split the equation into three cases based on the value of $x$:

1. When $x < 1$, the equation becomes $\vert -(x-1) - 2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\vert -x + 1 - 2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert -x - 1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$.
2. When $1 \leq x \leq 3$, the equation becomes $\vert x - 1 - 2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert x - 3 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$.
3. When $x > 3$, the equation becomes $\vert x - 1 - 2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert x - 3 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$.

For each of these cases, we need to solve the equation $\vert x - 3 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$ for $x$, and count the number of solutions that are distinct and positive.

After solving the equations and counting the solutions, we find that the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 1.
The answer is: $1$

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is a positive number less than 2.
This means $\frac{m}{100} \in (0, 2)$.
Multiplying both sides by 100 gives $m \in (0, 200)$.
The number of positive integers $m$ in this interval is $200 - 1 = 199$.
Therefore, there are 199 positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions.
The value of $m$ is 199. The answer is: $199$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, we know that the equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.
2. We know that $| |x - 1| - 2 |$ can only be 0 when $|x - 1| - 2 = 0$, i.e., $|x - 1| = 2$. That means $x - 1 = \pm 2$, so $x = 1 \pm 2$. Therefore, the solutions are $x = 3$ and $x = -1$.
3. To make $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be the distance between these two solutions, which is 4. So, we have $\frac{m}{100} = 4$, from which we get $m = 400$.

The answer is: $1$
