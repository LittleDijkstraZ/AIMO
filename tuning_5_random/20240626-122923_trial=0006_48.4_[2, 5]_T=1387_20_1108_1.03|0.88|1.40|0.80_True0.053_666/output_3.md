Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The expression is equal to zero if and only if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, or both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The first set of conditions implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
The second set of conditions implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
From $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, we have $x + y = \pm 10$ or $x + y = 0$.
From $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, we have $x - y = \pm 10$ or $x - y = 0$.
From $\vert x \vert = 8$, we have $x = \pm 8$.
From $\vert y \vert = 8$, we have $y = \pm 8$.
By considering all possible combinations of these conditions, we find that the points that satisfy the conditions are:
$(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(2, 8)$, $(-2, 8)$, $(2, -8)$, and $(-2, -8)$.
These points form a square with side length 16.
The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The condition for the product to be zero is that at least one of the factors is zero. So we have two sets of equations:

1. $|x + y| - 10 = 0 \Rightarrow |x + y| = 10$
2. $|x - y| - 10 = 0 \Rightarrow |x - y| = 10$
3. $|x| - 8 = 0 \Rightarrow |x| = 8$
4. $|y| - 8 = 0 \Rightarrow |y| = 8$

From equations (3) and (4), we get the four lines $x = 8, x = -8, y = 8, y = -8$.

From equation (1), we get the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$. From equation (2), we get the lines $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.

Plotting these lines, we find that they form a square with side length 16. Therefore, the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. So the answer is $\boxed{256}$.

Here is the entire script:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solve, Abs, simplify

def area_of_polygon():
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # define the equations
    eq1 = Abs(x + y) - 10
    eq2 = Abs(x - y) - 10
    eq3 = Abs(x) - 8
    eq4 = Abs(y) - 8

    # solve the equations
    solutions1 = solve(eq1, y)
    solutions2 = solve(eq2, y)
    solutions3 = solve(eq3, x)
    solutions4 = solve(eq4, y)

    # plot the lines and find the vertices of the polygon
    vertices = []
    for sol1 in solutions1:
        for sol2 in solutions2:
            vertices.append((sol1, sol2))

    for sol3 in solutions3:
        for sol4 in solutions4:
            vertices.append((sol3, sol4))

    # calculate the side length of the square
    side_length = 2 * max(abs(v[0] - v[1]) for v in vertices)

    # calculate the area of the square
    area = side_length**2

    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 To solve this problem, we need to understand the given equation and the constraints it imposes on $x$ and $y$.

The equation is:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$

This equation is true if either of the two terms is zero:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From these, we get the following constraints:
1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$
2. $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$

These constraints define a square with side length $16$. The vertices of the square are:
$(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, $(-8,-8)$.

To find the area of the square, we simply square the length of one of its sides. The side length is $16$, so the area is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so one or both of the expressions must be zero for the equation to hold. That means we need to find the solution sets for each of the following:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From these, we get the following system of equations:
1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$
2. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$
3. $\vert x \vert = 8$
4. $\vert y \vert = 8$

From 3 and 4, we have $x = 8$ or $x = -8$, and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

From 1, when $x = 8$, we get $\vert y \vert = 2$, so $y = 2$ or $y = -2$.
When $x = -8$, we get $\vert y \vert = 2$, so $y = 2$ or $y = -2$.

From 2, when $y = 8$, we get $\vert x \vert = 2$, so $x = 2$ or $x = -2$.
When $y = -8$, we get $\vert x \vert = 2$, so $x = 2$ or $x = -2$.

So the vertices of the polygon are $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$.
This forms a square with side length 16. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, we notice that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to the following system of equations:

$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$$
$$((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$

For the first equation, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

For the second equation, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

From $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, we have $x + y = \pm 10$. From $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, we have $x - y = \pm 10$. From $\vert x \vert = 8$, we have $x = \pm 8$. From $\vert y \vert = 8$, we have $y = \pm 8$.

Combining all these equations, we get the following system of equations:

1. $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$. Solving this system gives $x = 10$, $y = 0$.
2. $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$. Solving this system gives $x = 0$, $y = 10$.
3. $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$. Solving this system gives $x = 0$, $y = -10$.
4. $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$. Solving this system gives $x = -10$, $y = 0$.
5. $x - y = 10$ and $x = 8$. Solving this system gives $x = 8$, $y = -2$.
6. $x - y = 10$ and $y = 8$. Solving this system gives $x = 18$, $y = 8$.
7. $x - y = -10$ and $x = 8$. Solving this system gives $x = 8$, $y = 18$.
8. $x - y = -10$ and $y = 8$. Solving this system gives $x = -2$, $y = 8$.

So the vertices of the polygon are $(10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(8, -2)$, $(18, 8)$, $(8, 18)$, and $(-2, 8)$.

To find the area of the polygon, we can use the Shoelace formula. The Shoelace formula is given by:

$$A = \frac{1}{2} \vert (x_1y_2 + x_2y_3 + \dots + x_ny_1) - (y_1x_2 + y_2x_3 + \dots + y_nx_1) \vert$$

Applying the Shoelace formula to the coordinates of the vertices, we get:

$$A = \frac{1}{2} \vert (10 \cdot 10 + 0 \cdot -10 + 0 \cdot 0 + -10 \cdot 0 + 8 \cdot -2 + 18 \cdot 8 + 8 \cdot 18 + -2 \cdot 8) - (0 \cdot 10 + 10 \cdot 0 + 0 \cdot -10 + -10 \cdot 0 + -2 \cdot 8 + 8 \cdot 18 + 18 \cdot 8 + 8 \cdot -2) \vert$$

$$A = \frac{1}{2} \vert (100 + 0 + 0 + 0 - 16 + 144 + 144 - 16) - (0 + 0 + 0 + 0 - 16 + 144 + 144 - 16) \vert$$

$$A = \frac{1}{2} \vert 360 - 360 \vert$$

$$A = 0$$

This doesn't make sense, because the area of the polygon should be positive. Let's check our

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is: $ ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$

For the expression to be zero, either one of the factors must be zero. This gives us two cases:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
This is only possible when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that both $x$ and $y$ must be in the range of $[-10, 10]$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
This is only possible when both $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that both $x$ and $y$ must be in the range of $[-8, 8]$.

The intersection of the ranges from both cases gives us the vertices of the polygon. This polygon is a square with side length 16. The area of a square is given by $side^2$, so the area of the polygon is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$
