 The given equation is a product of two terms, each of which is a square of a difference. If the product of two numbers is zero, then at least one of the numbers must be zero. Therefore, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

Each of these equations implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$. These equations represent 4 lines in the coordinate plane.

The lines $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ form a square with side length 10. The lines $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ form a square with side length 16.

The area of the convex polygon enclosed by these lines is the sum of the areas of the two squares, which is $10^2 + 8^2 = 100 + 64 = 164$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 164 square units. The answer is: $164$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, let's understand the problem. The equation is given as:

$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$

This equation is equal to zero if either of the two factors is equal to zero. This gives us two sets of equations:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From the first set of equations, we get the points $(8,8)$, $(-8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

From the second set of equations, we get the points $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

So the points that satisfy the equation are the vertices of a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

The first term is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, and the second term is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$.

For the first term to be zero, both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)$ must be zero, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This results in a square with side length 10.

For the second term to be zero, both $(\vert x \vert - 8)$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)$ must be zero, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This results in a square with side length 16.

The convex polygon formed by the intersection of these two squares is also a square, and its side length is the minimum of the side lengths of the two squares, which is 10.

The area of this square is side length squared, which is $10^2 = 100$. So the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units.

The python code to compute the area of the polygon is very simple:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    side_length = min(10, 16)
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 100

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
100
```
The area of the convex polygon is 100 square units. The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The equation in the problem is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \ \text{or} \ (\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

2. For the first equation to be equal to zero, $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0 \ \text{and} \ \vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10 \ \text{and} \ \vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us four lines: $x + y = 10, x + y = -10, x - y = 10, x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length 10.

3. For the second equation to be equal to zero, $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0 \ \text{and} \ \vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8 \ \text{and} \ \vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us four lines: $x = 8, x = -8, y = 8, y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length 16.

4. The first square has side length 10 and area $10^2 = 100$, and the second square has side length 16 and area $16^2 = 256$. However, we are interested in the intersection of the two squares, which forms a smaller square.

5. The smaller square is formed by the intersection of the two squares, and its side length is the difference between the x and y coordinates of the larger square's vertices, which is $16 - 10 = 6$. Therefore, the side length of the smaller square is 6 and its area is $6^2 = 36$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 36. We can confirm this by using sympy.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solve

def area_of_polygon():
    # Side length of the smaller square
    side_length = 16 - 10

    # Area of the smaller square
    area = side_length**2

    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 36

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
36
```

The area of the convex polygon is $36$. The answer is $\boxed{36}$.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is equal to zero if either of the factors is equal to zero. Let's consider each factor separately:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ which implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ which implies $\vert y \vert = 8$

From 3 and 4, we can deduce that the points must lie within a square with side length 16 (since $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ implies $-8 \leq x \leq 8$ and $-8 \leq y \leq 8$).

From 1 and 2, we can deduce that the points must lie on a square grid with a spacing of 10 units. The smallest such square containing all the points is a 20x20 square (since $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ implies $-10 \leq x \leq 10$ and $-10 \leq y \leq 10$).

The intersection of the square with side length 16 and the square with side length 20 is a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So the area of the convex polygon is 256.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is $\boxed{256}$.
