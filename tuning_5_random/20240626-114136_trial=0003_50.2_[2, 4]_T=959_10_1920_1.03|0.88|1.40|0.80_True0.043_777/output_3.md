Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Step 1: The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ is satisfied only when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These two equations imply that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$, which lead to four possible cases: $x = y = 5$, $x = -y = 5$, $x = y = -5$, and $x = -y = -5$.

Step 2: Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ is satisfied only when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which imply that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Combining these results, we have four points satisfying the original equation: $(5, 5)$, $(-5, 5)$, $(5, -5)$, and $(-5, -5)$.

Step 3: The four points form a square with side length $10$. The area of the square is $10^2 = 100$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so one or both of the expressions must be zero for the equation to hold. That means we need to find the solution sets for each of the following:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From these, we get the following system of equations:
1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$
2. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$
3. $\vert x \vert = 8$
4. $\vert y \vert = 8$

From 3 and 4, we have $x = 8$ or $x = -8$, and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

From 1, when $x = 8$, we get $\vert y \vert = 2$, so $y = 2$ or $y = -2$.
When $x = -8$, we get $\vert y \vert = 2$, so $y = 2$ or $y = -2$.

From 2, when $y = 8$, we get $\vert x \vert = 2$, so $x = 2$ or $x = -2$.
When $y = -8$, we get $\vert x \vert = 2$, so $x = 2$ or $x = -2$.

So the vertices of the polygon are $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$.
This forms a square with side length 16. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of them is zero. This means that our equation is zero if and only if at least one of the following is true:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From 1., we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. 
From 2., we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

This gives us the following equations:

1. $x + y = \pm 10$, $x - y = \pm 10$.
2. $x = \pm 8$, $y = \pm 8$.

Now, let's analyze each case:

For case 1., we have the following four equations:

1. $x + y = 10$.
2. $x + y = -10$.
3. $x - y = 10$.
4. $x - y = -10$.

Solving each of these equations simultaneously with the equations from case 2, we get the vertices of the polygon.

For case 2., we have the following four equations:

1. $x = 8$.
2. $x = -8$.
3. $y = 8$.
4. $y = -8$.

Solving each of these equations simultaneously with the equations from case 1, we get the vertices of the polygon.

By plotting the vertices on a coordinate plane and connecting them, we get a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

The final numerical answer is: $\boxed{256}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Step 1: To solve the given equation, we first need to understand that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

Step 2: For Case 1, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

Step 3: For Case 2, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So we get four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

Step 4: The intersection points of these lines form a square with side length 16.

Step 5: To find the area of this square, we simply square the length of its side: $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, we need to understand that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So, the equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ must be true.

Now, let's analyze the first equation:

$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$

This equation is true if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

This means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.

Solving these equations, we get four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

Now let's analyze the second equation:

$(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

This equation is true if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

This means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

So we get four more lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersection of these lines form a square with side length 16.

The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $\boxed{256}$
