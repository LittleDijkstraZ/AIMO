 The problem asks for the area of a polygon formed by the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the given equation. The equation is of the form $A \cdot B = 0$, which means that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. 

Let's consider each term separately:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which gives $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which gives $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x \vert = 8$, which gives $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

These conditions define a square with vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$. The side length of the square is $16$, so its area is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: 256.

Here is a Python code that calculates the area of the square:
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def square_area():
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = square_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon formed by the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the given equation is 256 square units. So the answer is $\boxed{256}$.

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so one or both of the expressions must be zero for the equation to hold. That means we need to find the solution sets for each of the following:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From these, we get the following system of equations:
1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$
2. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$
3. $\vert x \vert = 8$
4. $\vert y \vert = 8$

From 3 and 4, we have $x = 8$ or $x = -8$, and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

From 1, when $x = 8$, we get $\vert y \vert = 2$, so $y = 2$ or $y = -2$.
When $x = -8$, we get $\vert y \vert = 2$, so $y = 2$ or $y = -2$.

From 2, when $y = 8$, we get $\vert x \vert = 2$, so $x = 2$ or $x = -2$.
When $y = -8$, we get $\vert x \vert = 2$, so $x = 2$ or $x = -2$.

So the vertices of the polygon are $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$.
This forms a square with side length 16. The area of the square is therefore $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: 256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$. These conditions are equivalent to $-10 \leq x + y \leq 10$ and $-8 \leq x \leq 8$, $-8 \leq y \leq 8$.

Therefore, the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the conditions form a square with side length $16$ (from $-8$ to $8$ in both the x and y directions). The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon formed by the points satisfying the given condition is $256$.
The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Step 1: First we need to observe that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So we have two separate cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

Step 2: From $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. The absolute value equation gives us two equations $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.

Step 3: Similarly, from $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$, which gives $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.

Step 4: And from $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us four equations: $x - y = 10$, $x - y = -10$, $y - x = 10$, and $y - x = -10$.

Step 5: Lastly, from $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

Step 6: By analyzing the system of equations, we find that the points are: (8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), and (-8, -8).

Step 7: This forms a square with side length of 16. To find the area of this square, we simply square the length of one side: $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$
