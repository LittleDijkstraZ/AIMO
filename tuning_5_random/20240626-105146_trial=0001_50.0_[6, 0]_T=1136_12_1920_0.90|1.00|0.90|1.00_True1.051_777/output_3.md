Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ equals to zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
2. The expression $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2$ equals to zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
3. Therefore, the points satisfying the original equation must satisfy both $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$.
4. From $\vert x \vert = 8$, we get that $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
5. For $x = 8$, we have $\vert 8 + y \vert = 10$, which gives $y = 2$ or $y = -18$.
6. For $x = -8$, we have $\vert -8 + y \vert = 10$, which gives $y = 18$ or $y = -2$.
7. Therefore, the polygon is a rectangle with side lengths $18 - (-18) = 36$ and $8 - (-8) = 16$.
8. The area of the rectangle is $36 \times 16 = 576$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $576$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    # Calculate the side lengths of the rectangle
    side1 = 18 - (-18)
    side2 = 8 - (-8)

    # Calculate the area of the rectangle
    area = side1 * side2

    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 576

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
576
```

The area of the convex polygon is $576$. The answer is: $576$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Step 1: The expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ equals zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These two equations represent two pairs of parallel lines in the $xy$-plane, specifically the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square.

Step 2: Similarly, the expression $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which represent four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square.

Step 3: Therefore, the points satisfying the original equation are those that lie in the intersection of these two squares. The intersection of the two squares is a smaller square.

Step 4: The side length of the smaller square is the distance between the points $(8, 0)$ and $(-8, 0)$, which is $16$. So the area of the smaller square is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$

The expression is true if and only if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $x = y = \pm 8$. Thus, the polygon is a square with side length 16, and its area is $16^2 = 256$.

The python script to compute the area is as follows:
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length**2
    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:


The expression $AB = 0$ is true if and only if either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, in the given equation, either of the following two equations must be true for every point $(x, y)$ inside the polygon:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first equation to be true, both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The four lines satisfying these equalities are: $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. These lines form a square with side length 20 and area 400.

For the second equation to be true, both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. This implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The four lines satisfying these equalities are: $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. These lines also form a square with side length 16 and area 256.

Since the points satisfying either of the equations form two squares, the convex polygon enclosed by these points is the intersection of the two squares, which is also a square. The side length of this square is the smaller side length, which is 16. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is $\boxed{256}$.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The problem statement is a bit complicated, but we can simplify it by realizing that the only way for the product of two numbers to be zero is if at least one of the numbers is zero. This means we can set each factor equal to zero and solve for the points that satisfy the conditions.

The two factors in the equation are:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$$
and
$$((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$$

Setting each factor to zero gives us:

1. For the first factor:
$$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10$$
$$(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x - y \vert = 10$$
This results in a square with side length 20, centered at the origin (0,0).

2. For the second factor:
$$(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8 \Rightarrow -8 \leq x \leq 8$$
$$(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert y \vert = 8 \Rightarrow -8 \leq y \leq 8$$
This results in a square with side length 16, centered at the origin (0,0).

The intersection of these two squares is the region enclosed by the convex polygon. The side length of this square is the smaller of the two side lengths, which is 16. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the square of the side length, which is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$
