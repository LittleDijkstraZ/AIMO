Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So we can rewrite the equation as:
\[(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0\] or 
\[(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0.\]

From the first equation we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x = y$ and $x = -y$. From the second equation we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $x = 8$ or $x = -8$ and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. Therefore, the points that satisfy the equation are
\[(8,8), (8,-8), (-8,8), (-8,-8).\]

The points form a square with side length $16$, so the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $256$. The Python code to calculate the area of the square is:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def square_area():
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = square_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{256}$.

1. First, observe that the product of two numbers equals zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So we can convert the original equation into two separate equations: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

2. Solving the four equations, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

3. Solving these four equations gives us the four vertices of the polygon: $(8, 0)$, $(8, -16)$, $(0, 8)$, and $(-16, 8)$.

4. We can use the Shoelace Formula to calculate the area of the polygon with vertices $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$, ..., $(x_n, y_n)$: $A = \frac{1}{2} |(x_1y_2 + x_2y_3 + \cdots + x_ny_1) - (y_1x_2 + y_2x_3 + \cdots + y_nx_1)|$.

5. Applying the Shoelace Formula to the four vertices, we get the area of the polygon as $128$.

So the area of the polygon is $128$. The answer is: $128$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



A product of two terms equals zero if at least one of the terms is zero. Hence we have two sets of equations:

\begin{align*}
(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 &= 0,\\
(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 &= 0,\\
(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 &= 0,\\
(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 &= 0.
\end{align*}

Solving these we get the four points $(\pm8, 0)$ and $(0, \pm8)$.

The distance between any two of these points is at least $\sqrt{8^2 + 8^2} = 8\sqrt{2}$.

The maximum distance between any two points on a rectangle with side lengths $8$ and $8$ is also $8\sqrt{2}$.

Hence the points are the vertices of a square with side length $8$. The area is therefore $8^2 = 64$. Hence the area of the convex polygon is $64$ square units.
The answer is: $64$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The expression $A = ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ can be true only if either one of the two factors is zero. This gives us the following four equations:

1. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10$
2. $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x - y \vert = 10$
3. $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8$
4. $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert y \vert = 8$

Solving these equations, we obtain the vertices of the polygon:

1. $(x, y) = (8, 8)$, $(x, y) = (8, -8)$, $(x, y) = (-8, 8)$, $(x, y) = (-8, -8)$ for the first two equations.
2. $(x, y) = (8, 0)$, $(x, y) = (0, 8)$, $(x, y) = (-8, 0)$, $(x, y) = (0, -8)$ for the last two equations.

Thus, the polygon is a square with side length 8*sqrt(2). Its area is $(8\sqrt{2})^2 = 128$.

So the area of the polygon is 128. The answer is: $128$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



We need to analyze the system of equations defined by $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0.$

We know that $(a - b)^2 = 0$ if and only if $a = b$. Hence, for the first equation to be zero, we should have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. From these equations, we get that either $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ or $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$. The first pair has no solution for $x$ and $y$, therefore, the only possible solution is $x = 5$ and $y = 5$.

For the second equation to be zero, we should have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. From these equations, we get that either $x = 8$ or $x = -8$ and either $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

The points where both equations are zero are $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$. These points form a square with side length $16$. To find the area of the square, we square the length of its side: $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the square is $256$. The solution to the original problem is the positive integer $256$. Let's print it.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

print(256)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $\boxed{256}$
