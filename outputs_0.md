Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, we have the equation of the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ and the line $y = 4$. 

We can find the points where the parabola intersects the line by setting the two equations equal to each other:

$kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$

Now, we know that the points $A$ and $B$ where the parabola intersects the line are distance 6 apart, so we can write this as:

$AB = 6$

To find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin, we can use the distance formula for each point and square them:

$(distance from A to origin)^2 + (distance from B to origin)^2$

The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is given by $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$, so the squared distance would be $x^2 + y^2$. Since the line $y = 4$ is horizontal, we can just use the $y$-coordinate for the distance calculation:

$(distance from A to origin)^2 = (0 - x_A)^2 + (4 - 0)^2 = x_A^2 + 16$

$(distance from B to origin)^2 = (0 - x_B)^2 + (4 - 0)^2 = x_B^2 + 16$

So, we want to find the sum of the squared distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin:

$(distance from A to origin)^2 + (distance from B to origin)^2 = (x_A^2 + 16) + (x_B^2 + 16)$

Now, we know that $AB = 6$, and we can use the distance formula:

$AB^2 = (x_B - x_A)^2 + (4 - 4)^2 = (x_B - x_A)^2$

We can substitute $x_B = x_A + 6$:

$AB^2 = (x_A + 6 - x_A)^2 = 6^2 = 36$

Now, we can substitute this into the equation for the sum of the squared distances:

$(distance from A to origin)^2 + (distance from B to origin)^2 = (x_A^2 + 16) + ((x_A + 6)^2 + 16)$

Simplify:

$(distance from A to origin)^2 + (distance from B to origin)^2 = 2(x_A^2 + 16) + 36$

Now, we can substitute $x_A^2 = 18$ (from the equation $x_A^2 + 16 = 36$):

$(distance from A to origin)^2 + (distance from B to origin)^2 = 2(18) + 36$

Simplify:

$(distance from A to origin)^2 + (distance from B to origin)^2 = 36 + 36$

Finally, we get the answer:

$(distance from A to origin)^2 + (distance from B to origin)^2 = 72$

So, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $\boxed{72}$.
