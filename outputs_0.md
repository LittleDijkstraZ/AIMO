Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

 This problem requires a bit of analytical geometry and algebra to solve. Here is a Python implementation to solve it:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solve, sqrt

def solve_problem():
    k, l, x = symbols('k l x')

    # The equation of the parabola
    parabola = k*x**2 - 2*k*x + l - 4

    # The equation of the distance from the origin to a point (x, y) on the parabola
    distance_squared = x**2 + parabola**2

    # Solve the equation y = 4 for l
    l_value = solve(parabola, l)[0]

    # Substitute l into the distance equation
    distance_squared = distance_squared.subs(l, l_value)

    # The points A and B are the solutions to the equation y = 4, so we find the x-coordinates of these points
    solutions = solve(parabola, x)
    A, B = solutions

    # The distance between A and B is given as 6
    distance_AB = 6

    # The distance from A and B to the origin
    distance_A = sqrt(A**2 + parabola.subs(x, A)**2)
    distance_B = sqrt(B**2 + parabola.subs(x, B)**2)

    # The sum of the squares of the distances from A and B to the origin
    sum_of_squares = distance_A**2 + distance_B**2

    # Substitute the distance AB into the equation
    sum_of_squares = sum_of_squares.subs(x, B) + (distance_AB/2)**2

    return sum_of_squares

result = solve_problem()
print(result)
```
