Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The condition $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ can be true only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only possible values are $x = 0$ and $y = \pm 10$. Similarly, the condition $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, so $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So the points are: $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(8, 0)$, $(-8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, $(0, -8)$, $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

If we plot these points in the coordinate plane, we find that they are the vertices of a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

The area of the polygon is 100 square units.
The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, we need to notice that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. This implies that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

2. From the first two equations, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us four lines in the coordinate plane: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

3. From the last two equations, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us four lines in the coordinate plane: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

4. The intersection points of these lines are the vertices of the polygon. By solving the equations, we find that the vertices are $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$.

5. The polygon is a square with side length 16. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the polygon is $256$.
The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The condition for the product of two numbers being zero is that at least one of them must be zero. Therefore, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. This represents a square with side length 20 centered at the origin.

For $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This represents a square with side length 20 centered at the origin, but at a 45-degree angle to the first square.

For $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$, which represents a line segment of length 16 along the x-axis.

For $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert y \vert = 8$, which represents a line segment of length 16 along the y-axis.

The intersection of these four geometric objects forms a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We first need to understand the given equation. The equation is a product of two terms. The product is zero if and only if one or both of the terms are zero. So, we have two cases:
   - $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
   - $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

2. For the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us four equations:
   - $x + y = 10$
   - $x + y = -10$
   - $x - y = 10$
   - $x - y = -10$

3. For the second case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us four more equations:
   - $x = 8$
   - $x = -8$
   - $y = 8$
   - $y = -8$

4. We can solve these eight equations to find the intersection points of the lines defined by these equations. This will give us the vertices of the polygon.

5. Finally, we can calculate the area of the polygon using the vertices obtained in step 4.

Now let's use Python to solve this problem:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve, Abs

def polygon_area():
    # Define variables
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # Define the equations
    eq1 = Eq(Abs(x + y), 10)
    eq2 = Eq(Abs(x - y), 10)
    eq3 = Eq(Abs(x), 8)
    eq4 = Eq(Abs(y), 8)

    # Solve the equations
    solutions1 = solve((eq1, eq3), (x, y))
    solutions2 = solve((eq1, eq4), (x, y))
    solutions3 = solve((eq2, eq3), (x, y))
    solutions4 = solve((eq2, eq4), (x, y))

    # Combine all solutions
    solutions = solutions1 + solutions2 + solutions3 + solutions4

    # Calculate the area of the polygon
    area = 0
    for i in range(len(solutions)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(solutions)):
            area += abs(0.5 * (solutions[i][0] * solutions[j][1] - solutions[j][0] * solutions[i][1]))

    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 7712.00000000000

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
7712.00000000000
```
The area of the polygon is $7712$ square units. However, this is not correct. The area of a rectangle is $80 * 90 = 7200$, and the area of the four right triangles formed by the rectangle's sides and the lines $x+y=10$, $x-y=10$, $x=8$, and $y=8$ is $2*(1/2 * 80*10 + 1/2 * 90*10 - 1/2 * 8*10 - 1/2 * 8*90) = 720$. So the area of the polygon should be $7200 - 720 = 6480$, not $7712$. The area is actually $6480$. The answer is $\boxed{6480}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The given equation is $0$ if and only if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

This implies that the points $\left(x, y\right)$ must satisfy either $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The solutions to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ are the lines $x + y = 10, -10$ and $x = 8, -8$. Similarly, the solutions to $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ are the lines $x - y = 10, -10$ and $y = 8, -8$.

These lines form a square with side length $10$ in the first quadrant, and another square with side length $8$ in each of the other three quadrants. The total area of the square is therefore $4(10 \cdot 8) = 320$.

So the area of the convex polygon is $320$.

Here's the python code to find the solution:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    side_length_square1 = 10
    side_length_square2 = 8

    area_square1 = side_length_square1 ** 2
    area_square2 = side_length_square2 ** 2

    total_area = 4 * (area_square1 * area_square2)

    return total_area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 25600

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output

```
Oops, it seems I made a mistake. The squares are in different quadrants. The square with side length 10 is in the first quadrant and the square with side length 8 is in each of the other three quadrants. So the total area of the square is $10^2 + 3 \cdot 8^2 = 100 + 192 = 292$. The correct answer is therefore 292.

Here's the corrected python code:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    side_length_square1 = 10
    side_length_square2 = 8

    area_square1 = side_length_square1 ** 2
    area_square2 = side_length_square2 ** 2

    total_area = area_square1 + 3 * area_square2

    return total_area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 292

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
292
```
The area of the convex polygon is 292. However, as the problem asks for a numerical answer, we need to convert it to a positive integer. The area is already an integer, so we can simply use the `int()` function to convert it:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    side_length_square1 = 10
    side_length_square2 = 8

    area_square1 = side_length_square1 ** 2
    area_square2 = side_length_square2 ** 2

    total_area = area_square1 + 3 * area_square2

    return int(total_area)

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
``````output

CODE RESULTS 292

INTERMEDIATE OUT :

```
The area of the convex polygon is 292. The answer is $\boxed{292}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The given equation is a product of two expressions, set equal to zero. This means that either of the expressions must be zero for the equation to be true. So we have two cases to consider:
   - $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
   - $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
2. For the first case, either $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are four lines in the coordinate plane.
3. For the second case, either $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are also four lines in the coordinate plane.
4. The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 16.
5. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $f(x, y) = ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is true only when either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. 

From this, we find four lines in the coordinate plane where the function equals zero:

1. $x + y = 10$,
2. $x + y = -10$,
3. $x - y = 10$,
4. $x - y = -10$,
5. $x = 8$,
6. $x = -8$,
7. $y = 8$,
8. $y = -8$.

These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8),$ and $(-8, -8)$. The area of this rectangle is $(8 - (-8))(8 - (-8)) = 16 \times 16 = 256$.

The area of the polygon is therefore 256.
