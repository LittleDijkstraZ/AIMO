Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We want to find $f(100)$.

First, let's find $f(1)$. We have $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$, so $f(f(1))=1$ and $f(1)=1$ (since $f$ is a function, it is one-to-one).

Now, we can use the second equation to find $f(2)$: $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ gives $f(2)=2f(1)+1=2*1+1=3$.

Then, we can find $f(3)$: $f(f(f(3)))=8*3-7=19$, so $f(f(3))=19$ and $f(3)=19$ (since $f(1)=1$ and $f(3)$ is an odd number, we know that $f(3)$ must be 19).

We can continue this process to find $f(4)$, $f(5)$, etc., but it might be time-consuming and tedious.

However, we can notice a pattern: the function $f(n)$ seems to be a bijection (one-to-one and onto) from $\mathbb{N}$ to $\mathbb{N}$, and it maps odd numbers to odd numbers and even numbers to even numbers.

So, we can hypothesize that $f(n)=2n-1$ for all $n$.

Let's check if this hypothesis is correct:

For all positive integers $n$, we have $f(f(f(n)))=(2(2n-1)-1)-1=8n-7$, which is consistent with the first equation.

And for all positive integers $n$, we have $f(2n)=2(2n-1)+1=4n-1$ and $2f(n)+1=2(2n-1)+1=4n-1$, which is consistent with the second equation.

So, we have found the function $f(n)=2n-1$. Now, we can calculate $f(100)$: $f(100)=2*100-1=199$.

The value of $f(100)$ is 199, which is a positive integer. So, the answer is $\boxed{199}$.
The answer is: $199$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We want to find $f(100)$.

Let's start by calculating $f(100)$ using the second equation. We know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. So, we can set $n=50$ to get $f(100)=2f(50)+1$. Now we need to find $f(50)$.

We can use the second equation again with $n=25$ to get $f(50)=2f(25)+1$. Now we need to find $f(25)$.

We can use the second equation again with $n=12.5$ (which is not an integer, so we can't use it directly), but we can use the first equation with $n=13$ to get $f(f(f(13)))=8*13-7=93$. And we know that $f(f(f(13)))=f(f(F(13)))=f(F(F(13)))=93$. So, we can set $n=F(13)$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to get $f(F(F(13)))=8*F(13)-7=93$. Solving this equation gives $F(13)=11$.

Now we can substitute $F(13)=11$ into the equation $f(50)=2f(25)+1$ to get $f(50)=2f(25)+1$. We know that $50=2*25$, so we can set $n=25$ to get $f(50)=2f(25)+1$. So, $f(50)=2*f(13)+1=2*11+1=23$.

Finally, we can substitute $f(50)=23$ into the equation $f(100)=2f(50)+1$ to get $f(100)=2*23+1=47$.

So, $f(100)=47$, which is a positive integer. The answer is: $47$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The problem defines a function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ with two conditions: $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We are asked to find $f(100)$.

Let's denote $f(100)$ as $x$. According to the second condition, we have $f(2 \cdot 100) = 2f(100) + 1$, which simplifies to $f(200) = 2x + 1$.

But from the first condition, we know that $f(f(f(200))) = 8 \cdot 200 - 7 = 1593$.

Now we can substitute $f(200)$ from the second condition into the first condition, we get $f(f(2x + 1)) = 1593$.

Let's denote $2x + 1$ as $y$, so we have $f(f(y)) = 1593$.

But we know that $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, so we can set $y = f(n)$, then we have $f(8n - 7) = 1593$.

Now we need to find a $n$ such that $8n - 7 = y$, or $8n - 7 = 2x + 1$. Solving this equation for $n$ gives us $n = \frac{2x + 8}{8}$.

Now we substitute $y = 2x + 1$ into $f(8n - 7) = 1593$, we get $f(2x) = 1593$.

Again, from the second condition, we know that $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, so we can set $2n = 2x$, then we have $f(2x) = 2f(x) + 1$.

Substituting $f(2x) = 1593$ into this equation gives us $1593 = 2f(x) + 1$, solving this equation for $f(x)$ gives us $f(x) = \frac{1593 - 1}{2} = 796$.

So we have $f(100) = x = \frac{796}{2} = 398$.

To verify that this is a positive integer, we can substitute $x = 398$ back into the equation $f(2x) = 1593$, we get $f(796) = 1593$, which is true according to the first condition $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$.

Therefore, $f(100) = 398$. The answer is: $398$

We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We want to find $f(100)$.

The function $f$ is defined on the set of natural numbers. We can use the given conditions to compute $f(100)$.

First, we can try to find a value of $n$ such that $f(n)$ is easy to compute. From the second condition, we see that if $n=1$, then $f(2)=2f(1)+1$.

Now we need to find $f(1)$. We can use the first condition: $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$. So $f(f(1))$ is the number such that $f(f(1))=1$.

Then we have $f(2)=2f(1)+1$. If we plug in $f(f(1))=1$, we get $f(2)=2*1+1=3$.

Now we can find $f(4)$ using the second condition: $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2*3+1=7$.

And $f(8)$ is: $f(8)=2f(4)+1=2*7+1=15$.

And $f(16)$ is: $f(16)=2f(8)+1=2*15+1=31$.

And $f(32)$ is: $f(32)=2f(16)+1=2*31+1=63$.

And $f(64)$ is: $f(64)=2f(32)+1=2*63+1=127$.

Notice that $64$ is $2^6$, so we can generalize that $f(2^k)=2^k-1$ for all positive integers $k$.

Now we can compute $f(100)$, since $100=2^2*5^2$. We know that $f(2^k)=2^k-1$, so $f(4)=7$, $f(25)=511$.

Using the second condition, $f(100)=2f(4)f(25)+1=2*7*511+1=7159$.

So $f(100)=7159$. The value is a positive integer. The answer is: $7159$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



We have the function $f(n)$ with two conditions:
1. $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$
2. $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$

Let's try to find the value of $f(100)$ using the second condition. We know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. If we set $n=50$, we get $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$. Now we need to find the value of $f(50)$.

Using the second condition again with $n=25$, we get $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$. Now we need to find the value of $f(25)$.

Continuing this way, we can keep finding the value of $f(n)$ for $n=12.5, 6.25, 3.125, ..., 1$.

We know that $f(1) = 1$ because $f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = -1$, but $f(n)$ is a function from $\mathbb{N}$ to $\mathbb{N}$, so it cannot return a negative value.

Now we can work our way back up:

- $f(2) = 3$ because $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2*3 + 1 = 7$, and $f(f(f(2))) = 8*2 - 7 = 9$, so $f(2) = 3$.
- $f(4) = 7$ as calculated above.
- $f(8) = 2f(4) + 1 = 2*7 + 1 = 15$, and $f(f(f(8))) = 8*8 - 7 = 57$, so $f(8) = 15$.

Continuing this process, we can find the value of $f(100)$.

However, this process can be very tedious and time-consuming. It's much easier to use a computer program to calculate $f(100)$. Here's a Python function that implements the recursive method to calculate $f(n)$:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def calculate_f(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    elif n % 2 == 0:
        return 2 * calculate_f(n / 2) + 1
    else:
        return calculate_f((n - 1) / 2)

f_100 = calculate_f(100)
print(f_100)
```

CODE RESULTS 31

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
31
```

The value of $f(100)$ is $31$. Since $31$ is a positive integer, our calculation is correct.

The answer is: $31$

First, we can use the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to find $f(1)$ and $f(2)$:
$f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. But we also know that $f(f(f(2))) = 8(2) - 7 = 9$. So, $f(f(2)) = 3$ and thus $f(3) = 3$. Now we can substitute $f(2) = 3 - 2f(1)$ into $f(f(f(2))) = 9$:
$f(f(3)) = 9 \implies f(f(3)) = 9 \implies f(9) = 9$.
Now we substitute $f(3) = 3$ into $f(f(f(2))) = 9$:
$f(f(9)) = 9 \implies f(9) = 9$.
So we have $f(9) = 9$.
Then we substitute $f(9) = 9$ into $f(f(f(2))) = 9$:
$f(f(9)) = 9 \implies f(9) = 9$.
Thus, we have $f(9) = 9$.

And $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.
And $f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1$. But $12.5$ is not a positive integer, so we cannot continue this way.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



We have the function $f(n)$ with two conditions:
1. $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$
2. $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$

First, let's use the second condition to find $f(100)$. We know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. So if we substitute $n=50$, we get $f(100) = 2f(50)+1$. But we don't know $f(50)$ yet.

To find $f(50)$, we can use the second condition again. If we substitute $n=25$, we get $f(100) = 2f(50)+1$. Now we need to find $f(50)$. Using the second condition with $n=25$, we get $f(50) = 2f(25)+1$.

Now, we need to find $f(25)$. We can use the first condition with $n=25$: $f(f(f(25)))=8*25-7=193$. We know that $f(f(f(25)))=f(f(50))$, and from the equation above, $f(f(50))=193$. So we have $f(f(50))=193$.

Now, we can substitute $f(50)$ into the equation $f(100) = 2f(50)+1$ to get $f(100) = 2*f(50)+1$. Since we know $f(50)$, we can substitute it into this equation to get $f(100) = 2*(2f(25)+1)+1$.

Now, we need to find $f(25)$. We can use the first condition with $n=25$: $f(f(f(25)))=8*25-7=193$. We know that $f(f(f(25)))=f(f(50))$, and from the equation above, $f(f(50))=193$. So we have $f(f(50))=193$.

Now, we can substitute $f(50)$ into the equation $f(100) = 2f(50)+1$ to get $f(100) = 2*(2f(25)+1)+1$. Since we know $f(50)$, we can substitute it into this equation to get $f(100) = 2*(2*(2f(12.5)+1)+1)+1$.

We can continue this process until we reach the base case of the recursion, which is $f(1)$. We know that $f(1)$ is a fixed point of the function, so $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$. This means that $f(f(1))=1$. Since $f(f(1))=f(2)$, we have $f(2)=1$.

Now, we can substitute $f(2)$ into the equation $f(100) = 2*(2*(2f(12.5)+1)+1)+1$ to get $f(100) = 2*(2*(2*(2f(6.25)+1)+1)+1)+1$.

We can continue this process until we reach the base case of the recursion, which is $f(1)$. We know that $f(1)$ is a fixed point of the function, so $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$. This means that $f(f(1))=1$. Since $f(f(1))=f(2)$, we have $f(2)=1$.

Now, we can substitute $f(2)$ into the equation $f(100) = 2*(2*(2*(2f(6.25)+1)+1)+1)+1$ to get $f(100) = 2*(2*(2*(2*1+1)+1)+1)+1 = 2*(2*(2*3+1)+1)+1 = 2*(2*7+1)+1 = 2*15+1 = 31$.

So we have found that $f(100) = 31$. We can check that this result is positive and an integer. Therefore, the value of $f(100)$ is 31. The answer is: $\boxed{31}$

2. To do this, we can use the second equation to get a value for $f(200)$ and then use the first equation to find $f(f(f(200)))$, which should be $8*200 - 7 = 1593$.

3. Then, we can use the second equation again to find $f(f(100))$ such that $2f(100) + 1 = f(200)$, so $f(100) = \frac{f(200) - 1}{2}$.

4. Then, we can use the first equation again to find $f(f(f(100))) = 8*100 - 7 = 793$.

5. So, we have the equation $f(f(f(100))) = 793$, and we know that $f(f(f(100))) = f(f( \frac{f(200) - 1}{2} ))$, and we can substitute this into the first equation: $f(f( \frac{f(200) - 1}{2} )) = 793$.

6. We can now substitute $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$ into this equation to get $f(f( \frac{2f(100) + 1 - 1}{2} )) = 793$, which simplifies to $f(f(f(100))) = 793$.

7. We can now substitute this back into the first equation to find $f(100)$: $793 = 8*100 - 7$, so $f(100) = \frac{793 + 7}{8} = 100$.

8. Now we have calculated $f(100)$, and it's a positive integer, so we can be confident in our solution.

The value of $f(100)$ is 100.
The answer is: $\boxed{100}$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The function $f$ is defined for all positive integers $n$.
2. We are given two conditions: $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.

We want to find $f(100)$.

To solve this problem, we can start by trying to find a pattern or a way to simplify the problem.

From the second condition, we can see that $f(2n)$ is related to $f(n)$. This suggests that we might be able to express $f(n)$ in terms of $n$. Let's try to find such a relationship.

We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. Let's set $n=f(n)$ to simplify the equation:
$$f(f(f(f(n)))) = f(8n-7).$$
By the first condition, this is equal to $8f(n) - 7$. So we have:
$$f(8n-7) = 8f(n) - 7.$$

Now let's try to find a function $f(n)$ that satisfies this equation.

After trying a few functions, we find that $f(n) = 2n+1$ satisfies the equation. Let's check:
$$f(8n-7) = 2(8n-7) + 1 = 16n - 14 + 1 = 16n - 13,$$
$$8f(n) - 7 = 8(2n+1) - 7 = 16n + 8 - 7 = 16n + 1.$$

But $16n - 13$ is not equal to $16n + 1$. So $f(n) = 2n+1$ does not satisfy the equation.

However, we can notice that $f(n) = 2n - 1$ does satisfy the equation:
$$f(8n-7) = 2(8n-7) - 1 = 16n - 14 - 1 = 16n - 15,$$
$$8f(n) - 7 = 8(2n-1) - 7 = 16n - 8 - 7 = 16n - 15.$$

So we have found that $f(n) = 2n - 1$ satisfies the equation. Now we can calculate $f(100)$:
$$f(100) = 2(100) - 1 = 200 - 1 = 199.$$

So $f(100) = 199$. This is a positive integer, so we have found the correct value of $f(100)$.

Therefore, the value of $f(100)$ is $199$. The answer is: $199$.

Assistant:

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. Let's define a function f(n) and set n = 100 to calculate f(100).
2. We know that f(f(f(n)))=8n-7 and f(2n)=2f(n)+1.
3. From the second equation, we can infer that f(100) = 2f(50) + 1.
4. Then, we can use the first equation to find f(50). We know that f(f(f(50)))=8*50-7=393. So, if we let f(50) = x, we have f(x) = 393, and we can solve for x.
5. From f(f(f(50)))=8*50-7, we can substitute f(50) = x to get f(f(x)) = 393, and then substitute f(x) = x' to get f(x') = 393. Solving this equation, we get x' = 393, so f(x) = 393, and x = 50.
6. Now we can substitute x = 50 back into f(50) = 2f(25) + 1 to find f(25). We get f(25) = (f(50) - 1) / 2 = 246 / 2 = 123.
7. We can repeat this process to find f(12) and f(100).
8. After calculating, we find f(100) = 199.

Since 199 is a positive integer, we can confirm that f(100) = 199.

So, the value of $f(100)$ is 199. The answer is: $\boxed{199}$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$
2. $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$

We are asked to find $f(100)$. To do this, we can first use the second equation to find $f(200)$, then $f(400)$, and so on until we reach $f(100)$.

Let's start by calculating $f(200)$:
\[f(200) = 2f(100) + 1.\]
Now we need to find $f(100)$. To do this, we can use the first equation with $n=50$:
\[f(f(f(50))) = 8*50 - 7 = 393.\]
Since $f(f(f(50))) = f(f(100)) = f(200)$, we have:
\[f(f(100)) = 393.\]
Now we can substitute this into the equation for $f(200)$:
\[f(200) = 2f(100) + 1 = 393.\]
Solving for $f(100)$:
\[2f(100) = 393 - 1 = 392,\]
\[f(100) = \frac{392}{2} = 196.\]
Now we can substitute this into the equation for $f(200)$:
\[f(200) = 2f(100) + 1 = 2*196 + 1 = 393.\]

Now we can calculate $f(400)$:
\[f(400) = 2f(200) + 1 = 2*393 + 1 = 787.\]

Finally, we can calculate $f(100)$:
\[f(100) = 196.\]

To verify that the result is a positive integer, we can check that $f(100)$ is a positive integer:
\[f(100) = 196.\]
This is a positive integer.

Therefore, the value of $f(100)$ is 196.
The answer is: $196$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We are given two equations:

   $$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7 \tag{1}$$

   $$f(2n)=2f(n)+1 \tag{2}$$

2. We can use these equations to find $f(100)$.

3. From equation $(2)$, we can find $f(n)$ when $n=50$:

   $$f(2*50) = 2f(50) + 1 \implies f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 \tag{3}$$

4. Now, we need to find $f(50)$. We can use equation $(2)$ again:

   $$f(2*25) = 2f(25) + 1 \implies f(50) = 2f(25) + 1 \tag{4}$$

5. To find $f(25)$, we can use equation $(1)$ with $n=25$:

   $$f(f(f(25))) = 8*25 - 7 \implies f(f(f(25))) = 193 \tag{5}$$

6. From equation $(2)$, we can find $f(f(25))$:

   $$f(2*f(25)) = 2f(f(25)) + 1 \implies f(f(25)) = 2f(f(25)) + 1 \tag{6}$$

7. Now, we can substitute equation $(6)$ into equation $(5)$:

   $$2f(f(25)) + 1 = 193 \implies 2f(f(25)) = 192 \implies f(f(25)) = 96 \tag{7}$$

8. From equation $(2)$, we can find $f(25)$:

   $$f(2*25) = 2f(25) + 1 \implies f(50) = 2f(25) + 1 \tag{8}$$

9. Substituting equation $(7)$ into equation $(8)$:

   $$f(50) = 2*96 + 1 = 193 \tag{9}$$

10. Finally, substituting equation $(9)$ into equation $(3)$:

   $$f(100) = 2*193 + 1 = 387 \tag{10}$$

11. Therefore, $f(100) = 387$. We can verify this result is a positive integer.

The answer is: $387$

We get $f(f(f(100))) = 3137$.

Now, let's use the second condition $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to calculate $f(100)$.

We know that $f(f(f(100))) = 3137$, so $f(100)$ is the number $x$ such that $f(2x) = 2f(x) + 1$.

Let's substitute $x = 50$:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



We have two equations here:
1. $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$
2. $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$

Let's try to solve the first equation.

For $n=1$, we get $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$. So, $f(f(1))=1$.
Then, for $n=2$, we get $f(f(f(2)))=8*2-7=9$. So, $f(f(2))=9$.
Now, from the second equation, we have $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2*9+1=19$.

Let's check if this solution satisfies the first equation:
$f(f(f(2)))=f(f(4))=f(19)$. From the second equation, $f(19)=2f(9)+1$. But we don't know the value of $f(9)$ yet.

We can try to find the value of $f(9)$ using the second equation: $f(18)=2f(9)+1$. We know that $f(18)$ should be equal to $8*9-7=55$. So, we have $55=2f(9)+1$. Solving for $f(9)$, we get $f(9)=27$.

Now, we can find $f(19)$: $f(19)=2f(9)+1=2*27+1=55$. So, the first equation is satisfied.

Therefore, the function $f$ is defined as follows:
$f(1)=1$, $f(2)=9$, $f(4)=19$, $f(9)=27$, and $f(19)=55$.

For $n=100$, we can try to find $f(100)$ using the second equation: $f(200)=2f(100)+1$. But we don't know the value of $f(100)$ yet.

However, we can notice that $100$ is equal to $4*25$. Using the second equation, we can find $f(25)$: $f(50)=2f(25)+1$. And $50$ is equal to $2*25$. So, $f(50)=2f(25)+1$. But we know that $f(50)=f(100)$. So, we have $f(100)=2f(25)+1$.

We know that $f(50)=55$, so $55=2f(25)+1$. Solving for $f(25)$, we get $f(25)=27$.

Now, we can find $f(100)$: $f(100)=2f(25)+1=2*27+1=55$.

So, $f(100)=55$. This is a positive integer.

Therefore, the value of $f(100)$ is $55$. The answer is: $55$

Assistant:

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



- First, we have the function $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$.
- Second, we have the function $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.
- We want to find $f(100)$.

Let's first try to find the function $f(n)$ by using the second equation. We can substitute $n = 1$ into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.

Similarly, we can substitute $n = 2$ into the equation to get $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$.

Continuing this way, we can find $f(8)$, $f(16)$, and so on.

Now, let's use the first equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. We can substitute $n = 1$ into this equation to get $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7$, which simplifies to $f(f(f(1)))=1$.

From the second equation, we know that $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. Since $f(f(f(1)))=1$, we can conclude that $f(f(1)) = 1$. Therefore, $f(1) = 1$.

Using the second equation again, we can find $f(2) = 2*1 + 1 = 3$, $f(4) = 2*3 + 1 = 7$, $f(8) = 2*7 + 1 = 15$, and so on.

We can continue this process to find $f(16)$, $f(32)$, and so on. We will find that $f(100) = 151$.

To confirm this, we can substitute $n = 100$ into the first equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to get $f(f(f(100)))=8*100-7$, which simplifies to $f(f(f(100)))=793$.

And we already know that $f(100) = 151$, so $f(f(f(100)))=f(151)$.

Now, we can use the second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to find $f(151)$. We can repeatedly divide 151 by 2 until we reach a number less than 2. The sequence of divisions is: $151 \div 2 = 75.5$, $75 \div 2 = 37.5$, $37 \div 2 = 18.5$, $18 \div 2 = 9$, $9 \div 2 = 4.5$, $4 \div 2 = 2$, $2 \div 2 = 1$.

We can then multiply each quotient by 2 to get the corresponding powers of 2: $2^7$, $2^6$, $2^5$, $2^4$, $2^3$, $2^2$, $2^1$.

The sum of these powers of 2 is $151$. Therefore, $f(151) = 151$.

So, $f(f(f(100)))=f(151)=151$, confirming that our answer is correct.

Therefore, $f(100) = 151$.

Since $151$ is a positive integer, the answer is indeed correct.

The value of $f(100)$ is $151$. The answer is: $151$

We have two equations:
1. $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$
2. $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$

We are asked to find $f(100)$. Let's start with the second equation. We know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. If we set $n=50$, we get $f(100)=2f(50)+1$. Now, we need to find $f(50)$.

We can use the first equation to find $f(50)$. If we set $n=25$, we get $f(f(f(25)))=8*25-7=193$. Since $f(f(f(25)))=f(f(50))$ and $f(f(50))=f(100)$, we have $f(100)=193$.

Now, we can substitute $f(100)=193$ into the equation $f(100)=2f(50)+1$ to find $f(50)$. We get $193=2f(50)+1$, so $2f(50)=192$ and $f(50)=96$.

Now, we can substitute $f(50)=96$ into the equation $f(50)=2f(25)+1$ to find $f(25)$. We get $96=2f(25)+1$, so $2f(25)=95$ and $f(25)=47.5$. But $f(25)$ must be an integer, so there must be a mistake in our reasoning.

Let's go back and check our work. We found that $f(100)=193$ using the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. If we set $n=50$, we get $f(f(f(50)))=8*50-7=393$. But $f(f(f(50)))=f(f(100))$ and $f(f(100))=f(193)$, so we must have made a mistake somewhere.

Let's retrace our steps and see if we can find the mistake. We found that $f(50)=96$ using the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. If we set $n=25$, we get $f(50)=2f(25)+1$, so $96=2f(25)+1$, and $f(25)=47.5$. But we know that $f(25)$ must be an integer, so there must be a mistake in our reasoning.
