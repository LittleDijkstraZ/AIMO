Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



If a product is 0, one of the factors must be 0. Therefore, we have two equations to solve:
1. $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$
2. $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$

From the first equation, we have:
$\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$
This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$
Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon: $(5,5), (5,-5), (-5,5), (-5,-5)$

From the second equation, we have:
$\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$
This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$
Adding these vertices to our list, we get: $(8,0), (0,8), (-8,0), (0,-8)$

Now we can calculate the area of the polygon. It's a square with side length 10 (the distance between $(5,5)$ and $(5,-5)$, or $(8,0)$ and $(0,8)$), so its area is $10^2 = 100$.

The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The condition for the product of two numbers to be zero is that at least one of them is zero. Therefore, we have two cases:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For Case 1, we have:
$\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$
For Case 2, we have:
$\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$

Solving these absolute value equations gives us a total of 8 points:
$(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, $(-8,-8)$, $(10,0)$, $(-10,0)$, $(0,10)$, $(0,-10)$.

These points form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units.
The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, we have two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From case 1, we get:
- $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$
- $x + y = \pm 10$ or $x - y = \pm 10$

From case 2, we get:
- $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$
- $x = \pm 8$ or $y = \pm 8$

Now, we can find the vertices of the polygon by solving these equations. The vertices are:
- $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(2, 8)$, $(-2, 8)$, $(2, -8)$, $(-2, -8)$

To find the area of the polygon, we can use the formula for the area of a polygon given its vertices. The area of the polygon is 64 square units.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 64 square units.
The answer is: $64$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The equation given is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

This equation equals to zero if and only if both terms are zero. That is:

$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The solutions to these equations are:

$x + y = \pm 10$, $x - y = \pm 10$, $x = \pm 8$, and $y = \pm 8$.

These equations define a square with side length $16$ (the sum of the absolute values of the solutions for $x$ and $y$).

2. To calculate the area of the square, we use the formula for the area of a square which is side length squared. So, the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

Now, let's confirm this is a positive integer:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    # Side length of the square
    side_length = 16

    # Calculate the area of the square
    area = side_length ** 2

    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output

```
The area of the convex polygon is a positive integer, $256$. The answer is: $256$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The given equation is: $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

This equation equals to zero if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

Each of these equations is equal to zero if and only if the absolute value expressions are equal to zero, i.e., $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

These absolute value equations translate to the following:

1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ translates to $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
2. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ translates to $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
3. $\vert x \vert = 8$ translates to $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
4. $\vert y \vert = 8$ translates to $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

These equations represent the equations of lines and axes in the coordinate plane. The intersections of these lines and axes enclose a convex polygon.

To find the area of this polygon, we can visualize it as a square with sides of length 16 (since the maximum and minimum values for x and y are 8 and -8) minus the four right triangles in the corners, each with legs of length 10 (since the maximum and minimum values for $x+y$ and $x-y$ are 10 and -10).

The area of the square is $16 \times 16 = 256$.
The area of each right triangle is $\frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10 = 50$.
There are 4 right triangles, so the total area of the right triangles is $4 \times 50 = 200$.

The area of the convex polygon is the area of the square minus the total area of the right triangles, which is $256 - 200 = 56$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 56.
The answer is: $56$

If the product of two numbers is zero, then at least one of the numbers must be zero. Hence, the given equation is satisfied if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = \pm 10$.
If $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x - y = \pm 10$.
If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$, which implies $x = \pm 8$.
If $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $y = \pm 8$.

The solutions to these equations are the vertices of a square with side length 10, centered at the origin. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The given equation is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

This equation equals zero if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first equation to be zero, $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This forms a square with side length 10.

For the second equation to be zero, $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This forms a square with side length 8.

To find the area of the convex polygon, we add the areas of these two squares.

The area of a square with side length $a$ is $a^2$. Therefore, the area of the larger square is $10^2 = 100$ and the area of the smaller square is $8^2 = 64$.

Adding these two areas gives the total area of the convex polygon: $100 + 64 = 164$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 164. The answer is: $164$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation given is:

$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$

For the product of two numbers to be zero, either one of the numbers must be zero. Hence, either
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$$
or
$$((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$

The second equation implies that both $|x|$ and $|y|$ must be equal to $8$, which means $x = \pm8$ and $y = \pm8$. This gives us a square with side length $16$ and area $256$.

The first equation implies that both $|x + y|$ and $|x - y|$ must be equal to $10$. This gives us two cases:

1. $x + y = \pm10$ and $x - y = \pm10$. Adding these two equations gives $2x = \pm20$, so $x = \pm10$. Substituting $x = 10$ into the first equation gives $y = 0$. Substituting $x = -10$ into the first equation gives $y = 0$. This gives us two vertices of the square: $(10, 0)$ and $(-10, 0)$.

2. $x + y = \pm10$ and $x - y = \mp10$. Adding these two equations gives $2y = 0$, so $y = 0$. Substituting $y = 0$ into the first equation gives $x = \pm10$. This gives us two more vertices of the square: $(0, 10)$ and $(0, -10)$.

Thus, the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equation are the vertices of a square with side length $16$ and area $256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$
