Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $AB = 0$ is equivalent to $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. So the given equation is equivalent to either
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0\]
or
\[((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]
The first equation implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations gives the vertices of the square as $(0, 10)$, $(10, 0)$, $(0, -10)$, and $(-10, 0)$.
The second equation implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these four equations gives the vertices of the square as $(8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, $(-8, 0)$, and $(0, -8)$.
The two squares overlap along a square of side length $6$ centered at the origin, so the area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares minus twice the area of the overlapping square. The area of each of the larger squares is $10^2 = 100$, and the area of the overlapping square is $6^2 = 36$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $2 \cdot 100 - 2 \cdot 36 = 200 - 72 = 128$. The answer is: $128$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression equals zero if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$.
If $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = \pm 10$.
If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$.
If $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = \pm 8$.
Combining all these conditions, we find that the points $\left(x, y\right)$ that satisfy the equation are the vertices of a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, let's understand what the equation is saying. The equation is equal to zero, which means that one of the terms in the product must be zero. This gives us two separate conditions to consider.

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first condition, both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ must be zero. This means that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, as well as their opposites $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$.

For the second condition, both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2$ must be zero. This means that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$, as well as their opposites $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

These lines form a square with side length 10 (from the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$), and the vertices of the square are at $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

To find the area of this square, we simply square the length of one of its sides. The side length is 10, so the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
Each of these equations is satisfied if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The equations $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$ represent a square with side length 16 centered at the origin.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression equals zero if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The first two equations imply $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which are the equations of two lines passing through the origin with slopes $+1$ and $-1$.
The last two equations imply $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which are the equations of two lines parallel to the y-axis and x-axis, respectively, at a distance of 8 units from the origin.
The intersection of these lines form a square with side length 10 (since $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ imply that the distance from the origin to the point $(x, y)$ is always 10, and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ imply that the maximum distance from the origin to the point $(x, y)$ is 8, so the side length of the square is the difference of these two distances, which is 10).
The area of the square is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:
Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.
Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, and $(-10, 0)$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

Plotting these points on a coordinate plane, we find that the points form a square with side length 16.
To find the area of this square, we use the formula for the area of a square, which is side length squared.
The side length of the square is 16, so the area is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if both of the factors are equal to zero.
The first factor is equal to zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
These equations represent the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.
The second factor is equal to zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
These equations represent the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.
The intersection of these lines form a square with side length 16.
The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$.
The answer is: $256$
