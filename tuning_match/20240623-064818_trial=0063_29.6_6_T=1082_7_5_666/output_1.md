Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ subject to the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.

First, let's rewrite the constraint using the property $|a| + |b| = |a+b| + |a-b|/2$:

$|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |x-2y + y-2x| + |x-2y - (y-2x)|/2 = |3(y-x)| + |-x+3y|/2$.

According to the given constraint, $|3(y-x)| + |-x+3y|/2 = 40$.

Since both absolute values are nonnegative, we can rewrite the constraint as:
$3|y-x| + |y-x|/2 = 40$, which simplifies to $7|y-x|/2 = 40$.

Solving for $|y-x|$, we get $|y-x| = \frac{80}{7}$.

Now, let's find the expression we want to minimize: $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.

This expression can be rewritten as $5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x-y)^2 + 2xy] - 8xy = 5(x-y)^2 + 3xy$.

By the inequality of arithmetic and geometric means (AM-GM), we have $(x-y)^2 \geq 0$ and $xy \geq -\frac{(x-y)^2}{4}$.

Substituting this into our expression for $5(x-y)^2 + 3xy$, we get:
$5(x-y)^2 + 3xy \geq 5(x-y)^2 - 3 \cdot \frac{(x-y)^2}{4} = 5(x-y)^2 - \frac{3}{4}(x-y)^2 = \frac{17}{4}(x-y)^2$.

Now, we substitute $|y-x| = \frac{80}{7}$:
$\frac{17}{4}(x-y)^2 \geq \frac{17}{4} \cdot \left(\frac{80}{7}\right)^2 = \frac{17 \cdot 6400}{4 \cdot 49} = \frac{108800}{196}$.

The minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is achieved when the equalities hold in AM-GM, which means $x=y$.
In this case, $5(x-y)^2 + 3xy = 0$, so the minimum value is 0.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0. The answer is: 0.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we rewrite the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ using the absolute value property $|a|-|b| \leq |a-b|$. We get \[|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |x-2y| + |2x-y| = |x-2y| + |- (x-2y)| = 2|x-2y|.\]Hence, we have $2|x-2y| = 40$, so $|x-2y| = 20$. Now, we know that the expression inside the absolute value must be nonnegative or nonpositive, so we have two cases to consider:

1) $x - 2y \ge 0$. Then $|x-2y| = x-2y$, and we have $x - 2y = 20$, which gives $x = 2y + 20$.

2) $x - 2y < 0$. Then $|x-2y| = 2y - x$, and we have $2y - x = 20$, which gives $x = 2y - 20$.

Substitute $x = 2y + 20$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get
\[5(2y + 20)^2 + 5y^2 - 8(2y + 20)y = 20y^2 + 400y + 2000 + 5y^2 - 16y^2 - 160y = -y^2 + 240y + 2000.\]

Similarly, substitute $x = 2y - 20$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get
\[5(2y - 20)^2 + 5y^2 - 8(2y - 20)y = 20y^2 - 400y + 2000 + 5y^2 - 16y^2 + 160y = -y^2 - 240y + 2000.\]

Since $-y^2 + 240y + 2000$ and $-y^2 - 240y + 2000$ are both quadratic functions with a negative leading coefficient, they both have a maximum value. Let's find the maximum value of each function:

1) $-y^2 + 240y + 2000$: The maximum value occurs at $y = -\frac{b}{2a} = -\frac{240}{2(-1)} = 120$, so the maximum value is $-120^2 + 240*120 + 2000 = -14400 + 28800 + 2000 = 14400 + 2000 = 16400$.

2) $-y^2 - 240y + 2000$: The maximum value also occurs at $y = -\frac{b}{2a} = -\frac{-240}{2(-1)} = 120$, so the maximum value is $-120^2 - 240*120 + 2000 = -14400 - 28800 + 2000 = -14400 + 2000 = -12400$.

But since we are looking for the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we need to take the smaller of the two values, which is $-12400$. Hence, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $-12400$. The answer is: $\boxed{-12400}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's find the relationship between $x$ and $y$ from the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
Without loss of generality, we can assume that $x \geq y$ in $|x-2y|$. Then $|x-2y| = x - 2y$. Similarly, we can assume that $y \geq 2x$ in $|y-2x|$, so $|y-2x| = y - 2x$. Therefore, the equation becomes:
\[(x - 2y) + (y - 2x) = 40.\]
Simplifying the left side gives:
\[-x - y = 40.\]
Multiplying the entire equation by $-1$ gives:
\[x + y = -40.\]
Now, let's substitute $y = -40 - x$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
\[5x^2 + 5(-40 - x)^2 - 8x(-40 - x).\]
Simplifying the expression:
\[5x^2 + 5(1600 + 80x + x^2) + 320x + 8x^2.\]
Combining like terms:
\[5x^2 + 8000 + 400x + 5x^2 + 320x + 8x^2.\]
Combine like terms again:
\[18x^2 + 720x + 8000.\]
Now, we want to find the minimum value of this expression. To do this, we can complete the square:
\[18(x^2 + \frac{720}{18}x) + 8000 = 18(x^2 + 40x + 400) + 8000 - 18(400) = 18(x + 20)^2 + 2200.\]
The expression is minimized when $x = -20$ (since the term $18(x + 20)^2$ is always nonnegative), and when $y = -40 - (-20) = -20$. Now, substitute $x = -20$ and $y = -20$ into the original expression:
\[5(-20)^2 + 5(-20)^2 - 8(-20)(-20) = 2000 + 2000 - 3200 = 800.\]
Therefore, the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 800. The answer is: $800$

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2 - 11xy$. Using the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we know that $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2 = 40^2 = 1600$. Substituting this into the expression, we have $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2 - 11xy = 1600 - 11xy$.

We want to minimize this expression, so we need to find the maximum value of $11xy$. To do this, we know from the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality that $(x^2+y^2)(1+4) \ge (x+2y)^2$, which simplifies to $5(x^2+y^2) \ge (x+2y)^2$. Rearranging terms, we have $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2 \le 5(x^2+y^2)$, so from the given equation, we know that $1600 = (x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2 \le 5(x^2+y^2)$. Thus, $(x^2+y^2) \ge \frac{1600}{5} = 320$.

Multiplying by 11, we have $11xy \le \frac{11}{2} \sqrt{(x^2+y^2)(4x^2+4y^2)} = \frac{11}{2} \sqrt{5(x^2+y^2)^2} \le \frac{11}{2} \sqrt{5(320^2)} = 880\sqrt{5}$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $1600 - 880\sqrt{5}$. But this is not in the form of a positive numerical answer, so let's evaluate this expression:
\[1600 - 880\sqrt{5} \approx 1600 - 880 \times 7.071 \approx 1600 - 6228.8 \approx -4628.8.\]

This doesn't look right. Notice that the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ should be non-negative because it's a sum of squares. We made an error in applying the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. 

Let's reconsider the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality:
\[(x^2+y^2)(1+4) \ge (x\sqrt{1} + y\sqrt{4})^2 = (x+2y)^2.\]
This simplifies to $5(x^2+y^2) \ge (x+2y)^2$, so we should divide both sides by 5:
\[x^2+y^2 \ge \frac{(x+2y)^2}{5}.\]
Now when we go back to our original equation, we have $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2 \le 5(x^2+y^2) \le 5\left(\frac{(x+2y)^2}{5}\right) = (x+2y)^2$. Taking square roots of both sides gives
\[|(x-2y)| + |(y-2x)| = |x - 2y| + |2x - y| \le x+2y.\]
Now, recall that $|a| + |b| \ge |a + b|$ for all real numbers $a$ and $b$. So,
\[|x - 2y| + |2x - y| \ge |(x - 2y) + (2x - y)| = |3x - 3y| = 3|x - y|.\]
We have $3|x - y| \le |x - 2y| + |2x - y| = 40$. So $|x - y| \le \frac{40}{3}$.
Now, let's apply the Titu's Lemma to the inequality $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2 \le 5(x^2+y^2)$. We have
\[\frac{(x-2y)^2}{5} + \frac{(y-2x)^2}{5} \le x^2 + y^2.\]
But,
\[\frac{(x-2y)^2}{5} + \frac{(y-2x)^2}{5} = \frac{(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2}{5} = \frac{1600}{5} = 320.\]
So, $x^2 + y^2 \ge 320$. Now, let's multiply this inequality by $11$ to get $11xy$. But here is where we used the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality wrongly. Now instead, using the Titu's Lemma, we have
\[11xy \le \frac{11}{2} \sqrt{(x^2+y^2)(4x^2+4y^2)} = \frac{11}{2} \sqrt{5(x^2+y^2)^2} \le \frac{11}{2} \sqrt{5(320^2)} = 880\sqrt{5}.\]
So $11xy \le 880\sqrt{5}$. Finally, let's substitute these inequalities into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
\[5x^2+5y^2-8xy = (x^2+y^2) + 4(x^2+y^2) - 8xy \ge 320 + 4 \cdot 320 - 880\sqrt{5} = 1600 - 880\sqrt{5}.\]
So we made a mistake again. Our calculation seems correct but now we realize that we found the maximum of $-11xy$ instead of $11xy$. Let's reconsider the Titu's Lemma application to find an upper bound for $11xy$:
\[11xy \le \frac{11}{2} \sqrt{(x^2+y^2)(4x^2+4y^2)} = \frac{11}{2} \sqrt{5(x^2+y^2)^2} \le \frac{11}{2} \sqrt{5(320^2)} = 880\sqrt{5}.\]
This looks right because we got a positive value for the upper bound. So, now we have $11xy \le 880\sqrt{5}$. Substituting this into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get
\[5x^2+

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We can use the method of Lagrange multipliers to solve this problem. Define the function $F(x, y, \lambda) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy - \lambda(|x - 2y| + |y - 2x - 40)$.
We want to find the minimum value of $F(x, y, \lambda)$ when $(x, y)$ satisfies the constraint $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$.
Taking the partial derivatives of $F$ with respect to $x$, $y$, and $\lambda$, we get:
$$\frac{\partial F}{\partial x} = 10x - 8y - \lambda(-1 + 2\delta(y - 2x)) = 0,$$
$$\frac{\partial F}{\partial y} = 10y - 8x - \lambda(1 - 2\delta(x - 2y)) = 0,$$
$$\frac{\partial F}{\partial \lambda} = |x - 2y| + |y - 2x| - 40 = 0,$$
where $\delta(t)$ is the Dirac delta function, which is 1 if $t = 0$ and 0 otherwise.
From the first two equations, we have:
$$10x - 8y + \lambda = 0,$$
$$10y - 8x + \lambda = 0.$$
Adding these two equations, we get:
$$2(10x - 8y) + 2\lambda = 0 \Rightarrow 10x - 8y = -\lambda.$$
From the third equation, we know that $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$.
Using the properties of the absolute value, we have:
$$|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = \begin{cases} (x - 2y) + (y - 2x) = -y & \text{ if } x - 2y \geq 0 \text{ and } y - 2x \geq 0, \\ (2y - x) + (2x - y) = y & \text{ if } x - 2y < 0 \text{ and } y - 2x \geq 0, \\ (x - 2y) + (2x - y) = x & \text{ if } x - 2y \geq 0 \text{ and } y - 2x < 0, \\ (2y - x) + (y - 2x) = -x & \text{ if } x - 2y < 0 \text{ and } y - 2x < 0. \end{cases}$$
From the fourth equation, we get:
$$|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = \begin{cases} -y = 40 \Rightarrow y = -40, \\ y = 40. \end{cases}$$
Similarly, we can solve for $x$:
$$|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = \begin{cases} x = 40 \Rightarrow x = 40, \\ -x = 40 \Rightarrow x = -40. \end{cases}$$
But since $x$ and $y$ are both restricted to be real numbers, the only possible solutions are $(x, y) = (40, -40)$ or $(x, y) = (-40, 40)$.
Substituting these into $10x - 8y = -\lambda$, we get:
$$\lambda = 10x - 8y = 720 \text{ or } -720.$$
Since the constraint $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$ must be satisfied, we check the two possible solutions:
If $(x, y) = (40, -40)$, then $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = |-40| + |80| = 40 + 80 = 120$, which is not equal to 40.
If $(x, y) = (-40, 40)$, then $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = |-40| + |-80| = 40 + 80 = 120$, which is not equal to 40.
Therefore, there must be some mistake in our calculations.
However, upon revisiting the calculations, we realize that the Lagrange multiplier $\lambda$ is actually equal to 0, as it should be.
This indicates that the method of Lagrange multipliers may not have been the appropriate tool to solve this problem.
Instead, we can directly solve for the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ under the constraint $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$.
First, we can rewrite the constraint as $|x - 2y| = 40 - |y - 2x|$.
Now, let's consider two cases:
Case 1: $x - 2y \geq 0$ and $y - 2x \geq 0$.
In this case, $x - 2y = 40 - (y - 2x) \Rightarrow x - 2y = 40 - y + 2x \Rightarrow x = -y + 40.$
Substituting this into the expression to be minimized, we get:
$$5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = 5(-y + 40)^2 + 5y^2 - 8(-y + 40)y = 5(y^2 - 80y + 1600) + 5y^2 + 8y^2 - 640y = 18y^2 - 1440y + 8000.$$
To minimize this expression, we can find its derivative with respect to $y$ and set it equal to 0:
$$\frac{d}{dy}(18y^2 - 1440y + 8000) = 36y - 1440 = 0 \Rightarrow y = \frac{1440}{36} = 40.$$
Substituting this back into $x = -y + 40$, we get $x = -40 + 40 = 0$.
Therefore, one possible minimum point is $(x, y) = (0, 40)$.
Case 2: $x - 2y < 0$ and $y - 2x \geq 0$.
In this case, $- (x - 2y) = 40 - (y - 2x) \Rightarrow -x + 2y = 40 - y + 2x \Rightarrow 3x = 3y - 40.$
If $3x = 3y - 40$, then $x = y - \frac{4

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The given equation is $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. To simplify this, we know that $|a| + |b| = |a + b|$ if and only if $ab \geq 0$. Therefore, we must have $(x-2y)(y-2x) \geq 0$. Expanding the left side gives:
\[xy - 2x^2 - 2y^2 + 4xy = 5xy - 2x^2 - 2y^2 \geq 0.\]
\[5xy \geq 2x^2 + 2y^2 = 2(x^2 + y^2).\]
Now, let's look at the given expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, and try to rewrite it in terms of $2(x^2 + y^2)$. This is the job of the inequality we just obtained. We have:
\[5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 2\cdot 4xy + 8xy - 8xy = 5(x^2 + y^2) - 2(4xy - 4xy + 4xy) = 5(x^2 + y^2) - 2(5xy) \geq 5(x^2 + y^2) - 2\cdot 2(x^2 + y^2) = 5(x^2 + y^2) - 4(x^2 + y^2) = (5 - 4)(x^2 + y^2) = 1(x^2 + y^2) = x^2 + y^2.\]
Therefore, $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is at least as large as $x^2 + y^2$. However, we want the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, and for $x^2 + y^2$ to give us the minimum value is equivalent to $x = y = 0$. This is because for any other values of $x$ and $y$, $x^2 + y^2$ will be larger. If $x = y = 0$, then $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 0$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0. However, 0 is not an option for the minimum value of the given inequality $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. The minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ must be obtained from the relation $(x-2y)(y-2x) \geq 0$.

The relation can be re-written as:
\[xy - 2x^2 - 2y^2 + 4xy \geq 0 \implies 5xy \geq 2(x^2 + y^2).\]
Dividing both sides by $x^2 + y^2$, we get:
\[\frac{5xy}{x^2 + y^2} \geq 2 \implies 5\left(\frac{x}{y}\right) \geq 2 + 2\left(\frac{x}{y}\right).\]
Simplifying the above inequality gives:
\[3\left(\frac{x}{y}\right) \geq 2 \implies \frac{x}{y} \geq \frac{2}{3}.\]
Similarly, we get $\frac{y}{x} \geq \frac{3}{2}$.
Combining the above two inequalities, we find $\frac{x}{y} = \frac{2}{3}$ and $x = \frac{2}{3}y$. From the given equation, we have:
\[|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40.\]
We substitute $x = \frac{2}{3}y$ and simplify:
\[ \left|\frac{2}{3}y - 2y\right| + \left|y - \frac{4}{3}y\right| = 40 \implies \left|-\frac{y}{3}\right| + \left|\frac{y}{3}\right| = 40 \implies \frac{2y}{3} = 40 \implies y = 60.\]
Then, $x = \frac{2}{3}y = 40$. Hence, the pair $(x, y)$ which makes the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ true is $(x, y) = (40, 60)$. Now, we substitute these values back into the original expression to find its minimum value:
\[5(40)^2 + 5(60)^2 - 8(40)(60) = 8000 + 18000 - 19200 = 8000.\]
The minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the given constraint is 8000. Hence, the value of the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 8000. But this is obviously not the answer! Where did we go wrong?

The mistake we made in our approach was to assume that the minimum value will occur when $x = y = 0$. This is not necessarily true for this problem. The correct approach is to note that the function $f(x, y) = 5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is a convex function (the sum of squared terms is always convex), so its minimum value must occur at the boundary of the feasible region defined by the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. 

We know that at the minimum, the gradient of the function must be zero. So, we compute the gradient of $f(x, y)$: $\nabla f(x, y) = \left(10x - 8y, 10y - 8x\right)$. Setting this equal to zero gives us two equations: $10x - 8y = 0$ and $10y - 8x = 0$. Solving these equations simultaneously, we get $x = \frac{4}{3}y$. Then, substituting this into the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ gives $y = 30$ and $x = 40$.

Finally, substituting these values into the function $f(x, y)$, we get $f(40, 30) = 5(40)^2 + 5(30)^2 - 8(40)(30) = 8000$, so the minimum value of the function is indeed 8000. Hence, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the given constraint is 8000.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To begin, we can rewrite the condition as $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, we know that $|a| + |b| \geq |a + b|$, so we have
$|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| \geq |(x - 2y) + (y - 2x)| = |-x - y| = |x + y| = 40$.
Now let $S = x + y$, we have $S = 40$. Then $y = S - x$. Substituting into the given expression, we get
\begin{align*}
5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy &= 5x^2 + 5(S - x)^2 - 8x(S - x) \\
&= 5x^2 + 5(S^2 - 2Sx + x^2) - 8x(S - x) \\
&= 5x^2 + 5S^2 - 10Sx + 5x^2 - 8xS + 8x^2 \\
&= 10x^2 - 18xS + 5S^2 \\
&= 10x^2 - 18x(40) + 5(40)^2 \\
&= 10x^2 - 720x + 8000.
\end{align*}This is a quadratic function in terms of $x$, and its minimum value occurs at $x = \frac{-b}{2a} = \frac{720}{20} = 36$.
So the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is achieved when $x = 36$, and we can substitute this back into $S = x + y$ to find the corresponding value of $y$:
\[y = S - x = 40 - 36 = 4.\]Hence, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ occurs when $x = 36$ and $y = 4$. To find this minimum value, we simply substitute these values into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$:
\begin{align*}
5(36)^2 + 5(4)^2 - 8(36)(4) &= 5 \cdot 1296 + 5 \cdot 16 - 8 \cdot 144 \\
&= 6480 + 80 - 1152 \\
&= 5408.
\end{align*}Thus, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is 5408. The answer is: $5408$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We start by considering the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
This equation can be rewritten as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$,
which simplifies to $|x-2y| + |- (x-2y)| = 40$,
and further simplifies to $|x-2y| + |x-2y| = 40$,
which is simply $2|x-2y| = 40$,
or $|x-2y| = 20$.

Now, let $u = x - 2y$. Then the equation $|u| = 20$ means $-20 \le u \le 20$, or $-20 \le x - 2y \le 20$.
We can solve this double inequality for $x$ in terms of $y$: $-20 \le x - 2y \le 20$, which simplifies to $-20 + 2y \le x \le 20 + 2y$.

Now let's consider the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$.
We can rewrite this as $5(x^2 - 1.6xy + y^2) + y^2 = 5(x^2 - 1.6xy + 0.64y^2 + 0.64y^2 - y^2) + y^2 = 5[(x-0.8y)^2 + 0.64y^2 - y^2] + y^2 = 5[(x-0.8y)^2 - 0.36y^2] + y^2$.

Now let $v = x - 0.8y$. Then the expression becomes $5(v^2 - 0.36y^2) + y^2$.
We know that $-20 + 2y \le x \le 20 + 2y$, so $-20 + 2y \le x - 0.8y \le 20 + 2y$. Thus, $-20 + 2y \le v \le 20 + 2y$.

The expression $5(v^2 - 0.36y^2) + y^2$ is minimized when $v^2 - 0.36y^2$ is minimized, which happens when $v = 0$, or $x = 0.8y$. Substituting this into the inequalities, we get $-20 + 2y \le 0.8y \le 20 + 2y$. This simplifies to $-20 \le 0.2y \le 20$, or $-100 \le y \le 100$.

Now, let's substitute $x = 0.8y$ back into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$. This gives us $5(0.8y)^2 + 5y^2 - 8(0.8y)y = 3.2y^2 + 5y^2 - 6.4y^2 = 1.6y^2$.

Finally, substitute the value $y = \pm 100$ (which is the maximum value of $y$ in the range $-100 \le y \le 100$) into the expression $1.6y^2$. This gives us $1.6(100)^2 = 16000$.

So the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $-16000$.

However, this doesn't seem right since our calculations have some inaccuracies. Let's reexamine the equation $|x - 2y| + |2y - x| = 40$. If we set $x = 2y$, the equation simplifies to $|x| + |-x| = 40$, or $2|x| = 40$. Thus $|x| = 20$, which gives us two possibilities: $x = 20$ or $x = -20$. 
Similarly, if we set $2y = x$, we get $|y| + |-y| = 40$, or $2|y| = 40$, so $|y| = 20$, which also gives us two possibilities: $y = 20$ or $y = -20$. 
So, the possible pairs $(x, y)$ are $(20, 10), (20, -10), (-20, 10)$, and $(-20, -10)$. 
Now we substitute these pairs into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ and find the minimum value. 
If we calculate, we will find that the minimum value is actually $0$, not $-16000$. 
We must have made a mistake earlier in our calculations. We're getting confused because the original function $f(x,y) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ can be rewritten as 
\[f(x, y) = 5(x - 0.8y)^2 - 0.36 \cdot 5y^2 + y^2 = 5(x - 0.8y)^2 + 0.06y^2.\]
This shows that $f(x, y)$ is always non-negative, since both $5(x - 0.8y)^2 \geq 0$ and $0.06y^2 \geq 0$. Moreover, $f(x, y) = 0$ when $x - 0.8y = 0$ and $y = 0$. Hence, the minimum value of $f(x, y)$ under the given condition must be $0$. Therefore, the minimum value of the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 0. The answer is: 0

## QUESTION 1 - 8 
- TIME_SPENT : 391 secs

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we notice that $|x-2y| + |y-2x|$ is always equal to $0$ if $x=2y$ or $y=2x$.
So we try these two cases.
If $x=2y$, then $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 0$.
Substituting $x=2y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get:
$5(2y)^2+5y^2-8(2y)(y) = 20y^2 + 5y^2 - 16y^2 = 9y^2$.
If $y=2x$, then $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 0$.
Substituting $y=2x$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get:
$5x^2+5(2x)^2-8x(2x) = 5x^2 + 20x^2 - 16x^2 = 19x^2$.
Now we need to find the minimum value of $9y^2$ and $19x^2$ subject to the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
Since $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ holds true in both cases (with either $x=2y$ or $y=2x$),
the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ will be the smaller of $9y^2$ and $19x^2$.
We calculate the value of $9y^2$ and $19x^2$.
Since $y^2$ and $x^2$ are both non-negative, the smaller value will be $9y^2$ when $y=0$. This gives a value of 0.
The smaller value will be $19x^2$ when $x=0$. This gives a value of 0.
Therefore, both $9y^2$ and $19x^2$ are equal to 0. The smallest value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0 when $x$ and $y$ satisfy $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
The answer is: $0$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we have $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, we know that $|a+b| \leq |a| + |b|$ for all real numbers $a$ and $b$. So we have
$$|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |x-2y| + |2x-y| \geq |x-2y + (2x-y)| = |3x-3y| = 3|x-y|.$$
Since $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we have $3|x-y| = 40$, or $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$.
Now let $A = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix}$, then $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$ becomes $|A - \begin{pmatrix} y \\ x \end{pmatrix}| = \frac{40}{3}$, or $|A - \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}| = \frac{40}{3}$. This is the equation of a circle centered at $\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$ with radius $\frac{40}{3}$.
Now we want to minimize the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite this as $(5x^2 - 8xy + 5y^2) = (x-y)^2 + 4xy - 8xy + 4y^2 = (x-y)^2 - 4xy + 4y^2 = (x-y)^2 - 4(x-y)(y-x) = (x-y)^2 + 4(x-y)(y-x)$. We substitute $x-y = \frac{40}{3}$, to get $\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 + 4\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)(-1) \cdot (x-y)$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 - 4\cdot \frac{40}{3} \cdot \frac{40}{3} = \frac{1600}{9} - \frac{6400}{9} = -\frac{4800}{9}$. However, the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is clearly nonnegative for all real numbers $x$ and $y$. This contradiction arises because our substitution of $x-y$ was incorrect. Instead, we should have $x-y = \frac{40}{3}$ or $y-x = \frac{40}{3}$.

By substituting $x-y = \frac{40}{3}$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get $\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 + 4\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)(y-x)$. To minimize this expression, we should choose $y-x = -\frac{40}{3}$. Then the expression becomes $\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 + 4\left(\frac{40}{3}\right) \cdot -\left(\frac{40}{3}\right) = 0$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0.
The answer is: $0$
