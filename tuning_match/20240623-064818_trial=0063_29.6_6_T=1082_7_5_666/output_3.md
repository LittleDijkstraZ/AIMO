Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$

In order for the product of two numbers to be zero, either one of them must be zero. Therefore, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0.$

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then it must be the case that both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies that $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$. This corresponds to the equation of a square with side length 10. The square has vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then it must be the case that both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies that $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. This corresponds to a square centered at the origin with side length 16. The square has vertices at $(8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, $(-8, 0)$, and $(0, -8)$.

Thus the two squares overlap at the center of the two squares, i.e., the point $(0, 0)$. The area of the convex polygon formed by the intersection of the two squares is the area of the larger square minus the area of the smaller square.

The side length of the larger square is $16$ so its area is $16^2 = 256$. The side length of the smaller square is $10$ so its area is $10^2 = 100$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $256 - 100 = 156$. So, the value of the area is $\boxed{156}$. The answer is: $156$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points that satisfy the given equation, we need to first find the points that satisfy the equation.
From the equation, we can see that both the expressions within the parentheses must be equal to zero for the equation to hold true.
For the first expression, we have two cases:
Case 1: $|x + y| - 10 = 0$, which implies $|x + y| = 10$, so $x + y = \pm10$.
Case 2: $|x - y| - 10 = 0$, which implies $|x - y| = 10$, so $x - y = \pm10$.
For the second expression, we also have two cases:
Case 3: $|x| - 8 = 0$, which implies $|x| = 8$, so $x = \pm8$.
Case 4: $|y| - 8 = 0$, which implies $|y| = 8$, so $y = \pm8$.
To summarize the results from the above cases, we have the following combinations of $x$ and $y$:
$x = \pm8$, $y = \pm8$; $x + y = \pm10$, $x - y = \pm10$.
The resulting points are: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, $(10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(0, -10)$.
These points form a square with side length 16 (since the distance between $(8, 8)$ and $(8, -8)$ is 16, or the distance between $(8, 8)$ and $(-8, 8)$ is 16).
The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points that satisfy the equation is 256.
The answer is: 256

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, let's consider the equations inside the parentheses separately:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ imply that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us four lines: $x+y=10$, $x+y=-10$, $x-y=10$, and $x-y=-10$. These lines form a square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$.

2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ imply that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us four lines: $x=8$, $x=-8$, $y=8$, and $y=-8$. These lines form a square with side length $16$.

The intersection of these two squares is the region enclosed by the convex polygon. To find the area of this convex polygon, we first need to find the side length of the smaller square. Since the side length of the smaller square is the distance between the lines $x+y=10$ and $x-y=10$ (or $x+y=-10$ and $x-y=-10$), we can find it using the point-to-line distance formula. For example, the distance between the lines $x+y=10$ and $x-y=10$ is given by $\frac{|10-(-10)|}{\sqrt{1^2+(-1)^2}} = \frac{20}{\sqrt{2}} = 10\sqrt{2}$.

Therefore, the side length of the smaller square is $10\sqrt{2}$. Now we can find the area of the smaller square. The area is $(10\sqrt{2})^2 = 200$.

The area of the convex polygon is 200 square units. The answer is: $\boxed{200}$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


A value is zero if and only if one or more of the values that are multiplied are zero.
Thus, a point $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfies the equation if and only if it either satisfies $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. Each of these is equivalent to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$, respectively. These are the equations of lines in the plane, and if we graph all these lines and shade the enclosed area, we find a convex polygon.
$\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$, which form a rectangle.
$\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ gives us four more lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$, which form a square.
Shading the enclosed area, we see that the convex polygon is a square with side length 10. The area of a square with side length s is $s^2$, so the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. So the area of this convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $A \cdot B = 0$ means that at least one of the products $A=0$ or $B=0$ must be zero.
If any one of $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ is satisfied, the entire equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ will be zero.
The equalities $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ , $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ , $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ , $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ happen when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, $\vert y \vert = 8$ respectively.
The system of equations can be broken into four groups for solutions
1) $x+y = \pm 10$
2) $x-y = \pm 10$
3) $x = \pm 8$
4) $y = \pm 8$
1) For the first two equations, we have a diamond shape for each, the vertices of which are $(\pm 10,0)$,$(0,\pm10)$. The combined solution area is then a square with side length $20$ and thus area $400$.
2) The third and fourth equations yield a square with vertices at $(\pm 8,0)$,$(0,\pm8)$, with side length $16$ and area $256$.
Combining the results from all groups, the total area of the figure is indeed the area enclosed by both the squares which we calculated.
So $400 + 256 =656$ square units is the area enclosed by the polygon, the question asked for. Our final answer is: $656$.
The answer is: $656$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation given, $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$, is satisfied only if either one of the factors is equal to zero. This means either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. The square of the absolute value of a number is always nonnegative, and the sum of two nonnegative numbers is zero if and only if each number is zero. Thus, we must have:

1. $|x+y| = 10$ and $|x-y| = 10$
2. $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$

The first condition implies that $x+y = \pm 10$ and $x-y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the following corners of the polygon: $(0,10)$, $(0,-10)$, $(10,0)$, and $(-10,0)$. The second condition implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Adding the resulting corners, we find a total of 8 corners: $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, $(-8,-8)$, $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$. 

By plotting these points on the coordinate plane, we recognize that they form a square with side length $16$. The area of a square is the square of the length of one of its sides, so the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. 
The answer is: $256$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points satisfying the equation, we first need to understand the equation and its implications on the values of $x$ and $y$.
The equation is 
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]
For the product of two terms to be zero, one or both terms must be zero. That is, one of the following two conditions must be met:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, or
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first condition to be met, we must have both $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means the sum of the absolute values of the $x$ and $y$ values is 10, and the absolute value of the difference between $x$ and $y$ is also 10. This implies that $x$ and $y$ must be either both 5 or both -5. So the points lie on the lines $x+y=10$, $x+y=-10$, $x-y=10$, or $x-y=-10$.

For the second condition to be met, we must have both $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x$ and $y$ must be either both 8 or both -8. So the points also lie on the lines $x=8$, $x=-8$, $y=8$, or $y=-8$.

Therefore, the convex polygon is formed by the intersections of these lines. These lines form a square with side length 10. The area of the square is side length squared, which is $10^2=100$. The answer is: $\boxed{100}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation is equal to zero only when at least one of the factors is equal to zero. This gives us four cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8) = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8) = 0$.
2. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8) = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8) \neq 0$.
3. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8) \neq 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8) = 0$.
4. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8) \neq 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8) \neq 0$.

By considering these four cases, we find that the solution region is the square with vertices at $\left(8, 8\right)$, $\left(8, -8\right)$, $\left(-8, 8\right)$, and $\left(-8, -8\right)$. The side length of the square is $16$, so the area is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $256$ square units.
The answer is: $\boxed{256}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The product of two real numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the equation $AB = 0$ is equivalent to $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Applying this to the given equation, we get that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
For the first equation to hold, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This describes a square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$, hence its area is $(10\sqrt{2})^2 = 200$.
For the second equation to hold, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This describes a square with side length $16$, hence its area is $16^2 = 256$.
The total area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares, which is $200 + 256 = \boxed{456}$. The answer is: 456

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we notice that the product of two quantities is zero if and only if at least one of the quantities is zero. Therefore, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. 
If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies that $x$ and $y$ are both $5$ or both $-5$. If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that $x$ is in $[-8,8]$ and $y$ is in $[-8,8]$. 
The points $(x,y)$ that satisfy both conditions are the points in the square formed by the vertices $(-8, -8), (-8, 8), (8, 8), (8, -8)$, and the points that satisfy exactly one of the conditions are the points in the two rhombuses formed by the vertices $(-5,-5), (-5,5), (5,5), (5,-5)$, $(-5,-5), (-5,-5), (5,5), (5,5)$ and $(-5,5), (-5,-5), (5,-5), (5,5)$, respectively.
The intersection of these four figures is just the four vertices $(-5,-5), (-5,5), (5,5), (5,-5)$. 

Hence, the area of the convex polygon is the area of the square minus the areas of the two rhombuses, which is $64 - 2(60) = 64 - 120 = -56$. 
However, since area cannot be negative, there must have been an error in our calculations.

Upon revisiting the problem, we realize that the given equation actually does not have the solutions that we found. Instead, we should consider the conditions: 
$$(1) \quad (\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \text{ or } ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$$ $$(2) \quad (\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \text{ or } ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$$
If $(1)$ holds, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm10$ or $x - y = \pm10$. 
If $(2)$ holds, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm8$ or $y = \pm8$.
The intersection of these conditions is the four vertices $(-5,-5), (-5,5), (5,5), (5,-5)$, which are also the vertices of the square with side length $10$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of the square, which is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The absolute value equation $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ gives two lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$. The absolute value equation $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ gives two lines $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$. The absolute value equation $\vert x \vert = 8$ gives two lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$. The absolute value equation $\vert y \vert = 8$ gives two lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $\left(8,8\right)$, $\left(8,-8\right)$, $\left(-8,8\right)$, and $\left(-8,-8\right)$. The length of the rectangle is $16$ and the width is $16$, so the area of the rectangle is $16 \times 16 = 256$. The answer is: 256$
