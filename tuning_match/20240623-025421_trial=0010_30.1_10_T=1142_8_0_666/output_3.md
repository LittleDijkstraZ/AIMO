Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Approach:


The equation $AB = 0$ is satisfied if either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. So we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first case, both terms must be equal to zero:

$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10 \Rightarrow x + y = \pm 10$.
$(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x - y \vert = 10 \Rightarrow x - y = \pm 10$.

The solution of these two equations is a square with side length 20. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.

For the second case, both terms must be equal to zero:

$(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8 \Rightarrow x = \pm 8$.
$(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert y \vert = 8 \Rightarrow y = \pm 8$.

The solution of these two equations is a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

Since the area of the first square (400) is greater than the area of the second square (256), the area of the convex polygon is 256.

The answer is: $256$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:


The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied only when either of the two factors is zero. 
For the first factor to be zero, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x$ and $y$ are both $5$ or both $-5$. 
For the second factor to be zero, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x$ is in the range $[-8, 8]$ and $y$ is in the range $[-8, 8]$. 
Combining these two conditions, we get four points: $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, and $(-5,-5)$. 
The points form a square with side length $10$, so its area is $10^2 = 100$. 
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $100$. The answer is: $100$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

Approach:


The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. Therefore, either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. We will consider each case and find the solution set for each.

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
This equation is satisfied only when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ are such that the sum of the absolute values of their coordinates is always 10. This represents a square with side length 10 and a diagonal of 10*sqrt(2).

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
This equation is satisfied only when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ are such that the absolute values of their coordinates are always 8. This represents a square with side length 16 and a diagonal of 16*sqrt(2).

The intersection of the two cases is a smaller square that is inscribed in the larger square. The side length of the smaller square is the diagonal of the smaller square divided by sqrt(2). So, the side length of the smaller square is 10. The area of the convex polygon is the area of the larger square minus the area of the smaller square.

The area of the larger square is $16^2 = 256$. The area of the smaller square is $10^2 = 100$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $256 - 100 = 156$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 156 square units.

Note: The exact steps to solve this problem might vary, but the general approach would involve understanding the conditions given in the problem and finding the corresponding sets of points. Then, one would determine the intersection of these sets to obtain the polygon enclosed by the points and calculate its area.

The answer is: $156$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

Approach:



The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ equals to 0 if and only if at least one of the two products is zero, i.e., $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$, which gives us the vertices of a square with side length 10. The area of the square is $10^2 = 100$.

For the second case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us another square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

However, since both cases are included in the original equation, the total area of the convex polygon formed by the union of the two squares is $100 + 256 = 356$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 356. The answer is: $\boxed{356}$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:



The equation given is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$

This equation equals to zero if either of the two terms equals to zero. 

The first term $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that either $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$, and either $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$. Solving these four equations we get the vertices of the rectangle.

The second term $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that either $x = 8$ or $x = -8$, and either $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. Solving these four equations we get the vertices of the square.

By calculating the vertices of the rectangle and the square, we can find the intersection points. These intersection points will be the vertices of the polygon.

The area of the polygon can be found by calculating the area of the rectangle and subtracting the area of the square (since the polygon is the intersection of the rectangle and the square).

The rectangle has vertices at $(10,0)$, $(0,10)$, $(-10,0)$, and $(0,-10)$. The square has vertices at $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$. 

The intersection points are $(10,0)$, $(0,10)$, $(-10,0)$, and $(0,-10)$ for the rectangle, and $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$ for the square. The polygon formed by the intersection of these two shapes is a square with side length 10.

The area of a square is given by side length squared, so the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 100.

The answer is: $100$.

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:


The given equation is a product of two terms, each of which must be equal to zero for the equation to hold. This means that either of the two terms is zero, or both are zero.

The two terms are:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$$
and
$$((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$$

If either of the terms is zero, then the values of x and y that satisfy the equation are the solutions to the equations:

1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$
2. $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$

The first set of equations represent a square with side length 10, centered at the origin. The vertices of this square are at $(\pm 10, 0)$, $(0, \pm 10)$.

The second set of equations represent a square with side length 16, centered at the origin. The vertices of this square are at $(\pm 8, 0)$, $(0, \pm 8)$.

The intersection of these two squares is a smaller square with side length 8, centered at the origin. The vertices of this square are at $(\pm 4, 0)$, $(0, \pm 4)$.

The area of the smaller square is $8^2 = 64$.

The answer is: $\boxed{64}$

Approach:



The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This happens when $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. We can solve these equations to get the vertices of the square. Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. We can also solve these equations to get the vertices of the square.

The vertices of the first square are $(10, 0), (0, 10), (-10, 0), (0, -10)$.
The vertices of the second square are $(8, 0), (0, 8), (-8, 0), (0, -8)$.

The intersection of these two squares is a smaller square with side length 6. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $6^2 = 36$. The answer is: $36$

Approach:

 The equation given in the problem is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either one of the expressions is zero, or both are zero. The expressions inside the absolute values make them always nonnegative, so the only way for the product to be zero is if both expressions are zero. Therefore, we need to solve the following two systems of equations:

1) $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$.
2) $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.

The solutions to these systems of equations will give us the vertices of the polygon. Once we have all the vertices, we can use a formula to compute the area of the polygon.

Let's solve the first system of equations:
$\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ gives $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, so $x + y = \pm 10$.
$\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$ gives $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, so $x - y = \pm 10$.

These equations form a system of four equations:
1. $x + y = 10$
2. $x + y = -10$
3. $x - y = 10$
4. $x - y = -10$

Solving these, we get the vertices:
1. $(5, 5)$
2. $(-5, -5)$
3. $(9, -1)$
4. $(-9, 1)$

The second system of equations:
$\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ gives $\vert x \vert = 8$, so $x = \pm 8$.
$\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$ gives $\vert y \vert = 8$, so $y = \pm 8$.

So we have the vertices $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

Combining all the vertices, we get a total of eight vertices: $(5, 5)$, $(-5, -5)$, $(9, -1)$, $(-9, 1)$, $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

Since the polygon is symmetric about the x and y axes, we only need to compute the area of the polygon enclosed by the vertices $(5, 5)$, $(-5, -5)$, $(9, -1)$, and $(-9, 1)$, and then multiply the result by 4.

The area of the polygon can be computed using the Shoelace formula. For the vertices $(5, 5)$, $(-5, -5)$, $(9, -1)$, and $(-9, 1)$, the Shoelace formula gives an area of 160 square units.

Multiplying this by 4, we get a total area of $4 \times 160 = 640$ square units. So the area of the convex polygon is 640 square units.
The answer is: $\boxed{640}$

Approach:



The equation is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. For the product of two numbers to be 0, either one of them has to be 0. This gives us two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$.
In this case, both $\vert x + y \vert - 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10$ must be 0. This means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only way this can happen is if $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$. So we have four vertices of the polygon: $(10, 10), (10, -10), (-10, 10), (-10, -10)$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
In this case, both $\vert x \vert - 8$ and $\vert y \vert - 8$ must be 0. This means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The only way this can happen is if $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So we have four additional vertices of the polygon: $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$.

The polygon formed by these eight points is a square with side length 20. The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.

The Python code to calculate the area of the polygon is:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    side_length = 20
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)

The area of the convex polygon is $400$. The answer is: $\boxed{400}$.

Approach:


The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These conditions can only be satisfied when $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$. Therefore, the four points $(10, 10)$, $(10, -10)$, $(-10, 10)$, and $(-10, -10)$ are the vertices of the square.

Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, meaning that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Therefore, the four points $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$ are also the vertices of the square.

In both cases, the square has side length of 20 units. The area of a square is given by the square of its side length, so the area of this convex polygon is $20^2 = 400$ square units.
