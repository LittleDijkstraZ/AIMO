Approach:


To have 4 distinct solutions for the equation $ \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100} $,
the value of $ \frac{m}{100} $ must be chosen such that it splits the graph of $ \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert $ into 4 separate regions.
The graph of $ \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert $ consists of three line segments with slopes of $ \pm 1 $ and $ 0 $.
To have 4 distinct solutions, the value of $ \frac{m}{100} $ should be between the slopes of the middle two segments, i.e., $ 0 < \frac{m}{100} < 1 $.
Therefore, the value of $ m $ should be between $ 0 $ and $ 100 $.
The number of positive integers $ m $ in this range is $ 100 $.
The value of $ m $ can be any positive integer from $ 1 $ to $ 100 $.
Therefore, there are $ 100 $ positive integers $ m $ for which the equation has $ 4 $ distinct solutions. The answer is: $100$

Approach:


We will start by analyzing the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] and find the possible values of $m$ such that it has $4$ distinct solutions.

1. First, we need to consider the right-hand side of the equation. Since $\frac{m}{100}$ is positive, $m$ must be a positive integer.
2. Next, we need to analyze the absolute value inside the absolute value. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be rewritten as $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \pm\frac{m}{100}$.
3. This leads to two equations: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.
4. Solving these equations, we can find the possible values of $m$ that make the original equation have $4$ distinct solutions.

Solution:
After analyzing the equations and solving them, we find that the only positive integer $m$ that makes the equation have $4$ distinct solutions is $m=200$. So, there is only one positive integer $m$ that satisfies the condition, namely $m=200$. The answer is: $1$

The equation $||x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 2 and 3. This is because $||x-1|-2|$ is a function that has four distinct solutions if and only if its right-hand side is strictly between 2 and 3.

So we need to solve the inequality $2<\frac{m}{100}<3$. Multiplying all sides by 100 gives $200<m<300$.

The positive integers $m$ in this range are the integers from 201 to 299, inclusive. To find the number of these integers, we subtract the smallest integer in the range from the largest integer in the range and add 1. So the number of positive integers $m$ is $299 - 201 + 1 = 99$.

Therefore, there are 99 positive integers $m$ for which the equation $||x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions.
The answer is: $99$

Approach:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is less than $2$ but greater than or equal to $0$. This gives us the inequality $0 \leq \frac{m}{100} < 2$.

Solving this inequality gives us:

\[0 \leq \frac{m}{100} < 2 \implies 0 \leq m < 200.\]

Since $m$ must be a positive integer, the possible values for $m$ are $1, 2, ..., 199$.

Now, we need to count the number of these values of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions. This can be done by examining the form of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.

This equation has 4 distinct solutions when the right-hand side, $\frac{m}{100}$, is strictly between the two transition points of the absolute value function on the left-hand side. The transition points occur when $\vert x - 1 \vert - 2$ equals zero and when $\vert x - 1 \vert - 2$ equals negative.

Setting $\vert x - 1 \vert - 2 = 0$, we get $\vert x - 1 \vert = 2$, which gives us two equations: $x - 1 = 2$ and $x - 1 = -2$. Solving these gives us $x = 3$ and $x = -1$. These are the transition points of the left-hand side of the equation.

Setting $\vert x - 1 \vert - 2 = -1$, we get $\vert x - 1 \vert = 1$, which gives us two more equations: $x - 1 = 1$ and $x - 1 = -1$. Solving these gives us $x = 2$ and $x = 0$. These are the other two transition points of the left-hand side of the equation.

The four distinct solutions occur when $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $2$. This gives us the inequality $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Solving this inequality gives us:

\[1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2 \implies 100 < m < 200.\]

The positive integer values of $m$ that satisfy this inequality are exactly the integers from $101$ to $199$, inclusive. There are $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$ such integers.

So, there are $99$ positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.
The answer is: $99$

The equation $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions, if and only if $\frac{m}{100}=2$. So, we have $m=200$. We need to check if this value of $m$ satisfies the conditions of the problem.

Solution:
We can see that if $m=200$, then the equation becomes $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|=\frac{200}{100}=2$. Now, we need to solve the equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2=2$ and $\vert x-1 \vert -2=-2$.

For $\vert x-1 \vert -2=2$, we have $\vert x-1 \vert =4$. This gives us two equations: $x-1=4$ and $x-1=-4$. Solving these equations, we get $x=5$ and $x=-3$.

For $\vert x-1 \vert -2=-2$, we have $\vert x-1 \vert =0$. This gives us one equation: $x-1=0$, and the solution is $x=1$.

So, for $m=200$, we have 4 distinct solutions: $x=-3$, $x=1$, $x=5$. Thus, the value $m=200$ satisfies the conditions of the problem.

Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions, and that value is $m=200$. The answer is: $1$

Approach:



In order for the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ to have 4 distinct solutions, the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be a value that splits the graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ into 4 distinct sections. 

The graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a V-shape with a minimum at $x=1$. The value inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, is 0 when $x=3$ and changes sign when $x=1$. So, the graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is 0 at $x=3$, and increases as $x$ moves left or right from $x=3$.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is in the range $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$.

This means $0 < m < 200$.

The number of positive integer values of $m$ in this range is the number of integers from 1 to 199, which is 199.

So, the number of positive integer values of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 199.

The value of $m$ that satisfies this condition is 199. The answer is: $199$

Approach:


To find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions,
we need to analyze the behavior of the equation.

The expression inside the absolute value, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, can be equal to $\frac{m}{100}$ in four different ways:

1. When $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$,
2. When $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = \frac{m}{100}$,
3. When $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$,
4. When $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.

For each of these cases, we need to find the number of solutions for $x$.

Solving these cases will lead to different intervals for $x$ and the corresponding values of $m$.

By analyzing the number of solutions for each case and combining the results, we can find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions.

Python Script:
In this problem, we don't need to write a python script as the problem can be solved analytically.

However, if you want to write a python script to find the answer, you can use the following approach:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def count_solutions():
    count = 0
    for m in range(1, 101):
        # Analyze the equation for each value of m
        # If the equation has 4 distinct solutions, increment the count
    return count

result = count_solutions()
print(result)
```

```
The Python script above does not work as intended because it does not properly set up the loop to check each value of $m$.

The analytical solution to this problem is given in the answer.
The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $1$. The answer is $\boxed{1}$.

Assistant:

Approach:


To begin with, we consider the right hand side of the equation $\frac{m}{100}$. Since $m$ is a positive integer, $\frac{m}{100}$ is a positive number that can be as small as $\frac{1}{100}$ and can be as large as we want, depending on how large $m$ gets.

On the left hand side, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a function that takes on values between $0$ and $3$ and is piecewise linear with four segments. It equals $0$ when $x=3$, equals $1$ when $1<x<3$, equals $2$ when $x=1$, and equals $3$ when $-1<x<1$. It is a V-shaped function with the vertex at $(1, 2)$.

Now we want the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ to have $4$ distinct solutions. This means that $\frac{m}{100}$ must be a number in the interval $(1, 2)$, because only in this interval does the left hand side of the equation have $4$ distinct solutions. Therefore, we must have $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$.

This inequality is equivalent to $100 < m < 200$. The positive integers that satisfy this inequality are the integers from $101$ to $199$, inclusive. There are $100$ such integers.
The answer is: $100$.

Approach:


We start by observing that the left-hand side of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is a non-negative quantity, and the right-hand side is a positive quantity. Therefore, the number of solutions of this equation is the same as the number of positive integer values of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions.

We can rewrite the equation as $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.
To count the number of solutions, we consider the different cases of the absolute value signs:
1. If $x \geq 1$, then we have $\vert x-1 -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\vert x-3 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. This gives two equations: $x-3 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $-(x-3) = \frac{m}{100}$, or $x=3+\frac{m}{100}$ and $x=3-\frac{m}{100}$.
2. If $0 \leq x < 1$, then we have $\vert -x+1 -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\vert -x-1 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. This gives two equations: $-x-1 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $-( -x-1 ) = \frac{m}{100}$, or $x=-1-\frac{m}{100}$ and $x=-1+\frac{m}{100}$.
3. If $x < 0$, then we have $\vert -x-1 -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\vert -x-3 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. This gives two equations: $-x-3 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $-( -x-3 ) = \frac{m}{100}$, or $x=-3-\frac{m}{100}$ and $x=-3+\frac{m}{100}$.

For each case, we need to find the range of $m$ for which the two resulting equations have 4 distinct solutions.
We can observe that each case will give 2 solutions for a given value of $m$, and we want 4 distinct solutions in total. Therefore, we need exactly 2 solutions from each case.

For the first case, $x=3+\frac{m}{100}$ and $x=3-\frac{m}{100}$, the second equation will have a solution only if $\frac{m}{100} \leq 3$, or $m \leq 300$. Similarly, for the second case, $x=-1+\frac{m}{100}$ and $x=-1-\frac{m}{100}$, the second equation will have a solution only if $\frac{m}{100} \geq 1$, or $m \geq 100$. And for the third case, $x=-3+\frac{m}{100}$ and $x=-3-\frac{m}{100}$, the second equation will have a solution only if $\frac{m}{100} \geq 3$, or $m \geq 300$.

Combining these inequalities, we see that the value of $m$ that satisfies all three cases is $100 \leq m \leq 300$. The number of positive integers in this range is $300 - 100 + 1 = 201$. However, this count includes the case where $m=200$, which gives only 3 distinct solutions (two from the first case and one from the second case). Therefore, we need to subtract this case and add the case where $m=0$, which gives only 2 distinct solutions (one from each case). So the final count of positive integer values of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is $201 - 1 + 1 = 201$.
The answer is: $201$

First, observe that the equation $|\vert x - 1 \vert - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is less than $2$ but greater than or equal to $0$. This is because the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert - 2$, can take on values in the range $[-2, 2]$. So $\frac{m}{100}$ must be in this range to allow for 4 distinct solutions.

This gives us the inequality $0 \leq \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Multiplying through by $100$ to clear the fraction gives $0 \leq m < 200$.

Now, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ in this range. The integers are $1, 2, 3, ..., 199$, so there are $199$ such integers. Therefore, there are $199$ values of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions. The answer is: $199$

Assistant:

Approach:


We need to find the value of $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

Step 1: Simplify the equation
The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be simplified as follows:

1. For $\vert x-1 \vert -2 \geq 0$, we have $\vert x-1 \vert -2=\frac{m}{100}$, which gives us $\vert x-1 \vert = 2+\frac{m}{100}$.
2. For $\vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0$, we have $-( \vert x-1 \vert -2 )=\frac{m}{100}$, which gives us $\vert x-1 \vert = 2-\frac{m}{100}$.

Step 2: Find the solutions
The equation $\vert x-1 \vert = 2+\frac{m}{100}$ has two solutions: $x=3+\frac{m}{100}$ and $x=-1+\frac{m}{100}$.
The equation $\vert x-1 \vert = 2-\frac{m}{100}$ has two solutions: $x=3-\frac{m}{100}$ and $x=-1-\frac{m}{100}$.

Step 3: Count the distinct solutions
To have $4$ distinct solutions, the values of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be positive and smaller than $2$. This gives us $0< \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which simplifies to $0 < m < 200$.

Step 4: Count the positive integers in the interval $(0, 200)$
The number of positive integers in the interval $(0, 200)$ is $199$.

So, the value of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $199$. The answer is: $199$

Assistant:

Approach:



Firstly, let's observe the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] and notice that the left hand side of the equation is a piecewise function with four cases to consider:

1. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 \geq 0$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \vert x-1 \vert - 2$. The equation becomes $\vert x-1 \vert - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$.

2. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = -( \vert x-1 \vert - 2) = 2 - \vert x-1 \vert$. The equation becomes $2 - \vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$.

For each of these cases, we need to solve for $x$ and find the number of distinct solutions that satisfy the equation.

Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$. We can rewrite this as $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. Then we have two subcases to consider:

a) $x-1 \geq 0$, which gives $x - 1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, or $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.

b) $x-1 < 0$, which gives $-(x - 1) = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, or $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

For each value of $m$, we can solve for $x$ in these two subcases and check how many distinct solutions we get.

Case 2: $2 - \vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$. We can rewrite this as $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. Then we have two subcases to consider:

a) $x-1 \geq 0$, which gives $x - 1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, or $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.

b) $x-1 < 0$, which gives $-(x - 1) = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, or $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

For each value of $m$, we can solve for $x$ in these two subcases and check how many distinct solutions we get.

By checking the number of distinct solutions for each value of $m$, we can determine for how many values of $m$ the equation has exactly 4 distinct solutions.

Solution:

After checking the number of distinct solutions for each value of $m$, we find that the equation has 4 distinct solutions when $m=100$. So the answer is $1$. The answer is: $1$
