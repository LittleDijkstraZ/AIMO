This problem involves finding the minimum value of a function subject to a constraint. We can use the method of Lagrange multipliers to solve this problem. First, let's rewrite the constraint as $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. We can express this as a system of equations:

1. $x - 2y + y - 2x = 40$, if $x \geq 2y$ and $y \geq 2x$.
2. $x - 2y - (y - 2x) = 40$, if $x \geq 2y$ and $y < 2x$.
3. $-x + 2y + y - 2x = 40$, if $x < 2y$ and $y \geq 2x$.
4. $-x + 2y - (y - 2x) = 40$, if $x < 2y$ and $y < 2x$.

Solving these four systems of equations, we find that the only solution that satisfies all of them is $x=10$ and $y=5$.

Now, we can substitute these values into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:

\[5(10)^2 + 5(5)^2 - 8(10)(5) = 500 + 125 - 400 = 325.\]

So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 325. The answer is: $\boxed{325}$.

Approach:


This problem involves two variables $x$ and $y$, and we are given an equation involving absolute values. To solve this problem, we can first simplify the given equation and then substitute $y$ in terms of $x$ or vice versa into the expression we want to minimize. Then we can apply the method of completing the square to find the minimum value of the resulting quadratic function.

Step 1: Simplify the given equation
$|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$

We can rewrite the absolute values as:
$|x-2y| = (2y-x) \text{ if } 2y-x \geq 0$
$|x-2y| = -(2y-x) \text{ if } 2y-x < 0$
$|y-2x| = (2x-y) \text{ if } 2x-y \geq 0$
$|y-2x| = -(2x-y) \text{ if } 2x-y < 0$

So we have four cases to consider:
Case 1: $2y-x \geq 0$ and $2x-y \geq 0$, the equation becomes:
$2y-x + 2x-y = 40 \implies y = 20$

Case 2: $2y-x < 0$ and $2x-y \geq 0$, the equation becomes:
$-(2y-x) + 2x-y = 40 \implies y = -20$

Case 3: $2y-x \geq 0$ and $2x-y < 0$, the equation becomes:
$2y-x - (2x-y) = 40 \implies y = 0$

Case 4: $2y-x < 0$ and $2x-y < 0$, the equation becomes:
$-(2y-x) - (2x-y) = 40 \implies y = 0$

So we have three possible values for $y$: $20$, $-20$, and $0$. We can substitute these values into the expression we want to minimize and find the minimum value.

Step 2: Substitute $y$ into the expression
We want to minimize $f(x, y) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$. We will substitute the possible values of $y$ into this expression and find the minimum value of each resulting function of $x$.

Case 1: $y = 20$
$f(x, 20) = 5x^2 + 5(20)^2 - 8x(20) = 5x^2 + 2000 - 160x$

Case 2: $y = -20$
$f(x, -20) = 5x^2 + 5(-20)^2 - 8x(-20) = 5x^2 + 2000 + 160x$

Case 3: $y = 0$
$f(x, 0) = 5x^2 + 5(0)^2 - 8x(0) = 5x^2$

Step 3: Find the minimum value of each function
Now we need to find the minimum value of each of these functions. We can do this by completing the square.

Case 1: $f(x, 20) = 5x^2 + 2000 - 160x = 5(x^2 - 32x) + 2000 = 5(x^2 - 32x + 256) - 1280 + 2000 = 5(x - 16)^2 + 720$
The minimum value of $f(x, 20)$ is $720$ at $x = 16$.

Case 2: $f(x, -20) = 5x^2 + 2000 + 160x = 5(x^2 + 32x) + 2000 = 5(x^2 + 32x + 256) - 1280 + 2000 = 5(x + 16)^2 + 720$
The minimum value of $f(x, -20)$ is $720$ at $x = -16$.

Case 3: $f(x, 0) = 5x^2$ is minimized at $x = 0$, and its minimum value is $0$.

Comparing the minimum values, we see that the minimum value of $f(x, y)$ is $720$, which occurs when $y = 20$ or $y = -20$ and $x = 16$ or $x = -16$. But when $y = 0$, the minimum value of $f(x, y)$ is $0$, which is smaller than $720$. So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $0$.

Therefore, the minimum value of the given expression is 0. The answer is: $\boxed{0}$.

Approach:


To solve this problem, we will use the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality.

Step 1: Apply the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality to the given expression $|x-2y| + |y-2x|$.

Step 2: Simplify the inequality to get a relationship between $x$ and $y$.

Step 3: Substitute this relationship into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to find its minimum value.

Step 4: Simplify the expression to get a quadratic in a single variable.

Step 5: Find the minimum value of this quadratic.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

Step 1: Apply the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality to the given expression $|x-2y| + |y-2x|$.

By the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, we have:
\[(|x-2y| + |y-2x|)^2 \geq ((\sqrt{x-2y})^2 + (\sqrt{y-2x})^2)^2.\]
This simplifies to:
\[(|x-2y| + |y-2x|)^2 \geq (x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2.\]

Step 2: Simplify the inequality to get a relationship between $x$ and $y$.

Given that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we can square both sides to get:
\[(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2 \leq 40^2 = 1600.\]
Expanding the left side, we have:
\[x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2 + y^2 - 4xy + 4x^2 \leq 1600.\]
Combining like terms, we get:
\[5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy \leq 1600.\]

Step 3: Substitute this relationship into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.

Since we know that $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy \leq 1600$, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is achieved when the inequality becomes an equality, i.e., when $x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2 + y^2 - 4xy + 4x^2 = 1600$.

Step 4: Simplify the expression to get a quadratic in a single variable.

Let's solve the equation $x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2 + y^2 - 4xy + 4x^2 = 1600$ for $x$ in terms of $y$:
\[5x^2 - 8xy + 5y^2 = 1600.\]
Divide by 5:
\[x^2 - \frac{8}{5}xy + y^2 = \frac{1600}{5} = 320.\]
Complete the square:
\[\left(x - \frac{4}{5}y\right)^2 + y^2 = 320.\]

Step 5: Find the minimum value of this quadratic.

Now, we know that $\left(x - \frac{4}{5}y\right)^2 + y^2 = 320$. The left side is always nonnegative, so the minimum value of the left side is 0. This occurs when $x - \frac{4}{5}y = 0$ and $y = 0$. Solving these equations simultaneously, we get $x = 0$ and $y = 0$.

Substitute $x = 0$ and $y = 0$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to find its minimum value:
\[5(0)^2 + 5(0)^2 - 8(0)(0) = 0.\]

So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 0.
The answer is: $0$

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"

Approach:


We first notice that the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ can be rewritten as $5(x^2+y^2)-8xy$, which is a quadratic expression in disguise. Let's denote $A=x^2+y^2$ and $B=xy$, then the expression becomes $5A-8B$.

We also notice that the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$. This condition implies that $x$ and $y$ are related in some way. We will explore this relationship to find a minimum value for the expression $5A-8B$.

Solution:
We can rewrite the condition $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$ as $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. By the triangle inequality, we have $|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |x-2y + y-2x| = |-(x-2y)| = |x-2y|$, so $|x-2y| \leq 40$. Similarly, we have $|y-2x| \leq 40$.

By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have
\[(1+4)(x^2+y^2) \geq (x+2y)^2 \Rightarrow 5A \geq (x+2y)^2,\]
and
\[(4+1)(x^2+y^2) \geq (2x+y)^2 \Rightarrow 5A \geq (2x+y)^2.\]
So, $5A \geq (x+2y)^2$ and $5A \geq (2x+y)^2$. Therefore,
\[5A \geq \max\{(x+2y)^2, (2x+y)^2\}.\]

Now, we want to minimize $5A - 8B = 5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy$. By the AM-GM inequality, we have
\[5A - 8B = 5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy \geq 2\sqrt{5(x^2+y^2)(-8xy)} = 2\sqrt{-40(x^2+y^2)xy} \geq -40.\]
Equality occurs when $x=2y$ and $2x=y$, which implies $x=0$ and $y=0$. Therefore, the minimum value is $-40$. The minimum value of the expression $5A - 8B$ is $-40$. The answer is: $-40$.

Approach:



The given expression is $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite this as $5(x^2+y^2)-8xy = 5[(x-y)^2+2xy]-8xy = 5(x-y)^2 - 3xy$.

The condition given is $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, which simplifies to $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40 \implies |x-2y| = |2y-x| = 20$.

Without loss of generality, let $x \geq 2y$. Then $x-2y = 20 \implies x = 2y + 20$.

Substitute this into the expression $5(x-y)^2 - 3xy$:

$5[(2y+20)-y]^2 - 3(2y+20)y = 5(y+20)^2 - 6y^2 - 60y = 5(y^2+40y+400) - 6y^2 - 60y = 5y^2 + 200y + 2000 - 6y^2 - 60y = -y^2 + 140y + 2000$.

To minimize this expression, we can find its derivative and set it equal to zero:

$-2y + 140 = 0 \implies y = 70$.

Then $x = 2y + 20 = 2(70) + 20 = 160$.

Substitute $x = 160$ and $y = 70$ into the expression $-y^2 + 140y + 2000$:

$-(70)^2 + 140(70) + 2000 = -4900 + 9800 + 2000 = 7900$.

So the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the given condition is 7900. The answer is: $7900$.

Approach:



To find the minimum value of the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ under the condition $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$, we can use the inequality $|a| + |b| \geq |a + b|$ for real numbers $a$ and $b$. This inequality becomes equality when $a$ and $b$ have the same sign or one of them is zero. Applying this inequality to the given condition:

$|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| \geq |(x - 2y) + (y - 2x)| = |-x - y| = |-(x + y)| = |x + y| = 40$.

This means that $x + y = \pm 40$. Let's consider both cases:

Case 1: $x + y = 40$. We can rewrite this as $y = 40 - x$. Substituting this into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$:

$5x^2 + 5(40 - x)^2 - 8x(40 - x) = 5x^2 + 5(1600 - 80x + x^2) - 320x + 8x^2 = 13x^2 - 320x + 8000$.

To find the minimum value of this expression, we can take the derivative and set it equal to zero:

$\frac{d}{dx}(13x^2 - 320x + 8000) = 26x - 320 = 0 \Rightarrow x = \frac{320}{26} = \frac{160}{13}$.

Then, $y = 40 - x = 40 - \frac{160}{13} = \frac{520 - 160}{13} = \frac{360}{13}$.

Substituting these values back into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$:

$5\left(\frac{160}{13}\right)^2 + 5\left(\frac{360}{13}\right)^2 - 8\left(\frac{160}{13}\right)\left(\frac{360}{13}\right) = \frac{128000}{169}$.

Case 2: $x + y = -40$. We can rewrite this as $y = -40 - x$. Substituting this into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$:

$5x^2 + 5(-40 - x)^2 - 8x(-40 - x) = 5x^2 + 5(1600 + 80x + x^2) + 320x + 8x^2 = 13x^2 + 320x + 8000$.

To find the minimum value of this expression, we can take the derivative and set it equal to zero:

$\frac{d}{dx}(13x^2 + 320x + 8000) = 26x + 320 = 0 \Rightarrow x = -\frac{320}{26} = -\frac{160}{13}$.

Then, $y = -40 - x = -40 + \frac{160}{13} = \frac{-520 + 160}{13} = -\frac{360}{13}$.

Substituting these values back into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$:

$5\left(-\frac{160}{13}\right)^2 + 5\left(-\frac{360}{13}\right)^2 - 8\left(-\frac{160}{13}\right)\left(-\frac{360}{13}\right) = \frac{128000}{169}$.

Comparing the values of the expression in both cases, we find that both yield the same minimum value of $\frac{128000}{169}$. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ when $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$ is $\frac{128000}{169}$. The answer is: $\boxed{\frac{128000}{169}}$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):

Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:


We start by simplifying the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
Let's denote $a = x - 2y$ and $b = y - 2x$. Then we have $|a| + |b| = 40$.
We know that $|a| + |b|$ is equivalent to $|a + b| + |a - b|$, so we have $|(x - 2y) + (y - 2x)| + |(x - 2y) - (y - 2x)| = 40$,
which simplifies to $|-x - y| + |-x + 3y| = 40$.
This is equivalent to $|x + y| + |x - 3y| = 40$.
Now, let's consider two cases:
1. If $x + y \ge 0$ and $x - 3y \ge 0$, then $|x + y| + |x - 3y| = (x + y) + (x - 3y) = 2x - 2y = 40$.
Solving this gives $x - y = 20$, or $y = x - 20$.

2. If $x + y < 0$ or $x - 3y < 0$, then $|x + y| + |x - 3y| = -(x + y) - (x - 3y) = -2x + 4y = 40$.
Solving this gives $y = 10$. Substituting this into $y = x - 20$ gives $x = 30$.

So the only solution that works for both cases is $x = 30$ and $y = 10$.

Now we substitute these values into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
$5(30)^2 + 5(10)^2 - 8(30)(10) = 4500 + 500 - 2400 = 2600$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $2600$.

The minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $2600$. The answer is: $\boxed{2600}$

Assistant:

Approach:


The given expression is a quadratic form in terms of $x$ and $y$. We can complete the square to find its minimum value. Also, the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is non-linear and doesn't simplify easily. So, we will use a different approach. We can use the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality to find a lower bound for the expression.

The Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality states that for any real numbers $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$ and $b_1, b_2, ..., b_n$, we have:
$$(a_1^2 + a_2^2 + ... + a_n^2)(b_1^2 + b_2^2 + ... + b_n^2) \geq (a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 + ... + a_nb_n)^2$$
Setting $a_1 = x$, $a_2 = y$, $b_1 = 1$ and $b_2 = 1$, we get:
$$(x^2 + y^2)(1^2 + 1^2) \geq (x + y)^2$$
$$(x^2 + y^2)(2) \geq (x + y)^2$$
$$2(x^2 + y^2) \geq (x + y)^2$$

Now, we know that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. By the triangle inequality, $|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |x - 2y + y - 2x| = |0| = 0$. But this would imply $40 = 0$, which is a contradiction. Therefore, we must have equality in the triangle inequality. This means that $x - 2y$ and $y - 2x$ must have the same sign. Without loss of generality, let's assume that $x - 2y \geq 0$ and $y - 2x \geq 0$. Then we have:
$$x - 2y = 0$$
$$y - 2x = 0$$
Solving this system of equations, we find that $x = y$.

Substituting $x = y$ into the constraint equation, we get:
$$|x - 2x| + |x - 2x| = | -x| + |-x| = 2|x| = 40$$
$$|x| = 20$$
This means that $x = 20$ or $x = -20$. Since we are looking for the minimum value of the given expression, we will choose $x = 20$ (or equivalently, $y = 20$).

Now, substituting $x = 20$ and $y = 20$ into the given expression, we get:
$$5(20^2) + 5(20^2) - 8(20)(20) = 5(400) + 5(400) - 8(400) = 2000 + 2000 - 3200 = 800$$
Therefore, the minimum value of the given expression under the constraint is $800$. The answer is: $\boxed{800}$

Approach:

 The given expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ can be rewritten as $\frac{1}{2}((5x-4y)^2+(4y-5x)^2)$. The equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be simplified as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$, which means $|x-2y| = |2y-x|$, thus $x-2y = 2y-x$ or $x-2y = -(2y-x)$. Solving these two cases, we get $x=y$ or $x=3y$.

Now, substitute $x=y$ and $x=3y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get two functions: $5x^2+5x^2-8x^2=2x^2$ when $x=y$, and $5(3y)^2+5y^2-8*3y*y=45y^2+5y^2-24y^2=26y^2$ when $x=3y$.

To find the minimum value of these two functions, we need to find the minimum value of $2x^2$ and $26y^2$. Since $x^2$ and $y^2$ are both non-negative, the minimum value of $2x^2$ and $26y^2$ are both $0$. But $x^2=0$ and $y^2=0$ implies $x=y=0$, which does not satisfy the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. So the minimum value of $2x^2$ and $26y^2$ must be positive.

Since $2x^2$ and $26y^2$ are both positive and convex functions, their minimum value must occur at the boundary of their domains. However, in both cases $x=y$ and $x=3y$, the values of the functions do not depend on the specific values of $x$ and $y$ but only on the ratio between $x$ and $y$. Therefore, we can set $y=1$ without loss of generality and find the minimum value of $2x^2$ and $26y^2$ with respect to $x$.

For $2x^2$, we have $2x^2=2(x^2)\geq 0$, with equality if and only if $x=0$. But this does not satisfy $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. So the minimum value of $2x^2$ must occur at the boundary of its domain, i.e., as $x\rightarrow \pm\infty$, $2x^2\rightarrow \pm\infty$. Therefore, the minimum value of $2x^2$ must occur at a finite $x$ value.

For $26y^2$, we have $26y^2=26(y^2)\geq 0$, with equality if and only if $y=0$. But this does not satisfy $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. So the minimum value of $26y^2$ must occur at the boundary of its domain, i.e., as $y\rightarrow \pm\infty$, $26y^2\rightarrow \pm\infty$. Therefore, the minimum value of $26y^2$ must occur at a finite $y$ value.

Now we substitute $y=1$ into the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we get $|x-2| + |1-2x| = 40$. This equation has two solutions: $x=3$ and $x=\frac{1}{3}$. Substitute $x=3$ and $x=\frac{1}{3}$ into $2x^2$ and $26y^2$, we get $2*3^2=18$ and $26*1^2=26$. The minimum value of $2x^2$ and $26y^2$ is $18$.

So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $18$.
The answer is: $18$.

Approach:


The function $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ can be rewritten as $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2$. Let's denote $z = |x-2y| + |y-2x|$. Given that $z = 40$, we have $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2 = z^2/2 = 800$. Now, we need to minimize $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under this condition. By the Trivial Inequality, we know that $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2 \geq \frac{(x-2y+y-2x)^2}{2} = \frac{(-x+y)^2}{2}$. So, we have $\frac{(-x+y)^2}{2} \leq 800$. Thus, $(-x+y)^2 \leq 1600$, and $-40 \leq -x+y \leq 40$.

Now, we consider two cases:
1) If $-x+y \geq 0$, then $-x+y = 40$, which simplifies to $y = x + 40$. Substituting this into $z = 40$, we get $|x-2(x+40)| + |(x+40)-2x| = 40$, which simplifies to $|x-80| + |x+40| = 40$. By the Triangle Inequality, we know that $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$, so we have $|x-80| + |x+40| \geq |(x-80)+(x+40)| = |2x-40| = 2|x-20|$. Thus, we get $2|x-20| \leq 40$, and $|x-20| \leq 20$. This gives $-20 \leq x-20 \leq 20$, or $0 \leq x \leq 40$. Substituting $y = x + 40$ into the function $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get $5x^2+5(x+40)^2-8x(x+40) = 10x^2 + 3200$. The minimum value of this function in the interval $0 \leq x \leq 40$ can be found by taking the derivative and setting it to zero: $20x = 0$, which gives $x = 0$. So, the minimum value in this case is $10(0)^2 + 3200 = 3200$.

2) If $-x+y \leq 0$, then $-x+y = -40$, which simplifies to $y = x - 40$. Substituting this into $z = 40$, we get $|x-2(x-40)| + |(x-40)-2x| = 40$, which simplifies to $|x+80| + |-x-40| = 40$. By the Triangle Inequality, we know that $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$, so we have $|x+80| + |-x-40| \geq |(x+80) + (-x-40)| = |40| = 40$. Thus, the equality holds, and we have $|x+80| = |x+40|$. This implies that $x+80 = x+40$ or $x+80 = -(x+40)$. Solving these two equations, we get $x = -40$ or $x = 0$. For $x = -40$, we have $y = x - 40 = -80$. For $x = 0$, we have $y = x - 40 = -40$. Substituting these values into the function $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get $5(-40)^2+5(-80)^2-8(-40)(-80) = 8000$ and $5(0)^2+5(-40)^2-8(0)(-40) = 800$. The minimum value in this case is $800$.

Comparing the minimum values from both cases, we find that the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ subject to the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $800$. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{800}$.
The answer is: $\boxed{800}$

Approach:


We will first solve the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ for a relationship between $x$ and $y$. Then we will substitute this relationship into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to find its minimum value.

Step 1: Solving the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$
Case 1: If $x-2y \ge 0$ and $y-2x \ge 0$, then the equation becomes $x - 2y + y - 2x = 40 \implies -x - y = 40$, which is not possible as it would imply that $x$ and $y$ are both negative and their absolute values sum up to 40, which is a contradiction.
Case 2: If $x-2y \ge 0$ and $y-2x < 0$, then the equation becomes $x - 2y - (y - 2x) = 40 \implies x - 2y - y + 2x = 40 \implies 3x - 3y = 40 \implies x - y = \frac{40}{3}$.
Case 3: If $x-2y < 0$ and $y-2x \ge 0$, then the equation becomes $-(x - 2y) + y - 2x = 40 \implies -x + 2y + y - 2x = 40 \implies -3x + 3y = 40 \implies y - x = \frac{40}{3}$.
Case 4: If $x-2y < 0$ and $y-2x < 0$, then the equation becomes $-(x - 2y) - (y - 2x) = 40 \implies -x + 2y - y + 2x = 40 \implies x + y = 40$.
Combining the results from cases 2, 3 and 4, we find that $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$ or $y - x = \frac{40}{3}$ or $x + y = 40$.

Step 2: Substituting the relationship into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$
From the relationships found in step 1, we can express $y$ in terms of $x$. For example, from $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$, we get $y = x - \frac{40}{3}$. Substituting this into the expression gives $5x^2 + 5(x - \frac{40}{3})^2 - 8x(x - \frac{40}{3})$.

Step 3: Differentiating the expression and setting it to zero to find the minimum value
Differentiate the expression and set it to zero to find the value of $x$ that minimizes the expression. Then substitute this value of $x$ back into the expression to find the minimum value.

After going through these steps, we find that the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $-\frac{1600}{3}$. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $-\frac{1600}{3}$. The answer is: $\boxed{-\frac{1600}{3}}$

Approach:


We can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to solve this problem. First, let's rewrite the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ as $2|x-2y| = 40$, so $|x-2y| = 20$. Now, let's apply the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality:
\[(1^2+(-2)^2)(x^2+y^2) \geq (x-2y)^2.\]
This simplifies to $5(x^2+y^2) \geq (x-2y)^2 = 400$, so $x^2+y^2 \geq 80$.
Now, let's substitute $x^2+y^2 = 80$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
\[5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy = 5 \cdot 80 - 8xy = 400 - 8xy.\]
To minimize this expression, we need to maximize $xy$. By AM-GM inequality, we have
\[xy \leq \left(\frac{x^2+y^2}{2}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{80}{2}\right)^2 = 1600,\]
with equality when $x=y$. So the maximum value of $xy$ is $1600$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $400 - 8 \cdot 1600 = 400 - 12800 = -12400$. However, this is not possible because the given function is always positive.
Let's try another approach. We can rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy = 5(x^2+y^2) - 4xy - 4xy = 5(x^2+y^2) - 4xy - 4xy$. By AM-GM inequality, we have
\[4xy \leq 2(x^2+y^2),\]
so $5(x^2+y^2) - 4xy - 4xy \geq 5(x^2+y^2) - 2(x^2+y^2) = 3(x^2+y^2)$.
Since $x^2+y^2 \geq 80$, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $3 \cdot 80 = 240$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $240$.
The answer is: $240$

Approach:


The first step is to rewrite the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ using the property $|a-b| = |b-a|$. We get
\[|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40.\]
This simplifies to
\[|x-2y| + |2(x-y)| = 40.\]
Using the property $|a+b| \leq |a| + |b|$, we have
\[|x-2y| + |2(x-y)| \leq |x-2y| + 2|x-y| = 3|x-y|.\]
So we have
\[3|x-y| = 40.\]
This implies $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$.

Now let's consider the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite it as
\[5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x-y)^2 + 2xy] - 8xy = 5(x-y)^2 + 3xy.\]
Using the fact $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$, we can substitute this into the equation to get
\[5\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 + 3xy = \frac{8000}{9} + 3xy.\]
To minimize this expression, we need to minimize $xy$. By the Trivial Inequality, $xy \geq \left(\frac{x+y}{2}\right)^2$, so the minimum value of $xy$ is achieved when $x=y$. Substituting $x=y$ into the equation, we get
\[\frac{8000}{9} + 3x^2.\]
To minimize this expression, we need to minimize $x^2$. The minimum value of $x^2$ is achieved when $x=0$. Substituting $x=0$ into the equation, we get
\[\frac{8000}{9}.\]
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\frac{8000}{9}$. The answer is: $\boxed{\frac{8000}{9}}$

Approach:



To find the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ subject to the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we first observe that the constraint equation is equivalent to $|x-2y| = |2x-y| = 20$. This is because $|a| + |b| = c$ implies that $|a| = |b| = \frac{c}{2}$.

Now, let's consider the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = (3x^2 - 4xy + 3y^2) + 2(x^2 - 2xy + y^2) = (x-y)^2 + 2(x-y)^2 = 3(x-y)^2$.

From the constraint equation, we have $|x-2y| = 20$, which implies $(x-2y)^2 = 400$. Expanding, we get $x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2 = 400$. Rearranging terms, we have $3y^2 - 4xy + x^2 = 400$, which means $(x-y)^2 = 400/3$.

Substituting this back into the expression we want to minimize, we have $3(x-y)^2 = 400$. Therefore, the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ subject to the constraint is 400. The answer is: $400$.

Approach:



Let $f(x, y) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$. The problem is asking for the minimum value of $f(x, y)$ given the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.

The constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ implies that $x-2y$ and $y-2x$ have the same absolute value but opposite signs. Thus, we have two cases:

Case 1: $x-2y = y-2x$ and $x-2y = - (y-2x)$. Solving the first equation gives $x = y$, and substituting into the second equation gives $x = 0$ or $x = 2$.

Case 2: $x-2y = - (y-2x)$ and $y-2x = - (x-2y)$. Solving the first equation gives $x = -y$, and substituting into the second equation gives $x = 0$ or $x = -2$.

Now we have four possible solutions: $(x, y) = (0, 0), (2, 1), (-2, -1), (0, -2)$. 

We can compute $f(x, y)$ for each of these points:

$f(0, 0) = 0$, $f(2, 1) = -3$, $f(-2, -1) = -3$, and $f(0, -2) = -20$. 

So the minimum value of $f(x, y)$ under the given constraint is $-20$. The answer is: $\boxed{-20}$.

Approach:


First, we need to solve the constraint equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
Then, we substitute the solutions of $x$ and $y$ into the objective function $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to find the minimum value.


To solve the constraint equation, we can consider four cases:
1) $x - 2y \geq 0$ and $y - 2x \geq 0$, which gives $x - 2y + y - 2x = 40 \Rightarrow -x - y = 40 \Rightarrow x + y = -40$.
2) $x - 2y \geq 0$ and $y - 2x < 0$, which gives $x - 2y - (y - 2x) = 40 \Rightarrow x - 2y - y + 2x = 40 \Rightarrow 3x - 3y = 40 \Rightarrow x - y = \frac{40}{3}$.
3) $x - 2y < 0$ and $y - 2x \geq 0$, which gives -(x - 2y) + (y - 2x) = 40 \Rightarrow -x + 2y + y - 2x = 40 \Rightarrow -3x + 3y = 40 \Rightarrow -x + y = \frac{40}{3}$.
4) $x - 2y < 0$ and $y - 2x < 0$, which gives -(x - 2y) - (y - 2x) = 40 \Rightarrow -x + 2y - y + 2x = 40 \Rightarrow x - y = -40$.

We can solve these equations to get the solutions:
1) $x = -20$ and $y = -20$.
2) $x = 20 + \frac{40}{3}$ and $y = \frac{40}{3}$.
3) $x = \frac{40}{3}$ and $y = 20 - \frac{40}{3}$.
4) $x = 20$ and $y = 20$.

Now, substitute these solutions into the objective function $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
1) $5(-20)^2 + 5(-20)^2 - 8(-20)(-20) = 2000$.
2) $5\left(20 + \frac{40}{3}\right)^2 + 5\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 - 8\left(20 + \frac{40}{3}\right)\left(\frac{40}{3}\right) = 2000$.
3) $5\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 + 5\left(20 - \frac{40}{3}\right)^2 - 8\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)\left(20 - \frac{40}{3}\right) = 2000$.
4) $5(20)^2 + 5(20)^2 - 8(20)(20) = 2000$.

All these solutions give the same value of 2000. Therefore, the minimum value of the objective function is 2000 under the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. The answer is: $2000$.
