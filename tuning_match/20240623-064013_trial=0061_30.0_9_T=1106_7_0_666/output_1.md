Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We start by considering the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
Using the triangle inequality, we know that $|a+b| \leq |a| + |b|$ for all real numbers $a$ and $b$.
Applying this to the given equation, we get $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |-(x-2y)| - (y-2x) = |-x+2y| - (y-2x) = |2y-x| - (y-2x) = |2y-x| + |2x-y| \geq |(2y-x) + (2x-y)| = |y| + |x| = |x| + |y|$.
So, $|x| + |y| = 40$.
Now, we consider the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.
We can rewrite this as $5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x^2 - 2xy + y^2) + (x^2 - 6xy + y^2)] - 8xy = 5[(x-y)^2 + (x-3y)^2] - 8xy$.
By AM-GM inequality, we know that for any positive numbers $a$ and $b$, $(a+b)/2 \geq \sqrt{ab}$, or equivalently, $a+b \geq 2\sqrt{ab}$.
Applying this to the terms $(x-y)^2$ and $(x-3y)^2$, we get $(x-y)^2 + (x-3y)^2 \geq 2\sqrt{(x-y)^2(x-3y)^2} = 2|x-2y|$.
Substituting this back into the expression, we get $5(x-y)^2 + 5(x-3y)^2 - 8xy \geq 10|x-2y| - 8xy$.
Using the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we know that $|x-2y| = 40 - |y-2x| = 40 - |2x-y|$.
So, $|x-2y| = 20$ or $|x-2y| = 20$.
Case 1: If $|x-2y| = 20$, then $10|x-2y| - 8xy = 200 - 8xy$.
Case 2: If $|x-2y| = 20$, then $10|x-2y| - 8xy = 200 - 8xy$.
In both cases, we have $5(x-y)^2 + 5(x-3y)^2 - 8xy \geq 200 - 8xy$.
Setting $8xy = 200$, we get $5(x-y)^2 + 5(x-3y)^2 - 8xy \geq 0$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $0$. The answer is: $0$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's simplify the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
Since $|a - b| = |b - a|$, we can rewrite this as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$.
Using the property $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$, we have $|x-2y| + |2y-x| \geq |(x-2y) + (2y-x)| = |0| = 0$.
Therefore, the only way for this equation to hold is when equality holds in the triangle inequality, which means $x-2y = 0$ and $2y-x = 0$, or $x = 2y$.
Substituting $x = 2y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get $5(2y)^2 + 5y^2 - 8(2y)(y) = 20y^2 + 5y^2 - 16y^2 = 9y^2$.
Now, we need to find the minimum value of $9y^2$ under the condition $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$, or $|2y - 2y| + |y - 4y| = 40$, which simplifies to $|0| + |-3y| = 40$, or $3|y| = 40$. Therefore, $|y| = \frac{40}{3}$. Since $y$ can be positive or negative, the minimum value of $y^2$ is $\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{1600}{9}$.
Substituting this back into $9y^2$, we get $9 \cdot \frac{1600}{9} = 1600$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 1600.
The answer is: $1600$.

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's simplify the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. This can be rewritten as $5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy$.
Now, let's recall the formula $(a-b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2$. We can rewrite the expression $5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy$ as $5[(x-y)^2 + 2xy] - 8xy$.
Simplifying further, we get $5(x-y)^2 + 5*2xy - 8xy = 5(x-y)^2 - 3xy$.
Now, let's look at the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. By the triangle inequality, $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |(x-2y) - (y-2x)| = |x-2y - y+2x| = |3x - 3y| = 3|x-y| = 40$. So, $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$.
Since the expression we want to minimize, $5(x-y)^2 - 3xy$, depends only on $|x-y|$, and not on the individual values of $x$ and $y$, we can set $x-y = \frac{40}{3}$. Then, $-3xy = -3\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 = -\frac{1600}{3}$.
So, the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $5\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 - \frac{1600}{3} = \frac{8000}{9} - \frac{1600}{3} = \frac{8000-4800}{9} = \frac{3200}{9}$. Therefore, the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\frac{3200}{9}$. The answer is: $\frac{3200}{9}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



We start by noting that the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$.

Now, let's consider the function $f(x, y) = 5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We want to find its minimum value under the condition $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$.

By the triangle inequality, we know that $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$, so $|2y-x| + |2x-y| \geq |(2y-x) + (2x-y)| = |y|$. Therefore, $|y| = 40$.

Since $|y| = 40$, we have $y = 40$ or $y = -40$.

If $y = 40$, then from $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$, we get $|80-x| + |2x-40| = 40$. By the triangle inequality again, we have $|80-x| + |2x-40| \geq |(80-x) + (2x-40)| = |40| = 40$, so the equality holds. Therefore, we have $80 - x = 2x - 40$, which gives $x = \frac{120}{3} = 40$.

Similarly, if $y = -40$, we get $x = -40$.

Now we have two pairs of solutions: $(x, y) = (40, 40)$ and $(x, y) = (-40, -40)$. Let's substitute these pairs into the function $f(x, y)$:

For $(x, y) = (40, 40)$, we have $f(40, 40) = 5(40)^2 + 5(40)^2 - 8(40)(40) = 4000$.

For $(x, y) = (-40, -40)$, we have $f(-40, -40) = 5(-40)^2 + 5(-40)^2 - 8(-40)(-40) = 4000$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $f(x, y)$ is $4000$. The answer is: $4000$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


Let $a = x - 2y$ and $b = y - 2x$. We have $|a| + |b| = 40$. By the triangle inequality, we know that $|a| + |b| \ge |a + b|$. So we have $|a + b| \le 40$. We also know that $a + b = x - 2y + y - 2x = -x - y$. So we have $|-x - y| \le 40$, which is equivalent to $|x + y| \le 40$.
Now we need to minimize the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$. We can rewrite this as $5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x + y)^2 - 2xy] - 8xy = 5(x + y)^2 - 18xy$.
By the AM-GM inequality, we have $5(x + y)^2 - 18xy \ge 5(x + y)^2 - 9(x + y)^2 = -4(x + y)^2$. We know that $|x + y| \le 40$, so $-4(x + y)^2 \ge -4(40)^2 = -6400$. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is $-6400$.
The answer is: $-6400$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's consider the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, we know that $|a| + |b| \ge |a+b|$ for any real numbers $a$ and $b$. So we have
\[|x-2y| + |y-2x| \ge |(x-2y) + (y-2x)| = |x-2y+y-2x| = |-x-y| = |-(x+y)| = |x+y|.\]
We are given that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, so we must have $|x+y| = 40$.
Now let's consider the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite this as:
\[5x^2+5y^2-8xy = \frac{1}{2}((5x^2-8xy+8y^2) + (5y^2-8xy+8x^2)) = \frac{1}{2}((5x-4y)^2 + (4x-5y)^2).\]
Now, by the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have:
\[((5x)^2+(8y)^2)((8x)^2+(5y)^2) \ge (5x \cdot 8x + 8y \cdot 5y)^2 = (40x^2 + 40y^2)^2.\]
So we have:
\[(25x^2+64y^2)(64x^2+25y^2) \ge (40x^2 + 40y^2)^2.\]
Taking the square root of both sides gives:
\[\sqrt{(25x^2+64y^2)(64x^2+25y^2)} \ge 40x^2 + 40y^2.\]
But we know that $|x+y| = 40$, so $x^2 + 2xy + y^2 = 1600$, and therefore $40x^2 + 40y^2 + 80xy = 6400$. Then $80xy = 6400 - 40x^2 - 40y^2 = 40(160 - x^2 - y^2)$.
Thus, we have:
\[40(x^2 + y^2) + 80xy \ge 6400 \implies 40(x^2 + y^2) + 40(160 - x^2 - y^2) \ge 6400 \implies 40(320) \ge 6400 \implies x^2 + y^2 \ge 80.\]
Finally, we can substitute this back into our expression for $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
\[5x^2+5y^2-8xy = \frac{1}{2}((5x-4y)^2 + (4x-5y)^2) \ge \frac{1}{2}(0^2 + 0^2) = 0.\]
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0 when $x=2y$ and $y=2x$, or equivalently, when $x=y=0$. But this doesn't satisfy the condition $|x+y| = 40$. So we need to look for another way to find the minimum value.

Let's consider the expression $(5x-4y)^2 + (4x-5y)^2$. By the AM-GM inequality, we have:
\[\frac{(5x-4y)^2 + (4x-5y)^2}{2} \ge \sqrt{(5x-4y)^2 \cdot (4x-5y)^2} = |5x-4y| \cdot |4x-5y| = |20x^2 - 40xy + 20y^2|.\]
But we know that $|x+y| = 40$, so $x^2 + 2xy + y^2 = 1600$, and therefore $20x^2 + 40xy + 20y^2 = 8000$. So we have:
\[\frac{(5x-4y)^2 + (4x-5y)^2}{2} \ge 8000 - 40xy.\]
Therefore, we have:
\[5x^2+5y^2-8xy = \frac{1}{2}((5x-4y)^2 + (4x-5y)^2) \ge \frac{1}{2}(8000 - 40xy) = 4000 - 20xy.\]
We want to minimize $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, so we want to maximize $20xy$. By the AM-GM inequality, we have:
\[20xy \le \sqrt{(20x)^2 \cdot (20y)^2} = \sqrt{(400x^2) \cdot (400y^2)} = \sqrt{160000(x^2+y^2)} = \sqrt{160000 \cdot 80} = 4000.\]
Equality occurs when $20x = 20y$, or $x = y$. Substituting this back into the equation $|x+y| = 40$, we get $|2x| = 40$, or $x = \pm 20$. But we want the positive value, so $x = 20$ and $y = 20$.

Therefore, when $x=20$ and $y=20$, we have:
\[5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(20)^2+5(20)^2-8(20)(20) = 2000 + 2000 - 3200 = 800.\]
Thus, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 800. The answer is: $800$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we need to find the relationship between $x$ and $y$ from the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
If $x - 2y \ge 0$ and $y - 2x \ge 0$, we have $x - 2y + y - 2x = 40$, which simplifies to $-x - y = 40$, or $x + y = -40$.
If $x - 2y < 0$ and $y - 2x < 0$, we have $-(x - 2y) - (y - 2x) = 40$, which simplifies to $-x + 2y - y + 2x = 40$, or $x + y = 40$.
If $x - 2y \ge 0$ and $y - 2x < 0$, we have $x - 2y - (y - 2x) = 40$, which simplifies to $x - 2y - y + 2x = 40$, or $3x - 3y = 40$, or $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$.
If $x - 2y < 0$ and $y - 2x \ge 0$, we have -(x - 2y) + (y - 2x) = 40, which simplifies to $-x + 2y + y - 2x = 40$, or $-3x + 3y = 40$, or $y - x = \frac{40}{3}$.
However, the last two cases are not possible because $x + y = -40$ implies $x < 0$ and $y < 0$, but $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$ or $y - x = \frac{40}{3}$ would lead to either $x > 0$ or $y > 0$, which contradicts $x < 0$ and $y < 0$.
Therefore, we only need to consider the case $x + y = -40$.

Now, we need to find the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ subject to the constraint $x + y = -40$.
Using the constraint, we can express $y$ in terms of $x$ as $y = -40 - x$.
Substitute this into the expression:
$$5x^2 + 5(-40 - x)^2 - 8x(-40 - x)$$
$$= 5x^2 + 5(1600 + 80x + x^2) + 320x + 8x^2$$
$$= 5x^2 + 8000 + 400x + 5x^2 + 320x + 8x^2$$
$$= 18x^2 + 720x + 8000$$
To find the minimum value of this quadratic expression, we can find its vertex.
The x-coordinate of the vertex is given by $-\frac{b}{2a}$, where $a$ and $b$ are the coefficients of the quadratic expression.
In this case, $a = 18$ and $b = 720$, so the x-coordinate of the vertex is $-\frac{720}{2 \cdot 18} = -20$.
Substitute $x = -20$ into the expression to find the minimum value:
$$18(-20)^2 + 720(-20) + 8000 = 7200 - 14400 + 8000 = -6400 + 8000 = 1600$$
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $x + y = -40$ is 1600. The answer is: $1600$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we notice that the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is equivalent to $|x-2y| = |2x-y|$.
Expanding the absolute value signs, we get $x-2y = \pm (2x-y)$, which simplifies to $x-2y = 2x-y$ or $x-2y = -(2x-y)$.
Solving the first equation, we get $x=3y$.
Substituting this into the second equation, we get $x-2y = -2x+y$, which simplifies to $3x=3y$, or $x=y$.
So we have $x=3y$ and $x=y$. The only solution that satisfies both equations is $x=y$.
Now, we can substitute $y=x$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to get $5x^2+5x^2-8x^2 = 2x^2$.
Now, we need to find the minimum value of $2x^2$ given the condition $|x-2x| + |x-2x| = 40$, which simplifies to $0+0=40$, which is false.
However, we made a mistake in our reasoning. Let's go back and reconsider the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
The absolute value equation $|x-2y| = |2x-y|$ is equivalent to two separate cases:
Case 1: $x-2y = 2x-y$ and $x-2y = -(2x-y)$.
Solving the first equation, we get $x=3y$.
Substituting this into the second equation, we get $x-2y = -2x+y$, which simplifies to $3x=3y$, or $x=y$.
So for this case, $x=3y$ and $x=y$, which implies $x=y$.
Case 2: $x-2y = -(2x-y)$ and $x-2y = 2x-y$.
Solving the first equation, we get $x-2y = -2x+y$, which simplifies to $3x=3y$, or $x=y$.
Substituting this into the second equation, we get $x-2y = 2x-y$, which simplifies to $x=3y$.
So for this case, $x=y$ and $x=3y$, which implies $x=y$.
Therefore, the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ implies $x=y$.
Now, we can substitute $y=x$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to get $5x^2+5x^2-8x^2 = 2x^2$.
Finally, we need to find the minimum value of $2x^2$. Since $x^2$ is always non-negative, the minimum value of $2x^2$ is $0$, which occurs when $x=0$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $0$.
The answer is: $0$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To solve this problem, we first note that the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is always true for any real numbers $x$ and $y$. This is because $|x-2y| = |-(2y-x)| = |2x-y|$ and $|y-2x| = |-(2x-y)| = |2y-x|$, so $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |2x-y| + |2y-x|$. By the triangle inequality, $|a| + |b| \ge |a+b|$, so $|2x-y| + |2y-x| \ge |(2x-y) + (2y-x)| = |0| = 0$, which is a contradiction. Therefore, the given equation is always true.
Now, we want to find the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under this condition.
We can rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $(3x^2-8xy+3y^2) + 2(x^2+y^2)$. The first term can be factored as $(x-2y)^2 + (2x-y)^2$, so $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = (x-2y)^2 + (2x-y)^2 + 2(x^2+y^2)$.
By the triangle inequality, $(x-2y)^2 + (2x-y)^2 \ge 0$, and $x^2+y^2 \ge 0$, so the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is always nonnegative.
Equality occurs when $x-2y = 0$ and $2x-y = 0$, which gives $x = \frac{4}{3}y$. Substituting this into the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we get $|-\frac{2}{3}y| + |-\frac{4}{3}y| = 40$, which simplifies to $\frac{2}{3}|y| + \frac{4}{3}|y| = 40$, or $\frac{6}{3}|y| = 40$, or $|y| = 20$. So $y = \pm 20$, and $x = \frac{4}{3}y = \pm \frac{80}{3}$.
When $y = 20$, $x = \frac{80}{3}$, and $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = (0)^2 + (40)^2 + 2(400) = 1600 + 800 = 2400$. When $y = -20$, $x = -\frac{80}{3}$, and $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = (0)^2 + (40)^2 + 2(400) = 1600 + 800 = 2400$. So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the given condition is 2400. The answer is: $2400$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we first need to find the relationship between $x$ and $y$ from the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.

The given equation can be rewritten as $|x-2y| + |2x-y| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, we know that $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$, so we have $|x-2y + 2x-y| = |3x-3y| = 40$.
This simplifies to $3|x-y| = 40$, so $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$.

Now let's substitute $x = y + \frac{40}{3}$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
\begin{align*}
5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy &= 5(y + \frac{40}{3})^2 + 5y^2 - 8y(y + \frac{40}{3}) \\
&= 5(y^2 + 2*\frac{40}{3}y + \frac{1600}{9}) + 5y^2 - 8y^2 - \frac{320}{3}y \\
&= 5y^2 + \frac{400}{3}y + \frac{8000}{9} + 5y^2 - 8y^2 - \frac{320}{3}y \\
&= -3y^2 + \frac{80}{3}y + \frac{8000}{9}.
\end{align*}

This is a quadratic function in $y$, and its graph is a parabola opening downwards.
To find the minimum value, we can find the vertex of the parabola.

The $y$-coordinate of the vertex of a parabola given in the form $ay^2 + by + c$ is $-\frac{b}{2a}$.
In this case, $a = -3$ and $b = \frac{80}{3}$, so the $y$-coordinate of the vertex is $-\frac{\frac{80}{3}}{2*(-3)} = \frac{40}{9}$.

Substitute $y = \frac{40}{9}$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to find the minimum value:
\begin{align*}
5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy &= 5(y + \frac{40}{3})^2 + 5y^2 - 8y(y + \frac{40}{3}) \\
&= 5(\frac{40}{9} + \frac{40}{3})^2 + 5(\frac{40}{9})^2 - 8*\frac{40}{9}*(\frac{40}{9} + \frac{40}{3}) \\
&= 5*\frac{1600}{81} + 5*\frac{1600}{81} - 8*\frac{40}{9}*\frac{160}{9} \\
&= \frac{1600}{9} + \frac{1600}{9} - \frac{51200}{81} \\
&= \frac{3200}{9} - \frac{51200}{81} \\
&= \frac{28800 - 51200}{81} \\
&= -\frac{22400}{81}.
\end{align*}

Therefore, the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $-\frac{22400}{81}$.
The answer is: $-\frac{22400}{81}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ subject to the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we first need to simplify the condition.

Consider the absolute value expressions $|x-2y|$ and $|y-2x|$. We know that $|a| = |-a|$ for any real number $a$, so we can rewrite the condition as:
$$|x-2y| = |2x-y|.$$
Now, we expand the absolute value expressions:
$$x-2y = \pm (2x-y) \quad \text{or} \quad x-2y = \pm (y-2x).$$

Solving these two cases:
1. For $x-2y = 2x-y$, we get $y = x$.
2. For $x-2y = -(y-2x)$, we get $3x = 3y$, so $x = y$.

Thus, the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ simplifies to $x = y$.

Now, let's substitute $x = y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
$$5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5x^2+5x^2-8x^2 = 2x^2.$$

Now we need to find the minimum value of $2x^2$ under the condition $|x-2x| = 40$, or $|x-2x| = 40$, which simplifies to $0 = 40$, which is a contradiction. So, we must have made a mistake in our simplification of the condition.

Let's go back and reconsider the original condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. We can rewrite it as $|x-2y| = 40 - |y-2x|$. Since the left side of this equation is always nonnegative, and the right side is always nonnegative, both sides must be equal to 0:
$$|x-2y| = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad |y-2x| = 40.$$

The first equation implies $x = 2y$. Substituting this into the second equation gives $|y-4y| = 40$, or $|3y| = 40$. Thus, $y = \pm \frac{40}{3}$.

Now we can substitute $x = 2y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
$$5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(2y)^2+5y^2-8(2y)y = 20y^2+5y^2-16y^2 = 9y^2.$$

Now we substitute $y = \pm \frac{40}{3}$ into the expression $9y^2$:
$$9\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 = 9\left(\frac{1600}{9}\right) = 1600.$$

So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 1600. The answer is: $\boxed{1600}$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we observe that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$.
This is the same as $|x-2y| + |2x-y| = 40$.
Using the property of absolute value, we have $|a| + |b| = |a+b| + |a-b|$.
So, we can rewrite the equation as $|(x-2y) + (2x-y)| + |(x-2y) - (2x-y)| = 40$.
Simplifying, we get $|3x-3y| + |-x-y| = 40$.
Since absolute value is always non-negative, we have $|3x-3y| + |-x-y| \geq 0$.
And since this sum equals 40, we can conclude that both terms are equal to 20.
So, we have $|3x-3y| = 20$ and $|-x-y| = 20$.
This gives us two cases to consider:
Case 1: $3x-3y = 20$ and $-x-y = 20$.
Solving the system of equations, we get $x = 10$ and $y = -5$.
Case 2: $3x-3y = -20$ and $-x-y = -20$.
Solving the system of equations, we get $x = -10$ and $y = 5$.
Now, we substitute these values into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
For Case 1: $5(10)^2+5(-5)^2-8(10)(-5) = 500 + 125 + 400 = 1025$.
For Case 2: $5(-10)^2+5(5)^2-8(-10)(5) = 500 + 125 + 400 = 1025$.
In both cases, we get the same value.
So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 1025. The answer is: $1025$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's consider the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
We can rewrite this as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, we have $|2y-x| + |2x-y| \geq |(2y-x) + (2x-y)| = |y| = |y-0|$.
So, we must have $|y| = 20$.
Now, let's consider the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.
We can rewrite this as $5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy$.
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have $(x^2+y^2)^2 \geq (1^2+1^2)(x^2+y^2)$,
so $x^2+y^2 \geq \frac{1}{2}(x^2+y^2)^2$.
Multiplying both sides by 5, we get $5(x^2+y^2) \geq \frac{5}{2}(x^2+y^2)^2$.
Now, let's consider the expression $8xy$.
By the AM-GM inequality, we have $8xy \leq 2(x^2+y^2)$.
Therefore, $5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy \geq 5(x^2+y^2) - 2(x^2+y^2) = 3(x^2+y^2)$.
Now, we know that $y^2 = 20^2 = 400$, so we can substitute this into the inequality above:
$5(x^2+400) - 8xy \geq 3(x^2+400)$.
Expanding, we get $5x^2 + 2000 - 8xy \geq 3x^2 + 1200$.
Simplifying, we get $2x^2 - 8xy + 800 \geq 0$.
Factoring out a 2, we have $2(x^2 - 4xy + 400) \geq 0$.
Simplifying further, we have $2(x-2y)^2 \geq 0$.
Since $(x-2y)^2$ is always nonnegative, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is achieved when $(x-2y)^2 = 0$, or $x=2y$.
Substituting this into the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we have $|x-x| + |y-2x| = 40$,
or $|y-2x| = 40$.
Since $|y| = 20$, we can deduce that $y = 20$ or $y = -20$.
If $y = 20$, then $x = 40$, and the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $5(40)^2+5(20)^2-8(40)(20) = 8000$.
If $y = -20$, then $x = -40$, and the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is also $8000$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 8000. The answer is: $8000$.
