Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We start by substituting $n=1$ into the first equation, we have $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1$, hence $f(f(1))=1$.
Since $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can find $f(1)$ by setting $n=\frac{1}{2}$, but $\frac{1}{2}$ is not a positive integer, so we need to find another way.
If we substitute $n=1$ into the second equation, we get $f(2)=2f(1)+1$.
Substituting $f(1)=1$ into this equation, we get $f(2)=2(1)+1=3$.
Now, substituting $n=2$ into the second equation, we get $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2(3)+1=7$.
Substituting $n=4$ into the first equation, we get $f(f(f(4)))=8(4)-7=25$, hence $f(f(7))=25$.
Substituting $f(7)=25$ into the second equation with $n=\frac{7}{2}$, we get $f(14)=2f(7)+1=2(25)+1=51$.
Substituting $n=14$ into the first equation, we get $f(f(f(14)))=8(14)-7=109$, hence $f(f(51))=109$.
Since $f(f(1))=1$, we have $f(1)=51$.
Finally, substituting $n=100$ into the second equation, we get $f(200)=2f(100)+1$.
Substituting $f(100)$ into this equation, we get $f(200)=2f(100)+1$.
But we also know that $f(200)=f(f(f(100)))$ from the first equation.
Therefore, $f(f(f(100)))=2f(100)+1$.
Substituting $f(100)$ into this equation, we get $f(f(f(100)))=2f(100)+1$.
But we also know that $f(f(f(100)))=8(100)-7=793$.
Therefore, we have $793=2f(100)+1$.
Solving this equation for $f(100)$, we get $f(100)=\frac{793-1}{2}=396$.
Therefore, $f(100)=396$. The value of $f(100)$ is 396.
The answer is: $396$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find $f(100)$, we first need to find a pattern in the function $f$. 

We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. 

Let's try to find $f(f(n))$ by setting $n = f(n)$ in the equation:
$$f(f(f(f(n)))) = f(f(f(n))) = 8f(n) - 7.$$

From the second given condition, we know that $f(f(f(n)))=f(2f(n)+1)$. 

Setting these two equal to each other gives us:
$$8f(n) - 7 = f(2f(n)+1).$$

Now let's try to find $f(n)$. 

For $n = 1$, we have $f(f(f(1))) = 8(1) - 7 = -1$.
From the second condition, $f(f(2)) = 2f(1) + 1 = 3$.
Now we have $f(f(1)) = 3$.
Using the second condition again, $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 3$.
And finally, $f(1) = 1$.

Now we can try to find $f(100)$ using the second given condition:
$$f(200) = 2f(100) + 1.$$

Again using the second condition, we can find $f(200)$:
$$f(f(201)) = 8(100) - 7 = 793.$$
And from the first condition, we have $f(f(f(201))) = f(201) = 793$.
So $f(201) = 793$.

Substituting this into the equation $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$, we get:
$$793 = 2f(100) + 1.$$

Solving for $f(100)$ gives:
$$f(100) = \frac{793 - 1}{2} = \frac{792}{2} = 396.$$
So $f(100) = 396$.

The value of $f(100)$ is 396. The answer is: $396$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



We are given that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We want to find $f(100)$.

Let's try to find a pattern by calculating the first few values of $f(n)$ using the given equations.

For $n=1$, we have $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1$. So $f(f(1))=1$ implies $f(1)=1$ since $f(f(1))=f(1)$.

Now, for $n=2$, we have $f(f(f(2)))=8(2)-7=9$. Also, $f(2f(1))=f(2)=2f(1)+1=2(1)+1=3$. So we get $f(f(3))=9$. Since $f(f(3))=f(3)$, we have $f(3)=9$.

Continuing this process, we can find $f(4)=5$, $f(5)=7$, $f(6)=3$, $f(7)=11$, $f(8)=9$, $f(9)=15$, and so on.

We observe that $f(n)$ seems to be an odd number for all odd $n$ and an even number for all even $n$. Also, we notice that $f(f(n))$ is either $1$ or $9$ for all $n$.

Now, let's try to find $f(100)$. We have $f(100)=2f(50)+1$. Again, using the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can find $f(50)=2f(25)+1$. Continuing this process, we get:

\[f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2(2f(25) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(2f(12.5)+1) + 1) + 1.\]

Since $n$ must be a positive integer, we cannot proceed further with this method. However, we notice that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ is similar to the equation of a cubic function. Let's assume that $f(n)=an^3+bn^2+cn+d$. Substituting $n=1$ into the equation, we get $a+b+c+d=1$. Similarly, substituting $n=2$, we get $8a+4b+2c+d=9$.

We can solve this system of linear equations to find the values of $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$. After solving, we get $a=1/2$, $b=-1/2$, $c=2$, and $d=0$. So, $f(n)=\frac{n^3}{2}-\frac{n^2}{2}+2n$.

Now, we can find $f(100)=\frac{100^3}{2}-\frac{100^2}{2}+2(100)=500000-5000+200=495200$. However, this value does not match any of the values we found using the given equations. This suggests that our assumption of the form of $f(n)$ is incorrect.

Let's try a different approach. We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. If we substitute $f(n)$ with $8n-7$, we get:

\[f(f(8n-7))=8n-7.\]

Let's set $x=8n-7$. Then, we have $f(f(x))=x$. This implies that $f$ is the function that sends a number to its square root (since the square root of a number $x$ is the value that when squared gives $x$). Therefore, $f(n)=\sqrt{n}$.

Now, we can find $f(100)=\sqrt{100}=10$. However, this value also does not match any of the values we found using the given equations. This suggests that our assumption of the form of $f(n)$ is incorrect again.

Let's reconsider the given equations. The first equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ implies that $f$ is a cubic function, and the second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ implies that $f$ is an odd function. Combining these two properties, we can conclude that $f(n)=n^3$ for odd $n$ and $f(n)=n^3-1$ for even $n$.

Now, let's find $f(100)$. Since $100$ is even, we have $f(100)=(100)^3-1=1000000-1=999999$.

However, this value also does not match any of the values we found using the given equations. This suggests that our conclusion about the form of $f(n)$ is incorrect again.

Let's reconsider the given equations again. The first equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ implies that $f$ is a cubic function, and the second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ implies that $f$ is an odd function. Combining these two properties, we can conclude that $f(n)=n^3$ for odd $n$ and $f(n)=n^3-1$ for even $n$.

Now, let's find $f(100)$. Since $100$ is even, we have $f(100)=(100)^3-1=1000000-1=999999$.

However, this value also does not match any of the values we found using the given equations. This suggests that our conclusion about the form of $f(n)$ is incorrect again.

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we try to find $f(1)$.
Setting $n=1$ in the second equation, we have $f(2)=2f(1)+1$.
Then setting $n=2$ in the second equation, we have $f(4)=2f(2)+1$.
And setting $n=4$ in the second equation, we have $f(8)=2f(4)+1$.
And setting $n=8$ in the first equation, we have $f(f(f(8)))=8(8)-7=51$.
Since $f(f(f(8)))=f(f(2f(4)+1))=f(f(2f(2)+1))=f(f(4f(1)+1))$,
so we have $f(f(4f(1)+1))=51$.
Let $f(1)=x$, then we have $f(f(4x+1))=51$.
Setting $n=4x+1$ in the first equation, we have $f(f(f(4x+1)))=8(4x+1)-7=32x+1$.
So we have $f(f(4x+1))=32x+1$.
Substituting $f(f(4x+1))=51$ into the equation, we get $51=32x+1$,
which gives $32x=50$, and $x=\frac{50}{32}=\frac{25}{16}$.
But $f(1)$ must be a positive integer, so we must have made a mistake.
Let's try another approach.
Notice that the second equation is linear, so we can try to find a fixed point.
A fixed point is a number $x$ such that $f(x)=x$.
Setting $n=x$ in the second equation, we have $f(2x)=2f(x)+1$.
Since $f(x)=x$, we have $f(2x)=2x+1$.
Setting $n=2x$ in the first equation, we have $f(f(f(2x)))=8(2x)-7=16x-7$.
So we have $f(f(2x+1))=16x-7$.
Substituting $f(2x+1)=2x+1$ into the equation, we get $f(2x+1)=16x-7$.
This equation is true only when $2x+1=16x-7$, which gives $14x=8$, and $x=\frac{4}{7}$.
Again, $f(1)$ must be a positive integer, so this approach doesn't work either.
However, we notice that the function $f$ satisfies a recursive relation.
From $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we can say that $f(f(n))$ is the preimage of $8n-7$ under $f$.
And from $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can say that $f(2n)$ is the image of $f(n)$ under the transformation $x \to 2x+1$.
So we can try to find the image of 1 under successive applications of the transformation $x \to 2x+1$.
Applying the transformation once, we get $1 \to 2(1)+1=3$.
Applying the transformation twice, we get $3 \to 2(3)+1=7$.
Applying the transformation three times, we get $7 \to 2(7)+1=15$.
Applying the transformation four times, we get $15 \to 2(15)+1=31$.
Applying the transformation five times, we get $31 \to 2(31)+1=63$.
Applying the transformation six times, we get $63 \to 2(63)+1=127$.
Applying the transformation seven times, we get $127 \to 2(127)+1=255$.
And applying the transformation eight times, we get $255 \to 2(255)+1=511$.
We notice that the numbers are getting larger very quickly.
However, we know that the range of $f$ is $\mathbb N$, so there must be some pattern here.
Let's try to find the preimage of 1 under successive applications of the transformation $x \to 2x+1$.
Applying the inverse transformation $x \to \frac{x-1}{2}$, we get $1 \to \frac{1-1}{2}=0$.
But $0$ is not in the domain of $f$, so we must have made a mistake.
Let's try another approach.
We notice that the transformation $x \to 2x+1$ is the same as the transformation $x \to 2x$ followed by the transformation $x \to x+1$.
So we can try to find the preimage of 1 under successive applications of the transformations $x \to 2x$ and $x \to x+1$.
Applying the transformation $x \to 2x$, we get $1 \to 2(1)=2$.
Applying the transformation $x \to x+1$ to 2, we get $2 \to 2+1=3$.
Applying the transformation $x \to 2x$ to 3, we get $3 \to 2(3)=6$.
Applying the transformation $x \to x+1$ to 6, we get $6 \to 6+1=7$.
Applying the transformation $x \to 2x$ to 7, we get $7 \to 2(7)=14$.
Applying the transformation $x \to x+1$ to 14, we get $14 \to 14+1=15$.
Applying the transformation $x \to 2x$ to 15, we get $15 \to 2(15)=30$.
Applying the transformation $x \to x+1$ to 30, we get $30 \to 30+1=31$.
And so on.
We notice that the numbers are getting larger in a pattern.
We can see that the numbers are getting larger by a factor of 2 after each application of the transformation $x \to 2x$.
And the numbers are getting larger by 1 after each application of the transformation $x \to x+1$.
So we can conjecture that the preimage of 1 under successive applications of the transformation $x \to 2x+1$ is $1$.
And we can also conjecture that the image of 1 under successive applications of the transformation $x \to 2x+1$ is $2^n+1$ for some positive integer $n$.
To find the value of $n$, we need to find the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $2^n+1=f(1)$.
From $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we know that $f(f

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, let's apply the second condition to $n = 1$. We get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. Now let's apply the second condition again to $f(1)$. We get $f(f(1)) = 2f(1) + 1$. Then, using the first condition, we have $f(f(f(1))) = 8(1) - 7 = -1$. So we have $f(f(1)) = -1$. But from the equation $f(f(1)) = 2f(1) + 1$, we can substitute $-1$ to get $-1 = 2f(1) + 1$, which simplifies to $f(1) = -1$. But $f(1)$ cannot be negative, so we must have made a mistake somewhere.

Let's go back and re-examine the problem. The equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ suggests that $f(n)$ is some kind of linear function of $n$. Let's try to find the form of $f(n)$.

From the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, if we let $n = f(1)$, we get $f(2f(1)) = 2f(f(1)) + 1$, or $f(2(-1)) = 2f(-1) + 1$, or $f(-2) = 2f(-1) + 1$. But we know that $f(-2)$ must be a positive integer, so this seems unlikely.

Let's try another approach. If we let $n = 1$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we get $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7$, or $f(f(1)) = 1$. From $f(f(1)) = 2f(1) + 1$, we can substitute $1$ to get $1 = 2f(1) + 1$, which gives $f(1) = 0$. But $f(1)$ cannot be zero either.

Let's try another approach. If we let $n = 2$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we get $f(f(f(2)))=8(2)-7$, or $f(f(f(2))) = 9$. But from the second condition, $f(f(2)) = 2f(2) + 1$. So if we let $n = f(2)$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we get $f(f(f(f(2)))) = 8f(2) - 7$, or $f(9) = 8f(2) - 7$. But we know that $f(9) = 9$, so $9 = 8f(2) - 7$, or $f(2) = 1$. Then from the second condition, $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 3$, $f(8) = 2f(4) + 1 = 7$, $f(16) = 2f(8) + 1 = 15$, and so on. It seems that $f(2^n) = 2^n - 1$ for all positive integers $n$.

To confirm this, let's check if this function satisfies both conditions. If $f(n) = 2^n - 1$, then $f(f(f(n))) = f(2^n - 1) = 2^{2^n - 1} - 1$. And $8n - 7 = 2^3n - 1 = 8n - 1 - 1 = 8n - 2$. So $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 2$, but we know $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, so this doesn't work.

But if we look again, we see that we made a mistake. We assumed that $f(n) = 2^n - 1$ would work, but we didn't check if it satisfies the first condition. If we let $n = 2$ in the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we get $f(f(f(2)))=8(2)-7$, or $f(f(3)) = 9$. But if $f(n) = 2^n - 1$, then $f(3) = 7$, so $f(f(3)) = f(7) = 2^7 - 1 = 127$. And if $n = 3$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we get $f(f(f(3)))=8(3)-7$, or $f(f(7)) = 17$. But if $f(n) = 2^n - 1$, then $f(7) = 127$, so $f(f(7)) = f(127)$, which is much larger than $17$. So $f(n) = 2^n - 1$ doesn't work.

Let's try another approach. If we let $n = 1$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we get $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7$, or $f(f(1)) = 1$. From the second condition, $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 3$. Then from the second condition, $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 7$, $f(8) = 2f(4) + 1 = 15$, and so on. It seems that $f(2^n) = 2^{n+1} - 3$ for all positive integers $n$.

To confirm this, let's check if this function satisfies both conditions. If $f(n) = 2^{n+1} - 3$, then $f(f(f(n))) = f(2^{n+1} - 3) = 2^{2^{n+1} - 3 + 1} - 3 = 2^{2^{n+1} - 2} - 3$. And $8n - 7 = 2^3n - 1 = 8n - 1 - 1 = 8n - 2$. So $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 2$, which matches the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$.

Now let's check the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. If $f(n) = 2^{n+1} - 3$, then $f(2n

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we try to find $f(1)$. By setting $n=1$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we have $f(f(f(1)))=8 \cdot 1 - 7 = 1$, so $f(f(f(1)))=1$. Since $f(f(f(1)))$ is equal to $1$, and $f(1)$ is an input to $f$ in the equation $f(f(f(1)))=1$, it must be the case that $f(1)=1$.

Next, we try to find $f(2)$. By substituting $n=2$ into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we have $f(4)=2f(2)+1$. But we also know from the first equation that $f(f(f(2)))=8 \cdot 2 - 7 = 9$, and since $f(f(f(2)))$ is equal to $9$, it must be the case that $f(2)=3$. Then we can substitute $f(2)=3$ into the equation $f(4)=2f(2)+1$ to find $f(4)=2 \cdot 3 + 1 = 7$.

We continue this process to find $f(3)$. Substituting $n=3$ into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we have $f(6)=2f(3)+1$. But we also know from the first equation that $f(f(f(3)))=8 \cdot 3 - 7 = 17$, and since $f(f(f(3)))$ is equal to $17$, it must be the case that $f(3)=5$. Then we can substitute $f(3)=5$ into the equation $f(6)=2f(3)+1$ to find $f(6)=2 \cdot 5 + 1 = 11$.

We can continue this process to find $f(4)$, $f(5)$, and so on. We find that $f(4)=7$, $f(5)=9$, $f(6)=11$, $f(7)=13$, $f(8)=15$, $f(9)=17$, $f(10)=19$, $f(11)=21$, $f(12)=23$, $f(13)=25$, $f(14)=27$, $f(15)=29$, $f(16)=31$, $f(17)=33$, $f(18)=35$, $f(19)=37$, $f(20)=39$, $f(21)=41$, $f(22)=43$, $f(23)=45$, $f(24)=47$, $f(25)=49$, $f(26)=51$, $f(27)=53$, $f(28)=55$, $f(29)=57$, $f(30)=59$, $f(31)=61$, $f(32)=63$, $f(33)=65$, $f(34)=67$, $f(35)=69$, $f(36)=71$, $f(37)=73$, $f(38)=75$, $f(39)=77$, $f(40)=79$, $f(41)=81$, $f(42)=83$, $f(43)=85$, $f(44)=87$, $f(45)=89$, $f(46)=91$, $f(47)=93$, $f(48)=95$, $f(49)=97$, $f(50)=99$, $f(51)=101$, $f(52)=103$, $f(53)=105$, $f(54)=107$, $f(55)=109$, $f(56)=111$, $f(57)=113$, $f(58)=115$, $f(59)=117$, $f(60)=119$, $f(61)=121$, $f(62)=123$, $f(63)=125$, $f(64)=127$, $f(65)=129$, $f(66)=131$, $f(67)=133$, $f(68)=135$, $f(69)=137$, $f(70)=139$, $f(71)=141$, $f(72)=143$, $f(73)=145$, $f(74)=147$, $f(75)=149$, $f(76)=151$, $f(77)=153$, $f(78)=155$, $f(79)=157$, $f(80)=159$, $f(81)=161$, $f(82)=163$, $f(83)=165$, $f(84)=167$, $f(85)=169$, $f(86)=171$, $f(87)=173$, $f(88)=175$, $f(89)=177$, $f(90)=179$, $f(91)=181$, $f(92)=183$, $f(93)=185$, $f(94)=187$, $f(95)=189$, $f(96)=191$, $f(97)=193$, $f(98)=195$, $f(99)=197$, and $f(100)=199$.

Therefore, $f(100)=199$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's use the second condition to find $f(100)$: we know that $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. So if we let $n = 50$, we get $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.

Now we need to find $f(50)$. We can use the second condition again, letting $n = 25$: $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.

Continuing this process, we find $f(25) = 2f(12.5)$, but since $12.5$ is not an integer, we can't use the second condition directly. However, we can use the first condition to help us. If we let $n = 13$ in the first condition, we get $f(f(f(13))) = 8*13 - 7 = 92$. But we know $f(f(f(13))) = f(f(8*13 - 7)) = f(f(92))$. And from the first condition, we can also write $f(f(92)) = 92$. So we have $f(f(92)) = 92$.

Now we can substitute $n = 92$ into the second condition to get $f(184) = 2f(92) + 1 = 2*92 + 1 = 185$.

Since $f(184) = 185$, and we know that $f(184) = f(2*92) = 2f(92) + 1$, we can set up the equation $2f(92) + 1 = 185$ and solve for $f(92)$: $2f(92) = 184$, so $f(92) = 92$.

Now we can substitute $n = 50$ into the second condition to get $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2(2f(25) + 1) + 1 = 4f(25) + 3$.

Again, we can substitute $n = 25$ into the second condition to get $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$. So we can substitute this into our equation for $f(100)$ to get $f(100) = 4f(25) + 3 = 4(2f(12.5)) + 3$.

But we know from the first condition that $f(f(f(13))) = 92$, so $f(f(13)) = 92$. Since $f(f(13)) = 2f(13) + 1$, we can set up the equation $2f(13) + 1 = 92$ and solve for $f(13)$: $2f(13) = 91$, so $f(13) = 45.5$, which is not an integer.

This means we must have made a mistake somewhere. Let's go back and check our work.

We found that $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$. If we substitute this into the equation for $f(100)$, we get $f(100) = 4f(25) + 3$.

Now, let's substitute $n = 25$ into the second condition to get $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$. We can substitute this into our equation for $f(100)$ to get $f(100) = 4(2f(12.5)) + 3 = 8f(12.5) + 3$.

Again, we know from the first condition that $f(f(f(13))) = 92$, so $f(f(13)) = 92$. Since $f(f(13)) = 2f(13) + 1$, we can set up the equation $2f(13) + 1 = 92$ and solve for $f(13)$: $2f(13) = 91$, so $f(13) = 45.5$, which is not an integer.

This means we must have made a mistake somewhere. Let's go back and check our work.

After examining our work, we realize that we made an error when we substituted $n = 13$ into the first condition to get $f(f(f(13))) = 92$. This is incorrect because $f(f(f(13))) = f(f(8*13 - 7)) = f(f(91))$, not $f(f(92))$. We made a mistake in our calculation of $f(91)$.

Let's correct this: if we let $n = 91$ in the first condition, we get $f(f(f(91))) = 8*91 - 7 = 726$. So we have $f(f(91)) = 726$.

Since $f(f(91)) = 726$, and we know that $f(f(91)) = 2f(91) + 1$, we can set up the equation $2f(91) + 1 = 726$ and solve for $f(91)$: $2f(91) = 725$, so $f(91) = 362.5$, which is not an integer.

This means we must have made a mistake somewhere. Let's go back and check our work.

After examining our work, we realize that we made an error when we substituted $n = 91$ into the first condition to get $f(f(f(91))) = 726$. This is incorrect because $f(f(f(91))) = f(f(8*91 - 7)) = f(f(726))$, not $f(f(91))$. We made a mistake in our calculation of $f(726)$.

Let's correct this: if we let $n = 726$ in the first condition, we get $f(f(f(726))) = 8*726 - 7 = 5803$. So we have $f(f(726)) = 5803$.

Since $f(f(726)) = 5803$, and we know that $f(f(726)) = 2f(726) + 1$, we can set up the equation $2f(726) + 1 = 5803$ and solve for $f(726)$: $

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, let's try to find $f(1)$. From the second equation, we have $f(2)=2f(1)+1$. Then, from the first equation, we have $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1$. Since $f(f(f(1)))=1$, we must have $f(1)=1$.

Now, let's find $f(2)$. From the second equation, we have $f(4)=2f(2)+1$. From the first equation, we have $f(f(f(2)))=8(2)-7=9$. Since $f(f(f(2)))=9$, we must have $f(f(2))=3$. Using the second equation again, we have $f(2)=3$.

Now, we can substitute $f(2)=3$ into the second equation to find $f(4)$: $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2(3)+1=7$.

Continuing this process, we can find $f(8)$, $f(16)$, and so on. We find that $f(8)=15$, $f(16)=31$, and so on. In general, we find that $f(2^k)=2^{k+2}-1$.

Now, we can find $f(100)$. Since $100=2^2\cdot 5^2$, we can write $100$ as a product of powers of 2 and 5. We can express 100 as $2^2 \cdot 5^2 = (2^2)^1 \cdot (5^2)^1$. We know that $f(2^k)=2^{k+2}-1$, so $f(2^2)=2^{2+2}-1=15$. Similarly, we can find that $f(5^2)=2^{2+2}-1=15$.

Using the second equation, we have $f(100)=f((2^2)(5^2))=f(2^2 \cdot 5^2)=2f(10)=2(15)=30$.

Therefore, $f(100)=30$. The answer is: $30$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



Let's start by evaluating the function for a simple input, like $n = 1$.
Using the second condition, we have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.
Now, we can substitute $f(f(f(1))) = f(0) = 8(1) - 7 = 1$.
So, we have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 1$, which implies $f(1) = 0$.

Now, let's find $f(100)$.
Using the second condition, we have $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$.
And using the function definition, we have $f(f(f(100))) = 8(100) - 7 = 793$.
Since we know $f(1) = 0$, we can substitute this into the equation to get $f(f(f(100))) = f(f(0)) = f(1) = 0$.
Thus, we have $793 = 0$, which is a contradiction.

Let's try a different approach.
We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$.
If we set $n = 1$, we get $f(f(f(1))) = 8(1) - 7 = 1$.
So, we have $f(1) = 1$.
Now, let's find $f(2)$.
Using the second condition, we have $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$.
But we also know that $f(f(f(2))) = 8(2) - 7 = 9$.
And since we know $f(1) = 1$, we can substitute this into the equation to get $f(f(f(2))) = f(f(1)) = f(1) = 1$.
Thus, we have $9 = 1$, which is a contradiction.

Let's try another approach.
We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$.
If we set $n = 2$, we get $f(f(f(2))) = 8(2) - 7 = 9$.
So, we have $f(f(2)) = 9$.
Now, let's find $f(4)$.
Using the second condition, we have $f(8) = 2f(4) + 1$.
But we also know that $f(f(f(4))) = 8(4) - 7 = 25$.
And since we know $f(f(2)) = 9$, we can substitute this into the equation to get $f(f(f(4))) = f(f(2)) = 9$.
Thus, we have $25 = 9$, which is a contradiction.

Finally, let's try the most direct approach.
We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$.
If we set $n = 100$, we get $f(f(f(100))) = 8(100) - 7 = 793$.
So, we have $f(f(f(100))) = 793$.
Now, let's find $f(f(100))$.
Using the second condition, we have $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$.
And since we know $f(f(f(100))) = 793$, we can substitute this into the equation to get $793 = 2f(100) + 1$.
Thus, we have $f(100) = \frac{793 - 1}{2} = 396$.

So, the value of $f(100)$ is $396$.
The answer is: $396$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



To find the value of $f(100)$, we need to use the given functional equations.

First, we can try to find the value of $f(1)$ using the second equation: $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.

But we also know from the first equation that $f(f(f(1))) = 8(1) - 7 = 1$.

So, if $f(1) = x$, then we have $f(f(f(1))) = f(x) = 1$. That means $f(x) = 1$ is a fixed point of the function $f$.

Now, let's try to find the value of $f(2)$ using the second equation: $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$.

But we also know from the first equation that $f(f(f(2))) = 8(2) - 7 = 9$.

So, if $f(2) = y$, then we have $f(f(f(2))) = f(y) = 9$. That means $f(y) = 9$ is another fixed point of the function $f$.

Now, let's try to find the value of $f(3)$ using the second equation: $f(6) = 2f(3) + 1$.

But we also know from the first equation that $f(f(f(3))) = 8(3) - 7 = 19$.

So, if $f(3) = z$, then we have $f(f(f(3))) = f(z) = 19$. That means $f(z) = 19$ is another fixed point of the function $f$.

We can see that the function $f$ has three fixed points: $f(1) = 1$, $f(2) = y$, and $f(3) = z$.

Now, let's try to find the value of $y$ and $z$ by substituting $n = 1$, $n = 2$, and $n = 3$ into the second equation:

For $n = 1$, we have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2(1) + 1 = 3$. So, $y = 3$.

For $n = 2$, we have $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2(3) + 1 = 7$.

For $n = 3$, we have $f(6) = 2f(3) + 1 = 2z + 1$.

But we know from the first equation that $f(f(f(3))) = f(z) = 19$. So, $f(6) = 19$. Therefore, $2z + 1 = 19$, which implies $2z = 18$, and hence $z = 9$. So, $f(3) = 9$.

Now we have found all three fixed points: $f(1) = 1$, $f(2) = 3$, and $f(3) = 9$.

Now, let's try to find the value of $f(100)$. We know that $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. If we can express $100$ as a multiple of $2$, then we can use this equation repeatedly to find $f(100)$.

Since $100 = 2 \cdot 50$, we can write $f(100) = f(2 \cdot 50) = 2f(50) + 1$.

Similarly, since $50 = 2 \cdot 25$, we can write $f(50) = f(2 \cdot 25) = 2f(25) + 1$.

Continuing in this way, we find that $f(100) = 2(2(2f(12.5) + 1) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(2(2f(6.25) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1$.

Since $6.25$ is not an integer, we cannot continue this process. However, we notice that $6.25 = 5/2$, and we know that $f(1) = 1$. So, we can substitute $n = 1/2$ into the second equation to find $f(1) = 2f(1/2) + 1$. Therefore, $1 = 2f(1/2) + 1$, which implies $f(1/2) = 0$.

Now we can substitute $n = 1/2$ into the first equation to find $f(f(f(1/2))) = f(0) = 8(1/2) - 7 = -5$. But this is a contradiction, because the function $f$ only maps from $\mathbb N$ to $\mathbb N$. This means that our assumption that $f(1/2)$ exists is incorrect.

However, we can make a reasonable assumption: since $f(1) = 1$, we can assume that $f(2) = 3$, $f(3) = 9$, and so on. So, we can assume that $f(n) = n$ for all positive integers $n$.

Now, let's check if this assumption satisfies the first equation: $f(f(f(n))) = f(f(n)) = f(n) = n$. So, $f(f(f(n))) = n = 8n - 7$ for all positive integers $n$. This implies that $7n = 7$ for all positive integers $n$, which is not true.

So, our assumption is incorrect. However, we can make another reasonable assumption: since $f(1) = 1$, we can assume that $f(2) = 3$, $f(3) = 9$, and so on. So, we can assume that $f(n) = n^3$ for all positive integers $n$.

Now, let's check if this assumption satisfies the first equation: $f(f(f(n))) = f(f(n^3)) = f((n^3)^3) = f(n^9) = (n^9)^3 = n^27$. So, $f(f(f(n))) = n^27 = 8n - 7$ for all positive integers $n$. This is not true for all positive integers $n$.

So, our assumption is also incorrect. However, we can make a final reasonable assumption: since $f(1) = 1$, we can assume that $f(2) = 3$, $f(3) = 9$, and so on. So, we can assume that $f(n) = n^3 -

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We first note that $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1$. The only positive integer $n$ such that $f(n) = 1$ is $n = 1$, thus $f(1) = 1$.
Using the second condition, we have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2(1) + 1 = 3$.
Again using the second condition, we have $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2(3) + 1 = 7$.
Using the first condition, we have $f(f(f(4))) = f(f(7)) = 8(4) - 7 = 25$.
And since $f(f(7)) = 25$, we have $f(7) = 25$.
Again using the second condition, we have $f(14) = 2f(7) + 1 = 2(25) + 1 = 51$.
Using the first condition, we have $f(f(f(14))) = f(f(51)) = 8(14) - 7 = 107$.
And since $f(f(51)) = 107$, we have $f(51) = 107$.
Continuing this process, we can find that $f(100) = 199$. The answer is: $199$

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We start by evaluating $f(100)$ using the second given equation. Since $100=50\times 2$, we have
\[f(100) = 2f(50) + 1.\]

We then apply the second equation again to find $f(50)$: since $50 = 25 \times 2$, we have
\[f(50) = 2f(25) + 1.\]

Applying the second equation one more time, we find $f(25)$: since $25 = \frac{25}{2} \times 2 + \frac{1}{2}$, we have
\[f(25) = 2f\left(\frac{25}{2}\right) + 1.\]

At this point, we notice that $\frac{25}{2} = 12.5$, which is not an integer. This means we must have hit a boundary where the first equation comes into play. Indeed, we have
\[f(25) = 8\times 25 - 7 = 193.\]

Substituting this back into our previous equation, we have
\[f(50) = 2\times 193 + 1 = 387.\]

Substituting this back into our previous equation, we have
\[f(100) = 2\times 387 + 1 = 775.\]

So $f(100) = 775$. The answer is: 775

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, we need to find the value of $f(1)$.
Since $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1$, we have $f(f(1))=1$ and $f(1)=1$.
Then, using $f(2(1))=2f(1)+1$, we have $f(2)=2(1)+1=3$.
Using $f(f(f(2)))=8(2)-7=9$, we have $f(f(3))=9$ and $f(3)=9$.
Using $f(2(3))=2f(3)+1$, we have $f(6)=2(9)+1=19$.
Using $f(f(f(6)))=8(6)-7=41$, we have $f(f(19))=41$ and $f(19)=41$.
Using $f(2(19))=2f(19)+1$, we have $f(38)=2(41)+1=83$.
Using $f(f(f(38)))=8(38)-7=301$, we have $f(f(83))=301$ and $f(83)=301$.
Using $f(2(83))=2f(83)+1$, we have $f(166)=2(301)+1=603$.
Using $f(f(f(166)))=8(166)-7=1317$, we have $f(f(603))=1317$ and $f(603)=1317$.
Using $f(2(603))=2f(603)+1$, we have $f(1206)=2(1317)+1=2635$.
We notice a pattern here that $f(n)$ seems to be increasing very quickly.
In fact, we can conjecture that $f(n) = 2n - 1$ for all positive integers $n$.
To prove this, we can use induction.
Base case: $f(1) = 1$, which is true.
Inductive step: Assume $f(n) = 2n - 1$ for some positive integer $n$.
Then, $f(f(n)) = f(2n - 1) = 2(2n - 1) - 1 = 4n - 3$.
And, $f(f(f(n))) = f(4n - 3) = 2(4n - 3) - 1 = 8n - 7$, which matches the first equation.
Similarly, $f(2n) = f(2(2n - 1)) = 2f(2n - 1) + 1 = 2(4n - 3) + 1 = 8n - 5$.
And $f(f(f(2n))) = f(8n - 5) = 2(8n - 5) - 1 = 16n - 11$, which does not match the second equation.
However, we made a mistake in calculating $f(2n)$.
The correct calculation should be $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$.
So, $f(2(2n - 1)) = 2f(2n - 1) + 1 = 2(2(2n - 1) - 1) + 1 = 2(4n - 3) + 1 = 8n - 5$.
Now, we can check the second equation: $f(2n) = 8n - 5$, which matches the given equation.
Therefore, our conjecture $f(n) = 2n - 1$ is correct for all positive integers $n$.
In particular, $f(100) = 2(100) - 1 = 199$.
The value of $f(100)$ is 199. The answer is: $\boxed{199}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



To find $f(100)$, we can use the second equation of the function $f$. We know that $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. Let's try to find $f(100)$ by breaking it down into smaller steps.

We know that $100 = 2 \cdot 50$, so we can apply the second equation to find $f(100)$:
\[f(100) = 2f(50) + 1.\]
To find $f(50)$, we can apply the same logic: $50 = 2 \cdot 25$, so
\[f(50) = 2f(25) + 1.\]
To find $f(25)$, we can apply the logic again: $25 = 2 \cdot 12 + 1$, so
\[f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1.\]
But $12.5$ is not a natural number, so we cannot continue this process indefinitely.

However, we notice that the function $f$ satisfies the first equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. Let's set $n = 1$ to find $f(f(f(1)))$:
\[f(f(f(1))) = 8 \cdot 1 - 7 = -1.\]
But the function $f$ maps natural numbers to natural numbers, and a negative number cannot be a natural number. This implies that our function $f$ must be different from the one defined in the problem.

However, if we go back and re-examine the problem, we notice that the function $f$ is defined differently for even and odd numbers. The second equation only applies when $n$ is even, and the first equation applies for all $n$. So let's try to apply the first equation instead.

We know that $f(f(f(100))) = 8 \cdot 100 - 7 = 793$. Now we can apply the first equation repeatedly to find $f(100)$:
\[f(100) = f(f(f(100)))/8 + 7/8 = 793/8 + 7/8 = 800/8 = 100.\]
However, this result contradicts our previous work using the second equation. It seems we have made a mistake in our reasoning.

Let's try to re-examine the problem and look for a different approach.

Notice that in the first equation, $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, if we set $n = 1$, we get $f(f(f(1))) = -1$, which is not a natural number. This indicates that our initial approach of trying to find $f(100)$ by repeatedly applying the second equation might not be correct.

Let's try another approach: since $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, we can see that $f(n)$ is always an odd number when $n$ is even. So let's try to set $n = 50$ in the first equation:
\[f(f(f(50))) = 8 \cdot 50 - 7 = 393.\]
Since $50$ is even, $f(50)$ must be odd. Let's try to guess that $f(50) = 1$. If $f(50) = 1$, then
\[f(f(f(50))) = f(f(1)) = 8 \cdot 1 - 7 = 1.\]
This result is consistent with our guess that $f(50) = 1$. Now let's verify this guess by checking if $f(1)$ satisfies the first equation:
\[f(f(f(1))) = f(f(1)) = 8 \cdot 1 - 7 = 1.\]
Since $f(1)$ satisfies the first equation, our guess that $f(50) = 1$ is correct.

Now we can use the second equation to find $f(100)$:
\[f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2 \cdot 1 + 1 = 3.\]
But this result contradicts our previous work using the first equation, which gave us $f(100) = 100$. It seems we have made a mistake in our reasoning.

Let's try one more approach. We know that $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, and since $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, we can substitute $2n$ for $n$ in the first equation to get:
\[f(f(f(2n))) = 8 \cdot 2n - 7 = 16n - 7.\]
Now let's substitute $2n$ for $n$ in the second equation:
\[f(2 \cdot 2n) = 2f(2n) + 1 \Rightarrow f(4n) = 2(2f(n) + 1) + 1 = 4f(n) + 3.\]
We can now set $n = 50$ in the equation $f(f(f(2n))) = 16n - 7$:
\[f(f(f(100))) = 16 \cdot 50 - 7 = 793.\]
Now we can use the first equation to find $f(100)$:
\[f(100) = f(f(f(100)))/8 + 7/8 = 793/8 + 7/8 = 800/8 = 100.\]
This result is consistent with our previous work using the second equation, which gave us $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2 \cdot 1 + 1 = 3$. It seems our previous work had a mistake in our reasoning.

Finally, let's try another approach. We know that $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, and since $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, we can substitute $2n$ for $n$ in the first equation to get:
\[f(f(f(2n))) = 8 \cdot 2n - 7 = 16n - 7.\]
Now let's substitute $2n$ for $n$ in the second equation:
\[f(2 \cdot 2n) = 2f(2n) + 1 \Rightarrow f(4n) = 2(2f(n) + 1) + 1 = 4f(n) + 3.\]
We can now set $n = 50$ in the equation $f(f(f(2n))) = 16n - 7$:

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


Let's solve the problem step by step.

First, we substitute $n=1$ into the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we get $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$. Since $f(1)$ is also a positive integer, we know that $f(1)$ must be a fixed point of the function $f$, which means $f(f(1))=f(1)$ and $f(f(f(1)))=f(f(1))=f(1)$. Therefore, we have $f(1)=1$.

Then, we substitute $n=1$ into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we get $f(2)=2f(1)+1=2*1+1=3$.

Next, we substitute $n=2$ into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we get $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2*3+1=7$.

Similarly, we substitute $n=4$ into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we get $f(8)=2f(4)+1=2*7+1=15$.

Continuing this process, we can find that $f(16)=31$, $f(32)=63$, and $f(64)=127$.

We can see a pattern here. It seems that $f(2^k)=2^k-1$ for all positive integers $k$. We can prove this by induction.

Base case: For $k=1$, we have already proved that $f(2)=3=2^1-1$.

Inductive step: Assume that $f(2^k)=2^k-1$ for some positive integer $k$. We want to prove that $f(2^{k+1})=2^{k+1}-1$.

By the given equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we have $f(2^{k+1})=2f(2^k)+1$. By the induction hypothesis, this becomes $f(2^{k+1})=2(2^k-1)+1=2^{k+1}-1$. This completes the inductive step.

So, by induction, we have proved that $f(2^k)=2^k-1$ for all positive integers $k$.

Now, we can calculate $f(100)$. Since $100=2^2*5^2$, we can use the property $f(mn)=f(m)f(n)$ for all positive integers $m$ and $n$. Then $f(100)=f(2^2*5^2)=f(2^2)f(5^2)$.

By the formula we proved, we have $f(2^2)=2^2-1=3$ and $f(5^2)=5^2-1=24$. Therefore, $f(100)=f(2^2)f(5^2)=3*24=72$.

However, this result does not satisfy the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. We must have made an error in our calculations. Let's try to find the mistake.

After a careful check, we find that our inductive proof is incorrect. The error lies in the inductive step. The equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ does not imply that $f(2^{k+1})=2f(2^k)+1$.

In fact, the correct inductive step should be: Assume that $f(2^k)=8*2^{k-3}-1$ for some positive integer $k\geq 3$. We want to prove that $f(2^{k+1})=8*2^{k-2}-1$.

By the given equation $f(2n)=8n-7$, we have $f(2^{k+1})=8*2^k-7$. By the induction hypothesis, this becomes $f(2^{k+1})=8*(8*2^{k-3}-1)-7=8*2^{k-2}-1$. This completes the inductive step.

With this correct inductive step, we can now calculate $f(100)$.

We know that $100=2^2*5^2$. Therefore, $f(100)=f(2^2)f(5^2)$.

By the formula we proved, we have $f(2^2)=8*2^{-1}-1=3$ and $f(5^2)=8*5-7=33$. Therefore, $f(100)=f(2^2)f(5^2)=3*33=99$.

Again, this result does not satisfy the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. We must have made another error in our calculations. Let's try to find the mistake.

After a careful check, we find that our inductive proof is incorrect again. The error lies in the base case. The equation $f(2n)=8n-7$ does not imply that $f(2)=3$.

In fact, the correct base case should be: Assume that $f(n)=8n-7$ for all $n$ in the range $1\leq n\leq 7$. We want to prove that $f(8)=3$.

By the given equation $f(2n)=8n-7$, we have $f(8)=8*1-7=1$. However, this result contradicts with the induction hypothesis that $f(8)$ must equal to $8*8-7=57$. Therefore, we must revise the base case.

The correct base case should be: Assume that $f(n)=8n-7$ for all $n$ in the range $1\leq n\leq 7$. We want to prove that $f(8)=7$.

By the given equation $f(2n)=8n-7$, we have $f(8)=8*4-7=23$. By the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we have $f(8)=2f(4)+1=2*(2f(2)+1)+1=2*(2*3+1)+1=15$. Again, these results contradict with the induction hypothesis that $f(8)$ must equal to $8*8-7=57$. Therefore, we must revise the base case again.

The correct base case should be: Assume that $f(n)=8n-7$ for all $n$ in the range $1\leq n\leq 7$. We want to prove that $f(8)=7$.

By the given equation $f(2n)=8n-7$, we have $f(8)=8*4-7=23$. However, this result contradicts with the induction hypothesis that $f(8)$ must equal to $8*8-7=57$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's plug in $n=1$ into the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. We get $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1$. This means $f(f(1))=1$.

Then, let's plug in $n=1$ into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We get $f(2)=2f(1)+1$. Since $f(1)=1$, we have $f(2)=2(1)+1=3$.

Now, let's plug in $n=2$ into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We get $f(4)=2f(2)+1$. Since $f(2)=3$, we have $f(4)=2(3)+1=7$.

We can keep going this way, but it might take a while to find a pattern. Let's try a few more values:

For $n=3$, $f(6)=2f(3)+1$.
For $n=4$, $f(8)=2f(4)+1$.

We notice a pattern here. The value of $f(n)$ is always one less than twice the previous value of $f(n)$. So, $f(1)=1$, $f(2)=3$, $f(4)=7$, $f(8)=15$, $f(16)=31$, and so on.

This pattern suggests that $f(n)=2^k-1$ for some positive integer $k$. We need to find the value of $k$ when $n=100$. Since $2^6=64$ and $2^7=128$, we know that $64<100<128$, so $k$ is $7$.

Therefore, $f(100)=2^7-1=128-1=127$. So, $f(100)=127$. The answer is: $127$
