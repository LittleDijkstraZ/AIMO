 The problem asks for how many positive integers $m$ the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. This equation is a piecewise function, and its graph is made up of four line segments. Each segment represents a separate case of the absolute value function. For each segment, we can solve the equation and count the number of distinct solutions.

After careful analysis of each case and programming the solution, the value of $m$ that gives $4$ distinct solutions is found to be $m=50$. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{1}$.
The answer is $\boxed{1}$.

 The number of distinct solutions of the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ is 4 if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 1$. This is because the expression $| |x - 1| - 2|$ can be 1 in four different ways:

1. If $|x - 1| - 2 = 1$, then $|x - 1| = 3$, and $x - 1 = \pm 3$, giving $x = 4$ or $x = -2$.
2. If $|x - 1| - 2 = -1$, then $|x - 1| = 1$, and $x - 1 = \pm 1$, giving $x = 2$ or $x = 0$.

So the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = 1$ has four distinct solutions: $x = 0, 2, 4, -2$.

Therefore, the only value of $m$ that makes the equation have four distinct solutions is $m = 100$. 

The answer is: $1$

 This problem seems to be a bit more complex than the usual problems that we usually solve in a python environment. But, the problem can be simplified to a smaller problem: "For how many values of $m$ will the function $f(x) = | |x - 1| - 2 |$ intersect the horizontal line $y = m/100$ exactly four times?"

The function $f(x) = | |x - 1| - 2 |$ has a graph that is V-shaped and consists of three segments. The first segment is a line segment from $(1 - 2, 2)$ to $(1 + 2, 2)$, the second segment is a line segment from $(1 + 2, 2)$ to $(3, 0)$, and the third segment is a line segment from $(3, 0)$ to $(1 - 2, 2)$. The line segment from $(1 - 2, 2)$ to $(1 + 2, 2)$ is the line $y = 2$, the line segment from $(1 + 2, 2)$ to $(3, 0)$ is the line segment from $(3, 0)$ to $(1 - 2, 2)$ is the line $y = |x - 1| - 2$.

The horizontal line $y = m/100$ intersects the line segment $y = 2$ at exactly one point when $0 < m/100 < 2$, i.e., when $0 < m < 200$. The horizontal line intersects the line segment $y = |x - 1| - 2$ at exactly two points when $2 - m/100 > 0$, i.e., when $m < 200 - 2*100 = 100$. So, the horizontal line $y = m/100$ intersects the graph of $f(x)$ at exactly four points when $100 < m < 200$. There are exactly 100 such integers $m$.

Therefore, there are 100 positive integer values of $m$ for which the equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = m/100$ has exactly 4 distinct solutions.
The answer is: $100$

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"

Assistant:

 The equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions, we want to find the value of $m$.
First, let's understand the number of solutions of the equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$.
The expression $| |x-1|-2|$ is equal to 0 when $|x-1|=2$, which gives two solutions $x=3$ and $x=-1$.
So, the equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}=1$.
Solving for $m$ gives $m=100$. So there is only one value of $m$ that satisfies the condition. The answer is: $1$

Assistant:

 The number of distinct solutions to the equation $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|=\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to 4 if and only if $\frac{m}{100}=1$. This is because the expression $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|$ can take on exactly four distinct values when it equals 1.

Therefore, we have $\frac{m}{100}=1$, which implies $m=100$. So, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions, and that is $m=100$. The answer is: $100$

Assistant:

 We know that the equation $| |x-1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. 

This equation is equivalent to a piecewise function with 4 cases:
1. $|x - 1 - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$, when $x - 1 \geq 2$, which simplifies to $|x - 3| = \frac{m}{100}$.
2. $|x - 1 - 2| = -\frac{m}{100}$, when $x - 1 < 2$, which simplifies to $|x - 3| = -\frac{m}{100}$.
3. $|1 - x - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$, when $1 - x \geq 2$, which simplifies to $|-x - 1| = \frac{m}{100}$.
4. $|1 - x - 2| = -\frac{m}{100}$, when $1 - x < 2$, which simplifies to $|-x - 1| = -\frac{m}{100}$.

Case 1 and Case 2 give the same solutions since $|x - 3|$ is always nonnegative, and similarly, Case 3 and Case 4 give the same solutions since $|-x - 1|$ is always nonnegative.

So we just need to solve the following two cases:

1. $|x - 3| = \frac{m}{100}$, which gives two equations: $x - 3 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $x - 3 = -\frac{m}{100}$. The sum of the solutions to these two equations is 6.
2. $|-x - 1| = \frac{m}{100}$, which gives two equations: $-x - 1 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $-x - 1 = -\frac{m}{100}$. The sum of the solutions to these two equations is -2.

Therefore, the sum of the 4 solutions is $6 - 2 = 4$.

The value of $m$ that makes the sum of the 4 solutions equal to 4 is 50.

To find out how many values of $m$ make the equation have 4 distinct solutions, we can try values of $m$ from 1 to 100 and see how many of them make the sum of the 4 solutions equal to 4. 

By doing this, we find that there is only one value of $m$, which is 50.

So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 1.

Therefore, the value of $m$ that satisfies this condition is 50. The answer is: 1
