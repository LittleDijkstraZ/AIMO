Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1) The equation given is a product of two terms equal to zero, so we know that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

2) In the first two cases, we get $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ respectively, which are equations of a square with side length of $10$ units centered at the origin.
In the last two cases, we get $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which are equations of a square with side length of $16$ units centered at the origin.

3) The intersection of these two squares forms the convex polygon. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares.

Let's calculate it using sympy:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Rational, simplify

def calculate_area():
    # Side lengths of the squares
    side1 = 10
    side2 = 16

    # Areas of the squares
    area1 = side1**2
    area2 = side2**2

    # Total area of the convex polygon
    total_area = area1 + area2

    return total_area

result = calculate_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 356

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
356
```

The area of the convex polygon is $356$. As we can see, it is a positive integer.

So the area of the convex polygon is $356$. The answer is: $\boxed{356}$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The condition for a product to be zero is that one of the factors must be zero. So, we have two equations:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10 \Rightarrow x + y = \pm 10$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x - y \vert = 10 \Rightarrow x - y = \pm 10$
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8 \Rightarrow x = \pm 8$
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert y \vert = 8 \Rightarrow y = \pm 8$

The solution of the above system of equations gives us the vertices of the polygon:
$(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

These points form a square with side length 16. To calculate the area of the square, we use the formula: area = side_length^2.

The side_length is 16, so the area of the square is 256.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256.
The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The given equation is a product of two terms equals to 0. Therefore, one of the terms must be zero for the equation to hold. This gives us two conditions to consider:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

Now we solve each condition:

1. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ gives $\vert x + y \vert = 10$.
2. $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$ gives $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
3. $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ gives $\vert x \vert = 8$, so $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
4. $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$ gives $\vert y \vert = 8$, so $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

We have four vertices of the polygon: (8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), and (-8, -8).

Now we calculate the area of the rectangle formed by these points. The length of the rectangle is 16 (from 8 to -8 in the x-axis) and the width is 16 (from 8 to -8 in the y-axis). The area of the rectangle is $16 \times 16 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256. This is a positive integer. The answer is: $\boxed{256}$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:


The equation is a product of two expressions, one of which is equal to zero makes the entire product zero. Thus, we have two cases to solve:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

Solving these cases we get the following solutions for the pairs $(x, y)$:

For Case 1: 
If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which gives us two lines: $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.
If $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which gives us two lines: $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.

For Case 2:
If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$, which gives us two lines: $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.
If $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us two lines: $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

Combining all the lines, we find that the points $(x, y)$ satisfying the given equation enclose a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Given the function
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0,\]
we know that the product of two terms should be zero, thus either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.

Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
This means that both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which imply that $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$. These equations represent a square with side length of $20$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
This implies that $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$, which is a square with side length of $16$.

Combining these two cases, we have a total area of a polygon formed by these squares. The area of the polygon would be the sum of the areas of the two squares.

The area of a square with side length $a$ is $a^2$, so the area of the larger square with side length $20$ is $20^2 = 400$ and the area of the smaller square with side length $16$ is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the total area of the polygon is $400 + 256 = 656$.

Thus, the area of the convex polygon is $656$. The answer is: $656$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The condition for the product of two expression to be zero is that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.
So, one of the following two conditions must be satisfied:

1. $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$
2. $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$

For the first condition to be true, it requires that both $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x - y| - 10 = 0$, which simplifies to $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$. The solutions to these two equations are:

- For $|x + y| = 10$, we have $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$
- For $|x - y| = 10$, we have $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$

Solving these four equations, we get four points: (0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0).

For the second condition to be true, it requires that both $|x| - 8 = 0$ and $|y| - 8 = 0$, which simplifies to $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. The solutions to these two equations are:

- For $|x| = 8$, we have $x = 8$ and $x = -8$
- For $|y| = 8$, we have $y = 8$ and $y = -8$

Solving these four combinations, we get the same four points: (0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0).

So all four points are valid for the condition $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
The shape formed by these points is a square with side length 10. The area of the square is therefore $10 \times 10 = 100$. So the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units. To confirm the solution, we can also calculate the area by directly using the formula for the area of a square. The side length is 10, so the area is indeed 100 square units. The answer is: $\boxed{100}$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The condition that $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ implies that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first case, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, it means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies that $x = 0$ and $y = 0$.

For the second case, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, it means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that $-8 \leq x \leq 8$ and $-8 \leq y \leq 8$.

Thus the points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying the condition form a square with side length $16$ (from $-8$ to $8$ in both $x$ and $y$), which has area $16^2 = 256$.

To calculate the area of the square in python, we can use the following code:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_square():
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length**2
    return area

result = area_of_square()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the square is $256$. The result is a positive integer, so our calculation is correct. The answer is: $256$.
