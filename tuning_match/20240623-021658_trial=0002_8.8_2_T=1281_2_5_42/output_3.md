Here's the step by step solution:



We have an equation given as $ ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$, so if this product of two terms is zero, it means that either of the term in the equation must equal zero, and only if a term in a product equals zero, that all terms have to be zero. This gives us the four cases for making each term separately zero.

In each of the four cases, two of $x$ or $y$ must be respectively either +8 or -8 (the absolute value of the number within the $| \cdot |$ gives $8$). Letâ€™s solve each:

For $ |x+y| - 10 = 0 \Rightarrow |x+y| = 10 \Rightarrow x+y = \pm 10$, giving the two parallel lines: $x+y = 10$ and $x+y = -10$.
For $ |x-y| - 10 = 0 \Rightarrow |x-y| = 10 \Rightarrow x-y = \pm 10$,  and this gives the two other parallel lines $x-y = 10$ and $x-y = -10$.
Similarly for $|x|-8=0\Rightarrow |x|=8\Rightarrow x=\pm8$,  giving the horizontal lines at $y=8$ and $y=-8$.
And for $|y|-8=0\Rightarrow |y|=8\Rightarrow y=\pm8$, giving the vertical lines at $x=8$ and $x=-8$.
The shape is a square with side length 10, where the points are where these four lines meet, at $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,-8)$,and $(-8,8)$, hence with a sidelength 10.
The area is determined as the square of the sidelength hence:
$Area = 10 \times 10 = 100$. 
So the area of the figure (a square) is $\boxed{100}$ square units.

INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_square():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    sidelength = 10
    area = sidelength ** 2
    return area

result = area_of_square()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 100

```output
100
```

Here is the Python code that computes the area of the square formed by the points:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_square():
    sidelength = 10
    area = sidelength ** 2
    return area

result = area_of_square()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 100

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
100
```
The answer is: the area of the convex polygon (which is a square in this case) is 100 square units.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Here's the step by step solution:



The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. According to the zero multiplication property, for the equation to hold, either $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$ or $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. 

In other words, either $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. 

From the conditions $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, we can conclude that the possible shapes of the polygon are a square of side length 10 and a rhombus (diamond) with diagonals of length 20.

From the conditions $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, we can conclude that the possible shape of the polygon is a square of side length 16.

Comparing these two scenarios, we find that the polygon has side length of 16 units (the square formed by the condition $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$) as the largest.

The area of a square with side length 16 units is given by $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $256$. The value of unknown variable is 256.
The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Here's the step by step solution:



The given expression is equal to zero if and only if both of the factors are equal to zero. The factors are:
1) $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)=0$
2) $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2)=0$

For the first factor to be zero, both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means that both $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. This forms a square with side length 20, so the area is $20^2 = 400$.

For the second factor to be zero, both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means that both $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This forms a square with side length 16, so the area is $16^2 = 256$.

The convex polygon enclosed by the solutions is the intersection of the two squares, which is also a square with side length 16, because the first factor encloses a square of side length 20, and the second factor encloses a smaller square. Therefore, the area of this convex polygon is the area of the square with side length 16.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of this convex polygon is $256$.The answer is $\boxed{256}$.

Here's the step by step solution:



First, we know that the product of two numbers is 0 if and only if at least one of the numbers is 0. So, in the equation, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $|x| + |y| = 10$ and $|x| - |y| = 10$ or $|x| - |y| = -10$. These are the equations of four lines: $x+y=10$, $x+y=-10$, $x-y=10$ and $x-y=-10$. Together with $|x|=8$ and $|y|=8$, these lines form a square with side length of $16$ and area of $256$.

Thus the area of the convex polygon is $256$. The problem is:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    # The side length of the square is 16
    side_length = 16
    # The area of the square is side_length^2
    area = side_length**2
    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$
