Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second one is zero.

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$ and the second one is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$.

If the first expression is zero, we have:
\[(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0.\]
This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10 \quad \text{and} \quad \vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10 \quad \text{and} \quad x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives the vertices of the polygon as $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0)$ and $(-10, 0)$.

If the second expression is zero, we have:
\[(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0.\]
This implies $\vert x \vert = 8 \quad \text{and} \quad \vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8 \quad \text{and} \quad y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives the vertices of the polygon as $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8)$ and $(-8, -8)$.

So, the polygon is a square with side length $10$ (the maximum absolute value of $x + y$ or $x - y$). The area of the square is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $\boxed{100}$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, we notice that the product of two terms equals zero if either of them equals zero. This gives us two equations:

   $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
   
   and
   
   $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

2. From the first equation, we get $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

3. From the second equation, we get $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

4. Taking the absolute values into account, we have $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$, $x = 8$ or $x = -8$, and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

5. By solving these four systems of equations, we get eight points: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(2, 8)$, $(-2, 8)$, $(2, -8)$, and $(-2, -8)$.

6. These points are the vertices of a square with side length 8√2.

7. Therefore, the area of the square is $(8√2)^2 = 128$.

The area of the convex polygon is 128. To verify it's a positive integer, it's straightforward: 128 is a positive integer. The solution is thus $\boxed{128}$. The answer is: $\boxed{128}$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The problem statement is a bit complex, but it's equivalent to a set of conditions:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From 3 and 4, we can infer that $x$ and $y$ must be in the range $[-8, 8]$. From 1 and 2, we can deduce that $x + y = 10$ or $x - y = 10$, which means either $x = 5 + y$ or $x = y + 5$. This is the set of conditions that define a rectangle in the coordinate plane with vertices at $(8,2)$, $(2,8)$, $(-8,-2)$, and $(-2,-8)$. The sides of the rectangle are in the ratio 6:10, so its area is $6*10=60$.
The answer is: $60$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The expression $A = ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ equals to zero if at least one of the factors equals to zero.

The factor $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ has no solutions $(x, y)$ except for $(0, 0)$. The factor $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ gives us $x + y = \pm 10$ or $x - y = \pm 10$, which gives us four lines.

Hence, the polygon is a square with side $16$ (from $-8$ to $8$ on each axis). So, its area is $16^2 = 256$. The result is a positive integer as expected.The answer is: $256$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:


We know that $ ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. For the product of two numbers to be zero, either one of the numbers has to be zero. Therefore, either $ ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$ or $ ((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
This gives us four cases to consider:
Case 1: $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$
Case 2: $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$
Case 3: $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$
Case 4: $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$
In each of these cases, we get a square with side length 16. Therefore, the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. Identify the sympy functions required for each step.
2. Implement these functions step-by-step, commenting each line for clarity.
3. Calculate the final answer and verify it's a positive integer.
4. Output the result within the given empty box.

Let's solve this problem step by step using sympy:

1. The points $(x, y)$ that satisfy $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ form a polygon. We need to find the area of this polygon.

2. For the product of two factors to be zero, either of the factors must be zero. So either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

3. From $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the four vertices of the polygon: $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, and $(-10, 0)$.

4. From $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So we get four additional vertices: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

5. We now have the eight vertices of the polygon: $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

6. The polygon is a square with side length 16. The area of a square is the square of the side length, so the area of the polygon is $16^2 = 256$.

7. Now we check that our result is a positive integer. Since 256 is a positive integer, our solution is valid.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: 256

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The given equation is a product of two terms, which must be zero for the whole left side to be zero. That is to say, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. Solving for each of the absolute values (which can be interpreted as distances), we get:
   a) $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ implies either $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
   b) $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ implies either $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
   c) $\vert x \vert = 8$ implies either $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
   d) $\vert y \vert = 8$ implies either $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.
3. Each pair of equations above describes a line in the plane, forming a diamond shape with side length 10 and diagonals of length 16. Since there are 4 pairs of equations, the overall shape is a square with side length 16.
4. The area of this square is simply the square of the side length, or $16^2 = 256$.

The area of the convex polygon is $256$. This is a positive integer, so it is the correct answer. The answer is: $256$
