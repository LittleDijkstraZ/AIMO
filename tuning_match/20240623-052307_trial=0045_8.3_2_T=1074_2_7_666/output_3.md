Here's the step by step solution:



The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So we need to solve the following two sets of equations to find the points that satisfy the original equation:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From the first set of equations, we get:
- $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which implies that $x + y = \pm 10$.
- $\vert x \vert = 8$, which implies that $x = \pm 8$.

Similarly, from the second set of equations, we get:
- $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies that $x - y = \pm 10$.
- $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that $y = \pm 8$.

Now, we need to find the intersection of these points. By analyzing the equations, we find that the intersection points are:
- $(8, 2)$, $(8, -18)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -18)$.

The polygon formed by these points is a square with side length 16. To find the area of the square, we use the formula for the area of a square, which is side length squared:

Area = side length² = 16² = 256.

So the area of the polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $\boxed{256}$

Here's the step by step solution:



The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ is equivalent to the system of equations:

$$\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0, \vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0, \vert x \vert - 8 = 0, \vert y \vert - 8 = 0.$$

The solutions of the system of equations are the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy each of the four equations. The solutions are:

$$(x, y) = (8, 8), (-8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, -8).$$

The points $(8, 8), (-8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, -8)$ form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So the area of the convex polygon is 256.

```python

def area_of_polygon():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

The area of the convex polygon is $256$ square units. The answer is $\boxed{256}$.

Here's the step by step solution:



The expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that both $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which only happens when $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$. So the lines $x = 10$, $x = -10$, $y = 10$, and $y = -10$ are boundaries of the polygon.

The expression $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that both $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which only happens when $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. So the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$ are also boundaries of the polygon.

The polygon is formed by the intersection of the lines $x = 10$, $x = -10$, $y = 10$, and $y = -10$ with the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. It is a square with side length 20 units.

The area of the square is side length squared, which is $20^2 = 400$ square units. So the area of the polygon is $400$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $400$ square units.
The answer is: $400$

Here's the step by step solution:



The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if at least one of the factors is zero. The factors $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ can only be zero if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The factors $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2$ can only be zero if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. So, the equation represents the intersection of four circles:

- $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ with center at $(-5, -5)$ and radius $10$
- $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ with center at $(-5, 5)$ and radius $10$
- $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ with center at $(5, -5)$ and radius $10$
- $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ with center at $(5, 5)$ and radius $10$

and

- $\vert x \vert = 8$ with center at $(0, 8)$ and radius $8$
- $\vert y \vert = 8$ with center at $(8, 0)$ and radius $8$
- $\vert x \vert = 8$ with center at $(0, -8)$ and radius $8$
- $\vert y \vert = 8$ with center at $(-8, 0)$ and radius $8$.

These eight circles intersect at twelve points. By connecting the points of intersection, we get a square with side length $16$ (since the distance between the centers of the circles $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ is $16$). The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So, the area of the convex polygon is $256$.

Here's a Python function to calculate the area of the polygon:
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
So the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{256}$. The answer is: $256$.
