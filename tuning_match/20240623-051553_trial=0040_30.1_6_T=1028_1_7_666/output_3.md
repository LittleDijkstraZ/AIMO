Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The expression $ab = 0$ is true if and only if $a = 0$ or $b = 0$. Therefore, the given equation is satisfied if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
Solving these equations, we find that the points that satisfy the given equation are the points in the set $\{(x, y) : |x + y| = 10 \text{ or } |x - y| = 10 \text{ or } |x| = 8 \text{ or } |y| = 8\}$.
These points enclose a square with side length $16$. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

First, let's break down the problem. The equation $AB=0$ is true if and only if either $A=0$ or $B=0$. So the given equation is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This means that the points $(x,y)$ that satisfy the equation are those that make at least one of the following four equations true: $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The points that satisfy $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ are on a square with side length 10, centered at the origin, and the points that satisfy $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ are on a square with side length 10, centered at $(10,10)$. The points that satisfy $\vert x \vert = 8$ are on a square with side length 16, centered at the origin, in the x-direction, and the points that satisfy $\vert y \vert = 8$ are on a square with side length 16, centered at the origin, in the y-direction.
Therefore, the convex polygon is the intersection of these four squares, which is a smaller square with side length 8. The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$. The answer is: $64$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The expression $A \cdot B = 0$ implies that at least one of $A$ or $B$ is zero. Thus, the points that satisfy the given equation must satisfy either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
For the first equation to equal zero, both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. These four lines form a square with side length 20.
For the second equation to equal zero, both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. These four lines form a square with side length 16.
The points that satisfy the original equation are those that lie in the intersection of these two squares. The convex polygon formed by these points is the smaller square with side length 16.
The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: 256

Assistant:

 The expression is equal to zero if and only if both of its factors are equal to zero. Hence, the given condition is satisfied if either of the following holds:
- $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, or
- $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This means either $|x + y| = 10$, $|x - y| = 10$, $|x| = 8$, or $|y| = 8$. These equations describe a square with side length $16$ in the plane, centered at the origin $(0, 0)$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: 256
