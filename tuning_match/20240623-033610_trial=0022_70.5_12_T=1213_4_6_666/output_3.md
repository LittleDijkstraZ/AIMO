"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first list the problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge, and thens solve the problem step by step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions, and related knowledge are as follows:

1. The equation is given as $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
2. The equation is equal to zero if and only if either of the factors is zero.
3. The factors are of the form $((\vert a \vert - b)^2$, where $a$ and $b$ are some expressions. This expression is zero if and only if $\vert a \vert = b$.

From the above, we have the following conditions:

1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
2. $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

Now, let's solve these conditions step by step:

1. For $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, the solutions are given by $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.
2. For $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, the solutions are given by $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.
3. For $\vert x \vert = 8$, the solutions are given by $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.
4. For $\vert y \vert = 8$, the solutions are given by $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

These conditions give us a total of 8 points: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, $(4, 6)$, $(4, -6)$, $(-4, 6)$, $(-4, -6)$. These points are the vertices of the convex polygon.

Now, let's calculate the area of the polygon. The polygon is formed by a square with side length 16 and four right triangles with legs of lengths 6 and 8. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$, and the area of each triangle is $\frac{1}{2} \times 6 \times 8 = 24$. Since there are four triangles, the total area of the triangles is $4 \times 24 = 96$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $256 - 96 = 160$.
The answer is: $160$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions, and related knowledge are as follows:

1. The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ must be satisfied for all points $(x, y)$ inside the polygon.
2. The equation is equal to zero if either of the two factors is equal to zero.
3. The factors are products of two quadratic expressions. Each quadratic expression is equal to zero if its argument (the value inside the absolute value) is equal to zero.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

Step 1: For the first factor, we have two cases:
   - $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. This gives us two lines: $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.
   - $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us two more lines: $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.

Step 2: For the second factor, we have two cases:
   - $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$. This gives us two lines: $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.
   - $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us two more lines: $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

Step 3: The intersection points of these lines are the vertices of the polygon:
   - $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(2, 8)$, $(-2, 8)$, $(2, -8)$, and $(-2, -8)$.

Step 4: The polygon is a square with side length 16. To see this, consider the point $(8, 2)$. The distances to the lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$ are all 2, and the distance to the lines $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$ are all 8. Therefore, the side length of the square is 16.

Step 5: The area of the square is the square of the side length, so the area is $16^2 = 256$.

The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints are given by the equation:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$
This equation is equal to zero if either of the factors is zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
This equation is only possible if both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us the constraints for a square with side length $20$ centered at the origin.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This equation is only possible if both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us a square with side length $16$ centered at the origin.

The convex polygon enclosed by the points satisfying the original equation is the intersection of these two squares, which is another square with side length $20 - 16 = 4$ centered at the origin. The area of this square is $4^2 = 16$.
The answer is: $16$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first list the problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge, and thens solve the problem step by step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions, and related knowledge are as follows:

1. The expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ can be zero only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon.

2. The expression $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ can only be zero if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us the sides of the polygon.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. The system of equations $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$ can be solved to give the vertices of the polygon:

If $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, then adding these equations gives $2x = 20$, so $x = 10$. Substituting $x = 10$ into $x + y = 10$ gives $y = 0$. So one vertex is $(10, 0)$.

If $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$, then adding these equations gives $2y = 0$, so $y = 0$. Substituting $y = 0$ into $x + y = 10$ gives $x = 10$. So another vertex is $(10, 0)$.

If $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$, then subtracting these equations gives $2y = -20$, so $y = -10$. Substituting $y = -10$ into $x + y = -10$ gives $x = 0$. So a third vertex is $(0, -10)$.

If $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$, then subtracting these equations gives $2x = 0$, so $x = 0$. Substituting $x = 0$ into $x + y = -10$ gives $y = -10$. So a fourth vertex is $(0, -10)$.

2. The system of equations $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$ gives the sides of the polygon:

If $x = 8$ and $y = 8$, then the point is $(8, 8)$.
If $x = 8$ and $y = -8$, then the point is $(8, -8)$.
If $x = -8$ and $y = 8$, then the point is $(-8, 8)$.
If $x = -8$ and $y = -8$, then the point is $(-8, -8)$.

3. Plotting these points on the coordinate plane, we can see that they form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions, and related knowledge are as follows:
1. The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
2. The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
3. The solutions to the first equation are all points $(x, y)$ such that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This forms a square with side length 10.
4. The solutions to the second equation are all points $(x, y)$ such that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This forms a square with side length 16.
5. The intersection of the two sets of solutions is the set of all points $(x, y)$ that satisfy both equations, which is the set of all points $(x, y)$ that lie within both squares. This intersection forms a smaller square, which is the convex polygon in question.
6. The side length of the smaller square is the distance between the midpoints of the sides of the larger squares, which can be found using the Pythagorean theorem. The distance between the midpoints of the sides of the larger squares is $\sqrt{(8-(-8))^2 + (8-(-8))^2} = \sqrt{256+256} = \sqrt{512} = 16\sqrt{2}$. Therefore, the side length of the smaller square is $16\sqrt{2} - 2(8) = 16\sqrt{2} - 16$.
7. The area of the smaller square is the square of its side length, which is $(16\sqrt{2} - 16)^2$.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:
1. Calculate the side length of the smaller square: $16\sqrt{2} - 16$.
2. Square the side length to find the area of the smaller square: $(16\sqrt{2} - 16)^2$.

Now, let's simplify the expression:
$(16\sqrt{2} - 16)^2 = (16\sqrt{2})^2 - 2(16\sqrt{2})(16) + (16)^2 = 512 - 512 + 256 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first list the problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge, and thens solve the problem step by step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions, and related knowledge are as follows:

1. The equation is equal to zero, which means that the product of two expressions is zero. This implies that each of the expressions must be zero individually.

2. The absolute value function $|x|$ is equal to $x$ when $x \ge 0$, and $-x$ when $x < 0$.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. This expression equals to zero if and only if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

2. The second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. This expression equals to zero if and only if both $(\vert x \vert - 8) = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8) = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

3. From $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, we can deduce that $x$ and $y$ must be in the range of $[-10, 10]$.

4. From $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, we can deduce that $x$ and $y$ must be in the range of $[-8, 8]$.

5. Combining these two conditions, we find that the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equation must be in the rectangle with vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(8, -8)$.

6. The area of this rectangle is the product of its length and width, which are both $16$. So the area of the rectangle is $16 \times 16 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the given equation is $256$. The answer is: $256$
