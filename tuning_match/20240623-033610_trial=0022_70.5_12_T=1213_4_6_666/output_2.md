 The problem is asking for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

We know that $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is equivalent to the four equations:

1. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$,
2. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$,
3. $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = \frac{m}{100}$, and
4. $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.

Simplify each equation:

1. $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$,
2. $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$,
3. $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, and
4. $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.

For each equation, we need to consider the two cases inside the absolute value:

1.1. $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$,
1.2. $x-1 = -(2 + \frac{m}{100})$,
2.1. $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$,
2.2. $x-1 = -(2 - \frac{m}{100})$,
3.1. $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$,
3.2. $x-1 = -(2 - \frac{m}{100})$,
4.1. $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$,
4.2. $x-1 = -(2 + \frac{m}{100})$.

Solving each equation gives us the solutions:

1.1. $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$,
1.2. $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$,
2.1. $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$,
2.2. $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$,
3.1. $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$,
3.2. $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$,
4.1. $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$,
4.2. $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

For the four equations to have 4 distinct solutions, the solutions must be different from each other. Comparing the solutions, we see that:

- $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ are the same for all $m$,
- $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$ are the same for all $m$.

Therefore, we need to find the values of $m$ for which:

- $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ is different from $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$,
- $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ is different from $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

This gives us the system of inequalities:

\[3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 - \frac{m}{100} \quad \text{and} \quad 3 - \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 + \frac{m}{100}.\]

Simplifying each inequality, we get:

\[4m \neq -100 \quad \text{and} \quad 4m \neq 100.\]

Solving these inequalities, we find that $m$ must be greater than 25 and less than 25. However, $m$ must be a positive integer, so the only possible value of $m$ is 25.

Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. The answer is: $1$. The value of $m$ is 25. The answer is: $25$.

 The problem is asking for the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions.

First, let's understand the equation. The expression inside the absolute value, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, can be thought of as a function that takes the value of $x$ and returns the absolute value of the difference between $x$ and $1$, then subtracts $2$. This function will have different behaviors depending on the value of $x$.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is asking for the values of $x$ that make this function equal to $\frac{m}{100}$. The number of solutions to this equation will depend on the value of $\frac{m}{100}$.

For the equation to have four distinct solutions, the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must make the function equal to $\frac{m}{100}$ in four different places. This can only happen if the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ is $2$. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is equal to $2$ in four different places: $x=3$, $x=-1$, $x=5$, and $x=-3$.

Therefore, the value of $m$ we are looking for is $2*100=200$. So, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions, and that is $m=200$.
The value of $m$ is $200$. The answer is: $1$

First, let's analyze the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}.\]
The right side of the equation is a fraction with a denominator of $100$, and the number of distinct solutions for $x$ is $4$.
The left side of the equation is a composition of two absolute value functions.
We know that the number of distinct solutions of an equation involving absolute value functions depends on the value of the right side of the equation.
To find the value of $m$ that makes the equation have $4$ distinct solutions, we need to consider the properties of absolute value functions and how they interact with equations.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be solved by considering the different cases for the inner absolute value function, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$.

1. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 > 0$, then the equation becomes $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$.
2. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0$, then the equation becomes $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = \frac{m}{100}$.
3. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 0$, then the equation becomes $0 = \frac{m}{100}$, which implies $m=0$. However, this case does not give us four distinct solutions, so we discard it.

For the first case, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two sub-cases:

1.1 If $x-1 \geq 0$, then $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.
1.2 If $x-1 < 0$, then $-(x-1) = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

For the second case, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. This also gives us two sub-cases:

2.1 If $x-1 \geq 0$, then $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
2.2 If $x-1 < 0$, then $-(x-1) = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

For the equation to have four distinct solutions, the four expressions for $x$ (from 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, and 2.2) must be distinct. This implies that the following conditions must be satisfied:

1. $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 + \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $4 \neq 0$, which is true.
2. $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\frac{m}{100} \neq -\frac{m}{100}$, which is true for all $m$.
3. $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $4 \neq -2$, which is true.
4. $-1 + \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\frac{m}{100} \neq -\frac{m}{100}$, which is true for all $m$.
5. $3 - \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $4 \neq -2$, which is true.

Therefore, all the conditions are satisfied, and the equation has four distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is nonzero. This means that $m$ must be a positive integer other than $0$. The value of $m$ that satisfies the equation is any positive integer other than $0$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the equation is the number of positive integers other than $0$, which is infinite. However, the problem asks for a specific number of distinct solutions, which is $4$. To find the value of $m$ that makes the equation have $4$ distinct solutions, we need to set $\frac{m}{100}$ to a value that creates four distinct solutions for $x$.

By inspection or trial and error, we find that when $\frac{m}{100} = 1$, the four distinct solutions for $x$ are approximately $0.33$, $1.33$, $2.67$, and $3.67$. This satisfies the conditions for the number of distinct solutions.

Therefore, the value of $m$ that makes the equation have $4$ distinct solutions is $m = 100$. The answer is: $100$.

Assistant:


First, let's break down the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\]
This equation has four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$.

To see why, let's consider the absolute value function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. This function is equal to 2 when $\vert x-1 \vert = 3$ or $\vert x-1 \vert = 1$. The former gives us two solutions: $x = 4$ and $x = -2$, and the latter gives us $x = 3$ and $x = -1$. Thus, we have four distinct solutions.

Setting $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, we can solve for $m$ to get $m = 200$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is 1, and the answer is: $1$. The value of $m$ is $200$. The answer is: $1$

The problem is asking for how many positive integers $m$ does the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have $4$ distinct solutions.

First, let's consider the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. The right side of the equation is always positive, so the left side must also be positive. This means that $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert > 0$. The absolute value function makes the expression inside positive, so we have $\vert x-1 \vert -2 > 0$. Simplifying, we get $\vert x-1 \vert > 2$. This means that $x-1 > 2$ or $x-1 < -2$. Solving these inequalities, we get $x > 3$ or $x < -1$. So the solutions for $x$ must be outside the interval $(-1,3)$.

Now, let's consider the inner absolute value $\vert x-1 \vert$. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have four distinct solutions if the graph of $\vert x-1 \vert -2$ has two "jumps" or "kinks" in the interval $(-1,3)$. This will happen if the distance between the two kinks is less than $2$.

The kinks occur at $x=1-2=\text{-}1$ and $x=1+2=3$. So the distance between the kinks is $3 - (\text{-}1) = 4$. Since this distance is less than $2$, the equation will have four distinct solutions if $\frac{m}{100} < 2$. Solving for $m$, we get $m < 200$. The largest integer $m$ that satisfies this condition is $199$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is the number of positive integers less than $200$. This is equal to $199$.
The answer is: $199$

 The problem asks for how many positive integers $m$ the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ involves absolute values, which can be challenging to solve directly. However, we can observe that the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, is always positive. This means that the left side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, must also be positive.

The expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is equal to 0 when $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$, which gives us two solutions: $x = 3$ and $x = -1$.

So, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to the distance between these two solutions, which is $3 - (-1) = 4$.

This gives us $\frac{m}{100} = 4$, so $m = 400$.

Therefore, the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is $m = 400$. The answer is: $1$

Assistant:

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. This means that the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, must take on the values $\frac{m}{100}$, $0$, $-\frac{m}{100}$ each twice.

The expression $\vert x-1 \vert -2$ can take on a value of $0$ only once, because if it takes on the value $0$ twice, the equation would only have $3$ distinct solutions. Therefore, the value $0$ must correspond to $\frac{m}{100}$. So, we have $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$.

Solving this equation for $x$, we get $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, and then $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 = -(2 + \frac{m}{100})$.

The first equation gives $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$, and the second equation gives $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

These are the two solutions for $x$ that correspond to $\frac{m}{100}$. The other two solutions, which correspond to $-\frac{m}{100}$, must be symmetrically distributed around the line $x=1$. This means that they must be $2 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $2 + \frac{m}{100}$.

So, the four solutions are $3 + \frac{m}{100}$, $-1 - \frac{m}{100}$, $2 - \frac{m}{100}$, and $2 + \frac{m}{100}$.

For these to be distinct, we must have $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 - \frac{m}{100}$, $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, $-1 - \frac{m}{100} \neq 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, and $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, $-1 - \frac{m}{100} \neq 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, and $2 - \frac{m}{100} \neq 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Solving these inequalities, we find that $m$ must be in the range $100 < m < 300$. The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ in this range. The number of such integers is $200$.
The answer is: $200$

Assistant:

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions. This means that the right-hand side $\frac{m}{100}$ must be greater than $2$, because otherwise the equation would have at most two distinct solutions. Thus, we have $\frac{m}{100} > 2$, which implies $m > 200$.

On the other hand, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be less than $4$ because the absolute value function is bounded between $0$ and $4$ for $x$ in the interval $[1-2, 1+2]$, which gives a range of $4$. Thus, we have $\frac{m}{100} < 4$, which implies $m < 400$.

Combining these two inequalities, we have $200 < m < 400$. The positive integers in this range are $201, 202, \ldots, 399$. The number of such integers is $199$.
The answer is: $199$.

Assistant:

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. We know that $\frac{m}{100}$ is a positive number, and the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, can be either positive or negative. So, we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. This implies that $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \pm \frac{m}{100}$.
Case 2: $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=-\frac{m}{100}$. This implies that $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.

For Case 1, we have two sub-cases:

Sub-case 1.1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$. This implies that $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.
Sub-case 1.2: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$. This implies that $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.

For Sub-case 1.1, we have two more sub-cases:

Sub-sub-case 1.1.1: $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. This implies that $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.
Sub-sub-case 1.1.2: $-(x-1) = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. This implies that $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

For Sub-case 1.2, we have two more sub-cases:

Sub-sub-case 1.2.1: $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. This implies that $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
Sub-sub-case 1.2.2: $-(x-1) = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. This implies that $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

For Case 2, we have one sub-case:

Sub-case 2: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$. This implies that $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Sub-sub-case 2.1: $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. This implies that $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
Sub-sub-case 2.2: $-(x-1) = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. This implies that $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Comparing the solutions from the sub-sub-cases, we see that the solutions $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$ are not valid because they do not satisfy the original equation. Therefore, the 4 distinct solutions are $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$, $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, and $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

To have 4 distinct solutions, the values of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be distinct. This means that $m$ must be a multiple of 100. The smallest positive multiple of 100 is 100, and the largest multiple of 100 that gives 4 distinct solutions is 300. So, the possible values of $m$ are the integers from 100 to 300 inclusive, which are 201 values.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 201. The answer is: $201$

Assistant:

 First, we need to understand the problem. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. We are asked to find the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy this condition.

To solve this problem, we need to understand the behavior of the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. This function has a piecewise definition:
- If $x < 1$, then $f(x) = \vert -x - 1 - 2 \vert = \vert -x - 3 \vert = x + 3$.
- If $1 \leq x < 3$, then $f(x) = \vert x - 1 - 2 \vert = \vert x - 3 \vert = 3 - x$.
- If $x \geq 3$, then $f(x) = \vert x - 1 - 2 \vert = \vert x - 3 \vert = x - 3$.

The graph of this function is a "V" shape with the vertex at $(1, 2)$. The function equals $0$ at $x = 1 - 2 = -1$ and $x = 1 + 2 = 3$.

Now we want to find when the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. This means we want to find when the line $y = \frac{m}{100}$ intersects the "V" shape $4$ times.

The line $y = \frac{m}{100}$ intersects the "V" shape when $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, or equivalently, when $0 < m < 200$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition is the number of integers from $1$ to $199$, which is $199$.
The answer is: $199$

The problem is asking for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions.

First, let's simplify the equation. Since $\frac{m}{100}$ is positive, we know that the right-hand side of the equation is positive. This means that the absolute value on the left-hand side must also be positive, so $\vert x-1 \vert -2 > 0$. This implies that $\vert x-1 \vert > 2$, which means that $x-1 > 2$ or $x-1 < -2$.

Solving these inequalities, we get $x > 3$ or $x < -1$. So the solution set of the equation is the union of the solutions of $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ when $x < -1$ and $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ when $x > 3$.

For $x < -1$, we have $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $1 - x - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$, or $-x - 1 = \frac{m}{100}$. Multiplying both sides by $-100$ gives $100 + 100x = -m$.

For $x > 3$, we have $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x - 1 - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$, or $x - 3 = \frac{m}{100}$. Multiplying both sides by $100$ gives $100x - 300 = m$.

Now we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ that can be expressed in the form $100 + 100x$ for some $x < -1$ and $100x - 300$ for some $x > 3$.

For $x < -1$, we have $100 + 100x < 100 - 100 = 0$. So the only values of $m$ that can be expressed in this form are negative, which means we can disregard this case.

For $x > 3$, we need to find the values of $x$ that make $100x - 300$ a positive integer. This means $100x - 300 > 0$, or $100x > 300$, or $x > 3$. This is consistent with our earlier finding that the solution set of the equation is for $x > 3$.

Now we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ that can be expressed in the form $100x - 300$. Since $x$ must be an integer, we can try out integer values of $x$ starting from $4$.

For $x = 4$, we have $100(4) - 300 = 100$.
For $x = 5$, we have $100(5) - 300 = 200$.
For $x = 6$, we have $100(6) - 300 = 300$.
For $x = 7$, we have $100(7) - 300 = 400$.

So the values of $m$ are $100, 200, 300, 400$. Therefore, there are 4 positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions. The answer is: $4$.

 The problem states that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

The absolute value function $\vert x \vert$ splits into two cases: $x$ if $x \ge 0$ and $-x$ if $x < 0$. Applying this to the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, we get two sub-cases:

1) $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$: This gives us $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. We further split into two cases:

   a) $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$: This gives us $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.
   
   b) $-(x-1) = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$: This gives us $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

2) $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = \frac{m}{100}$: This gives us $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. We further split into two cases:

   a) $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$: This gives us $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
   
   b) $-(x-1) = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$: This gives us $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Now we have a total of 4 equations for $x$:

$$x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$$
$$x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$$
$$x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$$
$$x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$$

These 4 equations represent 4 distinct solutions for $x$. For the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, the values of $\frac{m}{100}$ in the above equations must be distinct. This means that $\frac{m}{100}$ must be greater than 2 for the first two equations to have real solutions, and less than 2 for the last two equations to have real solutions. Therefore, $2 < \frac{m}{100} < 4$, which gives $200 < m < 400$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are 201, 202, ..., 399. The number of such integers is $399 - 201 + 1 = 199$.
The value of $m$ that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions is 199. The answer is: $199$
