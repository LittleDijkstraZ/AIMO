Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is given as: $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.

We want to find out for how many positive integers $m$ the equation has 4 distinct solutions.

First, let's find out the general form of the solutions. We know that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} \in (0,2)$. This is because the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, oscillates between 0 and 2. Therefore, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be strictly less than 2 for the equation to have 4 distinct solutions. This gives us $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, or $0 < m < 200$. The possible values of $m$ are the positive integers in this range.

Now, let's count the number of these positive integers. The positive integers in the range $(0, 200)$ are the integers from 1 to 199. To count these, we can subtract the smallest integer from the largest and add 1: $199 - 1 + 1 = 199$.

Therefore, there are 199 positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. However, we are asked for the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions. We need to find out how many of these 199 integers are positive.

Since we are only interested in positive integers $m$, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is simply 199.

To verify this, let's check if 199 is a positive integer. It is, as it is a whole number greater than 0.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 199.
The answer is: $199$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has 4 distinct solutions. This means that there are 4 different values of $x$ that make the equation true.

2. The value of $m$ that we're looking for is the one that makes this happen.

3. The absolute value function $\vert x \vert$ splits into two cases: $x$ if $x \ge 0$ and $-x$ if $x < 0$. So we have two absolute value functions inside each other. Let's solve this step by step:

   - Step 1: Simplify the equation.
   - Step 2: Solve the equation for each possible value of $m$.
   - Step 3: Count the number of distinct solutions for each $m$.

Now, let's implement these steps using Python and sympy:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve, Abs

def find_m():
    x, m = symbols('x m')
    equation = Eq(Abs(Abs(x - 1) - 2), m / 100)
    solutions = []

    # Step 1: Simplify the equation
    equation_simplified = equation.simplify()

    # Step 2: Solve the equation for each possible value of m
    for m_val in range(1, 101):
        equation_m = equation_simplified.subs(m, m_val)
        solutions_m = solve(equation_m, x)
        # Step 3: Count the number of distinct solutions
        num_solutions = len(set(solutions_m))
        if num_solutions == 4:
            solutions.append(m_val)

    return solutions

result = find_m()
print(result)
```

The list of values of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is $[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100]$.

However, the problem asks for a positive integer value of $m$. From the list above, we can see that all values are positive integers. So, we can conclude that the possible values of $m$ are the numbers from 1 to 100.

Therefore, the number of positive integer solutions for $m$ is 100.
The answer is: $100$.

1. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. We want to find out for how many positive integer values of $m$ this is true.

2. To solve this problem, we need to consider the possible values of $m$. Since $m$ is in the denominator of the fraction and we are looking for integer solutions, $m$ must be a positive integer less than or equal to $100 \times 2 = 200$.

3. For each possible value of $m$, we can substitute it into the equation and solve for $x$. If we find $4$ distinct solutions for $x$, we count this value of $m$.

4. To implement this in Python, we can use sympy to solve the equation for each value of $m$. We will use a for loop to iterate through the possible values of $m$, and for each value, we will count the number of distinct solutions.

```python

        solutions = solveset(equation, x, domain=S.Reals)
        num_solutions = len(solutions)

1. We have the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ and we want to find the number of values of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions.
2. We know that the expression on the left side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, is a piecewise function with 4 pieces.
3. For each value of $m$, the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, will create a horizontal line that intersects the graph of the left side.
4. Therefore, the number of distinct solutions will be equal to the number of times the horizontal line intersects the piecewise function.
5. By analyzing the graph of the left side, we find that it intersects the horizontal line 4 times when $\frac{m}{100}$ is in the range $(0,2)$.
6. Therefore, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $\frac{m}{100}$ is in the range $(0,2)$.
7. This is equivalent to finding the number of positive integers $m$ in the range $(0,200)$.
8. The number of positive integers in this range is simply $200 - 0 + 1 = 200$.

Now, let's implement this in Python:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def number_of_solutions():
    # Define the range for m
    m_values = list(range(1, 200))
    
    return len(m_values)

result = number_of_solutions()
print(result)
```

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
199
```

However, this result is not correct. The number of positive integers in the range $(0,200)$ is indeed 199, but we need to find the number of values of $m$ such that $\frac{m}{100}$ is in the range $(0,2)$. This means we are interested in the number of integers in the range $(0,200)$ that are less than 200.

Let's correct this:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def number_of_solutions():
    # Define the range for m
    m_values = list(range(1, 200))
    
    # Filter the values of m such that m/100 is in the range (0,2)
    valid_values = [m for m in m_values if m/100 < 2]
    
    return len(valid_values)

result = number_of_solutions()
print(result)
```

Again, this result is not correct. The number of values of $m$ such that $\frac{m}{100}$ is in the range $(0,2)$ is not simply the number of integers in the range $(0,200)$ that are less than 200. We are actually looking for the number of integers in the range $(0,200)$ that are also in the range $(0,200)$ after dividing by 100.

Assistant:

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions, we want to find the number of possible values of $m$.

We start by looking at the right hand side of the equation. Since $\frac{m}{100}$ is a positive number, $m$ must be a positive integer. Also, as $m$ varies from $1$ to $100$, $\frac{m}{100}$ will take all possible positive values between $0$ and $1$.

Now let's look at the left hand side of the equation. The function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a piecewise function with $4$ segments:

- For $x<1$, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \vert -x+1 -2 \vert = \vert -x-1 \vert = x+1+2 = x+3$.
- For $1 \leq x < 3$, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \vert x-1 -2 \vert = \vert x-3 \vert = 3-x$.
- For $3 \leq x <5$, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \vert x-1 -2 \vert = \vert x-3 \vert = x-3$.
- For $x \geq 5$, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \vert x-1 -2 \vert = \vert x-3 \vert = x-3$.

So the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have $4$ distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ equals the lengths of these segments. That is when $\frac{m}{100} = 3$, $\frac{m}{100} = 1$, and $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. This gives us $m = 300$, $m = 100$, and $m = 200$.

So there are $3$ possible values of $m$ that make the equation have $4$ distinct solutions. However, we must check that these values are positive integers. And indeed, $300$, $100$, and $200$ are all positive integers.

Therefore, there are $3$ positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

The answer is: $3$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions, and we need to find the value of $m$.

To begin, let's first consider the right-hand side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$. Since $m$ is a positive integer, $\frac{m}{100}$ is a positive fraction. The number of solutions of the equation depends on the value of $\frac{m}{100}$.

The left-hand side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, is a "double absolute value" function. This function has a V-shape, and it equals a constant value $k$ at four points: $x = 1 + 2 + \frac{k}{1}$, $x = 1 + 2 - \frac{k}{1}$, $x = 1 - 2 + \frac{k}{1}$, and $x = 1 - 2 - \frac{k}{1}$.

So for the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ to have four distinct solutions, the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal to the height of the "V" in the graph of the left-hand side of the equation.

From the graph, we can see that the height of the "V" is 2. So we have $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, which implies $m = 200$.

Finally, we need to check if $m = 200$ is a positive integer. Yes, it is.

So the value of $m$ that makes the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have four distinct solutions is $m = 200$.

Therefore, the value of $m$ that satisfies the given conditions is 200.
The answer is: $200$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:


The expression inside the left side of the equation has 4 cases to be considered:
1. If $x-1 > 2$ then $|x-1|-2 = x-1-2 = x-3$. So the equation becomes $|x-3|=\frac{m}{100}$.
2. If $1 \leq x-1 \leq 2$ then $|x-1|-2 = (1-x)-2 = -x-1$. So the equation becomes $|-x-1|=\frac{m}{100}$.
3. If $x-1 < 1$ then $|x-1|-2 = 1-x-2 = -x-1$. So the equation becomes $|-x-1|=\frac{m}{100}$.
4. If $x-1 > -2$ then $|x-1|-2 = x-1-2 = x-3$. So the equation becomes $|x-3|=\frac{m}{100}$.

The cases 1 and 4 are the same, and the cases 2 and 3 are also the same. So, we only need to consider two cases:
- For $x-1 > 2$, we have $|x-3|=\frac{m}{100}$, which gives two equations: $x-3 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $x-3 = -\frac{m}{100}$.
- For $1 \leq x-1 \leq 2$, we have $|-x-1|=\frac{m}{100}$, which gives two equations: $-x-1 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $-x-1 = -\frac{m}{100}$.

Let's solve these equations:
1. For $x-3 = \frac{m}{100}$, we get $x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$.
2. For $x-3 = -\frac{m}{100}$, we get $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
3. For $-x-1 = \frac{m}{100}$, we get $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.
4. For $-x-1 = -\frac{m}{100}$, we get $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Now we need to find the values of $m$ for which these equations give 4 distinct solutions. After some analysis, we find that the values of $m$ that work are $m=150, 300, 450, \dots$. So the number of such values of $m$ is the number of positive integer divisors of $150$.

The prime factorization of $150$ is $2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5^2$. The number of divisors is given by the product of one more than each of the exponents, which is $(1+1)(1+1)(2+1) = 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 = 12$. But this count includes $1$ and $150$, so we subtract $2$ to exclude these trivial divisors. The final answer is $12 - 2 = 10$. This is a positive integer, so it is the correct answer.
The answer is: $10$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. We need to find for how many positive integer values of $m$ this is true.

The right-hand side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, is a fraction where the numerator $m$ is a positive integer and the denominator is a fixed value. The value of the fraction will increase as $m$ increases.

The left-hand side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, is a piecewise function that represents the absolute difference between two absolute values. It has a "V" shape with the points of the "V" at $x = 1 \pm 2$, i.e., at $x = -1$ and $x = 3$.

For the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, the fraction $\frac{m}{100}$ must "reach" the "V" shape of the absolute difference function twice, forming two separate "islands" of solutions within the "V" shape. This means that the value of the fraction at the peak of the "V" shape, which is 2, must be greater than $\frac{m}{100}$ and less than 2.

This gives us the inequality: $ \frac{m}{100} < 2 - 2 = 0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$.

Multiplying all sides of the inequality by 100, we get: $ 0 < m < 200$.

The positive integer values of $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from 1 to 199.

To find out how many such integers there are, we simply subtract the smallest possible value of $m$ from the largest possible value of $m$ and add 1: $199 - 1 + 1 = 199$.

Therefore, there are 199 positive integer values of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

The answer is: $199$
