Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



We have two conditions: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$.

The absolute value equation $\vert x \vert = 8$ gives us two solutions: $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.

For $x = 8$, the absolute value equation $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ gives us $y = 2$ and $y = -18$. So we have two points: $(8, 2)$ and $(8, -18)$.

For $x = -8$, the absolute value equation $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ gives us $y = 18$ and $y = -2$. So we have two more points: $(-8, 18)$ and $(-8, -2)$.

So, the four vertices of the polygon are $(8, 2)$, $(8, -18)$, $(-8, 18)$, and $(-8, -2)$.

The polygon is a rectangle with side lengths $20$ and $16$, so its area is $20 \times 16 = 320$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $320$. The answer is: $320$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Step 1: Identify the sympy functions required for each step.

We are asked to find the area of the convex polygon formed by the points that satisfy the equation. This equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. So, either one of the terms must be zero for the product to be zero. This gives us two separate cases to consider.

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

In Case 1, this implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. In Case 2, this implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

Step 2: Solve the equations and analyze the solutions

For Case 1, the solutions are four lines: $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.
For Case 2, the solutions are four lines: $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

The intersection of these lines form a square with side length 16.

Step 3: Calculate the area of the square

The area of a square is given by the square of its side length, so the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

Step 4: Verify the answer is a positive integer

The area of the square is indeed a positive integer: 256.

The answer is: $256$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We have a condition $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. For the product of two numbers to be zero, either one of them must be zero. Therefore, we have two cases:

   a) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
   b) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

2. For the first case, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we know that the square of a real number is always non-negative. Therefore, for the sum of two non-negative numbers to be zero, each of them must be zero. So we have:

   a1) $\vert x + y \vert = 10$
   a2) $\vert x - y \vert = 10$

3. For the second case, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we similarly deduce that:

   b1) $\vert x \vert = 8$
   b2) $\vert y \vert = 8$

4. From b1 and b2, we have $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
5. From a1 and a2, we have four cases to consider:

   a11) $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$
   a12) $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$
   a13) $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$
   a14) $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$

6. Solving these four cases, we find that there are four solutions: $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, and $(-5,-5)$.
7. These points form a square with side length $10$. The area of the square is therefore $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $100$. The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The expression equals zero if and only if both expressions in the product are zero. Therefore, we have two systems of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8) = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8) = 0$.

For the first system:
- Solving $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) = 0$ gives $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
- Similarly, solving $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) = 0$ gives $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.

For the second system:
- Solving $(\vert x \vert - 8) = 0$ gives $\vert x \vert = 8$, which implies $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
- Similarly, solving $(\vert y \vert - 8) = 0$ gives $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

Now we need to find the intersections of these solutions. The intersections are the vertices of the polygon:
- Intersection of $(x + y = 10)$ and $(x = 8)$ gives $y = 2$.
- Intersection of $(x + y = 10)$ and $(x = -8)$ gives $y = 18$, but this doesn't satisfy any of the conditions.
- Intersection of $(x + y = -10)$ and $(x = 8)$ gives $y = -18$, but this doesn't satisfy any of the conditions.
- Intersection of $(x + y = -10)$ and $(x = -8)$ gives $y = -2$.
- Intersection of $(x - y = 10)$ and $(x = 8)$ gives $y = -2$.
- Intersection of $(x - y = 10)$ and $(x = -8)$ gives $y = 18$, but this doesn't satisfy any of the conditions.
- Intersection of $(x - y = -10)$ and $(x = 8)$ gives $y = 2$.
- Intersection of $(x - y = -10)$ and $(x = -8)$ gives $y = -18$, but this doesn't satisfy any of the conditions.

So the vertices of the polygon are $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$.

The polygon is a square with side length 16 (from $(-8, 2)$ to $(8, 2)$ or from $(8, -2)$ to $(-8, -2)$). The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of the polygon is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the polygon is 256. Since 256 is a positive integer, the answer is valid. The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



If the product of two numbers is zero, then at least one of the numbers must be zero. Thus, we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

Case 2: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From case 1, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $x + y = \pm 10$, $x = \pm 8$, $x - y = \pm 10$, and $y = \pm 8$. There are 16 possible combinations of these equations.

From case 2, we have the same equations.

Now, let's plot these points in the coordinate plane and connect them with line segments to form a polygon. We will find that this polygon is a square with side length 16.

To find the area of the square, we simply square the length of one side. The length of one side is 16, so the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256.
The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The expression is equal to zero if either of the factors is zero. This gives us two equations: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. For the first equation, $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ means that $x + y = \pm 10$.
3. For the second equation, $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
4. The points that satisfy these conditions are the vertices of a square with side length 10 (from $x + y = \pm 10$) and another square with side length 8 (from $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$).
5. The area of a square is given by side length squared, so the area of the larger square is $10^2 = 100$ and the area of the smaller square is $8^2 = 64$.
6. The total area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares, which is $100 + 64 = 164$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 164 square units. Since the problem asked for a positive numerical answer, we have found the correct solution. The answer is:

\[164\]

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second one is zero. We need to find the set of all points $(x, y)$ that satisfy either of these conditions.

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$. The only way this expression can be zero is if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The set of all points $(x, y)$ that satisfy these conditions is a square with side length 20.

The second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. The only way this expression can be zero is if both $(\vert x \vert - 8) = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8) = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The set of all points $(x, y)$ that satisfy these conditions is a square with side length 16.

The intersection of these two squares is the set of all points $(x, y)$ that satisfy both conditions. This intersection is also a square, but its side length is the smaller of the two side lengths, which is 16. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256. To verify this is a positive integer, we see that it is indeed the case. The answer is: $256$.
