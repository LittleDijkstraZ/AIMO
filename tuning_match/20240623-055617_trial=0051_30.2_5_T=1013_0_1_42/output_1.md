Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:


1. First, we need to find a relation between x and y from the condition |x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40.
2. To simplify this equation, we can consider four cases:
   - When both x-2y and y-2x are positive or zero.
   - When x-2y is positive and y-2x is negative.
   - When x-2y is negative and y-2x is positive.
   - When both x-2y and y-2x are negative or zero.
3. For each case, we can solve the equation and find a relationship between x and y.
4. After that, substitute the relationship into the expression 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy.
5. Calculate the derivative of the expression with respect to x and y.
6. Set the derivative equal to zero and solve for x and y.
7. Substitute the values of x and y back into the expression to find its minimum value.

Here is the python code to perform these steps:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solve, diff, simplify

def find_minimum():
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # Define the expression and the condition
    expr = 5*x**2 + 5*y**2 - 8*x*y
    cond = abs(x - 2*y) + abs(y - 2*x) - 40

    # Solve the condition for y
    y_sol = solve(cond, y)[0]

    # Substitute y into the expression
    expr = expr.subs(y, y_sol)

    # Calculate the derivative of the expression with respect to x
    der = diff(expr, x)

    # Set the derivative equal to zero and solve for x
    x_sol = solve(der, x)[0]

    # Substitute x into the expression
    expr_min = expr.subs(x, x_sol)

    # Simplify the expression
    expr_min = simplify(expr_min)

    return expr_min

result = find_minimum()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 800

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
800
```
The minimum value of the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is $800$. The answer is $\boxed{800}$.

Step 1: Define the variables
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

def minimum_value():
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # The given equation
    equation = Eq(abs(x - 2*y) + abs(y - 2*x), 40)

    # The function to minimize
    f = 5*x**2 + 5*y**2 - 8*x*y

    # Solve the equation for y
    y_solution = solve(equation, y)[0]

    # Substitute the solution of y in the function
    f = f.subs(y, y_solution)

    # Differentiate the function with respect to x
    f_prime = f.diff(x)

    # Find the critical points by setting the derivative equal to zero
    critical_points = solve(Eq(f_prime, 0), x)

    # Evaluate the function at the critical points
    min_value = min([f.subs(x, point) for point in critical_points])

    return min_value

result = minimum_value()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 800

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
800
```
The minimum value of the function $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ subject to the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 800. The answer is: $800$
