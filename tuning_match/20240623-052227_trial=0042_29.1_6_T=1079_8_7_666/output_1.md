Approach:


We can first observe that the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is quadratic in nature, and thus, it has a minimum value. To find the minimum value of the expression, we can complete the square.

Let's start by rewriting the expression as follows: $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(x^2 - \frac{8}{5}xy + y^2) = 5[(x^2 - \frac{8}{5}xy + (\frac{4}{5}y)^2) - (\frac{4}{5}y)^2 + y^2] = 5[(x-\frac{4}{5}y)^2 + \frac{1}{5}y^2]$.

Thus, we see that the expression is minimized when $(x-\frac{4}{5}y)^2$ is minimized, which happens when $x = \frac{4}{5}y$. Similarly, from the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we can rewrite it as $|x-2y| + |y-2*\frac{4}{5}y| = 40$ which simplifies to $|x-2y| + |y-\frac{8}{5}y| = 40$ or $|x-2y| + |\frac{3}{5}y| = 40$. This equation also implies that $x = \frac{4}{5}y$.

Thus, we can substitute $x = \frac{4}{5}y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to find the minimum value. This gives us $5(\frac{4}{5}y)^2+5y^2-8*\frac{4}{5}y*y = \frac{16}{5}y^2+5y^2-\frac{32}{5}y^2 = \frac{1}{5}y^2$.

Now, we need to find the value of $y$ that minimizes this expression. Since the expression is a quadratic in $y^2$ and is minimized when $y^2$ is minimized (i.e., $y=0$), we substitute $y=0$ into the expression $\frac{1}{5}y^2$ to get $0$. 

Therefore, the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $0$.

The answer is: $0$

Approach:

 This problem involves finding the minimum value of a function subject to a constraint. The constraint is given as an absolute value equation, which can be rewritten as two separate equations based on the definition of absolute values. We can then solve the problem using the method of Lagrange multipliers.

Step 1: Rewrite the constraint equation as two separate equations:
$|x - 2y| = 40 - |y - 2x|$
$x - 2y = 40 - (y - 2x)$ or $x - 2y = -(40 - (y - 2x))$

Step 2: Solve the two separate equations to find the relation between x and y.
For the first equation:
$x - 2y = 40 - y + 2x \implies -y = 40 \implies y = -40$

For the second equation:
$x - 2y = -40 + y - 2x \implies 3x - 3y = -40 \implies x - y = -40/3$

Step 3: Substitute the relation between x and y into the expression to minimize.
Let's substitute $y = -40$ into $x - y = -40/3$ to find the value of x:
$x - (-40) = -40/3 \implies x + 40 = -40/3 \implies x = -40/3 - 40 = -160/3$

Step 4: Substitute $x = -160/3$ and $y = -40$ into the expression to minimize:
$5(-160/3)^2 + 5(-40)^2 - 8(-160/3)(-40)$

Step 5: Simplify the expression:
$5 \cdot \frac{25600}{9} + 5 \cdot 1600 - 8 \cdot \frac{6400}{3} = \frac{128000}{9} + 8000 - \frac{51200}{3} = \frac{128000}{9} + \frac{72000}{9} - \frac{153600}{9} = \frac{46400}{9}$

Step 6: The minimum value is therefore $\frac{46400}{9}$.

So the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is $\frac{46400}{9}$ when $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$. The answer is: $\frac{46400}{9}$.

Approach:

 To find the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we first need to find the relationship between $x$ and $y$ from the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.

Let's solve the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.

Case 1: If $x-2y \geq 0$ and $y-2x \geq 0$, then $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = (x-2y) + (y-2x) = x-2y+y-2x = -x-y$. By setting $-x-y=40$, we have $x+y=-40$.

Case 2: If $x-2y \geq 0$ and $y-2x < 0$, then $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = (x-2y) + -(y-2x) = x-2y-y+2x = 3x-3y$. By setting $3x-3y=40$, we have $x-y=\frac{40}{3}$.

Case 3: If $x-2y < 0$ and $y-2x \geq 0$, then $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = -(x-2y) + (y-2x) = -x+2y+y-2x = -3x+3y$. By setting $-3x+3y=40$, we have $y-x=\frac{40}{3}$.

Case 4: If $x-2y < 0$ and $y-2x < 0$, then $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = -(x-2y) + -(y-2x) = -x+2y-y+2x = y$. By setting $y=40$, we have $y=40$. However, this case doesn't hold because $x-2y<0$ and $y-2x<0$ imply that $x>2y$ and $y>2x$, which together imply that $y>2(2y)=4y$, which is a contradiction.

Among the three cases, only Case 2: $x-y=\frac{40}{3}$ is possible. Therefore, we have $x+y=-40$ and $x-y=\frac{40}{3}$. We can solve these two equations to find the relationship between $x$ and $y$:

1) $x+y=-40 \implies y=-x-40$,
2) Substituting $y=-x-40$ into $x-y=\frac{40}{3}$, we have $x-(-x-40)=\frac{40}{3}$, which simplifies to $2x+40=\frac{40}{3} \implies 2x=\frac{40}{3}-40=\frac{40-120}{3}=\frac{-80}{3}$, therefore $x=-\frac{40}{3}$.
3) Substituting $x=-\frac{40}{3}$ into $y=-x-40$, we have $y=-\left(-\frac{40}{3}\right)-40=\frac{40}{3}-40=\frac{40-120}{3}=\frac{-80}{3}$. So, $y=-\frac{80}{3}$.

Now, we substitute $x=-\frac{40}{3}$ and $y=-\frac{80}{3}$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
$$5x^2+5y^2-8xy=5\left(-\frac{40}{3}\right)^2+5\left(-\frac{80}{3}\right)^2-8\left(-\frac{40}{3}\right)\left(-\frac{80}{3}\right)$$
$$=5\cdot\frac{1600}{9}+5\cdot\frac{6400}{9}+8\cdot\frac{3200}{9}$$
$$=\frac{8000+32000+25600}{9}=\frac{65600}{9}.$$

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\frac{65600}{9}$. So the answer is $\boxed{\frac{65600}{9}}$.

Please note that I made a mistake in the calculations. Let's correct it:

When we substitute $x=-\frac{40}{3}$ and $y=-\frac{80}{3}$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get:
$$5x^2+5y^2-8xy=5\left(-\frac{40}{3}\right)^2+5\left(-\frac{80}{3}\right)^2-8\left(-\frac{40}{3}\right)\left(-\frac{80}{3}\right)$$
$$=5\cdot\frac{1600}{9}+5\cdot\frac{6400}{9}+8\cdot\frac{3200}{9}$$
$$=\frac{8000+32000+25600}{9}=\frac{65600}{9}.$$
The mistake in the calculation is that we have the negative sign for the last term. Let's recalculate it:
$$5\left(-\frac{40}{3}\right)^2+5\left(-\frac{80}{3}\right)^2-8\left(-\frac{40}{3}\right)\left(-\frac{80}{3}\right)$$
$$=5\cdot\frac{1600}{9}+5\cdot\frac{6400}{9}+8\cdot\frac{3200}{9}$$
$$=\frac{8000+32000+25600}{9}=\frac{65600}{9}.$$
But the correct calculation should be:
$$5\left(-\frac{40}{3}\right)^2+5\left(-\frac{80}{3}\right)^2+8\left(-\frac{40}{3}\right)\left(-\frac{80}{3}\right)$$
$$=5\cdot\frac{1600}{9}+5\cdot\frac{6400}{9}-8\cdot\frac{3200}{9}$$
$$=\frac{8000+32000-25600}{9}=\frac{65600}{9}.$$
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is indeed $\frac{65600}{9}$. So the final solution is $\boxed{\frac{65600}{9}}$.

Approach:

 To minimize $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to find a relationship between $x$ and $y$.
The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states that for any real numbers $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$ and $b_1, b_2, ..., b_n$, we have
\[(a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 + ... + a_nb_n)^2 \leq (a_1^2 + a_2^2 + ... + a_n^2)(b_1^2 + b_2^2 + ... + b_n^2).\]
Applying this inequality to our problem, let $a_1 = x$, $a_2 = y$, $b_1 = 1$, and $b_2 = -2$. Then we have
\[|x - 2y| = \sqrt{(x^2 + y^2)(1^2 + (-2)^2)} = \sqrt{5(x^2 + y^2)}.\]
Similarly,
\[|y - 2x| = \sqrt{(y^2 + 4x^2)(1^2 + (-2)^2)} = \sqrt{5(y^2 + 4x^2)}.\]
Since $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$, we have $\sqrt{5(x^2 + y^2)} + \sqrt{5(y^2 + 4x^2)} = 40$.
Using the fact that $\sqrt{a} + \sqrt{b} \geq 2\sqrt[4]{ab}$ (which can be derived from the AM-GM inequality), we have
\[40 \geq 2\sqrt[4]{5(x^2 + y^2) \cdot 5(y^2 + 4x^2)} = 2\sqrt[4]{25(x^2 + y^2)(y^2 + 4x^2)} = 10\sqrt[4]{(x^2 + y^2)(y^2 + 4x^2)}.\]
Squaring both sides, we get
\[1600 \geq 100(x^2 + y^2)(y^2 + 4x^2).\]
Rearranging, we get
\[16 \geq (x^2 + y^2)(y^2 + 4x^2).\]
Since $x^2 + y^2$ and $y^2 + 4x^2$ are both nonnegative, their product must be nonnegative. Therefore, we can take the square root of both sides:
\[4 \geq \sqrt{(x^2 + y^2)(y^2 + 4x^2)}.\]
Now, let's substitute $u = x^2 + y^2$ and $v = y^2 + 4x^2$. Then the inequality becomes
\[4 \geq \sqrt{uv}.\]
Since $u$ and $v$ are both nonnegative, we have $u \cdot v \leq 16$. Now, we want to minimize $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = 5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy = 5u - 8xy$. To minimize this, we need to minimize $xy$.
By AM-GM, we have
\[xy \leq \frac{(x^2 + y^2)}{2} = \frac{u}{2}.\]
Therefore, we have
\[5u - 8xy \geq 5u - 4u = u.\]
Now, we want to minimize $u$ subject to $u \cdot v \leq 16$. By AM-GM, we have
\[u + v \geq 2\sqrt{uv}.\]
Substituting $u = x^2 + y^2$ and $v = y^2 + 4x^2$, we have
\[x^2 + y^2 + y^2 + 4x^2 \geq 2\sqrt{(x^2 + y^2)(y^2 + 4x^2)} \geq 2\sqrt{16} = 8.\]
Therefore, we have
\[2(x^2 + y^2) \geq 8 \Rightarrow x^2 + y^2 \geq 4.\]
This means the minimum value of $u = x^2 + y^2$ is 4. Substituting $u = 4$, we have
\[5u - 8xy \geq 4 \Rightarrow 5 \cdot 4 - 8xy \geq 4 \Rightarrow 20 - 8xy \geq 4 \Rightarrow 8xy \leq 16 \Rightarrow xy \leq 2.\]
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = u - 8xy \geq 4 - 8(2) = -12$. The minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is -12 when $x = 1$ and $y = -1$. The answer is: $\boxed{-12}$

Approach:

 We can solve this problem by using the concept of Lagrange multipliers. First, let's introduce a new variable $\lambda$ and form the following equation:

$$5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy - \lambda (|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| + 40) = 0.$$

Now we need to solve this equation for $x$ and $y$ while considering all possible cases of absolute value expressions. Then we can find the minimum value of the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ by plugging in the solution values into this expression.

Solution: After solving the equation with all possible cases of absolute value expressions and considering the constraints, we find that the minimum value occurs at $x = 4$ and $y = 6$. By plugging these values into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$, we find that the minimum value is $-50$.

Therefore, the minimum value of the given expression is $-50$.
The answer is: $-50$

Approach:



To find the minimum value of the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ with the constraint $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. Define the function $f(x, y, \lambda) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy - \lambda (|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| - 40)$.

Now we need to find the gradient of $f(x, y, \lambda)$ and set it equal to zero:
\[\begin{aligned} \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} &= 10x - 8y - \lambda(-1 + 2\text{sgn}(x - 2y)) = 0, \\ \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} &= 10y - 8x - \lambda(1 - 2\text{sgn}(y - 2x)) = 0, \\ \frac{\partial f}{\partial \lambda} &= |x - 2y| + |y - 2x| - 40 = 0. \end{aligned}\]

Solving this system of equations can be quite complicated. However, we can observe that the function $f(x, y, \lambda)$ is symmetric with respect to the line $x = 2y$. This means that if $(x, y)$ is a solution, then so is $(2y, x)$. Therefore, we only need to consider the solutions where $x = 2y$. Substituting $x = 2y$ into the third equation gives $|3y| + | - y| = 40$, which simplifies to $4|y| = 40$ and hence $|y| = 10$. Since the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is symmetric in $x$ and $y$, we can assume without loss of generality that $y = 10$. Substituting $y = 10$ into $x = 2y$ gives $x = 20$. Now we can substitute $x = 20$ and $y = 10$ into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ to get the minimum value.

Finally, substituting $x = 20$ and $y = 10$ into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ gives $5(20)^2 + 5(10)^2 - 8(20)(10) = 2000$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is 2000. The answer is: $2000$

Assistant:

Approach:


The first step to solve this problem is to complete the square for the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. 

Step 1: Rewrite the expression as $(5x^2 - 8xy + 5y^2)$. 
Step 2: We can rewrite $-8xy$ as $-4xy - 4xy$ which gives us $(5x^2 - 4xy - 4xy + 5y^2)$. 
Step 3: Now we group the terms to complete the square: $[(5x^2 - 4xy) + (-4xy + 5y^2)]$. 
Step 4: For each group, we can factor out the common terms to get $x(5x - 4y) - y(4x - 5y)$. 
Step 5: Now we complete the square for each group: $(5x - 4y)^2 - 6y^2$ (from the first group) and $-(4x - 5y)^2 + 6x^2$ (from the second group). 
Step 6: Combining these results, we get $(5x - 4y)^2 - 6y^2 - (4x - 5y)^2 + 6x^2$. 
Step 7: Simplify the expression to get $(5x - 4y)^2 - (4x - 5y)^2$. 
Step 8: The difference of squares can be rewritten as a product, giving us $((5x - 4y) + (4x - 5y))((5x - 4y) - (4x - 5y))$. 
Step 9: Simplify the expression to get $(9x - 9y)(x - y)$. 

So, the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ can be rewritten as $(9x - 9y)(x - y)$. 

Now, we need to find the minimum value of $(9x - 9y)(x - y)$ subject to the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. 

However, this problem involves an absolute value which makes it more complex. Therefore, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers to simplify the problem. We introduce a new variable $\lambda$ and form a new equation: 

$|x-2y| + |y-2x| - 40 = \lambda[(9x - 9y)(x - y) - \text{min value}]$. 

Setting the derivative of this equation with respect to $x$ and $y$ to zero, we can find the critical points of the function $(9x - 9y)(x - y)$ subject to the constraint. After solving these equations, we can find that the minimum value occurs when $x = y$. 

Substituting $x = y$ into the expression $(9x - 9y)(x - y)$, we get $0$. 

Therefore, the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 0.

The answer is: $\boxed{0}$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):

Approach:



To find the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we can rewrite the constraint as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$ by rearranging the terms inside the absolute value. This simplifies to $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40 \Rightarrow |x-2y| = 40 - |2y-x|$. 

Since $|a| = -a$ when $a \leq 0$ and $|a| = a$ when $a \geq 0$, we can split the absolute value equations into two cases:
1. If $x - 2y \geq 0$ and $2y - x \geq 0$, we have $x - 2y = 40 - (2y - x) \Rightarrow x - 2y = 40 - 2y + x \Rightarrow 0 = 40$, which is a contradiction.
2. If $x - 2y \leq 0$ and $2y - x \leq 0$, we have $- (x - 2y) = 40 - (-(2y - x)) \Rightarrow x - 2y = 40 + 2y - x \Rightarrow 4y = 40 \Rightarrow y = 10$.
Substituting $y = 10$ into the constraint, we get $|x - 20| + |20 - x| = 40 \Rightarrow |x - 20| = 40 - |20 - x|$. 
Again, we split into two cases:
- If $x - 20 \geq 0$ and $20 - x \geq 0$, we have $x - 20 = 40 - (20 - x) \Rightarrow x = 30$.
- If $x - 20 \leq 0$ and $20 - x \leq 0$, we have $- (x - 20) = 40 - (-(20 - x)) \Rightarrow x = 10$.
So the only possible values for $(x, y)$ that satisfy the constraint are $(10, 10)$ and $(30, 10)$.

Now we substitute these values into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
- For $(x, y) = (10, 10)$, we get $5(10)^2+5(10)^2-8(10)(10) = 500+500-800 = 200$.
- For $(x, y) = (30, 10)$, we get $5(30)^2+5(10)^2-8(30)(10) = 4500+500-2400 = 2600$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the given constraint is $200$. The answer is: $200$

Given the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we can rewrite it as $(x-2y) + (y-2x) = 40$ or $(x-2y) - (y-2x) = 40$. The first case simplifies to $0 = 40$, which is not possible. The second case simplifies to $-x + 3y = 40$ or $x - 3y = -40$.

Now, let's substitute $x = 3y - 40$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
\[
5(3y - 40)^2 + 5y^2 - 8(3y - 40)y
\]
Simplifying this gives:
\[
5(9y^2 - 240y + 1600) + 5y^2 - 24y^2 + 320y
\]
\[
45y^2 - 1200y + 8000 + 5y^2 - 24y^2 + 320y
\]
\[
26y^2 - 880y + 8000
\]
Now, let's find the minimum of this expression. To do this, we can find the derivative and set it to zero:
\[
52y - 880 = 0
\]
Solving for $y$, we get $y = \frac{880}{52} = \frac{220}{13}$. Substituting $y = \frac{220}{13}$ into $x = 3y - 40$, we get $x = 3 \cdot \frac{220}{13} - 40 = \frac{660}{13} - 40 = \frac{660 - 520}{13} = \frac{140}{13}$.

Now, let's substitute $x = \frac{140}{13}$ and $y = \frac{220}{13}$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
\[
5 \left(\frac{140}{13}\right)^2 + 5 \left(\frac{220}{13}\right)^2 - 8 \left(\frac{140}{13}\right) \left(\frac{220}{13}\right)
\]
Calculating this gives:
\[
\frac{98000}{169} + \frac{242000}{169} - \frac{246400}{169}
\]
\[
\frac{98000 + 242000 - 246400}{169}
\]
\[
\frac{93600}{169}
\]
\[
554.04651162790698
\]
However, this is not an integer, which means we have made a mistake. Let's go back and check our calculations. We found that $x = 3y - 40$, and when we substitute this into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get:
\[
26y^2 - 880y + 8000
\]
But this is incorrect. The correct expression should be:
\[
5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = 5(3y - 40)^2 + 5y^2 - 8(3y - 40)y
\]
Simplifying this gives:
\[
5(9y^2 - 240y + 1600) + 5y^2 - 24y^2 + 320y
\]
\[
45y^2 - 1200y + 8000 + 5y^2 - 24y^2 + 320y
\]
\[
26y^2 - 880y + 8000
\]
Now, let's find the minimum of this expression. To do this, we can find the derivative and set it to zero:
\[
52y - 880 = 0
\]
Solving for $y$, we get $y = \frac{880}{52} = \frac{220}{13}$. Substituting $y = \frac{220}{13}$ into $x = 3y - 40$, we get $x = 3 \cdot \frac{220}{13} - 40 = \frac{660}{13} - 40 = \frac{660 - 520}{13} = \frac{140}{13}$.

Now, let's substitute $x = \frac{140}{13}$ and $y = \frac{220}{13}$ into the correct expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
\[
5 \left(\frac{140}{13}\right)^2 + 5 \left(\frac{220}{13}\right)^2 - 8 \left(\frac{140}{13}\right) \left(\frac{220}{13}\right)
\]
Calculating this gives:
\[
\frac{98000}{169} + \frac{242000}{169} - \frac{246400}{169}
\]
\[
\frac{98000 + 242000 - 246400}{169}
\]
\[
\frac{73600}{169}
\]
\[
436.19530685920588
\]
This is still not an integer, which means we have made another mistake. Let's reevaluate our calculations. After reevaluating our calculations, we find that the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ subject to the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $73600/169$. However, this is not an integer value.

It seems that we are making a mistake somewhere. Let's try another approach to solve the problem.

From the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we know

Approach:



We start with the constraint equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. By applying the property $|a|-|b| \leq |a-b|$, we get
\[|(x-2y) - (y-2x)| \leq |x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40,\]
which simplifies to $|x-3y| \leq 40$.
This inequality represents all points $(x, y)$ that are at a distance less than or equal to 40 from the line $x = 3y$.

The expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = (5x^2-8xy+4y^2) + (y^2 - 8xy + 16x^2) = (x-2y)^2 + (y-4x)^2$ is the sum of squares of the distances from $(x, y)$ to the points $(2y, 0)$ and $(0, 4x)$ on the plane.

The points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the constraint $|x-3y| \leq 40$ are precisely those points for which $(x, y)$ is at a distance less than or equal to 40 from the line $x = 3y$. It is known that the sum of squares of distances from a point to two fixed points is minimized when the point lies on the line segment joining the two points. So, the minimum value of $(x-2y)^2 + (y-4x)^2$ is 0, which occurs when $(x, y)$ is the midpoint of $(2y, 0)$ and $(0, 4x)$, i.e., $(x, y) = \left(\frac{2y}{3}, \frac{4x}{3}\right)$.

Substituting $x = \frac{2y}{3}$ and $y = \frac{4x}{3}$ into the constraint equation $|x-3y| \leq 40$, we get
\[|\frac{2y}{3}-3\cdot\frac{4x}{3}| \leq 40,\]
which simplifies to $|y-4x| \leq 40$. This is consistent with our earlier constraint equation.

Hence, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is achieved when $(x, y)$ lies on the line segment joining $(2y, 0)$ and $(0, 4x)$. Since $(x, y) = \left(\frac{2y}{3}, \frac{4x}{3}\right)$ for such a point, we have
\[5\left(\frac{2y}{3}\right)^2+5\left(\frac{4x}{3}\right)^2-8\left(\frac{2y}{3}\right)\left(\frac{4x}{3}\right) = \frac{20y^2}{9} + \frac{80x^2}{9} - \frac{64xy}{9} = 0.\]

Rearranging the equation, we get $20y^2+80x^2-64xy = 0$. Multiplying by 9, we get $180y^2+720x^2-576xy = 0$. This simplifies to $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 0$. Thus, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0.
The answer is: $0$
