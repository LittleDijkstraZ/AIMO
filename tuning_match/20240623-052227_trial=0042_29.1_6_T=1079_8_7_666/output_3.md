Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:

 The equation implies that either $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$ or $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. The first equation is satisfied if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which are the equations of two lines passing through the origin making an angle of 90 degrees between them. The second equation is satisfied if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which are the equations of two lines parallel to the x and y axis respectively at a distance of 8 units from the origin. The intersection of these lines form a square of side length 10 units. Therefore, the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$.

The answer is: 100.

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we find that the points satisfy either $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, or $x - y = -10$. These equations are the equations of lines in the coordinate plane.

The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. These equations are the equations of circles with radius 8 in the coordinate plane.

The intersection of the lines $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$ with the circles $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$ gives the vertices of a square with side length 6. The area of the square is $6^2 = 36$. The answer is: $36$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:



The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, which implies that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. Thus, the points that satisfy the equation will be those that satisfy either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. This is a square with side length 20, and the area is $20^2 = 400$.

For $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This is a square with side length 20, and the area is also $20^2 = 400$.

For $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$. This is a rectangle with side lengths 16 and 16, and the area is $16 \times 16 = 256$.

For $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert y \vert = 8$. This is a rectangle with side lengths 16 and 16, and the area is also $16 \times 16 = 256$.

Now, we add up the areas of the four squares to get the total area of the convex polygon. The total area is $400 + 400 + 256 + 256 = 1312$.

However, this includes the overlapping area of the two squares, so we must subtract the area of the overlapping square. The side length of the overlapping square is 10, so its area is $10^2 = 100$.

Therefore, the final area of the convex polygon is $1312 - 100 = 1212$.

Solution:

The area of the convex polygon is $1212$. The answer is: $1212$

Approach:



The given equation is $ ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. This equation equals to zero when either of the two products equals to zero. This gives us two sets of equations:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The first equation gives $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, and the second equation gives $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions for these equations are a square with side length 16.

2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The first equation gives $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, and the second equation gives $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions for these equations are also a square with side length 16.

So, the area of the convex polygon formed by the points satisfying the given equation is the area of a square with side length 16. The area of a square is given by the square of the side length, so the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

The answer is: 256

Assistant:

Approach:

 The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied only if either of the two factors is zero. If the first factor is zero, then we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which imply that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. If we solve these equations, we get the four points $(8,2)$, $(8,-2)$, $(-8,2)$, and $(-8,-2)$. Similarly, if the second factor is zero, then we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which imply that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Again, solving these equations, we get the four points $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$. Plotting these points on a coordinate plane, we see that they form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units.

The Python code to calculate the area of the square is as follows:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{256}$ square units. The answer is: $256$

Approach:


The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These two equations are satisfied by the points on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$. Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which are satisfied by the points on the lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

The four lines intersect at the points $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$, forming a square with side length $4$. The area of this square is $4 \times 4 = 16$. So, the area of the convex polygon is 16.
The answer is $\boxed{16}$.

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

To solve this problem, we first need to understand the conditions given in the equation that the points need to satisfy. The equation is 
$$ ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0. $$ 

For the product of two numbers to be zero, one of the numbers must be zero. This implies that either the first part of the equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or the second part of the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ must be zero.

For the first part to be zero, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This forms a square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$. The area of this square is $(10\sqrt{2})^2 = 200$.

For the second part to be zero, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This forms a square with side length $16$. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

However, since we are looking for the area of the convex polygon that is the intersection of these two squares, we must take the smaller of the two areas. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $200$ square units.
The answer is $\boxed{200}$.

Approach:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the given equation is equal to zero if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm10$ and $x - y = \pm10$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the square as $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0)$ and $(-10, 0)$.

The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm8$ and $y = \pm8$. So the square formed by these vertices has side length $16$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of the square, which is given by side length squared, i.e., $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$
