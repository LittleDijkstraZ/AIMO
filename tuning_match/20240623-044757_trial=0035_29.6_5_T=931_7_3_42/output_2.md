Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. This is because the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=k$ has 4 distinct solutions for $k=2$ and no solutions for $k<2$.

So we set $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, which gives $m = 2 \times 100 = 200$.
Therefore, the only positive integer $m$ that satisfies the given condition is $200$. The answer is: $1$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}=0.5$. This is because the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=0.5$ is the only case where the absolute value equation will have 4 distinct solutions.

So we solve the equation $\frac{m}{100}=0.5$. Multiply both sides by 100 to get $m=50$.

Therefore, the value of $m$ is 50. The answer is: $\boxed{50}$.

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a piecewise linear function with $4$ segments, each of which is $2$ units away from the previous one. So, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, which gives $m = 200$. Therefore, the value of $m$ that satisfies the condition is $200$. The answer is: $1$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$.

This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ takes the value 2 exactly four times.

If $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, then $m = 200$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the equation is 1, namely 200.

The answer is: $1$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is between $1$ and $2$, exclusive.
This means that $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which implies $100 < m < 200$.
The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from $101$ to $199$, inclusive.
To find the number of these integers, we subtract the smallest integer from the largest integer and add $1$: $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$.
Therefore, there are $99$ positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions.
The value of $m$ that satisfies the condition is $99$.
The answer is: $99$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


For the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ to have 4 distinct solutions, the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be such that the graph of $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ intersects the line $y=\frac{m}{100}$ at exactly 4 points.

The graph of $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a "V" shape with a width of 1 at each of the vertices at $x=3$ and $x=-1$. This means that $\frac{m}{100}$ must be a number strictly between 1 and 2, exclusive. In other words, $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Multiplying all sides of the inequalities by 100 gives $100 < m < 200$.

The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are precisely the integers from 101 to 199, inclusive. To find the total number of such integers, we subtract the smallest integer from the largest and add 1: $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$.

Therefore, there are 99 positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. The answer is: $99$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is a positive number less than 2 but greater than or equal to 0. This is because the expression inside the absolute value on the left side of the equation can take on any value from -2 to 2, and if it equals $\frac{m}{100}$, then the equation will have 4 distinct solutions.
So we have $0 \leq \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Multiplying all parts of the inequality by 100 gives $0 \leq m < 200$.
The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from 1 to 199.
However, $m$ must be a positive integer, so the number of such positive integers is the number of positive integers from 1 to 199, inclusive.
This is equal to 199.
Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 199. The answer is: $199$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $2$. This is because the graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has two "humps" of height 1 unit and the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=2$ is the equation of the boundary between the two humps.

If $\frac{m}{100}=2$, then $m=200$.

Therefore, the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is $m=200$.
The answer is: $1$
