Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero. Therefore, either of the expressions must be equal to zero for the entire product to be zero.
The expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ can only be true if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$.
Similarly, the expression $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ can only be true if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these four equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$.
Combining the vertices from both cases, we have a total of 8 vertices for the polygon: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$.
The resulting polygon is a square with side length 10, so the area is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ equals to zero if and only if at least one of the factors equals to zero. Thus the original equation is satisfied if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ is satisfied if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solution set of the first equation is the set of points on the vertical lines $x = 5$ and $y = 5$, and the solution set of the second equation is the set of points on the lines $x = -5$ and $y = -5$. Thus this part of the equation describes a square with side length $10$ and area $100$.

The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ is satisfied if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which describes a square with side length $16$ and area $256$.

Thus the area of the convex polygon is $100 + 256 = \boxed{356}$. The answer is: $356$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation given is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, we have two cases:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
This can only happen if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This means that $|x+y| = 10$ and $|x-y| = 10$. The solutions to these equations are the points in a square with side length 20 centered at the origin.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This can only happen if both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This means that $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. The solutions to these equations are the points in a square with side length 16 centered at the origin.

Therefore, the points that satisfy the original equation are the points in the intersection of these two squares, which is a square with side length 8. The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$. So the area of the convex polygon is 64 square units.
The answer is: $64$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if and only if either of the following conditions holds:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
For the first condition to be true, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$, which can be solved to give the vertices of a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.
For the second condition to be true, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$, which can be solved to give the vertices of a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of these two squares, which is $100 + 256 = 356$.
The answer is: 356.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The given equation is $0$ when either $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$ or $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$ holds only when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two lines in the plane: $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, or $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$.

The equation $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ holds only when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which are the equations of four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length $16$.

The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon in question. The area of this convex polygon is the area of the smaller square, which is $(16)^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is equal to zero if either of the two factors is zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
For the first factor to be zero, both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us the lines $x + y = \pm10$ and $x - y = \pm10$.
For the second factor to be zero, both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us the lines $x = \pm8$ and $y = \pm8$.
The intersection points of these lines are the vertices of the polygon: $(8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(8, -8)$.
To find the area of the polygon, we can treat it as a square with side length 16 (since the distance between the points $(8, 8)$ and $(-8, 8)$, for example, is $8 - (-8) = 16$). The area of a square with side length 16 is $16^2 = 256$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation given in the problem is:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$

The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Thus, the equation is satisfied if either
$$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad (\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0.$$

This means that either $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The absolute value equations $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$ represent the equations of four lines in the coordinate plane. The intersections of these lines form a square with side length 8, which is the convex polygon we are looking for.

The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $8^2 = 64$.
The answer is: $64$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So, in the given equation, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$, which gives us four lines $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. The intersection of these lines form a square with side length 20.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us a square with side length 16.

The area of the larger square is $20^2 = 400$, and the area of the smaller square is $16^2 = 256$. The convex polygon enclosed by the points satisfying the equation is the intersection of these two squares, which is also a square.

The area of this convex polygon is the difference between the areas of the larger square and the smaller square, which is $400 - 256 = 144$. So, the area of the convex polygon is 144 square units.
The answer is: 144

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



To find the area of the polygon, we need to find the vertices of the polygon first.
The equation
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0\]
is satisfied if either
\[(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0\]
or
\[(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0.\]
The first equation is satisfied only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$.
The second equation is satisfied only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
So the vertices of the polygon are the points $(\pm 10, \pm 10)$ and $(\pm 8, \pm 8)$.
To find the area of the polygon, we can divide it into four smaller squares: one with side length 20 (formed by the vertices $(\pm 10, \pm 10)$), and three with side length 16 (formed by the vertices $(\pm 8, \pm 8)$).
The area of the square with side length 20 is $20^2 = 400$.
The area of each square with side length 16 is $16^2 = 256$.
Therefore, the total area of the polygon is $400 + 3 \cdot 256 = 1168$.
The answer is: $1168$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The given equation is $ ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0 $. This equation is equal to 0 if and only if either one of the two factors is equal to 0. 

The first factor is equal to 0 if and only if both $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x-y| - 10 = 0$. Solving these two equations, we get $|x+y| = 10$ and $|x-y| = 10$. This gives us the following four equations: 
1. $x + y = 10$
2. $x + y = -10$
3. $x - y = 10$
4. $x - y = -10$

The second factor is equal to 0 if and only if both $|x| - 8 = 0$ and $|y| - 8 = 0$. Solving these two equations, we get $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. This gives us the following four equations: 
5. $x = 8$
6. $x = -8$
7. $y = 8$
8. $y = -8$

By plotting these eight lines on a graph, we find that they enclose a square with side length 20. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.
The answer is: $400$.

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The expression is equal to zero if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

These conditions hold if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The conditions $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$ define a square with side length 16. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation given is a product of two terms equal to zero, which means either of the two terms must be zero. So we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
This is possible only when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us a square with side length 10, centered at the origin, and its vertices are $(\pm 10, 0)$, $(0, \pm 10)$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
This is possible only when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us a square with side length 16, also centered at the origin, and its vertices are $(\pm 8, 0)$, $(0, \pm 8)$.

The intersection of the two squares is the required polygon. The area of the polygon is the area of the smaller square (Case 2) minus the area of the square that is outside the smaller square (Case 1).

The side length of the smaller square (Case 2) is 16, so its area is $16^2 = 256$. The side length of the larger square (Case 1) is 20, so its area is $20^2 = 400$. Therefore, the area of the polygon is $256 - (400 - 256) = 256 - 144 = 112$. The answer is: $112$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So, the equation
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$
holds if and only if at least one of the following two conditions is true:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first condition to be true, both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations gives us the vertices of the rectangle: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$.

For the second condition to be true, both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these four equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The intersection of the rectangle and the square gives us the convex polygon formed by the points that satisfy the original equation. This polygon is a square with side length 16, so its area is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$
