Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To solve this problem, we first need to find the $x$-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$.
The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points, so we set $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$.
This simplifies to $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$.
The distance between points $A$ and $B$ is given as 6, so we can use the fact that the distance between two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is $\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$.
Since $A$ and $B$ are on the line $y = 4$, their $y$-coordinates are both 4.
So the distance between $A$ and $B$ is $\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2}$.
Given that this distance is 6, we have $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 36$.
Using the quadratic formula, we find that the $x$-coordinates of the points of intersection are given by $x = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{(2k)^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k}$.
The difference of these two $x$-coordinates is $\frac{\sqrt{(2k)^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{k} = 6$.
Squaring both sides, we get $(2k)^2 - 4k(l - 4) = 36k^2$.
Simplifying, we have $4k^2 - 4kl + 16k = 36k^2$.
Rearranging terms, we get $32k^2 = 4kl - 16k$.
Dividing both sides by $k$, we have $32k = 4l - 16$.
Rearranging terms, we get $4l = 32k + 16$.
Dividing both sides by 4, we have $l = 8k + 4$.
Now, we need to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin.
The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is given by $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$.
For point $A$, this distance is $\sqrt{x^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + 16}$.
Similarly, for point $B$, the distance is $\sqrt{(x + 6)^2 + 16}$.
We want the sum of the squares of these distances, so we need to find $(\sqrt{x^2 + 16})^2 + (\sqrt{(x + 6)^2 + 16})^2 = x^2 + 16 + (x + 6)^2 + 16$.
Expanding and simplifying, we have $x^2 + 16 + x^2 + 12x + 36 + 16 = 2x^2 + 12x + 68$.
To find the value of this expression, we need to substitute the value of $l = 8k + 4$ into the equation $4l = 32k + 16$.
Doing this, we get $4(8k + 4) = 32k + 16$, which simplifies to $32k + 16 = 32k + 16$.
This equation is always true, so we can proceed with our calculations.
Substituting the value of $l$ into the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$, we have $kx^2 - 2kx + (8k + 4) - 4 = 0$, which simplifies to $kx^2 - 2kx + 8k = 0$.
This is a quadratic equation in $x$, and its solutions are given by $x = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{(2k)^2 - 4k(8k)}}{2k} = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{4k^2 - 32k^2}}{2k} = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{-28k^2}}{2k}$.
However, the discriminant $\sqrt{-28k^2}$ is not real, which means that our assumption that the parabola and line intersect at two distinct points was incorrect.
This means that our value of $l$ was incorrect, and we need to find a different value of $l$ that will make the parabola and line intersect at two distinct points.
Let's go back to the equation $4l = 32k + 16$ and solve for $l$:
$4l = 32k + 16 \implies l = 8k + 4$.
Substituting this value of $l$ into the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$, we have $kx^2 - 2kx + (8k + 4) - 4 = 0$, which simplifies to $kx^2 - 2kx + 8k = 0$.
This is a quadratic equation in $x$, and its discriminant is $(2k)^2 - 4k(8k) = 4k^2 - 32k^2 = -28k^2$.
Since the discriminant is negative, this means that the parabola and line intersect at two distinct points.
Now, we can use the quadratic formula to find the $x$-coordinates of the points of intersection:
$x = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{(2k)^2 - 4k(8k)}}{2k} = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{-28k^2}}{2k}$.
However, the discriminant $\sqrt{-28k^2}$ is not real, which means that our assumption that the parabola and line intersect at two distinct points was incorrect.
This means that our value of $l$ was incorrect, and we need to find a different value of $l$ that will make the parabola and line intersect at two distinct points.
Let's try a different approach.
Since the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, we can set up an equation using the distance formula:
$\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (4 - 4)^2} = 6 \implies (x_2 - x_1)^2 = 36$.
Expanding, we have $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 36 \implies (x_2 + x_1)^2 - 4x_2x_1 = 36$.
Using the fact that the sum of the roots of a quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ is $-\frac{b}{a}$ and the product of the roots is $\frac{c}{a}$, we have $x_2 + x_1 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_2x_1 =

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we find the points of intersection by setting the two equations equal to each other:
\[kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4.\]
Rearranging terms, we get
\[kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0.\]
Let $x_1$ and $x_2$ be the x-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$, respectively. Since the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, we have
\[|x_2 - x_1| = 6.\]
We know that for a quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, the roots $x_1$ and $x_2$ can be found using the quadratic formula:
\[x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}.\]
In our case, $a = k$, $b = -2k$, and $c = l - 4$. The discriminant of the quadratic equation is
\[D = (-2k)^2 - 4k(l - 4) = 4k^2 - 4kl + 16k.\]
Since the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, we have $D = 36$. Therefore,
\[4k^2 - 4kl + 16k = 36.\]
Rearranging terms, we get
\[4k^2 - 4kl + 16k - 36 = 0.\]
Dividing by 4, we have
\[k^2 - kl + 4k - 9 = 0.\]
We want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. For point $A$ with coordinates $(x_1, kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)$, the distance to the origin is
\[d_A = \sqrt{x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l - 4)^2}.\]
Similarly, for point $B$ with coordinates $(x_2, kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)$, the distance to the origin is
\[d_B = \sqrt{x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l - 4)^2}.\]
We want to find $d_A^2 + d_B^2$. We can use the fact that $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = (x_2^2 + x_1^2) - 2x_1x_2$. Since $|x_2 - x_1| = 6$, we have
\[x_2^2 + x_1^2 = (x_2 - x_1)^2 + 2x_1x_2 = 36 + 2x_1x_2.\]
We also know that $(x_1 + x_2)^2 = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 2x_1x_2$. We can use the sum and product of the roots of the quadratic equation to express $x_1 + x_2$ and $x_1x_2$:
\[x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2,\]
\[x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}.\]
Substituting these into the equation for $x_2^2 + x_1^2$, we have
\[x_2^2 + x_1^2 = 36 + 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right).\]
We also know that
\[d_A^2 + d_B^2 = (x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l - 4)^2) + (x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l - 4)^2).\]
Using the fact that $(a + b)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + 2ab$, we can expand and simplify to get
\[d_A^2 + d_B^2 = 2(x_1^2 + x_2^2) + 2(k^2x_1^2 - 2k^2x_1 + k^2l - 8k^2 + k^2x_2^2 - 2k^2x_2 + k^2l - 8k^2).\]
Substituting $x_2^2 + x_1^2 = 36 + 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right)$, we have
\[d_A^2 + d_B^2 = 2\left(36 + 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right)\right) + 2(k^2(x_1^2 + x_2^2) - 4k^2(x_1 + x_2) + 2k^2l - 16k^2).\]
Substituting $x_1 + x_2 = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$, we have
\[d_A^2 + d_B^2 = 2\left(36 + 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right)\right) + 2(k^2(4 - 2\frac{l - 4}{k}) - 4k^2(2) + 2k^2l - 16k^2).\]
Simplifying, we get
\[d_A^2 + d_B^2 = 72 + 4\frac{l - 4}{k} + 8k^2 - 4l + 2k^2l - 32k^2.\]
Since the value of $d_A^2 + d_B^2$ does not depend on the specific values of $x_1$ and $x_2$, we can set $x_1 = x_2 = 1$ (or any other value as long as $|x_2 - x_1| = 6$), and the value of $d_A^2 + d_B^2$ will be the same. Therefore, we can simplify the equation above to
\[d_A^2 + d_B^2 = 72 + 4\frac{l - 4}{k} + 8k^2 - 4l + 2k^2l - 32k^2.\]
We are given that $k, l > 0$, so we can drop the absolute value signs when taking the difference $|x_2 - x_1|$. Hence, $x_2 - x_1 = 6$, and we can square this equation to get $x_2^2 - 2x_1x_2 + x_1^2 = 36$.

Expanding and simplifying, we have
\[x_2^2

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we set $y = 4$ in the equation of the parabola to find the $x$-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$:
\[4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l.\]
Rearranging terms, we have
\[kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0.\]
Let $x_1$ and $x_2$ be the $x$-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$, respectively. Since the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, we have $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 36$.

From the quadratic formula, we have
\[x = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{(2k)^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k} = 1 \pm \sqrt{1 - \frac{l - 4}{k}}.\]
So $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = (2\sqrt{1 - \frac{l - 4}{k}})^2 = 4(1 - \frac{l - 4}{k}) = 36$.

Simplifying, we have $1 - \frac{l - 4}{k} = 9$, which gives $\frac{l - 4}{k} = -8$. Solving for $l$, we get $l = 4 - 8k$.

The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. So the square of the distance from $A$ to the origin is
\[x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2 = x_1^2 + k^2x_1^4 - 4k^2x_1^3 + 4k^2x_1^2 - 2klx_1^2 + 4k^2x_1 - 2klx_1 + l^2.\]
Similarly, the square of the distance from $B$ to the origin is
\[x_2^2 + k^2x_2^4 - 4k^2x_2^3 + 4k^2x_2^2 - 2klx_2^2 + 4k^2x_2 - 2klx_2 + l^2.\]
Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is
\[(x_1^2 + k^2x_1^4 - 4k^2x_1^3 + 4k^2x_1^2 - 2klx_1^2 + 4k^2x_1 - 2klx_1 + l^2) + (x_2^2 + k^2x_2^4 - 4k^2x_2^3 + 4k^2x_2^2 - 2klx_2^2 + 4k^2x_2 - 2klx_2 + l^2).\]
Since $x_1$ and $x_2$ are the roots of the quadratic equation $kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0$, by Vieta's formulas, we have $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k} = -8$.

Substituting these values into the sum of the squares of the distances, we get
\[(x_1^2 + k^2x_1^4 - 4k^2x_1^3 + 4k^2x_1^2 - 2klx_1^2 + 4k^2x_1 - 2klx_1 + l^2) + (x_2^2 + k^2x_2^4 - 4k^2x_2^3 + 4k^2x_2^2 - 2klx_2^2 + 4k^2x_2 - 2klx_2 + l^2)\]
\[= (x_1^2 + k^2x_1^4 - 4k^2x_1^3 + 4k^2x_1^2 - 2klx_1^2 + 4k^2x_1 - 2klx_1 + (4 - 8k)^2) + (x_2^2 + k^2x_2^4 - 4k^2x_2^3 + 4k^2x_2^2 - 2klx_2^2 + 4k^2x_2 - 2klx_2 + (4 - 8k)^2).\]
By symmetry, the terms $x_1^2$ and $x_2^2$ will cancel out, as well as the terms $k^2x_1^4$, $k^2x_2^4$, $-4k^2x_1^3$, $-4k^2x_2^3$, $4k^2x_1^2$, $4k^2x_2^2$, and $-2klx_1^2$, $-2klx_2^2$. Also, the terms $-2klx_1$ and $-2klx_2$ will cancel out.

We are left with
\[(4k^2x_1 - 2klx_1 + (4 - 8k)^2) + (4k^2x_2 - 2klx_2 + (4 - 8k)^2).\]
Substituting $x_1 + x_2 = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = -8$, we get
\[(4k^2(2) - 2kl(2) + (4 - 8k)^2) = 8k^2 - 4kl + (4 - 8k)^2.\]
This simplifies to $64 - 64k + 16k^2$. Since this value does not depend on $l$, we can substitute $l = 4 - 8k$ into it to get
\[64 - 64k + 16k^2 = 64 - 64k + 16k^2 = 64 - 64k + 16k^2.\]
Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $64 - 64k + 16k^2$.

Finally, we substitute $k = \frac{1}{2}$ (from the equation of the parabola) into this expression to get
\[64 - 64\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) + 16\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = 64 - 32 + 4 = 36.\]
So the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is 36. The answer is: $\boxed{

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. So we can substitute $y = 4$ into the equation of the parabola to get:
$$4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l.$$
Rearranging, we get:
$$kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0.$$
We know that the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6. If $x_1$ and $x_2$ are the x-coordinates of $A$ and $B$, then we have:
$$|x_2 - x_1| = 6.$$
By the quadratic formula, the roots of the equation are:
$$x = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{(-2k)^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k} = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k} = 1 \pm \sqrt{1 - \frac{l - 4}{k}}.$$
Hence, $|x_2 - x_1| = 2\sqrt{1 - \frac{l - 4}{k}} = 6$.
Squaring both sides, we get:
$$36 = 4\left(1 - \frac{l - 4}{k}\right) \implies 9 = 1 - \frac{l - 4}{k}.$$
Rearranging, we get:
$$\frac{l - 4}{k} = 1 - 9 = -8 \implies l - 4 = -8k \implies l = 4 - 8k.$$
Now we want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. If $x_1$ and $x_2$ are the x-coordinates of $A$ and $B$, then the distances are $|x_1|$ and $|x_2|$, and we want to find $|x_1|^2 + |x_2|^2$.
But $|x_1|^2 + |x_2|^2 = (x_1^2 + x_2^2) = (x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 2x_1x_2) - 2x_1x_2 = ((x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2) - 2x_1x_2 = ((x_1 + x_2)^2 - 4x_1x_2)$.
By Vieta's formulas, $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k} = -8$.
So $|x_1|^2 + |x_2|^2 = (2^2 - 4(-8)) = 4 + 32 = 36$.
The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is 36.
The answer is: $36$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. So we can set $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$, which simplifies to $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$. Let's call this equation (1).

The distance between $A$ and $B$ is given as 6. According to the distance formula, the distance between two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is $\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$. Since the points $A$ and $B$ are on the line $y = 4$, the distance between them is just the difference in their x-coordinates, which is $6$. So, we have $x_2 - x_1 = 6$.

Now, let's denote the roots of equation (1) as $x_1$ and $x_2$. By Vieta's formulas, we know that the sum of the roots is $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$, and the product of the roots is $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$. 

Since $x_2 - x_1 = 6$, we can also write $x_2 = x_1 + 6$. Substituting this into the equation $x_1 + x_2 = 2$, we get $x_1 + x_1 + 6 = 2$, so $2x_1 = -4$ and $x_1 = -2$. Substituting $x_1 = -2$ into $x_2 = x_1 + 6$, we get $x_2 = 4$.

Now we can find $l$ using the product of roots. We have $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$, substituting $x_1 = -2$ and $x_2 = 4$, we get $(-2)(4) = \frac{l - 4}{k}$, so $-8k = l - 4$. Rearranging, we get $l = 4 - 8k$.

Finally, we want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The coordinates of $A$ are $(-2, 4)$ and the coordinates of $B$ are $(4, 4)$. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. So the distance from $A$ to the origin is $\sqrt{(-2)^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{20}$, and the distance from $B$ to the origin is $\sqrt{4^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{32}$. The sum of the squares of these distances is $20 + 32 = 52$.

So the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is 52. The answer is: $52$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find the intersection points of the parabola and line, we set $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$.
Rearranging, we have $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$.
Let the roots of this quadratic be $x_1$ and $x_2$, corresponding to points $A$ and $B$.
By Vieta's formulas, we know that $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$.
Given that the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, we can use the distance formula:
$\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (4 - 4)^2} = 6$.
This simplifies to $x_2 - x_1 = 6$.
Using the difference of squares, we have $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 36$, which can be simplified to $(x_2 + x_1)^2 - 4x_1x_2 = 36$.
Substituting the values of $x_1 + x_2$ and $x_1x_2$, we get:
$4 - 4\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = 36$.
Simplifying further, we have:
$4 - \frac{4(l - 4)}{k} = 36$.
Multiplying through by $k$ gives:
$4k - 4(l - 4) = 36k$.
Expanding the left side gives:
$4k - 4l + 16 = 36k$.
Rearranging terms gives:
$32k = 4l - 16$.
We can divide both sides by 4 to get:
$8k = l - 4$.
Solving for $l$, we have $l = 8k + 4$.
Now we need to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin.
The coordinates of $A$ are $(x_1, 4)$ and the coordinates of $B$ are $(x_2, 4)$.
The distance from $A$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x_1^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{x_1^2 + 16}$ and the distance from $B$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x_2^2 + 16}$.
Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances is:
$(\sqrt{x_1^2 + 16})^2 + (\sqrt{x_2^2 + 16})^2 = x_1^2 + 16 + x_2^2 + 16 = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32$.
We know that $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 2^2 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = 4 - 2\left(\frac{8k + 4 - 4}{k}\right) = 4 - 16 = -12$.
However, this result is not possible since the square of a real number cannot be negative.
We must have made a mistake in our calculations.
Let's go back and check our work.
From the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$, the discriminant must be non-negative for there to be real roots.
The discriminant is $(2k)^2 - 4k(l - 4) = 4k^2 - 4kl + 16k$.
Setting the discriminant non-negative gives:
$4k^2 - 4kl + 16k \ge 0$.
Dividing through by 4 gives:
$k^2 - kl + 4k \ge 0$.
Substituting $l = 8k + 4$ gives:
$k^2 - k(8k + 4) + 4k \ge 0$.
Expanding gives:
$k^2 - 8k^2 - 4k + 4k \ge 0$.
Simplifying gives:
$-7k^2 \ge 0$.
However, this is not possible since the square of a real number cannot be negative.
We must have made another mistake.
Let's go back and re-examine the problem.
We are given that the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6.
Using the distance formula, we have:
$\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (4 - 4)^2} = 6$.
Simplifying, we get:
$(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 36$.
Taking the square root of both sides gives:
$x_2 - x_1 = 6$.
However, this is not the correct form of the distance formula.
The correct form of the distance formula is:
$\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} = d$.
In this case, we have:
$\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (4 - 4)^2} = 6$.
Simplifying gives:
$(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 36$.
Taking the square root of both sides gives:
$x_2 - x_1 = 6$.
This is the correct form of the distance formula.
Therefore, there was no mistake in our calculations.
The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is:
$(\sqrt{x_1^2 + 16})^2 + (\sqrt{x_2^2 + 16})^2 = x_1^2 + 16 + x_2^2 + 16 = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32$.
We know that $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 2^2 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = 4 - 2\left(\frac{8k + 4 - 4}{k}\right) = 4 - 16 = -12$.
However, this result is not possible since the square of a real number cannot be negative.
We must have made a mistake in our calculations.
Let's go back and check our work.
From the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$, the discriminant must be non-negative for there to be real roots.
The discriminant is $(2k)^2 - 4k(l - 4) = 4k^2 - 4kl + 16k$.
Setting the discriminant non-negative gives:
$4k^2 - 4kl +

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we need to find the values of $x$ for which the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$. This means we set the two equations equal to each other and solve for $x$:
\[4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l.\]
Rearranging terms gives us:
\[kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0.\]
Let's call this equation $(1)$.

The problem states that the points $A$ and $B$ are distance 6 apart. If $x_1$ and $x_2$ are the $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$, then by the distance formula, we have:
\[(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 6^2 = 36.\]
From the quadratic formula, we know that for an equation of the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, the sum of the roots is $-b/a$ and the product of the roots is $c/a$. So for equation $(1)$, we have:
\[x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2,\]
\[x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}.\]
We also know that $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 4x_1x_2$. Substituting the values we have, we get:
\[36 = 2^2 - 4 \cdot \frac{l - 4}{k}.\]
Simplifying this equation gives:
\[36 = 4 - \frac{4l - 16}{k}.\]
Multiplying through by $k$ gives:
\[36k = 4k - 4l + 16.\]
Rearranging terms gives:
\[4l = 36k + 16 - 4k = 32k + 16.\]
Therefore,
\[l = 8k + 4.\]
Substitute $l = 8k + 4$ into equation $(1)$:
\[4 = kx^2 - 2kx + 8k + 4 - 4 = kx^2 - 2kx + 8k.\]
Rearranging terms gives:
\[kx^2 - 2kx - 8k = 0.\]
Now we can use the quadratic formula to find the values of $x_1$ and $x_2$. The quadratic formula states that the roots of an equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ are given by:
\[x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}.\]
For our equation, $a = k$, $b = -2k$, and $c = -8k$. So the roots are:
\[x = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{(-2k)^2 - 4k(-8k)}}{2k} = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{4k^2 + 32k^2}}{2k} = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{36k^2}}{2k} = \frac{2k \pm 6k}{2k}.\]
This gives us two possible values for $x$: $x_1 = \frac{8k}{2k} = 4$ and $x_2 = \frac{-4k}{2k} = -2$.

Now we want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. For point $A(4, 4)$, the distance is $\sqrt{4^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{32} = 4\sqrt{2}$. For point $B(-2, 4)$, the distance is $\sqrt{(-2)^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{20} = 2\sqrt{5}$.

So the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is:
\[(4\sqrt{2})^2 + (2\sqrt{5})^2 = 32 + 20 = 52.\] The answer is: $52$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To solve this problem, we first need to find the x-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$ by setting $y = 4$ in the equation of the parabola.
So, we have $4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l$.
Rearranging the terms, we get $kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0$.
Let $x_1$ and $x_2$ be the roots of this equation, which represent the x-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$ respectively.
Since the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, we have $|x_2 - x_1| = 6$.
This is equivalent to $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 36$.
By Vieta's formulas, we know that $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$.
Now, we use the identity $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = (x_2 + x_1)^2 - 4x_1x_2$ to substitute the values of $x_1 + x_2$ and $x_1x_2$:
$36 = 4 - 4\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right)$.
Simplifying this equation, we get $36 = 4 - \frac{4(l - 4)}{k}$.
Rearranging terms, we get $\frac{4(l - 4)}{k} = -32$.
Simplifying further, we get $l - 4 = -8k$.
So, $l = 4 - 8k$.

Now, we need to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin.
The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is given by $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$.
For point $A$ with coordinates $(x_1, 4)$, the distance to the origin is $\sqrt{x_1^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{x_1^2 + 16}$.
Similarly, for point $B$ with coordinates $(x_2, 4)$, the distance to the origin is $\sqrt{x_2^2 + 16}$.
So, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $(\sqrt{x_1^2 + 16})^2 + (\sqrt{x_2^2 + 16})^2 = x_1^2 + 16 + x_2^2 + 16 = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32$.

We know that $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 2^2 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = 4 - 2\left(\frac{4 - 8k - 4}{k}\right) = 4 + 16 = 20$.
Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $20 + 32 = 52$.
The value of the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is 52.
The answer is: 52

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find the points of intersection, we set $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$ and rearrange to get $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$. This is a quadratic equation, and we know that the distance between the points of intersection is 6. This means that the difference of the roots of this equation is 6, and we can write this as $\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2} = 6$, where $x_1$ and $x_2$ are the roots of the equation. From the quadratic formula, we know that the roots are given by $x = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k} = 1 \pm \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{k}$. Thus, the difference of the roots is $\frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{k}$, which we set equal to 6, so $\sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(l - 4)} = 6k$.
Squaring both sides, we get $4k^2 - 4k(l - 4) = 36k^2$, which simplifies to $32k^2 = 4k(l - 4)$, or $8k = l - 4$, so $l = 8k + 4$.
Now we want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The coordinates of the points of intersection are $(x_1, 4)$ and $(x_2, 4)$. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. So we want to find $(x_1^2 + 4^2) + (x_2^2 + 4^2)$.
Using the fact that $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k} = \frac{8k + 4 - 4}{k} = 8$, we can use the formula $(x_1^2 + x_2^2) = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2$ to find $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = 2^2 - 2(8) = 4 - 16 = -12$. But this is not possible, because distances cannot be negative. We must have made a mistake in our calculations.
Let's go back and check our work. We know that $x_1 + x_2 = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = 8$. The formula $(x_1^2 + x_2^2) = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2$ gives us $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = 2^2 - 2(8) = 4 - 16 = -12$, which is a mistake.
Instead, we can use the formula $(x_1^2 + y_1^2) + (x_2^2 + y_2^2) = (x_1 + x_2)^2 + 2y^2 - 2x_1x_2$. Since $y_1 = y_2 = 4$, this gives us $(x_1^2 + 4^2) + (x_2^2 + 4^2) = (2)^2 + 2(4^2) - 2(8) = 4 + 32 - 16 = 20$. So the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is 20. The answer is: $20$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, we solve the equation $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ with $y = 4$:
$$4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l.$$
Rearranging terms, we get
$$kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0.$$

Let $x_1$ and $x_2$ be the x-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$, respectively. According to the problem, $|x_2 - x_1| = 6$. Using the quadratic formula, we have
$$x_{1,2} = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{(2k)^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k} = 1 \pm \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k} = 1 \pm \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}}{2k}.$$

Then, $|x_2 - x_1| = 6$ implies that
$$2 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}}{2k} = 6,$$
which simplifies to
$$\sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k} = 6k.$$
Squaring both sides, we get
$$4k^2 - 4kl + 16k = 36k^2,$$
which simplifies further to
$$32k^2 - 4kl = 0,$$
or
$$4k(8k - l) = 0.$$
Since $k > 0$, we have $8k = l$.

Now we need to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. For point $A$, with coordinates $(x_1, 4)$, the distance is $\sqrt{x_1^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{(1 - \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}}{2k})^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{(1 - 3)^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{16 + 4^2} = \sqrt{32}$.

Similarly, for point $B$, with coordinates $(x_2, 4)$, the distance is also $\sqrt{32}$. Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $2 \cdot 32 = 64$.
The value of this expression is 64. The answer is: $64$

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find the intersection points of the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ and the line $y = 4$, we set them equal to each other:
\[4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l.\]
Rearranging terms, we have $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$. Let's call this equation (1).

We are given that the points $A$ and $B$ are distance 6 apart. Let's denote the coordinates of $A$ and $B$ as $(x_1, 4)$ and $(x_2, 4)$ respectively. Then, $x_2 - x_1 = 6$.

The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin $(0, 0)$ is given by $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. So, the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin are $\sqrt{x_1^2 + 4^2}$ and $\sqrt{x_2^2 + 4^2}$ respectively. Let's denote these distances as $d_1$ and $d_2$.

The sum of the squares of these distances is $d_1^2 + d_2^2 = (x_1^2 + 16) + (x_2^2 + 16) = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32$.

We know from Vieta's formulas that for a quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, the sum of the roots $x_1$ and $x_2$ is given by $-b/a$, and the product of the roots is given by $c/a$. In equation (1), $a = k$, $b = -2k$, and $c = l - 4$.

So, the sum of the roots $x_1 + x_2 = -(-2k)/k = 2$.

Also, the product of the roots $x_1x_2 = (l - 4)/k$.

We know that $x_2 - x_1 = 6$, and squaring both sides gives $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 36$, which can be expanded as $x_2^2 - 2x_1x_2 + x_1^2 = 36$.

Substituting $x_1 + x_2 = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = (l - 4)/k$ into this equation, we get $4 - 2(l - 4)/k + (l - 4)/k = 36$.

Simplifying this equation gives $4 - 2(l - 4)/k + (l - 4)/k = 36$, which simplifies further to $4 - (l - 4)^2/k = 36$.

Multiplying through by $k$ gives $4k - (l - 4)^2 = 36k$.

Rearranging terms gives $(l - 4)^2 = 4k - 36k = -32k$. But since $k > 0$, $-32k$ is negative, which is a contradiction because the square of a real number cannot be negative.

This indicates that we have made a mistake in our calculations. Let's go back and check our work.

Upon reexamining our calculations, we realize that we have forgotten to take into account the fact that the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6. We should have used the equation $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 36$, which gives $x_2^2 - 2x_1x_2 + x_1^2 = 36$.

Substituting $x_1 + x_2 = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = (l - 4)/k$ into this equation, we get $4 - 2(l - 4)/k + (l - 4)/k = 36$.

Simplifying this equation gives $4 - (l - 4)^2/k = 36$.

Multiplying through by $k$ gives $4k - (l - 4)^2 = 36k$.

Rearranging terms gives $(l - 4)^2 = 4k - 36k = -32k$. But since $k > 0$, we can square root both sides to get $l - 4 = \pm \sqrt{-32k}$. But the square root of a negative number is not a real number.

This indicates that we have made another mistake in our calculations. Let's go back and check our work again.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation of the parabola is $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$.
The equation of the line is $y = 4$.
Setting these equal to each other, we get $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$.
Rearranging, we have $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$.
The distance between points $A$ and $B$ is given as 6.
By the distance formula, the distance between two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is $\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$.
So, we have $\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (4 - 4)^2} = 6$.
This simplifies to $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 36$.
Let $x_1$ and $x_2$ be the x-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$, respectively.
By Vieta's formulas, we know that $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$.
We also have $(x_1 - x_2)^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 4x_1x_2 = 4 - \frac{4(l - 4)}{k} = 36$.
Simplifying, we get $4 - \frac{4l - 16}{k} = 36$.
Multiplying both sides by $k$, we get $4k - 4l + 16 = 36k$.
Rearranging, we have $36k - 4k = 4l - 16$.
This simplifies to $32k = 4l - 16$.
Dividing both sides by 4, we get $8k = l - 4$.
Rearranging, we have $l = 8k + 4$.
Now, we need to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin.
The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$.
For point $A$, the distance is $\sqrt{x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2}$.
And for point $B$, the distance is $\sqrt{x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2}$.
We want to find the sum of these squared distances.
Using the fact that $(x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = x_1^2 + x_2^2$, we can simplify this to:
\begin{align*}
&\left(\sqrt{x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2}\right)^2 + \left(\sqrt{x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2}\right)^2 \\

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's find the points $A$ and $B$. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$, so we have $4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l$. Rearranging gives $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$. Let's call this equation $(1)$.

We are given that the points $A$ and $B$ are distance 6 apart. This means that the difference of the x-coordinates of $A$ and $B$ is 6. Let's denote the x-coordinates of $A$ and $B$ as $x_1$ and $x_2$ respectively. Then we have $x_2 - x_1 = 6$.

From Vieta's formulas, we know that the sum of the roots of equation $(1)$ is $\frac{2k}{k} = 2$, and the product of the roots is $\frac{l - 4}{k}$. Also, we have $x_1 + x_2 = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$.

Now, we want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$, so for points $A$ and $B$, this is $\sqrt{x_1^2 + (4)^2}$ and $\sqrt{x_2^2 + (4)^2}$ respectively.

We want to find $(x_1^2 + 16) + (x_2^2 + 16) = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32$.

We know that $(x_1 + x_2)^2 = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 2x_1x_2$, so substituting in the values we have $2^2 = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 2\frac{l - 4}{k}$.

Solving for $x_1^2 + x_2^2$ gives us $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = 4 - 2\frac{l - 4}{k} = 4 - 2\frac{l - 4}{k}$.

Finally, substituting this into our expression for the sum of the squares of the distances gives us $4 - 2\frac{l - 4}{k} + 32 = 36 - 2\frac{l - 4}{k}$.

We also know that $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$, so substituting this gives us $36 - 2(x_1x_2) = 36 - 2\frac{l - 4}{k}$.

This simplifies to $36 - 2(x_1x_2) = 36 - 2(x_1x_2)$, which is true for all values of $x_1x_2$. So the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is indeed $36 - 2\frac{l - 4}{k}$.

However, we do not have enough information to determine the value of this expression without more information about the parameters $k$ and $l$. Therefore, we cannot find the numerical value of this expression.
The value of the expression $36 - 2\frac{l - 4}{k}$ depends on the values of $k$ and $l$, and without more information, we cannot determine the numerical value of this expression. The answer is: Unknown

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's find the $x$-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$. We can do this by setting $y = 4$ in the equation of the parabola and solving for $x$:
$$4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l.$$
Rearranging the terms, we get
$$kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0.$$
This is a quadratic equation in $x$, and we know that it has two solutions, which are the $x$-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$. Let's denote these solutions as $x_1$ and $x_2$. According to the problem, the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, so we have
$$|x_2 - x_1| = 6.$$
From the quadratic formula, we know that the roots of a quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ are given by
$$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}.$$
In our case, $a = k$, $b = -2k$, and $c = l - 4$. Therefore, the difference of the roots is
$$x_2 - x_1 = \frac{\sqrt{(-2k)^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{k} = \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{k} = \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}}{k}.$$
According to the problem, this difference is equal to 6, so we have
$$\frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}}{k} = 6.$$
Squaring both sides, we get
$$4k^2 - 4kl + 16k = 36k^2.$$
Rearranging the terms, we get
$$32k^2 = 4kl.$$
Dividing both sides by $4k$, we get
$$8k = l.$$
Now let's find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. For point $A$ with coordinates $(x_1, 4)$, this distance is $\sqrt{x_1^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{x_1^2 + 16}$. Similarly, the distance for point $B$ with coordinates $(x_2, 4)$ is $\sqrt{x_2^2 + 16}$. The sum of the squares of these distances is
$$(\sqrt{x_1^2 + 16})^2 + (\sqrt{x_2^2 + 16})^2 = x_1^2 + 16 + x_2^2 + 16 = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32.$$
We know that $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2$. From the quadratic formula, we have $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k} = \frac{8k - 4}{k} = 4$. Therefore,
$$x_1^2 + x_2^2 = 2^2 - 2\cdot 4 = 4 - 8 = -4.$$
However, this result is not possible because squares of distances cannot be negative. There must be a mistake in our calculations. Let's go back and check our work.

Upon further examination, we realize that we have made a mistake in our calculation of $x_1^2 + x_2^2$. The correct formula for the sum of squares of the roots of a quadratic equation is
$$x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = (2)^2 - 2\cdot 4 = 4 - 8 = -4.$$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find the $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$, we set $y = 4$ in the equation of the parabola:
\[4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l.\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[kx^2 - 2kx + (l-4) = 0.\]
This is a quadratic equation, and the solutions $x = a$ and $x = b$ are given by the quadratic formula:
\[x = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(l-4)}}{2k} = 1 \pm \sqrt{1 - (l-4)}.\]
We are given that $|a - b| = 6$, so
\[|1 - \sqrt{1 - (l-4)} - (1 + \sqrt{1 - (l-4)})| = 6,\]
which simplifies to $2|\sqrt{1 - (l-4)}| = 6$, or $|\sqrt{1 - (l-4)}| = 3$.
Squaring both sides, we get $1 - (l-4) = 9$, so $l-4 = -8$, which gives $l = -4$.
Then the equation of the parabola becomes $y = kx^2 - 2kx - 4$.
We are looking for the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin.
The distance from a point $(x,y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$.
For point $A$, with $x = 1 - \sqrt{1 - (l-4)} = 1 - \sqrt{1 - (-4)} = 1 - \sqrt{5}$, we have
\[d_A = \sqrt{(1 - \sqrt{5})^2 + (k(1 - \sqrt{5})^2 - 2k(1 - \sqrt{5}) - 4)^2}.\]
Similarly, for point $B$, with $x = 1 + \sqrt{1 - (l-4)} = 1 + \sqrt{5}$, we have
\[d_B = \sqrt{(1 + \sqrt{5})^2 + (k(1 + \sqrt{5})^2 - 2k(1 + \sqrt{5}) - 4)^2}.\]
The sum of the squares of the distances is then $d_A^2 + d_B^2$.
We can simplify this expression, but it will be quite complex.
However, we notice that the expression for $d_A^2 + d_B^2$ will be a function of $k$ only,
and we can find a value of $k$ that makes this expression as simple as possible.
After some trial and error, we find that $k = 1$ makes the expression much simpler.
With $k = 1$, the equation of the parabola is $y = x^2 - 2x - 4$, and the points $A$ and $B$ have $x$-coordinates $1 - \sqrt{5}$ and $1 + \sqrt{5}$, respectively.
Using these values, we find that
\[d_A^2 + d_B^2 = [(1 - \sqrt{5})^2 + ( (1 - \sqrt{5})^2 - 2(1 - \sqrt{5}) - 4)^2] + [(1 + \sqrt{5})^2 + ( (1 + \sqrt{5})^2 - 2(1 + \sqrt{5}) - 4)^2].\]
After simplifying, we get $d_A^2 + d_B^2 = 100$.
Thus, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $100$.
The value of the unknown parameter $k$ that makes the expression for $d_A^2 + d_B^2$ simple is $k = 1$.
So the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $100$. The answer is: $100$

"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's find the points $A$ and $B$.
To do this, we set the equation of the parabola equal to the equation of the line:
\[kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4.\]
Rearranging terms gives us the quadratic equation:
\[kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0.\]
Let $x_1$ and $x_2$ be the x-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$, respectively. Since these points are distance 6 apart, we have $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 36$. By Vieta's formulas, we know that $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$. We can use the difference of squares identity to find:
\[(x_2 - x_1)^2 = (x_2 + x_1)^2 - 4x_1x_2 = 4 - 4\cdot\frac{l - 4}{k} = 4 - \frac{4l - 16}{k}.\]
Setting this equal to 36 gives us:
\[4 - \frac{4l - 16}{k} = 36.\]
Simplifying gives us:
\[\frac{4l - 16}{k} = -32.\]
Multiplying both sides by $k$ gives us:
\[4l - 16 = -32k.\]
Adding 16 to both sides gives us:
\[4l = -32k + 16.\]
Dividing both sides by 4 gives us:
\[l = -8k + 4.\]
Now we can find the coordinates of $A$ and $B$. Since $A$ and $B$ lie on the line $y = 4$, we have $y_1 = y_2 = 4$. For point $A$, we have:
\[A = (x_1, 4).\]
Similarly, for point $B$, we have:
\[B = (x_2, 4).\]
Now we can find the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The distance from $A$ to the origin is:
\[d_1 = \sqrt{x_1^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{x_1^2 + 16}.\]
Similarly, the distance from $B$ to the origin is:
\[d_2 = \sqrt{x_2^2 + 16}.\]
Now we want to find the sum of the squares of these distances. We have:
\[d_1^2 + d_2^2 = (x_1^2 + 16) + (x_2^2 + 16) = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32.\]
We know that $(x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = x_1^2 + x_2^2$, so we can substitute in our expressions for $x_1 + x_2$ and $x_1x_2$:
\[(2)^2 - 2\cdot\frac{l - 4}{k} = x_1^2 + x_2^2.\]
Simplifying gives us:
\[4 - 2\cdot\frac{-8k + 4 - 4}{k} = x_1^2 + x_2^2.\]
Simplifying further gives us:
\[4 + \frac{16k}{k} = x_1^2 + x_2^2.\]
Simplifying gives us:
\[4 + 16 = x_1^2 + x_2^2.\]
Therefore, $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = 20$. Substituting this into our expression for $d_1^2 + d_2^2$ gives us:
\[d_1^2 + d_2^2 = 20 + 32 = 52.\]
Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is 52.
The answer is: $52$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We start by considering the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
Using the triangle inequality, we know that $|a+b| \leq |a| + |b|$ for all real numbers $a$ and $b$.
Applying this to the given equation, we get $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |-(x-2y)| - (y-2x) = |-x+2y| - (y-2x) = |2y-x| - (y-2x) = |2y-x| + |2x-y| \geq |(2y-x) + (2x-y)| = |y| + |x| = |x| + |y|$.
So, $|x| + |y| = 40$.
Now, we consider the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.
We can rewrite this as $5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x^2 - 2xy + y^2) + (x^2 - 6xy + y^2)] - 8xy = 5[(x-y)^2 + (x-3y)^2] - 8xy$.
By AM-GM inequality, we know that for any positive numbers $a$ and $b$, $(a+b)/2 \geq \sqrt{ab}$, or equivalently, $a+b \geq 2\sqrt{ab}$.
Applying this to the terms $(x-y)^2$ and $(x-3y)^2$, we get $(x-y)^2 + (x-3y)^2 \geq 2\sqrt{(x-y)^2(x-3y)^2} = 2|x-2y|$.
Substituting this back into the expression, we get $5(x-y)^2 + 5(x-3y)^2 - 8xy \geq 10|x-2y| - 8xy$.
Using the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we know that $|x-2y| = 40 - |y-2x| = 40 - |2x-y|$.
So, $|x-2y| = 20$ or $|x-2y| = 20$.
Case 1: If $|x-2y| = 20$, then $10|x-2y| - 8xy = 200 - 8xy$.
Case 2: If $|x-2y| = 20$, then $10|x-2y| - 8xy = 200 - 8xy$.
In both cases, we have $5(x-y)^2 + 5(x-3y)^2 - 8xy \geq 200 - 8xy$.
Setting $8xy = 200$, we get $5(x-y)^2 + 5(x-3y)^2 - 8xy \geq 0$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $0$. The answer is: $0$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's simplify the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
Since $|a - b| = |b - a|$, we can rewrite this as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$.
Using the property $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$, we have $|x-2y| + |2y-x| \geq |(x-2y) + (2y-x)| = |0| = 0$.
Therefore, the only way for this equation to hold is when equality holds in the triangle inequality, which means $x-2y = 0$ and $2y-x = 0$, or $x = 2y$.
Substituting $x = 2y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get $5(2y)^2 + 5y^2 - 8(2y)(y) = 20y^2 + 5y^2 - 16y^2 = 9y^2$.
Now, we need to find the minimum value of $9y^2$ under the condition $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$, or $|2y - 2y| + |y - 4y| = 40$, which simplifies to $|0| + |-3y| = 40$, or $3|y| = 40$. Therefore, $|y| = \frac{40}{3}$. Since $y$ can be positive or negative, the minimum value of $y^2$ is $\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{1600}{9}$.
Substituting this back into $9y^2$, we get $9 \cdot \frac{1600}{9} = 1600$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 1600.
The answer is: $1600$.

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's simplify the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. This can be rewritten as $5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy$.
Now, let's recall the formula $(a-b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2$. We can rewrite the expression $5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy$ as $5[(x-y)^2 + 2xy] - 8xy$.
Simplifying further, we get $5(x-y)^2 + 5*2xy - 8xy = 5(x-y)^2 - 3xy$.
Now, let's look at the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. By the triangle inequality, $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |(x-2y) - (y-2x)| = |x-2y - y+2x| = |3x - 3y| = 3|x-y| = 40$. So, $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$.
Since the expression we want to minimize, $5(x-y)^2 - 3xy$, depends only on $|x-y|$, and not on the individual values of $x$ and $y$, we can set $x-y = \frac{40}{3}$. Then, $-3xy = -3\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 = -\frac{1600}{3}$.
So, the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $5\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 - \frac{1600}{3} = \frac{8000}{9} - \frac{1600}{3} = \frac{8000-4800}{9} = \frac{3200}{9}$. Therefore, the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\frac{3200}{9}$. The answer is: $\frac{3200}{9}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



We start by noting that the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$.

Now, let's consider the function $f(x, y) = 5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We want to find its minimum value under the condition $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$.

By the triangle inequality, we know that $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$, so $|2y-x| + |2x-y| \geq |(2y-x) + (2x-y)| = |y|$. Therefore, $|y| = 40$.

Since $|y| = 40$, we have $y = 40$ or $y = -40$.

If $y = 40$, then from $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$, we get $|80-x| + |2x-40| = 40$. By the triangle inequality again, we have $|80-x| + |2x-40| \geq |(80-x) + (2x-40)| = |40| = 40$, so the equality holds. Therefore, we have $80 - x = 2x - 40$, which gives $x = \frac{120}{3} = 40$.

Similarly, if $y = -40$, we get $x = -40$.

Now we have two pairs of solutions: $(x, y) = (40, 40)$ and $(x, y) = (-40, -40)$. Let's substitute these pairs into the function $f(x, y)$:

For $(x, y) = (40, 40)$, we have $f(40, 40) = 5(40)^2 + 5(40)^2 - 8(40)(40) = 4000$.

For $(x, y) = (-40, -40)$, we have $f(-40, -40) = 5(-40)^2 + 5(-40)^2 - 8(-40)(-40) = 4000$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $f(x, y)$ is $4000$. The answer is: $4000$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


Let $a = x - 2y$ and $b = y - 2x$. We have $|a| + |b| = 40$. By the triangle inequality, we know that $|a| + |b| \ge |a + b|$. So we have $|a + b| \le 40$. We also know that $a + b = x - 2y + y - 2x = -x - y$. So we have $|-x - y| \le 40$, which is equivalent to $|x + y| \le 40$.
Now we need to minimize the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$. We can rewrite this as $5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x + y)^2 - 2xy] - 8xy = 5(x + y)^2 - 18xy$.
By the AM-GM inequality, we have $5(x + y)^2 - 18xy \ge 5(x + y)^2 - 9(x + y)^2 = -4(x + y)^2$. We know that $|x + y| \le 40$, so $-4(x + y)^2 \ge -4(40)^2 = -6400$. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is $-6400$.
The answer is: $-6400$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's consider the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, we know that $|a| + |b| \ge |a+b|$ for any real numbers $a$ and $b$. So we have
\[|x-2y| + |y-2x| \ge |(x-2y) + (y-2x)| = |x-2y+y-2x| = |-x-y| = |-(x+y)| = |x+y|.\]
We are given that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, so we must have $|x+y| = 40$.
Now let's consider the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite this as:
\[5x^2+5y^2-8xy = \frac{1}{2}((5x^2-8xy+8y^2) + (5y^2-8xy+8x^2)) = \frac{1}{2}((5x-4y)^2 + (4x-5y)^2).\]
Now, by the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have:
\[((5x)^2+(8y)^2)((8x)^2+(5y)^2) \ge (5x \cdot 8x + 8y \cdot 5y)^2 = (40x^2 + 40y^2)^2.\]
So we have:
\[(25x^2+64y^2)(64x^2+25y^2) \ge (40x^2 + 40y^2)^2.\]
Taking the square root of both sides gives:
\[\sqrt{(25x^2+64y^2)(64x^2+25y^2)} \ge 40x^2 + 40y^2.\]
But we know that $|x+y| = 40$, so $x^2 + 2xy + y^2 = 1600$, and therefore $40x^2 + 40y^2 + 80xy = 6400$. Then $80xy = 6400 - 40x^2 - 40y^2 = 40(160 - x^2 - y^2)$.
Thus, we have:
\[40(x^2 + y^2) + 80xy \ge 6400 \implies 40(x^2 + y^2) + 40(160 - x^2 - y^2) \ge 6400 \implies 40(320) \ge 6400 \implies x^2 + y^2 \ge 80.\]
Finally, we can substitute this back into our expression for $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
\[5x^2+5y^2-8xy = \frac{1}{2}((5x-4y)^2 + (4x-5y)^2) \ge \frac{1}{2}(0^2 + 0^2) = 0.\]
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0 when $x=2y$ and $y=2x$, or equivalently, when $x=y=0$. But this doesn't satisfy the condition $|x+y| = 40$. So we need to look for another way to find the minimum value.

Let's consider the expression $(5x-4y)^2 + (4x-5y)^2$. By the AM-GM inequality, we have:
\[\frac{(5x-4y)^2 + (4x-5y)^2}{2} \ge \sqrt{(5x-4y)^2 \cdot (4x-5y)^2} = |5x-4y| \cdot |4x-5y| = |20x^2 - 40xy + 20y^2|.\]
But we know that $|x+y| = 40$, so $x^2 + 2xy + y^2 = 1600$, and therefore $20x^2 + 40xy + 20y^2 = 8000$. So we have:
\[\frac{(5x-4y)^2 + (4x-5y)^2}{2} \ge 8000 - 40xy.\]
Therefore, we have:
\[5x^2+5y^2-8xy = \frac{1}{2}((5x-4y)^2 + (4x-5y)^2) \ge \frac{1}{2}(8000 - 40xy) = 4000 - 20xy.\]
We want to minimize $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, so we want to maximize $20xy$. By the AM-GM inequality, we have:
\[20xy \le \sqrt{(20x)^2 \cdot (20y)^2} = \sqrt{(400x^2) \cdot (400y^2)} = \sqrt{160000(x^2+y^2)} = \sqrt{160000 \cdot 80} = 4000.\]
Equality occurs when $20x = 20y$, or $x = y$. Substituting this back into the equation $|x+y| = 40$, we get $|2x| = 40$, or $x = \pm 20$. But we want the positive value, so $x = 20$ and $y = 20$.

Therefore, when $x=20$ and $y=20$, we have:
\[5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(20)^2+5(20)^2-8(20)(20) = 2000 + 2000 - 3200 = 800.\]
Thus, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 800. The answer is: $800$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we need to find the relationship between $x$ and $y$ from the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
If $x - 2y \ge 0$ and $y - 2x \ge 0$, we have $x - 2y + y - 2x = 40$, which simplifies to $-x - y = 40$, or $x + y = -40$.
If $x - 2y < 0$ and $y - 2x < 0$, we have $-(x - 2y) - (y - 2x) = 40$, which simplifies to $-x + 2y - y + 2x = 40$, or $x + y = 40$.
If $x - 2y \ge 0$ and $y - 2x < 0$, we have $x - 2y - (y - 2x) = 40$, which simplifies to $x - 2y - y + 2x = 40$, or $3x - 3y = 40$, or $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$.
If $x - 2y < 0$ and $y - 2x \ge 0$, we have -(x - 2y) + (y - 2x) = 40, which simplifies to $-x + 2y + y - 2x = 40$, or $-3x + 3y = 40$, or $y - x = \frac{40}{3}$.
However, the last two cases are not possible because $x + y = -40$ implies $x < 0$ and $y < 0$, but $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$ or $y - x = \frac{40}{3}$ would lead to either $x > 0$ or $y > 0$, which contradicts $x < 0$ and $y < 0$.
Therefore, we only need to consider the case $x + y = -40$.

Now, we need to find the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ subject to the constraint $x + y = -40$.
Using the constraint, we can express $y$ in terms of $x$ as $y = -40 - x$.
Substitute this into the expression:
$$5x^2 + 5(-40 - x)^2 - 8x(-40 - x)$$
$$= 5x^2 + 5(1600 + 80x + x^2) + 320x + 8x^2$$
$$= 5x^2 + 8000 + 400x + 5x^2 + 320x + 8x^2$$
$$= 18x^2 + 720x + 8000$$
To find the minimum value of this quadratic expression, we can find its vertex.
The x-coordinate of the vertex is given by $-\frac{b}{2a}$, where $a$ and $b$ are the coefficients of the quadratic expression.
In this case, $a = 18$ and $b = 720$, so the x-coordinate of the vertex is $-\frac{720}{2 \cdot 18} = -20$.
Substitute $x = -20$ into the expression to find the minimum value:
$$18(-20)^2 + 720(-20) + 8000 = 7200 - 14400 + 8000 = -6400 + 8000 = 1600$$
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $x + y = -40$ is 1600. The answer is: $1600$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we notice that the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is equivalent to $|x-2y| = |2x-y|$.
Expanding the absolute value signs, we get $x-2y = \pm (2x-y)$, which simplifies to $x-2y = 2x-y$ or $x-2y = -(2x-y)$.
Solving the first equation, we get $x=3y$.
Substituting this into the second equation, we get $x-2y = -2x+y$, which simplifies to $3x=3y$, or $x=y$.
So we have $x=3y$ and $x=y$. The only solution that satisfies both equations is $x=y$.
Now, we can substitute $y=x$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to get $5x^2+5x^2-8x^2 = 2x^2$.
Now, we need to find the minimum value of $2x^2$ given the condition $|x-2x| + |x-2x| = 40$, which simplifies to $0+0=40$, which is false.
However, we made a mistake in our reasoning. Let's go back and reconsider the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
The absolute value equation $|x-2y| = |2x-y|$ is equivalent to two separate cases:
Case 1: $x-2y = 2x-y$ and $x-2y = -(2x-y)$.
Solving the first equation, we get $x=3y$.
Substituting this into the second equation, we get $x-2y = -2x+y$, which simplifies to $3x=3y$, or $x=y$.
So for this case, $x=3y$ and $x=y$, which implies $x=y$.
Case 2: $x-2y = -(2x-y)$ and $x-2y = 2x-y$.
Solving the first equation, we get $x-2y = -2x+y$, which simplifies to $3x=3y$, or $x=y$.
Substituting this into the second equation, we get $x-2y = 2x-y$, which simplifies to $x=3y$.
So for this case, $x=y$ and $x=3y$, which implies $x=y$.
Therefore, the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ implies $x=y$.
Now, we can substitute $y=x$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to get $5x^2+5x^2-8x^2 = 2x^2$.
Finally, we need to find the minimum value of $2x^2$. Since $x^2$ is always non-negative, the minimum value of $2x^2$ is $0$, which occurs when $x=0$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $0$.
The answer is: $0$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To solve this problem, we first note that the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is always true for any real numbers $x$ and $y$. This is because $|x-2y| = |-(2y-x)| = |2x-y|$ and $|y-2x| = |-(2x-y)| = |2y-x|$, so $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |2x-y| + |2y-x|$. By the triangle inequality, $|a| + |b| \ge |a+b|$, so $|2x-y| + |2y-x| \ge |(2x-y) + (2y-x)| = |0| = 0$, which is a contradiction. Therefore, the given equation is always true.
Now, we want to find the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under this condition.
We can rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $(3x^2-8xy+3y^2) + 2(x^2+y^2)$. The first term can be factored as $(x-2y)^2 + (2x-y)^2$, so $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = (x-2y)^2 + (2x-y)^2 + 2(x^2+y^2)$.
By the triangle inequality, $(x-2y)^2 + (2x-y)^2 \ge 0$, and $x^2+y^2 \ge 0$, so the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is always nonnegative.
Equality occurs when $x-2y = 0$ and $2x-y = 0$, which gives $x = \frac{4}{3}y$. Substituting this into the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we get $|-\frac{2}{3}y| + |-\frac{4}{3}y| = 40$, which simplifies to $\frac{2}{3}|y| + \frac{4}{3}|y| = 40$, or $\frac{6}{3}|y| = 40$, or $|y| = 20$. So $y = \pm 20$, and $x = \frac{4}{3}y = \pm \frac{80}{3}$.
When $y = 20$, $x = \frac{80}{3}$, and $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = (0)^2 + (40)^2 + 2(400) = 1600 + 800 = 2400$. When $y = -20$, $x = -\frac{80}{3}$, and $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = (0)^2 + (40)^2 + 2(400) = 1600 + 800 = 2400$. So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the given condition is 2400. The answer is: $2400$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we first need to find the relationship between $x$ and $y$ from the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.

The given equation can be rewritten as $|x-2y| + |2x-y| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, we know that $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$, so we have $|x-2y + 2x-y| = |3x-3y| = 40$.
This simplifies to $3|x-y| = 40$, so $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$.

Now let's substitute $x = y + \frac{40}{3}$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
\begin{align*}
5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy &= 5(y + \frac{40}{3})^2 + 5y^2 - 8y(y + \frac{40}{3}) \\
&= 5(y^2 + 2*\frac{40}{3}y + \frac{1600}{9}) + 5y^2 - 8y^2 - \frac{320}{3}y \\
&= 5y^2 + \frac{400}{3}y + \frac{8000}{9} + 5y^2 - 8y^2 - \frac{320}{3}y \\
&= -3y^2 + \frac{80}{3}y + \frac{8000}{9}.
\end{align*}

This is a quadratic function in $y$, and its graph is a parabola opening downwards.
To find the minimum value, we can find the vertex of the parabola.

The $y$-coordinate of the vertex of a parabola given in the form $ay^2 + by + c$ is $-\frac{b}{2a}$.
In this case, $a = -3$ and $b = \frac{80}{3}$, so the $y$-coordinate of the vertex is $-\frac{\frac{80}{3}}{2*(-3)} = \frac{40}{9}$.

Substitute $y = \frac{40}{9}$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to find the minimum value:
\begin{align*}
5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy &= 5(y + \frac{40}{3})^2 + 5y^2 - 8y(y + \frac{40}{3}) \\
&= 5(\frac{40}{9} + \frac{40}{3})^2 + 5(\frac{40}{9})^2 - 8*\frac{40}{9}*(\frac{40}{9} + \frac{40}{3}) \\
&= 5*\frac{1600}{81} + 5*\frac{1600}{81} - 8*\frac{40}{9}*\frac{160}{9} \\
&= \frac{1600}{9} + \frac{1600}{9} - \frac{51200}{81} \\
&= \frac{3200}{9} - \frac{51200}{81} \\
&= \frac{28800 - 51200}{81} \\
&= -\frac{22400}{81}.
\end{align*}

Therefore, the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $-\frac{22400}{81}$.
The answer is: $-\frac{22400}{81}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ subject to the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we first need to simplify the condition.

Consider the absolute value expressions $|x-2y|$ and $|y-2x|$. We know that $|a| = |-a|$ for any real number $a$, so we can rewrite the condition as:
$$|x-2y| = |2x-y|.$$
Now, we expand the absolute value expressions:
$$x-2y = \pm (2x-y) \quad \text{or} \quad x-2y = \pm (y-2x).$$

Solving these two cases:
1. For $x-2y = 2x-y$, we get $y = x$.
2. For $x-2y = -(y-2x)$, we get $3x = 3y$, so $x = y$.

Thus, the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ simplifies to $x = y$.

Now, let's substitute $x = y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
$$5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5x^2+5x^2-8x^2 = 2x^2.$$

Now we need to find the minimum value of $2x^2$ under the condition $|x-2x| = 40$, or $|x-2x| = 40$, which simplifies to $0 = 40$, which is a contradiction. So, we must have made a mistake in our simplification of the condition.

Let's go back and reconsider the original condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. We can rewrite it as $|x-2y| = 40 - |y-2x|$. Since the left side of this equation is always nonnegative, and the right side is always nonnegative, both sides must be equal to 0:
$$|x-2y| = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad |y-2x| = 40.$$

The first equation implies $x = 2y$. Substituting this into the second equation gives $|y-4y| = 40$, or $|3y| = 40$. Thus, $y = \pm \frac{40}{3}$.

Now we can substitute $x = 2y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
$$5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(2y)^2+5y^2-8(2y)y = 20y^2+5y^2-16y^2 = 9y^2.$$

Now we substitute $y = \pm \frac{40}{3}$ into the expression $9y^2$:
$$9\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 = 9\left(\frac{1600}{9}\right) = 1600.$$

So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 1600. The answer is: $\boxed{1600}$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we observe that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$.
This is the same as $|x-2y| + |2x-y| = 40$.
Using the property of absolute value, we have $|a| + |b| = |a+b| + |a-b|$.
So, we can rewrite the equation as $|(x-2y) + (2x-y)| + |(x-2y) - (2x-y)| = 40$.
Simplifying, we get $|3x-3y| + |-x-y| = 40$.
Since absolute value is always non-negative, we have $|3x-3y| + |-x-y| \geq 0$.
And since this sum equals 40, we can conclude that both terms are equal to 20.
So, we have $|3x-3y| = 20$ and $|-x-y| = 20$.
This gives us two cases to consider:
Case 1: $3x-3y = 20$ and $-x-y = 20$.
Solving the system of equations, we get $x = 10$ and $y = -5$.
Case 2: $3x-3y = -20$ and $-x-y = -20$.
Solving the system of equations, we get $x = -10$ and $y = 5$.
Now, we substitute these values into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
For Case 1: $5(10)^2+5(-5)^2-8(10)(-5) = 500 + 125 + 400 = 1025$.
For Case 2: $5(-10)^2+5(5)^2-8(-10)(5) = 500 + 125 + 400 = 1025$.
In both cases, we get the same value.
So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 1025. The answer is: $1025$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's consider the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
We can rewrite this as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, we have $|2y-x| + |2x-y| \geq |(2y-x) + (2x-y)| = |y| = |y-0|$.
So, we must have $|y| = 20$.
Now, let's consider the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.
We can rewrite this as $5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy$.
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have $(x^2+y^2)^2 \geq (1^2+1^2)(x^2+y^2)$,
so $x^2+y^2 \geq \frac{1}{2}(x^2+y^2)^2$.
Multiplying both sides by 5, we get $5(x^2+y^2) \geq \frac{5}{2}(x^2+y^2)^2$.
Now, let's consider the expression $8xy$.
By the AM-GM inequality, we have $8xy \leq 2(x^2+y^2)$.
Therefore, $5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy \geq 5(x^2+y^2) - 2(x^2+y^2) = 3(x^2+y^2)$.
Now, we know that $y^2 = 20^2 = 400$, so we can substitute this into the inequality above:
$5(x^2+400) - 8xy \geq 3(x^2+400)$.
Expanding, we get $5x^2 + 2000 - 8xy \geq 3x^2 + 1200$.
Simplifying, we get $2x^2 - 8xy + 800 \geq 0$.
Factoring out a 2, we have $2(x^2 - 4xy + 400) \geq 0$.
Simplifying further, we have $2(x-2y)^2 \geq 0$.
Since $(x-2y)^2$ is always nonnegative, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is achieved when $(x-2y)^2 = 0$, or $x=2y$.
Substituting this into the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we have $|x-x| + |y-2x| = 40$,
or $|y-2x| = 40$.
Since $|y| = 20$, we can deduce that $y = 20$ or $y = -20$.
If $y = 20$, then $x = 40$, and the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $5(40)^2+5(20)^2-8(40)(20) = 8000$.
If $y = -20$, then $x = -40$, and the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is also $8000$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 8000. The answer is: $8000$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. This means that the expression on the left side of the equation will be equal to $\frac{m}{100}$ or $-\frac{m}{100}$ at $4$ different values of $x$.

The expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ will be equal to $\frac{m}{100}$ or $-\frac{m}{100}$ in different cases depending on the value of $m$. 

For $\frac{m}{100} \ge 2$, i.e., $m \ge 200$, the expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ will be equal to $\frac{m}{100}$ at $4$ different values of $x$.

For $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, i.e., $0 < m < 200$, the expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ will be equal to $\frac{m}{100}$ or $-\frac{m}{100}$ at $4$ different values of $x$.

For $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, i.e., $m = 200$, the expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ will be equal to $\frac{m}{100}$ or $-\frac{m}{100}$ at $4$ different values of $x$.

So, the possible values of $m$ are those in the range $0 < m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ in this range are $1, 2, 3, \ldots, 199$. 

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $199$. The answer is: $199$

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. This is because the expression $| |x-1|-2|$ is a "V" shape with the "peak" at 2. So, for it to have 4 distinct solutions, the "height" of the "V" must be exactly 2.

Solving the equation $\frac{m}{100} = 2$ for $m$ gives $m = 200$. So, there is only 1 positive integer $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions, and that is $m=200$. The answer is: $1$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions. 

The expression on the left side, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, represents a "hump" function that reaches a maximum of 2 at $x=1$, and a minimum of 0 at $x=3$ and $x=-1$.

The right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be a number between 0 and 2 for the equation to have 4 distinct solutions. Therefore, $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$.

Solving these inequalities gives $0 < m < 200$.

Since $m$ is a positive integer, the possible values for $m$ are the integers from 1 to 199.

However, we need to find the number of these values that make the equation have exactly 4 distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}=1$. This gives $m=100$.

Therefore, there is only one value of $m$ that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions, namely $m=100$. The answer is: 1

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has 4 distinct solutions.
We know that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=k$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $0<k<1$.
In this case, $k=\frac{m}{100}$, so we have $0<\frac{m}{100}<1$.
This inequality simplifies to $0<m<100$.
So the positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition are the integers from 1 to 99.
There are 99 such positive integers.
The answer is: 99.
The answer is: $\boxed{99}$.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$.
This is because the expression on the left side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, can only be equal to $2$ for four distinct values of $x$.

Setting $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, we can solve for $m$ to get $m = 200$.
Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions, and that is $m = 200$. The answer is: $\boxed{1}$

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The number of distinct solutions of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $4$ if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $2$. This is because the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, takes on the value of $2$ exactly four times.

Setting $\frac{m}{100}=2$, we find that $m = 200$. So there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions, and that is $m = 200$. The answer is: $1$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero. Therefore, either of the expressions must be equal to zero for the entire product to be zero.
The expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ can only be true if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$.
Similarly, the expression $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ can only be true if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these four equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$.
Combining the vertices from both cases, we have a total of 8 vertices for the polygon: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$.
The resulting polygon is a square with side length 10, so the area is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ equals to zero if and only if at least one of the factors equals to zero. Thus the original equation is satisfied if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ is satisfied if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solution set of the first equation is the set of points on the vertical lines $x = 5$ and $y = 5$, and the solution set of the second equation is the set of points on the lines $x = -5$ and $y = -5$. Thus this part of the equation describes a square with side length $10$ and area $100$.

The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ is satisfied if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which describes a square with side length $16$ and area $256$.

Thus the area of the convex polygon is $100 + 256 = \boxed{356}$. The answer is: $356$

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation given is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, we have two cases:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
This can only happen if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This means that $|x+y| = 10$ and $|x-y| = 10$. The solutions to these equations are the points in a square with side length 20 centered at the origin.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This can only happen if both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This means that $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. The solutions to these equations are the points in a square with side length 16 centered at the origin.

Therefore, the points that satisfy the original equation are the points in the intersection of these two squares, which is a square with side length 8. The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$. So the area of the convex polygon is 64 square units.
The answer is: $64$

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if and only if either of the following conditions holds:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
For the first condition to be true, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$, which can be solved to give the vertices of a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.
For the second condition to be true, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$, which can be solved to give the vertices of a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of these two squares, which is $100 + 256 = 356$.
The answer is: 356.

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The given equation is $0$ when either $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$ or $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$ holds only when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two lines in the plane: $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, or $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$.

The equation $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ holds only when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which are the equations of four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length $16$.

The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon in question. The area of this convex polygon is the area of the smaller square, which is $(16)^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is equal to zero if either of the two factors is zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
For the first factor to be zero, both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us the lines $x + y = \pm10$ and $x - y = \pm10$.
For the second factor to be zero, both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us the lines $x = \pm8$ and $y = \pm8$.
The intersection points of these lines are the vertices of the polygon: $(8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(8, -8)$.
To find the area of the polygon, we can treat it as a square with side length 16 (since the distance between the points $(8, 8)$ and $(-8, 8)$, for example, is $8 - (-8) = 16$). The area of a square with side length 16 is $16^2 = 256$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation given in the problem is:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$

The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Thus, the equation is satisfied if either
$$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad (\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0.$$

This means that either $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The absolute value equations $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$ represent the equations of four lines in the coordinate plane. The intersections of these lines form a square with side length 8, which is the convex polygon we are looking for.

The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $8^2 = 64$.
The answer is: $64$

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So, in the given equation, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$, which gives us four lines $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. The intersection of these lines form a square with side length 20.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us a square with side length 16.

The area of the larger square is $20^2 = 400$, and the area of the smaller square is $16^2 = 256$. The convex polygon enclosed by the points satisfying the equation is the intersection of these two squares, which is also a square.

The area of this convex polygon is the difference between the areas of the larger square and the smaller square, which is $400 - 256 = 144$. So, the area of the convex polygon is 144 square units.
The answer is: 144

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



To find the area of the polygon, we need to find the vertices of the polygon first.
The equation
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0\]
is satisfied if either
\[(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0\]
or
\[(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0.\]
The first equation is satisfied only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$.
The second equation is satisfied only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
So the vertices of the polygon are the points $(\pm 10, \pm 10)$ and $(\pm 8, \pm 8)$.
To find the area of the polygon, we can divide it into four smaller squares: one with side length 20 (formed by the vertices $(\pm 10, \pm 10)$), and three with side length 16 (formed by the vertices $(\pm 8, \pm 8)$).
The area of the square with side length 20 is $20^2 = 400$.
The area of each square with side length 16 is $16^2 = 256$.
Therefore, the total area of the polygon is $400 + 3 \cdot 256 = 1168$.
The answer is: $1168$

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The given equation is $ ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0 $. This equation is equal to 0 if and only if either one of the two factors is equal to 0. 

The first factor is equal to 0 if and only if both $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x-y| - 10 = 0$. Solving these two equations, we get $|x+y| = 10$ and $|x-y| = 10$. This gives us the following four equations: 
1. $x + y = 10$
2. $x + y = -10$
3. $x - y = 10$
4. $x - y = -10$

The second factor is equal to 0 if and only if both $|x| - 8 = 0$ and $|y| - 8 = 0$. Solving these two equations, we get $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. This gives us the following four equations: 
5. $x = 8$
6. $x = -8$
7. $y = 8$
8. $y = -8$

By plotting these eight lines on a graph, we find that they enclose a square with side length 20. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.
The answer is: $400$.

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The expression is equal to zero if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

These conditions hold if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The conditions $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$ define a square with side length 16. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation given is a product of two terms equal to zero, which means either of the two terms must be zero. So we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
This is possible only when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us a square with side length 10, centered at the origin, and its vertices are $(\pm 10, 0)$, $(0, \pm 10)$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
This is possible only when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us a square with side length 16, also centered at the origin, and its vertices are $(\pm 8, 0)$, $(0, \pm 8)$.

The intersection of the two squares is the required polygon. The area of the polygon is the area of the smaller square (Case 2) minus the area of the square that is outside the smaller square (Case 1).

The side length of the smaller square (Case 2) is 16, so its area is $16^2 = 256$. The side length of the larger square (Case 1) is 20, so its area is $20^2 = 400$. Therefore, the area of the polygon is $256 - (400 - 256) = 256 - 144 = 112$. The answer is: $112$

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So, the equation
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$
holds if and only if at least one of the following two conditions is true:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first condition to be true, both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations gives us the vertices of the rectangle: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$.

For the second condition to be true, both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these four equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The intersection of the rectangle and the square gives us the convex polygon formed by the points that satisfy the original equation. This polygon is a square with side length 16, so its area is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We start by substituting $n=1$ into the first equation, we have $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1$, hence $f(f(1))=1$.
Since $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can find $f(1)$ by setting $n=\frac{1}{2}$, but $\frac{1}{2}$ is not a positive integer, so we need to find another way.
If we substitute $n=1$ into the second equation, we get $f(2)=2f(1)+1$.
Substituting $f(1)=1$ into this equation, we get $f(2)=2(1)+1=3$.
Now, substituting $n=2$ into the second equation, we get $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2(3)+1=7$.
Substituting $n=4$ into the first equation, we get $f(f(f(4)))=8(4)-7=25$, hence $f(f(7))=25$.
Substituting $f(7)=25$ into the second equation with $n=\frac{7}{2}$, we get $f(14)=2f(7)+1=2(25)+1=51$.
Substituting $n=14$ into the first equation, we get $f(f(f(14)))=8(14)-7=109$, hence $f(f(51))=109$.
Since $f(f(1))=1$, we have $f(1)=51$.
Finally, substituting $n=100$ into the second equation, we get $f(200)=2f(100)+1$.
Substituting $f(100)$ into this equation, we get $f(200)=2f(100)+1$.
But we also know that $f(200)=f(f(f(100)))$ from the first equation.
Therefore, $f(f(f(100)))=2f(100)+1$.
Substituting $f(100)$ into this equation, we get $f(f(f(100)))=2f(100)+1$.
But we also know that $f(f(f(100)))=8(100)-7=793$.
Therefore, we have $793=2f(100)+1$.
Solving this equation for $f(100)$, we get $f(100)=\frac{793-1}{2}=396$.
Therefore, $f(100)=396$. The value of $f(100)$ is 396.
The answer is: $396$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find $f(100)$, we first need to find a pattern in the function $f$. 

We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. 

Let's try to find $f(f(n))$ by setting $n = f(n)$ in the equation:
$$f(f(f(f(n)))) = f(f(f(n))) = 8f(n) - 7.$$

From the second given condition, we know that $f(f(f(n)))=f(2f(n)+1)$. 

Setting these two equal to each other gives us:
$$8f(n) - 7 = f(2f(n)+1).$$

Now let's try to find $f(n)$. 

For $n = 1$, we have $f(f(f(1))) = 8(1) - 7 = -1$.
From the second condition, $f(f(2)) = 2f(1) + 1 = 3$.
Now we have $f(f(1)) = 3$.
Using the second condition again, $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 3$.
And finally, $f(1) = 1$.

Now we can try to find $f(100)$ using the second given condition:
$$f(200) = 2f(100) + 1.$$

Again using the second condition, we can find $f(200)$:
$$f(f(201)) = 8(100) - 7 = 793.$$
And from the first condition, we have $f(f(f(201))) = f(201) = 793$.
So $f(201) = 793$.

Substituting this into the equation $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$, we get:
$$793 = 2f(100) + 1.$$

Solving for $f(100)$ gives:
$$f(100) = \frac{793 - 1}{2} = \frac{792}{2} = 396.$$
So $f(100) = 396$.

The value of $f(100)$ is 396. The answer is: $396$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



We are given that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We want to find $f(100)$.

Let's try to find a pattern by calculating the first few values of $f(n)$ using the given equations.

For $n=1$, we have $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1$. So $f(f(1))=1$ implies $f(1)=1$ since $f(f(1))=f(1)$.

Now, for $n=2$, we have $f(f(f(2)))=8(2)-7=9$. Also, $f(2f(1))=f(2)=2f(1)+1=2(1)+1=3$. So we get $f(f(3))=9$. Since $f(f(3))=f(3)$, we have $f(3)=9$.

Continuing this process, we can find $f(4)=5$, $f(5)=7$, $f(6)=3$, $f(7)=11$, $f(8)=9$, $f(9)=15$, and so on.

We observe that $f(n)$ seems to be an odd number for all odd $n$ and an even number for all even $n$. Also, we notice that $f(f(n))$ is either $1$ or $9$ for all $n$.

Now, let's try to find $f(100)$. We have $f(100)=2f(50)+1$. Again, using the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can find $f(50)=2f(25)+1$. Continuing this process, we get:

\[f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2(2f(25) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(2f(12.5)+1) + 1) + 1.\]

Since $n$ must be a positive integer, we cannot proceed further with this method. However, we notice that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ is similar to the equation of a cubic function. Let's assume that $f(n)=an^3+bn^2+cn+d$. Substituting $n=1$ into the equation, we get $a+b+c+d=1$. Similarly, substituting $n=2$, we get $8a+4b+2c+d=9$.

We can solve this system of linear equations to find the values of $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$. After solving, we get $a=1/2$, $b=-1/2$, $c=2$, and $d=0$. So, $f(n)=\frac{n^3}{2}-\frac{n^2}{2}+2n$.

Now, we can find $f(100)=\frac{100^3}{2}-\frac{100^2}{2}+2(100)=500000-5000+200=495200$. However, this value does not match any of the values we found using the given equations. This suggests that our assumption of the form of $f(n)$ is incorrect.

Let's try a different approach. We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. If we substitute $f(n)$ with $8n-7$, we get:

\[f(f(8n-7))=8n-7.\]

Let's set $x=8n-7$. Then, we have $f(f(x))=x$. This implies that $f$ is the function that sends a number to its square root (since the square root of a number $x$ is the value that when squared gives $x$). Therefore, $f(n)=\sqrt{n}$.

Now, we can find $f(100)=\sqrt{100}=10$. However, this value also does not match any of the values we found using the given equations. This suggests that our assumption of the form of $f(n)$ is incorrect again.

Let's reconsider the given equations. The first equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ implies that $f$ is a cubic function, and the second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ implies that $f$ is an odd function. Combining these two properties, we can conclude that $f(n)=n^3$ for odd $n$ and $f(n)=n^3-1$ for even $n$.

Now, let's find $f(100)$. Since $100$ is even, we have $f(100)=(100)^3-1=1000000-1=999999$.

However, this value also does not match any of the values we found using the given equations. This suggests that our conclusion about the form of $f(n)$ is incorrect again.

Let's reconsider the given equations again. The first equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ implies that $f$ is a cubic function, and the second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ implies that $f$ is an odd function. Combining these two properties, we can conclude that $f(n)=n^3$ for odd $n$ and $f(n)=n^3-1$ for even $n$.

Now, let's find $f(100)$. Since $100$ is even, we have $f(100)=(100)^3-1=1000000-1=999999$.

However, this value also does not match any of the values we found using the given equations. This suggests that our conclusion about the form of $f(n)$ is incorrect again.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we try to find $f(1)$.
Setting $n=1$ in the second equation, we have $f(2)=2f(1)+1$.
Then setting $n=2$ in the second equation, we have $f(4)=2f(2)+1$.
And setting $n=4$ in the second equation, we have $f(8)=2f(4)+1$.
And setting $n=8$ in the first equation, we have $f(f(f(8)))=8(8)-7=51$.
Since $f(f(f(8)))=f(f(2f(4)+1))=f(f(2f(2)+1))=f(f(4f(1)+1))$,
so we have $f(f(4f(1)+1))=51$.
Let $f(1)=x$, then we have $f(f(4x+1))=51$.
Setting $n=4x+1$ in the first equation, we have $f(f(f(4x+1)))=8(4x+1)-7=32x+1$.
So we have $f(f(4x+1))=32x+1$.
Substituting $f(f(4x+1))=51$ into the equation, we get $51=32x+1$,
which gives $32x=50$, and $x=\frac{50}{32}=\frac{25}{16}$.
But $f(1)$ must be a positive integer, so we must have made a mistake.
Let's try another approach.
Notice that the second equation is linear, so we can try to find a fixed point.
A fixed point is a number $x$ such that $f(x)=x$.
Setting $n=x$ in the second equation, we have $f(2x)=2f(x)+1$.
Since $f(x)=x$, we have $f(2x)=2x+1$.
Setting $n=2x$ in the first equation, we have $f(f(f(2x)))=8(2x)-7=16x-7$.
So we have $f(f(2x+1))=16x-7$.
Substituting $f(2x+1)=2x+1$ into the equation, we get $f(2x+1)=16x-7$.
This equation is true only when $2x+1=16x-7$, which gives $14x=8$, and $x=\frac{4}{7}$.
Again, $f(1)$ must be a positive integer, so this approach doesn't work either.
However, we notice that the function $f$ satisfies a recursive relation.
From $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we can say that $f(f(n))$ is the preimage of $8n-7$ under $f$.
And from $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can say that $f(2n)$ is the image of $f(n)$ under the transformation $x \to 2x+1$.
So we can try to find the image of 1 under successive applications of the transformation $x \to 2x+1$.
Applying the transformation once, we get $1 \to 2(1)+1=3$.
Applying the transformation twice, we get $3 \to 2(3)+1=7$.
Applying the transformation three times, we get $7 \to 2(7)+1=15$.
Applying the transformation four times, we get $15 \to 2(15)+1=31$.
Applying the transformation five times, we get $31 \to 2(31)+1=63$.
Applying the transformation six times, we get $63 \to 2(63)+1=127$.
Applying the transformation seven times, we get $127 \to 2(127)+1=255$.
And applying the transformation eight times, we get $255 \to 2(255)+1=511$.
We notice that the numbers are getting larger very quickly.
However, we know that the range of $f$ is $\mathbb N$, so there must be some pattern here.
Let's try to find the preimage of 1 under successive applications of the transformation $x \to 2x+1$.
Applying the inverse transformation $x \to \frac{x-1}{2}$, we get $1 \to \frac{1-1}{2}=0$.
But $0$ is not in the domain of $f$, so we must have made a mistake.
Let's try another approach.
We notice that the transformation $x \to 2x+1$ is the same as the transformation $x \to 2x$ followed by the transformation $x \to x+1$.
So we can try to find the preimage of 1 under successive applications of the transformations $x \to 2x$ and $x \to x+1$.
Applying the transformation $x \to 2x$, we get $1 \to 2(1)=2$.
Applying the transformation $x \to x+1$ to 2, we get $2 \to 2+1=3$.
Applying the transformation $x \to 2x$ to 3, we get $3 \to 2(3)=6$.
Applying the transformation $x \to x+1$ to 6, we get $6 \to 6+1=7$.
Applying the transformation $x \to 2x$ to 7, we get $7 \to 2(7)=14$.
Applying the transformation $x \to x+1$ to 14, we get $14 \to 14+1=15$.
Applying the transformation $x \to 2x$ to 15, we get $15 \to 2(15)=30$.
Applying the transformation $x \to x+1$ to 30, we get $30 \to 30+1=31$.
And so on.
We notice that the numbers are getting larger in a pattern.
We can see that the numbers are getting larger by a factor of 2 after each application of the transformation $x \to 2x$.
And the numbers are getting larger by 1 after each application of the transformation $x \to x+1$.
So we can conjecture that the preimage of 1 under successive applications of the transformation $x \to 2x+1$ is $1$.
And we can also conjecture that the image of 1 under successive applications of the transformation $x \to 2x+1$ is $2^n+1$ for some positive integer $n$.
To find the value of $n$, we need to find the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $2^n+1=f(1)$.
From $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we know that $f(f

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, let's apply the second condition to $n = 1$. We get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. Now let's apply the second condition again to $f(1)$. We get $f(f(1)) = 2f(1) + 1$. Then, using the first condition, we have $f(f(f(1))) = 8(1) - 7 = -1$. So we have $f(f(1)) = -1$. But from the equation $f(f(1)) = 2f(1) + 1$, we can substitute $-1$ to get $-1 = 2f(1) + 1$, which simplifies to $f(1) = -1$. But $f(1)$ cannot be negative, so we must have made a mistake somewhere.

Let's go back and re-examine the problem. The equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ suggests that $f(n)$ is some kind of linear function of $n$. Let's try to find the form of $f(n)$.

From the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, if we let $n = f(1)$, we get $f(2f(1)) = 2f(f(1)) + 1$, or $f(2(-1)) = 2f(-1) + 1$, or $f(-2) = 2f(-1) + 1$. But we know that $f(-2)$ must be a positive integer, so this seems unlikely.

Let's try another approach. If we let $n = 1$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we get $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7$, or $f(f(1)) = 1$. From $f(f(1)) = 2f(1) + 1$, we can substitute $1$ to get $1 = 2f(1) + 1$, which gives $f(1) = 0$. But $f(1)$ cannot be zero either.

Let's try another approach. If we let $n = 2$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we get $f(f(f(2)))=8(2)-7$, or $f(f(f(2))) = 9$. But from the second condition, $f(f(2)) = 2f(2) + 1$. So if we let $n = f(2)$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we get $f(f(f(f(2)))) = 8f(2) - 7$, or $f(9) = 8f(2) - 7$. But we know that $f(9) = 9$, so $9 = 8f(2) - 7$, or $f(2) = 1$. Then from the second condition, $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 3$, $f(8) = 2f(4) + 1 = 7$, $f(16) = 2f(8) + 1 = 15$, and so on. It seems that $f(2^n) = 2^n - 1$ for all positive integers $n$.

To confirm this, let's check if this function satisfies both conditions. If $f(n) = 2^n - 1$, then $f(f(f(n))) = f(2^n - 1) = 2^{2^n - 1} - 1$. And $8n - 7 = 2^3n - 1 = 8n - 1 - 1 = 8n - 2$. So $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 2$, but we know $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, so this doesn't work.

But if we look again, we see that we made a mistake. We assumed that $f(n) = 2^n - 1$ would work, but we didn't check if it satisfies the first condition. If we let $n = 2$ in the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we get $f(f(f(2)))=8(2)-7$, or $f(f(3)) = 9$. But if $f(n) = 2^n - 1$, then $f(3) = 7$, so $f(f(3)) = f(7) = 2^7 - 1 = 127$. And if $n = 3$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we get $f(f(f(3)))=8(3)-7$, or $f(f(7)) = 17$. But if $f(n) = 2^n - 1$, then $f(7) = 127$, so $f(f(7)) = f(127)$, which is much larger than $17$. So $f(n) = 2^n - 1$ doesn't work.

Let's try another approach. If we let $n = 1$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we get $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7$, or $f(f(1)) = 1$. From the second condition, $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 3$. Then from the second condition, $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 7$, $f(8) = 2f(4) + 1 = 15$, and so on. It seems that $f(2^n) = 2^{n+1} - 3$ for all positive integers $n$.

To confirm this, let's check if this function satisfies both conditions. If $f(n) = 2^{n+1} - 3$, then $f(f(f(n))) = f(2^{n+1} - 3) = 2^{2^{n+1} - 3 + 1} - 3 = 2^{2^{n+1} - 2} - 3$. And $8n - 7 = 2^3n - 1 = 8n - 1 - 1 = 8n - 2$. So $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 2$, which matches the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$.

Now let's check the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. If $f(n) = 2^{n+1} - 3$, then $f(2n

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we try to find $f(1)$. By setting $n=1$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we have $f(f(f(1)))=8 \cdot 1 - 7 = 1$, so $f(f(f(1)))=1$. Since $f(f(f(1)))$ is equal to $1$, and $f(1)$ is an input to $f$ in the equation $f(f(f(1)))=1$, it must be the case that $f(1)=1$.

Next, we try to find $f(2)$. By substituting $n=2$ into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we have $f(4)=2f(2)+1$. But we also know from the first equation that $f(f(f(2)))=8 \cdot 2 - 7 = 9$, and since $f(f(f(2)))$ is equal to $9$, it must be the case that $f(2)=3$. Then we can substitute $f(2)=3$ into the equation $f(4)=2f(2)+1$ to find $f(4)=2 \cdot 3 + 1 = 7$.

We continue this process to find $f(3)$. Substituting $n=3$ into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we have $f(6)=2f(3)+1$. But we also know from the first equation that $f(f(f(3)))=8 \cdot 3 - 7 = 17$, and since $f(f(f(3)))$ is equal to $17$, it must be the case that $f(3)=5$. Then we can substitute $f(3)=5$ into the equation $f(6)=2f(3)+1$ to find $f(6)=2 \cdot 5 + 1 = 11$.

We can continue this process to find $f(4)$, $f(5)$, and so on. We find that $f(4)=7$, $f(5)=9$, $f(6)=11$, $f(7)=13$, $f(8)=15$, $f(9)=17$, $f(10)=19$, $f(11)=21$, $f(12)=23$, $f(13)=25$, $f(14)=27$, $f(15)=29$, $f(16)=31$, $f(17)=33$, $f(18)=35$, $f(19)=37$, $f(20)=39$, $f(21)=41$, $f(22)=43$, $f(23)=45$, $f(24)=47$, $f(25)=49$, $f(26)=51$, $f(27)=53$, $f(28)=55$, $f(29)=57$, $f(30)=59$, $f(31)=61$, $f(32)=63$, $f(33)=65$, $f(34)=67$, $f(35)=69$, $f(36)=71$, $f(37)=73$, $f(38)=75$, $f(39)=77$, $f(40)=79$, $f(41)=81$, $f(42)=83$, $f(43)=85$, $f(44)=87$, $f(45)=89$, $f(46)=91$, $f(47)=93$, $f(48)=95$, $f(49)=97$, $f(50)=99$, $f(51)=101$, $f(52)=103$, $f(53)=105$, $f(54)=107$, $f(55)=109$, $f(56)=111$, $f(57)=113$, $f(58)=115$, $f(59)=117$, $f(60)=119$, $f(61)=121$, $f(62)=123$, $f(63)=125$, $f(64)=127$, $f(65)=129$, $f(66)=131$, $f(67)=133$, $f(68)=135$, $f(69)=137$, $f(70)=139$, $f(71)=141$, $f(72)=143$, $f(73)=145$, $f(74)=147$, $f(75)=149$, $f(76)=151$, $f(77)=153$, $f(78)=155$, $f(79)=157$, $f(80)=159$, $f(81)=161$, $f(82)=163$, $f(83)=165$, $f(84)=167$, $f(85)=169$, $f(86)=171$, $f(87)=173$, $f(88)=175$, $f(89)=177$, $f(90)=179$, $f(91)=181$, $f(92)=183$, $f(93)=185$, $f(94)=187$, $f(95)=189$, $f(96)=191$, $f(97)=193$, $f(98)=195$, $f(99)=197$, and $f(100)=199$.

Therefore, $f(100)=199$.
The answer is: $199$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's use the second condition to find $f(100)$: we know that $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. So if we let $n = 50$, we get $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.

Now we need to find $f(50)$. We can use the second condition again, letting $n = 25$: $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.

Continuing this process, we find $f(25) = 2f(12.5)$, but since $12.5$ is not an integer, we can't use the second condition directly. However, we can use the first condition to help us. If we let $n = 13$ in the first condition, we get $f(f(f(13))) = 8*13 - 7 = 92$. But we know $f(f(f(13))) = f(f(8*13 - 7)) = f(f(92))$. And from the first condition, we can also write $f(f(92)) = 92$. So we have $f(f(92)) = 92$.

Now we can substitute $n = 92$ into the second condition to get $f(184) = 2f(92) + 1 = 2*92 + 1 = 185$.

Since $f(184) = 185$, and we know that $f(184) = f(2*92) = 2f(92) + 1$, we can set up the equation $2f(92) + 1 = 185$ and solve for $f(92)$: $2f(92) = 184$, so $f(92) = 92$.

Now we can substitute $n = 50$ into the second condition to get $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2(2f(25) + 1) + 1 = 4f(25) + 3$.

Again, we can substitute $n = 25$ into the second condition to get $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$. So we can substitute this into our equation for $f(100)$ to get $f(100) = 4f(25) + 3 = 4(2f(12.5)) + 3$.

But we know from the first condition that $f(f(f(13))) = 92$, so $f(f(13)) = 92$. Since $f(f(13)) = 2f(13) + 1$, we can set up the equation $2f(13) + 1 = 92$ and solve for $f(13)$: $2f(13) = 91$, so $f(13) = 45.5$, which is not an integer.

This means we must have made a mistake somewhere. Let's go back and check our work.

We found that $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$. If we substitute this into the equation for $f(100)$, we get $f(100) = 4f(25) + 3$.

Now, let's substitute $n = 25$ into the second condition to get $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$. We can substitute this into our equation for $f(100)$ to get $f(100) = 4(2f(12.5)) + 3 = 8f(12.5) + 3$.

Again, we know from the first condition that $f(f(f(13))) = 92$, so $f(f(13)) = 92$. Since $f(f(13)) = 2f(13) + 1$, we can set up the equation $2f(13) + 1 = 92$ and solve for $f(13)$: $2f(13) = 91$, so $f(13) = 45.5$, which is not an integer.

This means we must have made a mistake somewhere. Let's go back and check our work.

After examining our work, we realize that we made an error when we substituted $n = 13$ into the first condition to get $f(f(f(13))) = 92$. This is incorrect because $f(f(f(13))) = f(f(8*13 - 7)) = f(f(91))$, not $f(f(92))$. We made a mistake in our calculation of $f(91)$.

Let's correct this: if we let $n = 91$ in the first condition, we get $f(f(f(91))) = 8*91 - 7 = 726$. So we have $f(f(91)) = 726$.

Since $f(f(91)) = 726$, and we know that $f(f(91)) = 2f(91) + 1$, we can set up the equation $2f(91) + 1 = 726$ and solve for $f(91)$: $2f(91) = 725$, so $f(91) = 362.5$, which is not an integer.

This means we must have made a mistake somewhere. Let's go back and check our work.

After examining our work, we realize that we made an error when we substituted $n = 91$ into the first condition to get $f(f(f(91))) = 726$. This is incorrect because $f(f(f(91))) = f(f(8*91 - 7)) = f(f(726))$, not $f(f(91))$. We made a mistake in our calculation of $f(726)$.

Let's correct this: if we let $n = 726$ in the first condition, we get $f(f(f(726))) = 8*726 - 7 = 5803$. So we have $f(f(726)) = 5803$.

Since $f(f(726)) = 5803$, and we know that $f(f(726)) = 2f(726) + 1$, we can set up the equation $2f(726) + 1 = 5803$ and solve for $f(726)$: $

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, let's try to find $f(1)$. From the second equation, we have $f(2)=2f(1)+1$. Then, from the first equation, we have $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1$. Since $f(f(f(1)))=1$, we must have $f(1)=1$.

Now, let's find $f(2)$. From the second equation, we have $f(4)=2f(2)+1$. From the first equation, we have $f(f(f(2)))=8(2)-7=9$. Since $f(f(f(2)))=9$, we must have $f(f(2))=3$. Using the second equation again, we have $f(2)=3$.

Now, we can substitute $f(2)=3$ into the second equation to find $f(4)$: $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2(3)+1=7$.

Continuing this process, we can find $f(8)$, $f(16)$, and so on. We find that $f(8)=15$, $f(16)=31$, and so on. In general, we find that $f(2^k)=2^{k+2}-1$.

Now, we can find $f(100)$. Since $100=2^2\cdot 5^2$, we can write $100$ as a product of powers of 2 and 5. We can express 100 as $2^2 \cdot 5^2 = (2^2)^1 \cdot (5^2)^1$. We know that $f(2^k)=2^{k+2}-1$, so $f(2^2)=2^{2+2}-1=15$. Similarly, we can find that $f(5^2)=2^{2+2}-1=15$.

Using the second equation, we have $f(100)=f((2^2)(5^2))=f(2^2 \cdot 5^2)=2f(10)=2(15)=30$.

Therefore, $f(100)=30$. The answer is: $30$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



Let's start by evaluating the function for a simple input, like $n = 1$.
Using the second condition, we have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.
Now, we can substitute $f(f(f(1))) = f(0) = 8(1) - 7 = 1$.
So, we have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 1$, which implies $f(1) = 0$.

Now, let's find $f(100)$.
Using the second condition, we have $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$.
And using the function definition, we have $f(f(f(100))) = 8(100) - 7 = 793$.
Since we know $f(1) = 0$, we can substitute this into the equation to get $f(f(f(100))) = f(f(0)) = f(1) = 0$.
Thus, we have $793 = 0$, which is a contradiction.

Let's try a different approach.
We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$.
If we set $n = 1$, we get $f(f(f(1))) = 8(1) - 7 = 1$.
So, we have $f(1) = 1$.
Now, let's find $f(2)$.
Using the second condition, we have $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$.
But we also know that $f(f(f(2))) = 8(2) - 7 = 9$.
And since we know $f(1) = 1$, we can substitute this into the equation to get $f(f(f(2))) = f(f(1)) = f(1) = 1$.
Thus, we have $9 = 1$, which is a contradiction.

Let's try another approach.
We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$.
If we set $n = 2$, we get $f(f(f(2))) = 8(2) - 7 = 9$.
So, we have $f(f(2)) = 9$.
Now, let's find $f(4)$.
Using the second condition, we have $f(8) = 2f(4) + 1$.
But we also know that $f(f(f(4))) = 8(4) - 7 = 25$.
And since we know $f(f(2)) = 9$, we can substitute this into the equation to get $f(f(f(4))) = f(f(2)) = 9$.
Thus, we have $25 = 9$, which is a contradiction.

Finally, let's try the most direct approach.
We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$.
If we set $n = 100$, we get $f(f(f(100))) = 8(100) - 7 = 793$.
So, we have $f(f(f(100))) = 793$.
Now, let's find $f(f(100))$.
Using the second condition, we have $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$.
And since we know $f(f(f(100))) = 793$, we can substitute this into the equation to get $793 = 2f(100) + 1$.
Thus, we have $f(100) = \frac{793 - 1}{2} = 396$.

So, the value of $f(100)$ is $396$.
The answer is: $396$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



To find the value of $f(100)$, we need to use the given functional equations.

First, we can try to find the value of $f(1)$ using the second equation: $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.

But we also know from the first equation that $f(f(f(1))) = 8(1) - 7 = 1$.

So, if $f(1) = x$, then we have $f(f(f(1))) = f(x) = 1$. That means $f(x) = 1$ is a fixed point of the function $f$.

Now, let's try to find the value of $f(2)$ using the second equation: $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$.

But we also know from the first equation that $f(f(f(2))) = 8(2) - 7 = 9$.

So, if $f(2) = y$, then we have $f(f(f(2))) = f(y) = 9$. That means $f(y) = 9$ is another fixed point of the function $f$.

Now, let's try to find the value of $f(3)$ using the second equation: $f(6) = 2f(3) + 1$.

But we also know from the first equation that $f(f(f(3))) = 8(3) - 7 = 19$.

So, if $f(3) = z$, then we have $f(f(f(3))) = f(z) = 19$. That means $f(z) = 19$ is another fixed point of the function $f$.

We can see that the function $f$ has three fixed points: $f(1) = 1$, $f(2) = y$, and $f(3) = z$.

Now, let's try to find the value of $y$ and $z$ by substituting $n = 1$, $n = 2$, and $n = 3$ into the second equation:

For $n = 1$, we have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2(1) + 1 = 3$. So, $y = 3$.

For $n = 2$, we have $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2(3) + 1 = 7$.

For $n = 3$, we have $f(6) = 2f(3) + 1 = 2z + 1$.

But we know from the first equation that $f(f(f(3))) = f(z) = 19$. So, $f(6) = 19$. Therefore, $2z + 1 = 19$, which implies $2z = 18$, and hence $z = 9$. So, $f(3) = 9$.

Now we have found all three fixed points: $f(1) = 1$, $f(2) = 3$, and $f(3) = 9$.

Now, let's try to find the value of $f(100)$. We know that $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. If we can express $100$ as a multiple of $2$, then we can use this equation repeatedly to find $f(100)$.

Since $100 = 2 \cdot 50$, we can write $f(100) = f(2 \cdot 50) = 2f(50) + 1$.

Similarly, since $50 = 2 \cdot 25$, we can write $f(50) = f(2 \cdot 25) = 2f(25) + 1$.

Continuing in this way, we find that $f(100) = 2(2(2f(12.5) + 1) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(2(2f(6.25) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1$.

Since $6.25$ is not an integer, we cannot continue this process. However, we notice that $6.25 = 5/2$, and we know that $f(1) = 1$. So, we can substitute $n = 1/2$ into the second equation to find $f(1) = 2f(1/2) + 1$. Therefore, $1 = 2f(1/2) + 1$, which implies $f(1/2) = 0$.

Now we can substitute $n = 1/2$ into the first equation to find $f(f(f(1/2))) = f(0) = 8(1/2) - 7 = -5$. But this is a contradiction, because the function $f$ only maps from $\mathbb N$ to $\mathbb N$. This means that our assumption that $f(1/2)$ exists is incorrect.

However, we can make a reasonable assumption: since $f(1) = 1$, we can assume that $f(2) = 3$, $f(3) = 9$, and so on. So, we can assume that $f(n) = n$ for all positive integers $n$.

Now, let's check if this assumption satisfies the first equation: $f(f(f(n))) = f(f(n)) = f(n) = n$. So, $f(f(f(n))) = n = 8n - 7$ for all positive integers $n$. This implies that $7n = 7$ for all positive integers $n$, which is not true.

So, our assumption is incorrect. However, we can make another reasonable assumption: since $f(1) = 1$, we can assume that $f(2) = 3$, $f(3) = 9$, and so on. So, we can assume that $f(n) = n^3$ for all positive integers $n$.

Now, let's check if this assumption satisfies the first equation: $f(f(f(n))) = f(f(n^3)) = f((n^3)^3) = f(n^9) = (n^9)^3 = n^27$. So, $f(f(f(n))) = n^27 = 8n - 7$ for all positive integers $n$. This is not true for all positive integers $n$.

So, our assumption is also incorrect. However, we can make a final reasonable assumption: since $f(1) = 1$, we can assume that $f(2) = 3$, $f(3) = 9$, and so on. So, we can assume that $f(n) = n^3 -

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We first note that $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1$. The only positive integer $n$ such that $f(n) = 1$ is $n = 1$, thus $f(1) = 1$.
Using the second condition, we have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2(1) + 1 = 3$.
Again using the second condition, we have $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2(3) + 1 = 7$.
Using the first condition, we have $f(f(f(4))) = f(f(7)) = 8(4) - 7 = 25$.
And since $f(f(7)) = 25$, we have $f(7) = 25$.
Again using the second condition, we have $f(14) = 2f(7) + 1 = 2(25) + 1 = 51$.
Using the first condition, we have $f(f(f(14))) = f(f(51)) = 8(14) - 7 = 107$.
And since $f(f(51)) = 107$, we have $f(51) = 107$.
Continuing this process, we can find that $f(100) = 199$. The answer is: $199$

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We start by evaluating $f(100)$ using the second given equation. Since $100=50\times 2$, we have
\[f(100) = 2f(50) + 1.\]

We then apply the second equation again to find $f(50)$: since $50 = 25 \times 2$, we have
\[f(50) = 2f(25) + 1.\]

Applying the second equation one more time, we find $f(25)$: since $25 = \frac{25}{2} \times 2 + \frac{1}{2}$, we have
\[f(25) = 2f\left(\frac{25}{2}\right) + 1.\]

At this point, we notice that $\frac{25}{2} = 12.5$, which is not an integer. This means we must have hit a boundary where the first equation comes into play. Indeed, we have
\[f(25) = 8\times 25 - 7 = 193.\]

Substituting this back into our previous equation, we have
\[f(50) = 2\times 193 + 1 = 387.\]

Substituting this back into our previous equation, we have
\[f(100) = 2\times 387 + 1 = 775.\]

So $f(100) = 775$. The answer is: 775

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, we need to find the value of $f(1)$.
Since $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1$, we have $f(f(1))=1$ and $f(1)=1$.
Then, using $f(2(1))=2f(1)+1$, we have $f(2)=2(1)+1=3$.
Using $f(f(f(2)))=8(2)-7=9$, we have $f(f(3))=9$ and $f(3)=9$.
Using $f(2(3))=2f(3)+1$, we have $f(6)=2(9)+1=19$.
Using $f(f(f(6)))=8(6)-7=41$, we have $f(f(19))=41$ and $f(19)=41$.
Using $f(2(19))=2f(19)+1$, we have $f(38)=2(41)+1=83$.
Using $f(f(f(38)))=8(38)-7=301$, we have $f(f(83))=301$ and $f(83)=301$.
Using $f(2(83))=2f(83)+1$, we have $f(166)=2(301)+1=603$.
Using $f(f(f(166)))=8(166)-7=1317$, we have $f(f(603))=1317$ and $f(603)=1317$.
Using $f(2(603))=2f(603)+1$, we have $f(1206)=2(1317)+1=2635$.
We notice a pattern here that $f(n)$ seems to be increasing very quickly.
In fact, we can conjecture that $f(n) = 2n - 1$ for all positive integers $n$.
To prove this, we can use induction.
Base case: $f(1) = 1$, which is true.
Inductive step: Assume $f(n) = 2n - 1$ for some positive integer $n$.
Then, $f(f(n)) = f(2n - 1) = 2(2n - 1) - 1 = 4n - 3$.
And, $f(f(f(n))) = f(4n - 3) = 2(4n - 3) - 1 = 8n - 7$, which matches the first equation.
Similarly, $f(2n) = f(2(2n - 1)) = 2f(2n - 1) + 1 = 2(4n - 3) + 1 = 8n - 5$.
And $f(f(f(2n))) = f(8n - 5) = 2(8n - 5) - 1 = 16n - 11$, which does not match the second equation.
However, we made a mistake in calculating $f(2n)$.
The correct calculation should be $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$.
So, $f(2(2n - 1)) = 2f(2n - 1) + 1 = 2(2(2n - 1) - 1) + 1 = 2(4n - 3) + 1 = 8n - 5$.
Now, we can check the second equation: $f(2n) = 8n - 5$, which matches the given equation.
Therefore, our conjecture $f(n) = 2n - 1$ is correct for all positive integers $n$.
In particular, $f(100) = 2(100) - 1 = 199$.
The value of $f(100)$ is 199. The answer is: $\boxed{199}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



To find $f(100)$, we can use the second equation of the function $f$. We know that $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. Let's try to find $f(100)$ by breaking it down into smaller steps.

We know that $100 = 2 \cdot 50$, so we can apply the second equation to find $f(100)$:
\[f(100) = 2f(50) + 1.\]
To find $f(50)$, we can apply the same logic: $50 = 2 \cdot 25$, so
\[f(50) = 2f(25) + 1.\]
To find $f(25)$, we can apply the logic again: $25 = 2 \cdot 12 + 1$, so
\[f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1.\]
But $12.5$ is not a natural number, so we cannot continue this process indefinitely.

However, we notice that the function $f$ satisfies the first equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. Let's set $n = 1$ to find $f(f(f(1)))$:
\[f(f(f(1))) = 8 \cdot 1 - 7 = -1.\]
But the function $f$ maps natural numbers to natural numbers, and a negative number cannot be a natural number. This implies that our function $f$ must be different from the one defined in the problem.

However, if we go back and re-examine the problem, we notice that the function $f$ is defined differently for even and odd numbers. The second equation only applies when $n$ is even, and the first equation applies for all $n$. So let's try to apply the first equation instead.

We know that $f(f(f(100))) = 8 \cdot 100 - 7 = 793$. Now we can apply the first equation repeatedly to find $f(100)$:
\[f(100) = f(f(f(100)))/8 + 7/8 = 793/8 + 7/8 = 800/8 = 100.\]
However, this result contradicts our previous work using the second equation. It seems we have made a mistake in our reasoning.

Let's try to re-examine the problem and look for a different approach.

Notice that in the first equation, $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, if we set $n = 1$, we get $f(f(f(1))) = -1$, which is not a natural number. This indicates that our initial approach of trying to find $f(100)$ by repeatedly applying the second equation might not be correct.

Let's try another approach: since $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, we can see that $f(n)$ is always an odd number when $n$ is even. So let's try to set $n = 50$ in the first equation:
\[f(f(f(50))) = 8 \cdot 50 - 7 = 393.\]
Since $50$ is even, $f(50)$ must be odd. Let's try to guess that $f(50) = 1$. If $f(50) = 1$, then
\[f(f(f(50))) = f(f(1)) = 8 \cdot 1 - 7 = 1.\]
This result is consistent with our guess that $f(50) = 1$. Now let's verify this guess by checking if $f(1)$ satisfies the first equation:
\[f(f(f(1))) = f(f(1)) = 8 \cdot 1 - 7 = 1.\]
Since $f(1)$ satisfies the first equation, our guess that $f(50) = 1$ is correct.

Now we can use the second equation to find $f(100)$:
\[f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2 \cdot 1 + 1 = 3.\]
But this result contradicts our previous work using the first equation, which gave us $f(100) = 100$. It seems we have made a mistake in our reasoning.

Let's try one more approach. We know that $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, and since $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, we can substitute $2n$ for $n$ in the first equation to get:
\[f(f(f(2n))) = 8 \cdot 2n - 7 = 16n - 7.\]
Now let's substitute $2n$ for $n$ in the second equation:
\[f(2 \cdot 2n) = 2f(2n) + 1 \Rightarrow f(4n) = 2(2f(n) + 1) + 1 = 4f(n) + 3.\]
We can now set $n = 50$ in the equation $f(f(f(2n))) = 16n - 7$:
\[f(f(f(100))) = 16 \cdot 50 - 7 = 793.\]
Now we can use the first equation to find $f(100)$:
\[f(100) = f(f(f(100)))/8 + 7/8 = 793/8 + 7/8 = 800/8 = 100.\]
This result is consistent with our previous work using the second equation, which gave us $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2 \cdot 1 + 1 = 3$. It seems our previous work had a mistake in our reasoning.

Finally, let's try another approach. We know that $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, and since $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, we can substitute $2n$ for $n$ in the first equation to get:
\[f(f(f(2n))) = 8 \cdot 2n - 7 = 16n - 7.\]
Now let's substitute $2n$ for $n$ in the second equation:
\[f(2 \cdot 2n) = 2f(2n) + 1 \Rightarrow f(4n) = 2(2f(n) + 1) + 1 = 4f(n) + 3.\]
We can now set $n = 50$ in the equation $f(f(f(2n))) = 16n - 7$:

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


Let's solve the problem step by step.

First, we substitute $n=1$ into the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we get $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$. Since $f(1)$ is also a positive integer, we know that $f(1)$ must be a fixed point of the function $f$, which means $f(f(1))=f(1)$ and $f(f(f(1)))=f(f(1))=f(1)$. Therefore, we have $f(1)=1$.

Then, we substitute $n=1$ into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we get $f(2)=2f(1)+1=2*1+1=3$.

Next, we substitute $n=2$ into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we get $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2*3+1=7$.

Similarly, we substitute $n=4$ into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we get $f(8)=2f(4)+1=2*7+1=15$.

Continuing this process, we can find that $f(16)=31$, $f(32)=63$, and $f(64)=127$.

We can see a pattern here. It seems that $f(2^k)=2^k-1$ for all positive integers $k$. We can prove this by induction.

Base case: For $k=1$, we have already proved that $f(2)=3=2^1-1$.

Inductive step: Assume that $f(2^k)=2^k-1$ for some positive integer $k$. We want to prove that $f(2^{k+1})=2^{k+1}-1$.

By the given equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we have $f(2^{k+1})=2f(2^k)+1$. By the induction hypothesis, this becomes $f(2^{k+1})=2(2^k-1)+1=2^{k+1}-1$. This completes the inductive step.

So, by induction, we have proved that $f(2^k)=2^k-1$ for all positive integers $k$.

Now, we can calculate $f(100)$. Since $100=2^2*5^2$, we can use the property $f(mn)=f(m)f(n)$ for all positive integers $m$ and $n$. Then $f(100)=f(2^2*5^2)=f(2^2)f(5^2)$.

By the formula we proved, we have $f(2^2)=2^2-1=3$ and $f(5^2)=5^2-1=24$. Therefore, $f(100)=f(2^2)f(5^2)=3*24=72$.

However, this result does not satisfy the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. We must have made an error in our calculations. Let's try to find the mistake.

After a careful check, we find that our inductive proof is incorrect. The error lies in the inductive step. The equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ does not imply that $f(2^{k+1})=2f(2^k)+1$.

In fact, the correct inductive step should be: Assume that $f(2^k)=8*2^{k-3}-1$ for some positive integer $k\geq 3$. We want to prove that $f(2^{k+1})=8*2^{k-2}-1$.

By the given equation $f(2n)=8n-7$, we have $f(2^{k+1})=8*2^k-7$. By the induction hypothesis, this becomes $f(2^{k+1})=8*(8*2^{k-3}-1)-7=8*2^{k-2}-1$. This completes the inductive step.

With this correct inductive step, we can now calculate $f(100)$.

We know that $100=2^2*5^2$. Therefore, $f(100)=f(2^2)f(5^2)$.

By the formula we proved, we have $f(2^2)=8*2^{-1}-1=3$ and $f(5^2)=8*5-7=33$. Therefore, $f(100)=f(2^2)f(5^2)=3*33=99$.

Again, this result does not satisfy the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. We must have made another error in our calculations. Let's try to find the mistake.

After a careful check, we find that our inductive proof is incorrect again. The error lies in the base case. The equation $f(2n)=8n-7$ does not imply that $f(2)=3$.

In fact, the correct base case should be: Assume that $f(n)=8n-7$ for all $n$ in the range $1\leq n\leq 7$. We want to prove that $f(8)=3$.

By the given equation $f(2n)=8n-7$, we have $f(8)=8*1-7=1$. However, this result contradicts with the induction hypothesis that $f(8)$ must equal to $8*8-7=57$. Therefore, we must revise the base case.

The correct base case should be: Assume that $f(n)=8n-7$ for all $n$ in the range $1\leq n\leq 7$. We want to prove that $f(8)=7$.

By the given equation $f(2n)=8n-7$, we have $f(8)=8*4-7=23$. By the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we have $f(8)=2f(4)+1=2*(2f(2)+1)+1=2*(2*3+1)+1=15$. Again, these results contradict with the induction hypothesis that $f(8)$ must equal to $8*8-7=57$. Therefore, we must revise the base case again.

The correct base case should be: Assume that $f(n)=8n-7$ for all $n$ in the range $1\leq n\leq 7$. We want to prove that $f(8)=7$.

By the given equation $f(2n)=8n-7$, we have $f(8)=8*4-7=23$. However, this result contradicts with the induction hypothesis that $f(8)$ must equal to $8*8-7=57$.

## QUESTION 4 - 15

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's plug in $n=1$ into the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. We get $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1$. This means $f(f(1))=1$.

Then, let's plug in $n=1$ into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We get $f(2)=2f(1)+1$. Since $f(1)=1$, we have $f(2)=2(1)+1=3$.

Now, let's plug in $n=2$ into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We get $f(4)=2f(2)+1$. Since $f(2)=3$, we have $f(4)=2(3)+1=7$.

We can keep going this way, but it might take a while to find a pattern. Let's try a few more values:

For $n=3$, $f(6)=2f(3)+1$.
For $n=4$, $f(8)=2f(4)+1$.

We notice a pattern here. The value of $f(n)$ is always one less than twice the previous value of $f(n)$. So, $f(1)=1$, $f(2)=3$, $f(4)=7$, $f(8)=15$, $f(16)=31$, and so on.

This pattern suggests that $f(n)=2^k-1$ for some positive integer $k$. We need to find the value of $k$ when $n=100$. Since $2^6=64$ and $2^7=128$, we know that $64<100<128$, so $k$ is $7$.

Therefore, $f(100)=2^7-1=128-1=127$. So, $f(100)=127$. The answer is: $127$
