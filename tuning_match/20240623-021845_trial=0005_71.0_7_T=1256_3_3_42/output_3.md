- List the variables and known values from the problem.
- Outline the steps using sympy to solve the problem:
  * Identify the sympy functions required for each step.
  * Implement these functions step-by-step, commenting each line for clarity.
- Calculate the final answer and verify it's a positive integer.
- Output the result within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The equation is a product of two terms equals to zero. Thus, either the first term equals to zero or the second term equals to zero. This means that the points that satisfy this equation must satisfy either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

2. In order for a square of a real number to be zero, the number itself must be zero. Hence, we have four cases to solve:

   a. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0 \implies \vert x + y \vert = 10$.
   
   b. $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0 \implies \vert x - y \vert = 10$.
   
   c. $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0 \implies \vert x \vert = 8$.
   
   d. $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0 \implies \vert y \vert = 8$.

3. In each of these cases, we solve the absolute value equations and obtain a list of points:

   a. For $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, the solutions are $(x, y) = (10 - y, y)$ and $(x, y) = (-10 - y, y)$.
   
   b. For $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, the solutions are $(x, y) = (y + 10, y)$ and $(x, y) = (y - 10, y)$.
   
   c. For $\vert x \vert = 8$, the solutions are $(x, y) = (8, y)$ and $(x, y) = (-8, y)$.
   
   d. For $\vert y \vert = 8$, the solutions are $(x, y) = (x, 8)$ and $(x, y) = (x, -8)$.

4. By plotting these points, we find that they form a square with side length 16. Hence, the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



In order for the product to be zero, one of the factors must be zero. Therefore, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. This defines a square in the coordinate plane with side length $20$ and vertices at $(10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, $(-10, 0)$, and $(0, -10)$.

Similarly, for $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This also defines a square with side length $20$ and vertices at $(10, -10)$, $(-10, 10)$, $(-10, -10)$, and $(10, 10)$.

For $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$. This defines a line segment from $(-8, 0)$ to $(8, 0)$.

And for $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert y \vert = 8$. This defines a line segment from $(0, -8)$ to $(0, 8)$.

The intersection of these shapes is a square with side length $16$ and vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$.

The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



This problem seems to be a bit of a puzzle more than a problem solvable by sympy. The equation given is the product of two expressions equal to zero. So one or both of these expressions must be equal to zero. 

The expression $ ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) $ is equal to zero if both $ (\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 $ and $ (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 $. This implies $ \vert x + y \vert = 10 $ and $ \vert x - y \vert = 10 $, which means $ x + y = \pm 10 $ and $ x - y = \pm 10 $. Solving these equations for $x$ and $y$ gives four lines.

The expression $ ((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0 $ is only possible if both $ \vert x \vert = 8 $ and $ \vert y \vert = 8 $, which means $ x = \pm 8 $ and $ y = \pm 8 $. This gives us four more lines.

If we plot these eight lines, they form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $ 16^2 = 256 $. 

So the area of the polygon is 256 square units. The output is:
The area of the polygon is $\boxed{256}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The problem involves absolute values and a condition where the product of two terms equals zero. This can only happen if at least one of the terms is zero. Therefore, we have two separate cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

Now, let's solve these cases step by step:

Case 1:
1. For $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, we have $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
2. For $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, we have $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.

Case 2:
1. For $\vert x \vert = 8$, we have $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
2. For $\vert y \vert = 8$, we have $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

Now, we can create a 4x4 square where each side is 16 units long (since the absolute value of x or y is 8 in both cases), and we can divide the square into four smaller squares of dimensions 8x8.

The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. The area of each of the four smaller squares is $8^2 = 64$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $256 - 4*64 = 256 - 256 = 0$.

However, this result doesn't make sense, as the area of the polygon should be non-zero. Let's reconsider the cases:

Case 1:
1. For $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, we have $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$. These are the equations of two straight lines.
2. For $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, we have $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$. These are the equations of two more straight lines.

Case 2:
1. For $\vert x \vert = 8$, we have $x = 8$ or $x = -8$. These are the equations of two vertical lines.
2. For $\vert y \vert = 8$, we have $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. These are the equations of two horizontal lines.

The intersections of these lines form a square with side length 16. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256. This is a positive integer, as required. The answer is: $256$
