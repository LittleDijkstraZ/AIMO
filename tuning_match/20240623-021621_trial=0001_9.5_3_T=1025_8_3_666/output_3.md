Approach:

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. We can solve these two cases separately.

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
This case implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
From these two equations, we can deduce that $x = 0$ and $y = 0$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
This case implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
From these two equations, we can deduce that $-8 \leq x \leq 8$ and $-8 \leq y \leq 8$.

So, the points satisfying the given equation lie on the intersection of the lines $x = 0$ and $y = 0$ and the rectangle with vertices at $(-8, -8), (-8, 8), (8, 8), (8, -8)$. The shape formed by these points is a square with side length $16$. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So, the area of the convex polygon is 256.
The answer is: $256$

Approach:


The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied only when at least one of the two factors is zero. This gives us two sets of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

Solving these sets of equations, we find that the points satisfying either set of equations are the vertices of a square with side length 16. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of this square.

The area of a square with side length $s$ is $s^2$. So the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $256$.
The answer is: $256$.

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:

 The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, in the given equation, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. 

For the first case, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, it implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This forms a square with side length 10 units.

For the second case, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, it implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This forms a square with side length 16 units.

The area of the convex polygon formed by the intersection of these two squares is the area of the smaller square. The side length of the smaller square is 10 units. Therefore, the area of the smaller square is $10^2 = 100$ square units. So, the answer is $\boxed{100}$.
The answer is: $100$.

Approach:

 The equation $A \cdot B = 0$ is true if and only if at least one of the factors is zero. So the given equation is equivalent to either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. This gives us four systems of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
3. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
4. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

Solving these systems of equations, we find that the solutions are the vertices of a square with side length 16. Therefore, the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. So, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

The answer is: $256$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:

 The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This is only possible if both $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$ which gives us four possible cases:

1. $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, solving these equations gives $x = 10$ and $y = 0$.
2. $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$, solving these equations gives $x = 0$ and $y = 10$.
3. $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$, solving these equations gives $x = 0$ and $y = -10$.
4. $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$, solving these equations gives $x = -10$ and $y = 0$.

Similarly, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This is only possible if both $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So, the eight points are $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8), (10, 0), (0, 10), (0, -10),$ and $(-10, 0)$. These points form a square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$. The area of this square is $(10\sqrt{2})^2 = 200$.

So, the area of the convex polygon formed by the points $\left(x, y\right)$ is 200 square units.
The answer is: $200$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

Approach:

 The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is true if and only if either of the two factors is equal to zero. This gives us two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This equation is true if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two squares with side length 10, centered at the origin, one with vertices at $(10,0)$, $(0,10)$, $(-10,0)$, and $(0,-10)$, and the other with vertices at $(0,10)$, $(10,0)$, $(0,-10)$, and $(-10,0)$. Their intersection forms a square with side length 10 and area $100$.

2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This equation is true if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which describes a square with side length 16 and area $256$.

However, the first case describes a square with side length 10, and the second case describes a square with side length 16. The intersection of these two squares is the polygon we are looking for.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of the smaller square, which is $100$.
The answer is: $100$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:


The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ implies that either of the two factors must be equal to zero. This means that the points that satisfy this equation are the ones that satisfy either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of a square with side length 10: $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, and $(-5,-5)$.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of a square with side length 16: $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

The convex polygon formed by the union of these two squares is a larger square with side length 18 (the maximum of the x and y coordinates). The area of this square is $18^2 = 324$. So, the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{324}$.
The answer is: $324$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

Approach:

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so one or both of the expressions must be zero. This gives us four cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
3. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
4. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For each case, we can set the respective expressions equal to zero and solve for $x$ and $y$. The resulting points will be the vertices of the polygon. Once we have all the vertices, we can calculate the area of the polygon using standard methods.

Solution:

1. For the first case, we have:
   $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$. The possible solutions are:
   $(x, y) = (8, 2), (8, -18), (-8, 18), (-8, -2)$.

2. For the second case, we have:
   $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The possible solutions are:
   $(x, y) = (2, 8), (2, -18), (-18, 8), (-18, -8)$.

3. For the third case, we have:
   $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$. The possible solutions are:
   $(x, y) = (8, -2), (8, 18), (-8, -18), (-8, 2)$.

4. For the fourth case, we have:
   $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The possible solutions are:
   $(x, y) = (-2, 8), (18, 8), (-18, -8), (2, -8)$.

The vertices of the polygon are the points $(8, 2)$, $(8, -18)$, $(-8, 18)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(2, 8)$, $(2, -18)$, $(-18, 8)$, $(-18, -8)$, $(8, -2)$, $(8, 18)$, $(-8, -18)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-2, 8)$, $(18, 8)$, $(-18, -8)$, and $(2, -8)$. These points form a square with side length 16. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$
