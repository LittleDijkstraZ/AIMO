Approach:

 To solve this problem, we need to understand the properties of the absolute value function and how it affects the number of solutions of the equation.
The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if the right-hand side $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly greater than 2. This is because the maximum value of the left-hand side is 2, and for the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, the right-hand side must be greater than this maximum value.
So, we have $\frac{m}{100} > 2$.
To satisfy this inequality, we need to find the value of $m$ such that $m > 200$.
Since $m$ is a positive integer, the only possible value for $m$ is 201.
Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition is 1.
The answer is: $\boxed{1}$

 We know that the given equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions, and we need to find the number of possible values of $m$.
Let's start by analyzing the left side of the equation.
The expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ can take on a value between 0 and 2, inclusive.
So, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be in this range.
Multiplying through by 100 gives $0 \le m \le 200$.
Now, we need to find how many values of $m$ will result in 4 distinct solutions.
We can do this by trying each value of $m$ in the range and counting the number of solutions.
By doing this, we find that there are 2 values of $m$ that result in 4 distinct solutions: $m=100$ and $m=200$.
So, the number of positive integers $m$ is 2. The answer is: $\boxed{2}$

We know that the absolute value function $|\cdot|$ makes the expression inside it nonnegative. So, the equation $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if the equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2=\pm\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions.

Let's first solve the equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2=\frac{m}{100}$.
Adding $2$ to both sides gives $\vert x-1 \vert =\frac{m}{100}+2$.
This equation has two cases:

Case 1: $x-1=\frac{m}{100}+2$, which simplifies to $x=\frac{m}{100}+3$.

Case 2: $x-1=-\frac{m}{100}-2$, which simplifies to $x=-\frac{m}{100}+1$.

Now, let's solve the equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2=-\frac{m}{100}$.
Adding $2$ to both sides gives $\vert x-1 \vert =2-\frac{m}{100}$.
This equation also has two cases:

Case 3: $x-1=2-\frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x=\frac{m}{100}+1$.

Case 4: $x-1=-2+\frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x=\frac{m}{100}-1$.

Now, we want the four distinct solutions to be different from each other. So we have the following system of inequalities:

\[\begin{cases}
\frac{m}{100}+3 \neq \frac{m}{100}+1 \\
\frac{m}{100}+3 \neq \frac{m}{100}-1 \\
\frac{m}{100}+1 \neq \frac{m}{100}-1 \\
\frac{m}{100}-1 \neq -\frac{m}{100}+1
\end{cases}\]

Simplifying each inequality gives:

\[\begin{cases}
3 \neq 1 \\
3 \neq -1 \\
1 \neq -1 \\
-1 \neq 1
\end{cases}\]

All of these inequalities are true, so the four solutions are indeed distinct.

So, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if $m$ is a positive integer such that $1 \leq m \leq 100$.

Therefore, the number of such positive integers $m$ is 100. The answer is: $100$

1. First, we need to understand that the number of solutions of the equation depends on the value of the right side, which is $m/100$.
2. Since we want the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, we need to find out for which values of $m/100$ the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=m/100$ has 4 distinct solutions.
3. We know that the absolute value equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=m/100$ has 4 distinct solutions when $m/100$ is between 1 and 2. This is because the graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ intersects the line $y=m/100$ at 4 distinct points when $1<m/100<2$.
4. To find the value of $m$, we multiply both sides of the inequality $1<m/100<2$ by 100 to get $100<m<200$.
5. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from 101 to 199, which is a total of 100 integers.

The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=m/100$ has 4 distinct solutions is 100.
The answer is: 100

Approach:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can have a maximum of 4 distinct solutions.

First, we need to understand the behavior of the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$.

This function has 3 different "pieces":

1. For $x < 1$, $f(x) = \vert -x + 1 - 2 \vert = \vert -x - 1 \vert = x + 1 + 2 = x + 3$.
2. For $1 \leq x \leq 3$, $f(x) = \vert x - 1 - 2 \vert = \vert x - 3 \vert = 3 - x$.
3. For $x > 3$, $f(x) = \vert x - 1 - 2 \vert = \vert x - 3 \vert = x - 3 - 2 = x - 5$.

So, the function $f(x)$ is a "hump" function with a maximum value of 2 at $x = 1$.

Now, if $\frac{m}{100} > 2$, then the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have less than 4 solutions, since the right side of the equation is always less than or equal to 2.

Therefore, $\frac{m}{100} \leq 2$, which implies $m \leq 200$.

Also, the right side of the equation must be positive, which implies $\frac{m}{100} > 0$, so $m > 0$.

So, the possible values of $m$ are the positive integers less than or equal to 200.

We want to find the number of these positive integers that make the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have 4 distinct solutions.

This is equivalent to finding the number of $\frac{m}{100}$ values that make the "hump" function $f(x)$ have 4 distinct intersections with the line $y = \frac{m}{100}$.

From the graph of $f(x)$, we can see that this happens when $\frac{m}{100}$ is in the range $(0, 2]$.

So, the possible values of $\frac{m}{100}$ are the positive numbers in the interval $(0, 2]$, which are $\frac{1}{100}, \frac{2}{100}, \ldots, \frac{200}{100}$.

Counting these numbers, we find that there are exactly 200 such numbers.

But, we are asked to find the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the equation.

Since $\frac{m}{100}$ ranges from $\frac{1}{100}$ to $\frac{200}{100}$, $m$ ranges from 1 to 200.

Counting these numbers, we find that there are exactly 200 positive integers $m$ that satisfy the equation.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 200. The answer is: $200$

Approach:


To find the value of m for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions, we need to analyze the properties of the absolute value function and how it affects the number of solutions.

1. For the given equation, we first need to consider the right side of the equation $\frac{m}{100}$. Since m is a positive integer, $\frac{m}{100}$ is a positive number.

2. The left side of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a composition of two absolute value functions. This function is non-negative and has a shape of a "V" (or an upside down "V") in the coordinate plane. It is symmetric about the line x = 1.

3. Now we need to set the left side equal to the right side and solve for x. The right side $\frac{m}{100}$ will have a unique value, while the left side $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ will have multiple solutions (4 in total) for specific values of m.

4. To find the number of distinct solutions, we need to analyze the properties of the absolute value function and how it affects the number of solutions.

5. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have 4 distinct solutions when the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to the distance between the slopes of the "V" shaped graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$.

6. To find the value of m that satisfies this condition, we can set up the equation $\frac{m}{100}=2$. Solving for m gives $m=200$.

Therefore, the only positive integer m for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is m=200. The answer is: $1$

Approach:

 To solve this problem, we need to count the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. 

Step 1: We first note that the right-hand side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be positive because the absolute value of a quantity cannot be negative. This implies that $m$ must be a positive integer.

Step 2: The number of distinct solutions of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ depends on the value of $\frac{m}{100}$. The equation will have 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 1 and 2 (exclusive). 

This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ oscillates between 1 and 2 as $x$ varies. 

Step 3: To find the number of such positive integers $m$, we need to find the number of integers in the interval (100, 200). 

Step 4: The number of integers in the interval (100, 200) is $200 - 100 - 1 = 99$. 

So, there are 99 positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.
The answer is: 99

To solve this problem, we need to find how many positive integer values of $m$ make the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have 4 distinct solutions.

This equation is a double absolute value equation, which can be solved by considering the cases inside the absolute value signs separately. The equation is equivalent to the following system of equations:

\[\begin{cases} \vert x - 1 \vert - 2 = \frac{m}{100} \\ \vert x - 1 \vert - 2 = -\frac{m}{100} \end{cases}\]

For each equation in the system, we solve the absolute value equation and count the number of distinct solutions. The sum of these counts will give us the total number of solutions for the original equation.

Solve each equation separately:

For the first equation:
\[\vert x - 1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}\]
This equation has 2 solutions if $2 + \frac{m}{100} > 0$, that is $m > -200$. The solutions are given by:
\[x = 1 \pm (2 + \frac{m}{100})\]

For the second equation:
\[\vert x - 1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}\]
This equation has 2 solutions if $2 - \frac{m}{100} > 0$, that is $m < 200$. The solutions are given by:
\[x = 1 \pm (2 - \frac{m}{100})\]

The total number of distinct solutions is 4 if and only if the first equation has 2 solutions and the second equation has 2 solutions, and these solutions are distinct. This is the case if $-200 < m < 200$. So the number of positive integer values of $m$ is the number of positive integers in the interval $(0, 200)$, which is 199.
The value of $m$ that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions is 199. Therefore, there is only 1 value of $m$ that satisfies the condition. The answer is: $\boxed{1}$

Approach:

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 1 and 2. This is because the expression on the left side of the equation takes on the values of 1, 3 when the absolute value inside is equal to 2, and takes on the values of 1 and 0 when the absolute value inside is equal to 1. Therefore, the values of the left side lie strictly between 0 and 3. So, we have $\frac{m}{100} \in (1, 2)$. Solving for $m$ gives $m \in (100, 200)$. The number of positive integers in this interval is $200 - 100 - 1 = 99$. So, there are $99$ positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions. The answer is: $99$

Approach:


We first note that the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a piecewise function that takes on a value of $0$ when $1-2 \leq x \leq 1+2$, a value of $3- \vert x-1 \vert$ when $x < 1-2$ or $x > 1+2$, and a value of $ \vert x-1 \vert -1$ when $1-2 < x < 1+2$. Therefore, we can rewrite the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ as:
\[
\begin{cases}
0=\frac{m}{100} & \text{if } 1-2 \leq x \leq 1+2 \\
3-\vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100} & \text{if } x < 1-2 \text{ or } x > 1+2 \\
\vert x-1 \vert -1 = \frac{m}{100} & \text{if } 1-2 < x < 1+2
\end{cases}
\]
The first case has no solutions since $\frac{m}{100}$ is always positive and $0$ only occurs when $1-2 \leq x \leq 1+2$.
The second and third cases give two and two solutions respectively. Therefore, we need $\frac{m}{100} = 3-\vert x-1 \vert$ and $\frac{m}{100} = \vert x-1 \vert -1$ to each have two solutions.
For $\frac{m}{100} = 3-\vert x-1 \vert$, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = 3-\frac{m}{100}$. This has two solutions when $3-\frac{m}{100} > 0$, or $m < 300$.
For $\frac{m}{100} = \vert x-1 \vert -1$, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = 1+\frac{m}{100}$. This has two solutions when $1+\frac{m}{100} > 0$, or $m > -100$.
Taking the intersection of the two conditions, we find $-100 < m < 300$.
Since $m$ is a positive integer, we are looking for the number of positive integers in the interval $(0, 300)$. This is simply $300 - 1 = 299$.
Therefore, there are 299 positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions. The answer is: 299

Approach:



In order for the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ to have 4 distinct solutions, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal to 2. This is because the graph of $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has 4 "jumps" or changes in direction at $x = -1, 1, 3, 5$. Therefore, for the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, the right side of the equation must also have 4 changes in direction, which occurs when $\frac{m}{100} = 2$.

Solving for m:

$m = 2 \times 100 = 200$.

Therefore, the value of $m$ that makes the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have 4 distinct solutions is $m = 200$.
The answer is: $1$
