Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



We first notice that the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ can be rewritten as $\frac{1}{2}((5x-4y)^2+(4y-5x)^2)$.

Now let $u = 5x - 4y$ and $v = 4y - 5x$. Then we have $u + v = 0$, and we can rewrite the expression as $\frac{1}{2}(u^2 + v^2)$.

We are also given the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. We can rewrite this as $|5x-4y| + |4y-5x| = 40$, which simplifies to $|u| + |v| = 40$.

By the triangle inequality, we have $|u| + |v| \geq |u + v| = |0| = 0$. But we know that $|u| + |v| = 40$. So the minimum value of $\frac{1}{2}(u^2 + v^2)$ is achieved when $u = 20$ and $v = -20$ or $u = -20$ and $v = 20$. In either case, the minimum value of $\frac{1}{2}(u^2 + v^2)$ is $\frac{1}{2}(20^2 + (-20)^2) = \frac{1}{2}(800) = 400$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 400. The answer is: $400$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we note that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is equivalent to $|x-2y| = |y-2x| = 20$.
This means that $x-2y = \pm 20$ and $y-2x = \pm 20$.
Solving these equations, we find that the solutions are $(x, y) = (10, 0), (0, 10), (-10, 0), (0, -10)$.
Now we substitute these values into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
For $(x, y) = (10, 0)$, we get $5(10)^2+5(0)^2-8(10)(0) = 500$.
For $(x, y) = (0, 10)$, we get $5(0)^2+5(10)^2-8(0)(10) = 500$.
For $(x, y) = (-10, 0)$, we get $5(-10)^2+5(0)^2-8(-10)(0) = 500$.
For $(x, y) = (0, -10)$, we get $5(0)^2+5(-10)^2-8(0)(-10) = 500$.
So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 500. The answer is: $\boxed{500}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we observe that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$.
This is equivalent to $|x-2y| - |2y-x| = 0$, and by the property of absolute value, we know that $|a| - |b| = 0$ if and only if $a = b$ or $a = -b$.
So we have $x-2y = 2y-x$, which simplifies to $2x = 4y$, or $x = 2y$.
Now we substitute $x = 2y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to get $5(2y)^2 + 5y^2 - 8(2y)(y) = 20y^2 + 5y^2 - 16y^2 = 9y^2$.
Since $y$ can be any real number, the minimum value of $9y^2$ is 0, which occurs when $y = 0$.
Substituting $y = 0$ into $x = 2y$, we get $x = 0$.
So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is achieved when $x = 0$ and $y = 0$, and the minimum value is $9(0)^2 = 0$.
The answer is: $0$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The given expression is $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite this as $5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy$.
Now, let's complete the square for the expression $x^2 + y^2 - \frac{8}{5}xy$.
We know that $(x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2 = x^2 + y^2 - 2ax - 2by + a^2 + b^2$.
Comparing this with $x^2 + y^2 - \frac{8}{5}xy$, we can see that $2a = \frac{8}{5}$ and $2b = 0$.
So, $a = \frac{4}{5}$ and $b = 0$.
Then, $x^2 + y^2 - \frac{8}{5}xy = \left(x - \frac{4}{5}\right)^2 + y^2 - \left(\frac{4}{5}\right)^2$.
This is equal to $\left(x - \frac{4}{5}\right)^2 + \left(y - 0\right)^2 - \left(\frac{4}{5}\right)^2$.
So, $5\left(x^2 + y^2 - \frac{8}{5}xy\right) = 5\left(\left(x - \frac{4}{5}\right)^2 + \left(y - 0\right)^2 - \left(\frac{4}{5}\right)^2\right)$.
This simplifies to $5\left(x - \frac{4}{5}\right)^2 + 5y^2 - 16$.
Now, let's look at the constraint $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$.
Using the property $|a| + |b| = |a + b| + |a - b|$, we can rewrite the constraint as $|2x - y| + |-2x + y| = 40$.
This simplifies to $|2x - y| + |2x - y| = 40$, which further simplifies to $2|2x - y| = 40$.
So, $|2x - y| = 20$.
Now, let's substitute $u = x - \frac{4}{5}$ and $v = y$ into the expression $5\left(x - \frac{4}{5}\right)^2 + 5y^2 - 16$.
We get $5u^2 + 5v^2 - 16$.
And the constraint $|2x - y| = 20$ becomes $|2(u + \frac{4}{5}) - v| = 20$, which simplifies to $|2u - v + \frac{8}{5}| = 20$.
So, we want to minimize $5u^2 + 5v^2 - 16$ subject to the constraint $|2u - v + \frac{8}{5}| = 20$.
Since $u = x - \frac{4}{5}$ and $v = y$, this is equivalent to minimizing $5\left(x - \frac{4}{5}\right)^2 + 5y^2 - 16$ subject to the constraint $|2x - y| = 20$.
By the Trivial Inequality, $5\left(x - \frac{4}{5}\right)^2 + 5y^2 \geq 0$, so $5\left(x - \frac{4}{5}\right)^2 + 5y^2 - 16 \geq -16$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ subject to the constraint $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$ is $-16$.
The answer is: $-16$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's rewrite the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
By the property of absolute value, we know that $|a| + |b| = |a+b|$ if and only if $ab \ge 0$.
So we can rewrite the equation as $|x-2y - (y-2x)| = 40$, which simplifies to $|x-2y - y+2x| = 40$, or $|3x-3y| = 40$.
This further simplifies to $3|x-y| = 40$, so $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$.
Now, let's substitute $x-y = \frac{40}{3}$ or $x-y = -\frac{40}{3}$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.
If $x-y = \frac{40}{3}$, then $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(x-y)^2 = 5\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{8000}{9}$.
If $x-y = -\frac{40}{3}$, then $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(x-y)^2 = 5\left(-\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{8000}{9}$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\frac{8000}{9}$. The answer is: $\boxed{\frac{8000}{9}}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we notice that $|x-2y| + |y-2x|$ is equivalent to $|2y-x| + |2x-y|$.
Using the property of absolute values, we have $|a-b| = |b-a|$, so $|2y-x| = |x-2y|$.
Therefore, $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = |x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.

Now, we want to minimize the value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.

We can rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $(5x^2-8xy+5y^2)$, which can be factored as $(5x^2-8xy+4y^2+y^2)$, and then further factored as $((x-2y)^2 + y^2)$.

Using the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we know that $|x-2y| = 20 - |y-2x|$.
Squaring both sides, we get $(x-2y)^2 = (20 - |y-2x|)^2$.
Expanding and simplifying, we have $(x-2y)^2 + y^2 = (20 - |y-2x|)^2 + y^2$.

Since $(x-2y)^2 + y^2$ is the expression we want to minimize, and $(20 - |y-2x|)^2 + y^2$ is equal to it, we can conclude that the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the constraint is achieved when $(x-2y)^2 + y^2$ is minimized.

Since $(x-2y)^2 + y^2$ is always nonnegative, the minimum value is achieved when $(x-2y)^2 = 0$ and $y^2 = 0$.
This means $x = 2y$ and $y = 0$.
Substituting these values back into the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we get $|2y-2y| + |0-4y| = 40$, which simplifies to $|0| + |-4y| = 40$, or $4|y| = 40$.
Therefore, $|y| = 10$, and since $y = 0$, this means $y = 0$.
Substituting $y = 0$ back into $x = 2y$, we get $x = 0$.

So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the constraint is achieved when $x = 0$ and $y = 0$.
Evaluating the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ at these values, we get $5(0)^2 + 5(0)^2 - 8(0)(0) = 0$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the constraint is 0.
The answer is: $\boxed{0}$.

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We first note that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is equivalent to $|x-2y| = 20$ and $|y-2x| = 20$.

From $|x-2y| = 20$, we have two cases:
1) $x - 2y = 20$: In this case, $y = \frac{x}{2} - 10$.
2) $x - 2y = -20$: In this case, $y = \frac{x}{2} + 10$.

Similarly, from $|y-2x| = 20$, we have two more cases:
3) $y - 2x = 20$: In this case, $y = 2x - 20$.
4) $y - 2x = -20$: In this case, $y = 2x + 20$.

Now, we substitute the four equations into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
1) If $y = \frac{x}{2} - 10$, we have $5x^2+5\left(\frac{x}{2}-10\right)^2-8x\left(\frac{x}{2}-10\right)$.
2) If $y = \frac{x}{2} + 10$, we have $5x^2+5\left(\frac{x}{2}+10\right)^2-8x\left(\frac{x}{2}+10\right)$.
3) If $y = 2x - 20$, we have $5x^2+5\left(2x-20\right)^2-8x\left(2x-20\right)$.
4) If $y = 2x + 20$, we have $5x^2+5\left(2x+20\right)^2-8x\left(2x+20\right)$.

After simplifying each expression, we find that the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $-400$.
The answer is: $-400$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we simplify the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
We can rewrite it as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$,
which simplifies further to $|x-2y| - |x-2y| = 40$.
This equation is always true, but it doesn't give us any information about $x$ and $y$.
So, we need to find another approach.

Now, let's consider the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.
We can rewrite it as $(5x^2-8xy+5y^2)$.
This can be factored as $(5x^2-10xy+5y^2)+(-2xy)$,
which simplifies to $5(x-y)^2-2xy$.

Now, let's consider the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
We can rewrite it as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$,
which simplifies further to $|x-2y| - |x-2y| = 40$.
This equation is always true, but it doesn't give us any information about $x$ and $y$.
So, we need to find another approach.

Notice that $(x-2y)^2 + (2y-x)^2 = 40^2$.
Expanding both sides, we get $x^2-4xy+4y^2 + 4y^2-4xy+x^2 = 1600$,
which simplifies to $2x^2-8xy+8y^2 = 1600$.
Dividing both sides by 2, we get $x^2-4xy+4y^2 = 800$.

Now, let's add this equation to our expression $5x^2-8xy+5y^2$.
We get $6x^2-12xy+9y^2 = 800+5x^2-8xy+5y^2$.
Simplifying, we get $x^2-4xy+4y^2 = 800$.

Now, notice that $x^2-4xy+4y^2 = (x-2y)^2$.
So, $(x-2y)^2 = 800$.
Taking the square root of both sides, we get $x-2y = \pm \sqrt{800}$.

Now, let's substitute $x-2y = \sqrt{800}$ into the equation $5x^2-8xy+5y^2$.
We get $5(\sqrt{800})^2-8(\sqrt{800})y+5y^2 = 5*800-8*20\sqrt{10}y+5y^2$.
Simplifying, we get $4000-160\sqrt{10}y+5y^2$.

Now, let's substitute $x-2y = -\sqrt{800}$ into the equation $5x^2-8xy+5y^2$.
We get $5(-\sqrt{800})^2-8(-\sqrt{800})y+5y^2 = 5*800+8*20\sqrt{10}y+5y^2$.
Simplifying, we get $4000+160\sqrt{10}y+5y^2$.

Comparing the two expressions, we see that the minimum value of $5x^2-8xy+5y^2$ occurs when $x-2y = \sqrt{800}$.
So, we substitute $x-2y = \sqrt{800}$ into the equation $5x^2-8xy+5y^2$.
We get $4000-160\sqrt{10}y+5y^2$.

Now, let's find the minimum value of this expression.
Taking the derivative with respect to $y$, we get $-160\sqrt{10}+10y$.
Setting this equal to zero, we get $10y = 160\sqrt{10}$.
Solving for $y$, we get $y = 16\sqrt{10}$.

Substituting this value of $y$ back into the equation $x-2y = \sqrt{800}$,
we get $x-32\sqrt{10} = \sqrt{800}$.
Solving for $x$, we get $x = 40\sqrt{10}$.

Now, let's substitute these values of $x$ and $y$ back into the expression $5x^2-8xy+5y^2$.
We get $5(40\sqrt{10})^2-8(40\sqrt{10})(16\sqrt{10})+5(16\sqrt{10})^2$.
Simplifying, we get $8000-51200+12800$.
Combining like terms, we get $-31200$.

However, this result doesn't make sense because the minimum value of the expression cannot be negative.
So, we must have made a mistake somewhere.

Let's go back and check our work.

Notice that $(x-2y)^2 + (2y-x)^2 = 40^2$.
Expanding both sides, we get $x^2-4xy+4y^2 + 4y^2-4xy+x^2 = 1600$,
which simplifies to $2x^2-8xy+8y^2 = 1600$.
Dividing both sides by 2, we get $x^2-4xy+4y^2 = 800$.

Now, let's add this equation to our expression $5x^2-8xy+5y^2$.
We get $6x^2-12xy+9y^2 = 800+5x^2-8xy+5y^2$.
Simplifying, we get $x^2-4xy+4y^2 = 800$.

Now, notice that $x^2-4xy+4y^2 = (x-2y)^2$.
So, $(x-2y)^2 = 800$.
Taking the square root of both sides, we get $x-2y = \pm \sqrt{800}$.

Now, let's substitute $x-2y = \sqrt{800}$ into the equation $5x^2-8xy+5y^2$.
We get $5(\sqrt{800})^2-8(\sqrt{800})y+5y^2$.
Simplifying, we get $4000-160\sqrt{10}

## QUESTION 1 - 8

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$,
we can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.
The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states that for any real numbers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ and $b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n$,
we have $(a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 + \dots + a_nb_n)^2 \leq (a_1^2 + a_2^2 + \dots + a_n^2)(b_1^2 + b_2^2 + \dots + b_n^2)$.

Applying the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to the constraint equation, we have
\[(1 \cdot (x - 2y) + (-1) \cdot (y - 2x))^2 \leq ((1)^2 + (-1)^2)((x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2).\]
Simplifying, we get
\[(x - 2y - y + 2x)^2 \leq (2)((x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2).\]
\[(3x - 3y)^2 \leq 2((x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2) + (y^2 - 4yx + 4x^2)).\]
\[(3x - 3y)^2 \leq 2(5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy).\]
\[9(x^2 - 2xy + y^2) \leq 10(x^2 + y^2 - \frac{4}{5}xy).\]
\[9(x^2 + y^2 - 2xy) \leq 10(x^2 + y^2 - \frac{4}{5}xy).\]
\[9(x^2 + y^2 - 2xy) - 10(x^2 + y^2 - \frac{4}{5}xy) \leq 0.\]
\[(x^2 + y^2 - 2xy)(9 - 10) \leq 0.\]
\[-x^2 - y^2 + 2xy \leq 0.\]
\[x^2 - 2xy + y^2 \leq 0.\]
\[(x - y)^2 \leq 0.\]
Since the square of a real number is always nonnegative, the only way for the inequality to hold is if $(x - y)^2 = 0$,
which means $x = y$.

Now we substitute $x = y$ into the constraint equation:
\[|x - 2x| + |x - 2x| = 40.\]
\[| - x| + | - x| = 40.\]
\[2|x| = 40.\]
\[|x| = 20.\]
So $x = 20$ or $x = -20$.

We substitute $x = y$ into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ to find the minimum value:
\[5x^2 + 5x^2 - 8x^2 = 2x^2.\]
Substituting $x = 20$, we get $2(20)^2 = 800$.
Substituting $x = -20$, we also get $2(-20)^2 = 800$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ under the constraint is 800. The answer is: $800$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We are given the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
We can rewrite this equation as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$.
By the property of absolute value, $|a| = |-a|$, so we can simplify the equation to $|x-2y| + |-x+2y| = 40$.
This equation can be further simplified to $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$.
Using the property of absolute value, $|a-b| = |b-a|$, we can rewrite the equation as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$.
This equation is equivalent to $2|x-2y| = 40$, so $|x-2y| = 20$.
Now, we have two cases to consider:
Case 1: $x-2y = 20$ or $x-2y = -20$.
Case 2: $2y-x = 20$ or $2y-x = -20$.
For Case 1, we can solve the system of equations:
\[
\begin{cases}
x - 2y = 20 \\
x - 2y = -20
\end{cases}
\]
This system of equations has no solution, as both equations cannot be true at the same time.
For Case 2, we can solve the system of equations:
\[
\begin{cases}
2y - x = 20 \\
2y - x = -20
\end{cases}
\]
This system of equations also has no solution, as both equations cannot be true at the same time.
However, we made a mistake in our analysis. When we simplified the original equation to $2|x-2y| = 40$, we should have divided both sides by 2, not multiplied.
So, the correct equation should be $|x-2y| = 20$.
Now, let's consider the two cases again:
Case 1: $x-2y = 20$ or $x-2y = -20$.
Case 2: $2y-x = 20$ or $2y-x = -20$.
For Case 1, we can solve the system of equations:
\[
\begin{cases}
x - 2y = 20 \\
2y - x = 20
\end{cases}
\]
This system of equations has no solution, as both equations cannot be true at the same time.
For Case 2, we can solve the system of equations:
\[
\begin{cases}
x - 2y = -20 \\
2y - x = -20
\end{cases}
\]
This system of equations has the solution $x = 0$ and $y = -10$.
Substituting these values into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$, we get:
\[
5(0)^2 + 5(-10)^2 - 8(0)(-10) = 0 + 500 + 0 = 500.
\]
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is 500.
The answer is: $500$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we note that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is equivalent to $|x-2y| = 20 - |y-2x|$.
Now, we square both sides to get rid of the absolute values:
\[(x-2y)^2 = (20 - |y-2x|)^2.\]
Expanding both sides, we have
\[x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2 = 400 - 40|y-2x| + (y-2x)^2.\]
Rearranging terms, we get
\[x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2 - (y-2x)^2 = 400 - 40|y-2x|.\]
Since $(y-2x)^2 \geq 0$, we have
\[x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2 - (y-2x)^2 \leq x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2.\]
So, we have
\[x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2 \leq 400 - 40|y-2x|.\]
Now, we want to minimize the left-hand side, which is the same as minimizing $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have
\[(1^2 + 2^2)(x^2 + y^2) \geq (x + 2y)^2.\]
Simplifying, we get
\[5(x^2 + y^2) \geq (x + 2y)^2.\]
Since $(x + 2y)^2 \leq (x^2 + y^2) + 4xy + 4y^2 = 5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy$, we have
\[5(x^2 + y^2) \geq 5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy.\]
Simplifying, we get
\[8xy \geq 0.\]
So, $xy \geq 0$.
Now, let's go back to the inequality $x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2 \leq 400 - 40|y-2x|$.
Since $xy \geq 0$, we have $|y-2x| = y - 2x$.
So, the inequality becomes
\[x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2 \leq 400 - 40(y - 2x).\]
Expanding the right-hand side, we have
\[x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2 \leq 400 - 40y + 80x.\]
Rearranging terms, we get
\[x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2 - 80x + 40y \leq 400.\]
Now, we want to minimize the left-hand side.
By completing the square, we have
\[(x - 40)^2 - 80x + 40y + 4(y - 10)^2 - 40y \leq 400.\]
Simplifying, we get
\[(x - 40)^2 + 4(y - 10)^2 \leq 400.\]
Dividing both sides by 400, we have
\[\frac{(x - 40)^2}{400} + \frac{(y - 10)^2}{100} \leq 1.\]
This is the equation of an ellipse centered at $(40, 10)$ with semi-major axis 20 and semi-minor axis 10.
The minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ occurs at the center of the ellipse, which is $(40, 10)$.
So, we substitute $x = 40$ and $y = 10$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get
\[5(40)^2 + 5(10)^2 - 8(40)(10) = 8000 + 500 - 3200 = 5300.\]
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 5300. The answer is: $5300$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we notice that the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is equivalent to $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$, which simplifies to $2|x-2y| = 40$. Thus, $|x-2y| = 20$.
Now, consider the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite it as $5(x^2+y^2)-8xy = 5[(x-2y)^2+4xy] - 8xy = 5(x-2y)^2 + 12xy$.
We know that $|x-2y| = 20$, so $(x-2y)^2 = 400$. Substituting this into the expression, we get $5(400) + 12xy = 2000 + 12xy$.
To minimize this expression, we want to minimize the value of $12xy$. Since $x$ and $y$ are real numbers, the product $xy$ can be minimized when $x=y$.
When $x=y$, the equation $|x-2y| = 20$ simplifies to $|x-2x| = |x| = 20$, so $x = \pm 20$.
If we choose $x=y=20$, then $12xy = 12(20)(20) = 4800$.
If we choose $x=y=-20$, then $12xy = 12(-20)(-20) = 4800$.
In both cases, the value of $12xy$ is the same.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $2000 + 4800 = 6800$.
The answer is: $6800$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we notice that the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$, so we have $|2y-x| + |2x-y| \geq |(2y-x) + (2x-y)| = |y| = |2y/2| \geq 2|y|/2 = |y|$.
Therefore, $|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |y|$.
Since $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we have $|y| \leq 40$.
This implies that $-40 \leq y \leq 40$.
Now, we substitute $y = \frac{x}{2}$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to get $5x^2 + 5(\frac{x}{2})^2 - 8x(\frac{x}{2}) = 5x^2 + \frac{5x^2}{4} - 4x^2 = \frac{15x^2}{4} - 4x^2 = \frac{x^2}{4}$.
Since $-40 \leq y = \frac{x}{2} \leq 40$, we have $-80 \leq x \leq 80$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $\frac{x^2}{4}$ occurs when $x = 0$, and the minimum value is $\frac{0^2}{4} = 0$.
However, we need to check if this minimum value satisfies the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
When $x = 0$, we have $y = 0$, and $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |0-0| + |0-0| = 0$, which is not equal to 40.
So, we need to find another solution.
We can try $x = 2y$, then we have $|2y-2y| + |y-4y| = |0| + |-3y| = 3|y|$.
Since $-40 \leq y \leq 40$, we have $3|y| \geq 3(40) = 120$, which is greater than 40.
So, $x = 2y$ is not a valid solution.
We can try $y = 2x$, then we have $|x-4x| + |2x-x| = |-3x| + |x| = 4|x|$.
Since $-80 \leq x \leq 80$, we have $4|x| \geq 4(80) = 320$, which is greater than 40.
So, $y = 2x$ is not a valid solution either.
However, we can try $x = -2y$, then we have $|-2y-2y| + |y+4y| = |-4y| + |5y| = 9|y|$.
Since $-40 \leq y \leq 40$, we have $9|y| \leq 9(40) = 360$, which is less than 40.
So, $x = -2y$ is a valid solution.
When $x = -2y$, we have $y = -\frac{x}{2}$, and substitute this into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to get $5x^2 + 5(-\frac{x}{2})^2 - 8x(-\frac{x}{2}) = 5x^2 + \frac{5x^2}{4} + 4x^2 = \frac{15x^2}{4} + 4x^2 = \frac{x^2}{4}$.
Since $-80 \leq x \leq 80$, the minimum value of $\frac{x^2}{4}$ occurs when $x = 0$, and the minimum value is $\frac{0^2}{4} = 0$.
However, we need to check if this minimum value satisfies the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
When $x = 0$, we have $y = 0$, and $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |0-0| + |0-0| = 0$, which is equal to 40.
So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 0.
The answer is: 0

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, we notice that the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ can be rewritten as $\frac{1}{2}((5x-4y)^2+(4y-5x)^2)$.

Then, we have $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. By the triangle inequality, we have $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |(x-2y) - (y-2x)| = |x-2y-y+2x| = |3x-3y| = 3|x-y| = 40$. So we have $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$.

Now, let $a = 5x-4y$ and $b = 4y-5x$, then we have $a^2 + b^2 = (5x-4y)^2 + (4y-5x)^2 = 2(25x^2 + 16y^2 - 40xy) + 2(16y^2 + 25x^2 - 40xy) = 8(25x^2 + 16y^2 - 40xy) = 8(5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy)$.

Since $a^2 + b^2 = (a+b)^2 - 2ab = (5x-4y + 4y-5x)^2 - 2(5x-4y)(4y-5x) = 1600 - 8(5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy)$, we have $8(5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy) = 1600$, so $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = 200$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 200 when $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$.
The answer is: $200$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we simplify the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
By the property of absolute value, $|a-b| = |-(a-b)| = |b-a|$, so we can rewrite the equation as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$.
Then, we use the property $|a| + |b| = |a+b|$ if $ab \geq 0$, so we have $|x-2y + 2y-x| = 40$.
Simplifying the inside of the absolute value gives $|0| = 40$, which is clearly not possible.
However, we made a mistake in our assumption that $ab \geq 0$.
In fact, we need to consider two cases:
Case 1: $x-2y \geq 0$ and $2y-x \geq 0$. In this case, we have $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = (x-2y) + (2y-x) = 0$, which is not equal to 40.
Case 2: $x-2y < 0$ and $2y-x < 0$. In this case, we have $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = -(x-2y) - (2y-x) = -2(x-2y) = 40$.
Simplifying further gives $x-2y = -20$.
Now, let's substitute this into the expression we want to minimize: $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.
We have $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x-2y)^2 + 4xy] - 8xy$.
Substituting $x-2y = -20$ gives $5[(-20)^2 + 4xy] - 8xy = 5[400 + 4xy] - 8xy = 2000 + 20xy - 8xy = 2000 + 12xy$.
To minimize this expression, we want to minimize $12xy$. Since $x-2y = -20$, we can solve for $x$ in terms of $y$: $x = 2y - 20$.
Substituting this into $12xy = 12(2y-20)y = 24y^2 - 240y$.
To minimize this expression, we can take the derivative with respect to $y$ and set it equal to 0: $48y - 240 = 0$.
Solving for $y$ gives $y = 5$.
Substituting this back into $x = 2y - 20$ gives $x = 2(5) - 20 = -10$.
So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ occurs when $x = -10$ and $y = 5$.
Substituting these values gives $5(-10)^2+5(5)^2-8(-10)(5) = 500+125+400 = 1025$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 1025. The answer is: $1025$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



Let's first rewrite the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$.
Using the property $|a-b| = |b-a|$, we can rewrite the equation as $|2y-x| + |x-2y| = 40$.
This simplifies to $2|2y-x| = 40$, or $|2y-x| = 20$.
This means that $2y-x = \pm 20$.

Now let's solve the equation $2y-x = 20$.
Adding $x$ to both sides gives $2y = x + 20$, or $y = \frac{x}{2} + 10$.
Substituting this into the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ gives $|x - 2(\frac{x}{2} + 10)| + |(\frac{x}{2} + 10) - 2x| = 40$.
Simplifying this gives $|x - x - 20| + |\frac{x}{2} + 10 - 2x| = 40$, or $|-20| + |-\frac{3x}{2} + 10| = 40$.
This simplifies to $20 + |\frac{-3x}{2} + 10| = 40$, or $|\frac{-3x}{2} + 10| = 20$.
This means that $\frac{-3x}{2} + 10 = \pm 20$.

Solving $\frac{-3x}{2} + 10 = 20$ gives $\frac{-3x}{2} = 10$, or $x = -\frac{20}{3}$.
And solving $\frac{-3x}{2} + 10 = -20$ gives $\frac{-3x}{2} = -30$, or $x = 20$.
So the possible values of $x$ are $-\frac{20}{3}$ and $20$.

Let's substitute these values into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.
For $x = -\frac{20}{3}$, we have $y = \frac{-\frac{20}{3}}{2} + 10 = -\frac{10}{3} + 10 = \frac{20}{3}$.
Substituting these values gives $5(-\frac{20}{3})^2 + 5(\frac{20}{3})^2 - 8(-\frac{20}{3})(\frac{20}{3}) = 5(\frac{400}{9}) + 5(\frac{400}{9}) - 8(-\frac{400}{9}) = \frac{2000}{9} + \frac{2000}{9} + \frac{3200}{9} = \frac{7200}{9} = 800$.

For $x = 20$, we have $y = \frac{20}{2} + 10 = 20$.
Substituting these values gives $5(20)^2 + 5(20)^2 - 8(20)(20) = 5(400) + 5(400) - 8(400) = 2000 + 2000 - 3200 = 800$.

So in both cases, the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ equals 800.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 800.
The answer is: $800$.
