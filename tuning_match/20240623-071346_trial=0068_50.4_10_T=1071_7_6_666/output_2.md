Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}=2$.
This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a piecewise linear function with four distinct pieces,
and each piece corresponds to a value of $m$ in the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.

So we set $\frac{m}{100}=2$, and solve for $m$:
\[m=2\cdot 100=200.\]

Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ that makes the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have 4 distinct solutions,
and that value is $m=200$. The answer is: $1$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.
This equation is equivalent to a pair of equations:
$\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ or $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.
For the first equation, $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.
This implies that $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 = -2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
Solving these equations gives $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.
For the second equation, $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
This implies that $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 = -2 + \frac{m}{100}$.
Solving these equations gives $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ or $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.
So the four distinct solutions are $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$, $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$, $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, and $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.
To have 4 distinct solutions, we need the expressions $\frac{m}{100}$, $-\frac{m}{100}$, $2 + \frac{m}{100}$, $-2 - \frac{m}{100}$, $2 - \frac{m}{100}$, and $-2 + \frac{m}{100}$ to be positive.
This implies that $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, so $0 < m < 200$.
The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this condition are $1, 2, ..., 199$.
Therefore, there are 199 positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions.
The value of $m$ is 199. The answer is: $199$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.
Let's first consider the case where $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$.
Then $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, and so $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 = -2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
This gives us two equations:
$x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.
For these two equations to have 4 distinct solutions, the distance between them must be greater than 2.
So we have $3 + \frac{m}{100} - (-1 - \frac{m}{100}) > 2$, which simplifies to $4 + \frac{2m}{100} > 2$.
Solving this inequality gives us $m > 50$.
Now let's consider the case where $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.
Then $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, and so $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 = -2 + \frac{m}{100}$.
This gives us two equations:
$x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.
For these two equations to have 4 distinct solutions, the distance between them must be greater than 2.
So we have $3 - \frac{m}{100} - (-1 + \frac{m}{100}) > 2$, which simplifies to $4 - \frac{2m}{100} > 2$.
Solving this inequality gives us $m < 50$.
Putting it all together, we have $m$ is a positive integer such that $50 > m > 0$.
The number of positive integers satisfying this condition is 49.
Therefore, the value of $m$ is 49.
The answer is: $1$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To have four distinct solutions, the value of $m/100$ must be $2$. This is because the expression $| |x-1|-2|$ will be equal to $2$ four times, once in each interval of the piecewise function that makes up $| |x-1|-2|$.

To see this, consider the graph of $y = ||x-1|-2$. The graph will be a V-shape with the bottom of the V at $y=0$, and the top at $y=4$. The graph will pass through $y=2$ twice, once on the way up and once on the way down. This means that $| |x-1|-2|=2$ has exactly four solutions.

Since $m/100 = 2$, we have $m = 200$. Thus, there is only one positive integer $m$ that satisfies the given condition, and the answer is $1$. The answer is: 1
