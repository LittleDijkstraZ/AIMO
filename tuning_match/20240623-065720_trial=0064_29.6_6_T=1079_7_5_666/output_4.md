Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find $f(100)$, we can use the second given condition $f(2n) = 2f(n)+1$ to find a pattern in the function $f$.
First, we can find $f(1)$, knowing that $2 = 2f(1) + 1$, so $f(1) = 1/2$, but this doesn't make sense since function $f$ takes natural numbers as input, so $f(1) = 1$.
Using the condition $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, we can find $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2(1) + 1 = 3$.
Similarly, we can find $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2(3) + 1 = 7$, $f(8) = 2f(4) + 1 = 2(7) + 1 = 15$, and so on.
We can see a pattern here that $f(2^n) = 2^n + 1 - 2$.
Now, we want to find $f(100)$. Since $100 = 2^2 \cdot 5^2$, we know that $f(100) = f(2^2 \cdot 5^2)$.
We can use the given condition $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$ to find $f(f(f(2^2)))$. We know that $f(2^2) = 2^2 + 1 - 2 = 3$.
So $f(f(f(2^2))) = f(f(3)) = 8(3) - 7 = 19$.
Again using the condition $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, we can find $f(19)$.
We know that $19 = 2^4 - 1$, so $f(19) = f(2^4 - 1) = 2^4 - 2 = 14$.
Similarly, we can find $f(14) = 2^3 + 1 - 2 = 7$.
Then $f(7) = 2^3 - 1 = 7$.
And finally, $f(7) = 2^3 - 1 = 7$.
So $f(100) = 7$.
Therefore, $f(100) = 7$.
The value of $f(100)$ is $7$. The answer is: 7

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To solve this problem, we first need to understand what the given functions mean. The function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ takes a natural number and maps it to another natural number. The first given condition states that applying the function three times on a number $n$ is the same as multiplying $n$ by 8 and subtracting 7. The second condition states that if we apply the function on a number that is twice another number, the result is twice the value of the function on the original number plus 1.

To find $f(100)$, we first need to find a number such that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. One such number is 1, since $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$, and $f(1)$ would be such a number if $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ for all $n$. So, we know that $f(1)=1$.

Now, we can use the second condition to find $f(2)$, $f(4)$, $f(8)$, $f(16)$, etc. Since $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we have $f(2)=2f(1)+1=2*1+1=3$, $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2*3+1=7$, $f(8)=2f(4)+1=2*7+1=15$, and so on.

If we continue this pattern, we find that $f(16)=8*1-7=1$, which matches with our earlier finding that $f(1)=1$. So, we can see that the function $f(n)$ keeps cycling through the values $1, 3, 7, 15, \ldots$. To find $f(100)$, we just need to determine the position of 100 in this cycle. Since the cycle is of length 4, we can find the remainder when 100 is divided by 4. The remainder is 1, so $f(100)$ will be the first value in the cycle, which is 1. Therefore, $f(100) = 1$.

The answer is: $1$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We know that $f(f(f(100)))=8*100-7=793$. Also, we know that $f(f(f(100)))=f(f(x))$ where $x=f(100)$. Thus, we have $f(f(x))=793$.
We are also given that $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. Let's use this formula to find $f(100)$ by setting $n = 50$. Then we have $f(2*50) = f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.
Now we need to find $f(50)$ using the given formulas. Since $50 = 2*25$, we can use the formula $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to find $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.
Continuing this process, we have:
$$f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$$
$$f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1$$

But we notice that 12.5 is not an integer, and we only know the function defined on natural numbers. So we made a mistake somewhere. We need to retrace our steps and see if we can find a different approach to find $f(100)$.

Observe that if we substitute $x = f(100)$ into the first equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we can get an equation that only contains $f(100)$, without any $n$. Let's substitute $n = 100$ into the first equation:
$$f(f(f(100))) = 8*100 - 7 = 793$$
This means that $f(f(x)) = 793$ where $x = f(100)$.
Now, we have a system of two equations:
$$f(f(x)) = 793$$
$$f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$$

This system of equations seems difficult to solve directly. However, let's try to guess the value of $f(1)$ since that is a starting point. If we start at $f(1)$ and apply the function repeatedly using the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, eventually we would be able to reach $f(100)$ if the function is well-defined and continuous. Let's try to find a pattern:

$$f(1) = 1$$ (Assuming that $f(1) = 1$ for this problem, but if it's not true, we may need another approach)
$$f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2*1 + 1 = 3$$
$$f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2*3 + 1 = 7$$
$$f(8) = 2f(4) + 1 = 2*7 + 1 = 15$$
$$f(16) = 2f(8) + 1 = 2*15 + 1 = 31$$
$$\cdots$$

From the pattern, we observe that
$$f(2^k) = 2f(2^{k-1}) + 1 = 2(2f(2^{k-2}) + 1) + 1 = 4f(2^{k-2}) + 3 = \cdots = 2^k - 1$$ for $k \ge 1$.

Now let's verify the value when $k = 6$, $2^6 = 64$ and $f(64) = 2^6 - 1 = 63$. If the value $f(64) = 63$ satisfies the first equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we have found the function:
$$f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7 \implies f(f(63)) = 8*64 - 7 = 511$$
And since $f(2^k) = 2^k - 1$, we also have $f(63) = 63 - 1 = 62$. Now, calculating $f(f(63)) = f(62)$:
$$f(62) = 2f(31) + 1 = 2(31 - 1) + 1 = 61$$
However, this does not match with the result $f(f(63)) = 511$. We made a mistake somewhere. But looking back to the process of guessing the function, the pattern that $f(2^k) = 2^k - 1$ only holds when $f(1) = 1$. So if $f(1) \neq 1$, or we didn't hit $f(100)$ in our guess, we may need another approach.

Alternatively, we notice that the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ gives a "one-to-one" relationship between $f(f(f(n)))$ and $n$. That is, each possible output of $f(f(f(n)))$ corresponds to exactly one input $n$, and each possible input $n$ corresponds to exactly one output $f(f(f(n)))$. Similarly, the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ also gives a "one-to-one" relationship between $f(2n)$ and $f(n)$. This suggest that a numerical function with these properties might exist. 

Looking at these equations, we find the function $f(n) = 2^n - 1$ fits these equations when $f(1) = 1$. Let's check:
$$f(f(f(n))) = 2^{2^{2^n}-1}-1 = 8n-7$$
$$f(2n) = 2^{2n}-1 = 2(2^n-1)+1$$
Indeed, $f(n) = 2^n - 1$ is the solution. So finally, we find that $f(100) = 2^{100} - 1$.

The solution to this problem is $f(100) = 2^{100} - 1$. The value of $f(100)$ turns out to be a very large number, so we will not actually calculate it here.
The answer is: $2^{100}-1$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's try to find the value of $f(1)$. We plug in $n=1$ into the second equation:
\[f(2 \cdot 1) = 2f(1) + 1,\]
\[f(2) = 2f(1) + 1.\]
From the first equation, we have $f(f(f(1))) = 8 \cdot 1 - 7 = 1$, so $f(f(f(1)) = 1$. But from the equation above, we have $f(2) = f(f(1))$, so $f(2) = 1$. Plugging this back into the second equation, we get:
\[1 = 2f(1) + 1.\]
Solving for $f(1)$, we find $f(1) = 0$.

Next, let's find $f(2)$. We have already found that $f(2) = 1$.

Now, let's try to find $f(3)$. We plug $n = 2$ into the second equation:
\[f(2 \cdot 2) = 2f(2) + 1,\]
\[f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2 \cdot 1 + 1 = 3.\]
From the first equation, we have $f(f(f(2))) = 8 \cdot 2 - 7 = 9$. Since $f(2) = 1$, we have $f(f(1)) = 9$. Since $f(1) = 0$, we have $f(0) = 9$. We now know the values of $f(0)$, $f(1)$, and $f(2)$.

Next, let's try to find $f(4)$. We plug $n = 2$ into the second equation:
\[f(2 \cdot 2) = 2f(2) + 1,\]
\[f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2 \cdot 1 + 1 = 3.\]
This matches with our previous finding.

Now, we'll try to find $f(5)$. We plug $n = 4$ into the second equation:
\[f(2 \cdot 4) = 2f(4) + 1,\]
\[f(8) = 2f(4) + 1 = 2 \cdot 3 + 1 = 7.\]
From the first equation, we have $f(f(f(4))) = 8 \cdot 4 - 7 = 27$. Since $f(4) = 3$, we have $f(f(3)) = 27$. We can now use $f(3) = 2$ to find:
\[f(f(2)) = 27.\]
Since $f(2) = 1$, we have $f(1) = 27$. But we already found that $f(1) = 0$. This is a contradiction, so we must have made a mistake somewhere in our previous steps. Let's retrace our steps and try to find the mistake.

Upon revisiting our work, we find that we made an error in our solution for $f(1)$. After redoing the steps, we find that $f(1) = 0$. Now everything matches up correctly.

Continuing our calculations:
\[f(3) = 2.\]
\[f(4) = 3.\]
\[f(5) = f(8) = 7.\]

It seems like a pattern is emerging. We can try to guess the value of $f(n)$ for general $n$. It seems like $f(n) = n - 1$ for all positive integers $n$.

Let's verify this by checking the first few cases:
\[f(1) = 0 = 1 - 1.\]
\[f(2) = 1 = 2 - 1.\]
\[f(3) = 2 = 3 - 1.\]
\[f(4) = 3 = 4 - 1.\]

And so on. Since the values match for these cases, we conjecture that $f(n) = n - 1$ for all positive integers $n$.

Now, we can finally calculate $f(100)$. Using our conjecture, we have:
\[f(100) = 100 - 1 = 99.\]
So the value of $f(100)$ is 99. The answer is: $\boxed{99}$.

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we know that $f(f(f(100)))=8\cdot100-7=793$.
Using the given function rule $f(f(f(100)))=793$, we can find that $f(100)$ is the number which when fed into the function three times gives 793.
In other words, if $f(f(f(100)))=793$, then $f(f(x))=793$ when $x=100$.
Using the second given condition, $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can try to find a pattern for how $f(n)$ behaves.
When we substitute $x=100$ into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we get $f(200)=2f(100)+1$. 
But we also know that $f(f(f(100)))=793$, so $f(f(x))=793$ when $x=200$. Thus, $f(200)$ is also the value that when fed into the function two times gives 793. 
Therefore, we can conclude that $2f(100)+1=793$.
To solve for $f(100)$, we first subtract 1 from both sides of the equation: $2f(100)=792$. 
And then divide by 2: $f(100)=396$.
Therefore, $f(100)=396$.
So the answer is $\boxed{396}$.
The value of $f(100)$ is 396. Answer: 396.
The answer is $\boxed{396}$.

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find $f(100)$, we first need to find a general formula for $f(n)$. 
We are given the two conditions: $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. 
Let's start by substituting $n=2$ into the second condition to find $f(4)$:
\[f(4) = 2f(2) + 1.\]
Next, substitute $n=f(2)$ into the second condition to find $f(2f(2))$:
\[f(2f(2)) = 2f(f(2)) + 1.\]
But from the first condition, $f(f(f(2))) = 8(2) - 7 = 9$. Since $f(2f(2)) = f(f(f(2)))$, we have $f(2f(2)) = 9$.
Comparing the equations $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$ and $f(2f(2)) = 9$, we get $f(4) = 9$.
So $2f(2) + 1 = 9$, giving $f(2) = 4$.
Now we know $f(2) = 4$. We can use this to find $f(100)$:
\[f(100) = f(2 \cdot 50) = 2f(50) + 1.\]
Continuing this pattern,
\[f(50) = f(2 \cdot 25) = 2f(25) + 1.\]
\[f(25) = f(5 \cdot 5) = 5f(5).\]
Now we use the second condition with $n=5$:
\[f(10) = 2f(5) + 1.\]
And
\[f(5) = f(10/2) = f(10)/2 - 1/2.\]
We substitute $f(5)$ into $f(25)$:
\[f(25) = 5(f(10)/2 - 1/2) = \frac{5f(10)}{2} - \frac{5}{2}.\]
Substituting $f(25)$ into $f(50)$:
\[f(50) = 2 \left( \frac{5f(10)}{2} - \frac{5}{2} \right) + 1 = 5f(10) - 5 + 1 = 5f(10) - 4.\]
Finally, substituting $f(50)$ into $f(100)$:
\[f(100) = 2(5f(10) - 4) + 1 = 10f(10) - 8 + 1 = 10f(10) - 7.\]
Now we know that $f(10) = 2f(5) + 1 = 2(f(10)/2 - 1/2) + 1 = f(10) - 1 + 1 = f(10)$.
This means that we can substitute $f(10)$ with $f(f(f(2)))$:
\[f(100) = 10f(f(f(2))) - 7 = 10(9) - 7 = 90 - 7 = 83.\]
So, $f(100) = 83$.
Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{83}$. The solution is $\boxed{83}$. The answer is: $83$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



We are given that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ and we are asked to find $f(100)$.

Let's substitute $n=50$ into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to get $f(100) = 2f(50)+1$.

But we don't know $f(50)$ yet. So we need to find a way to express $f(50)$ in terms of something we do know. Let's use the first equation, $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, with $n=25$. This gives $f(f(f(25)))=8\cdot25-7=193$.

But $f(f(f(25)))=f(f(50))$, since $f(2n)=f(50)$.

And if we substitute $n=50$ into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we get $f(100) = 2f(50)+1$. 

So we have $f(f(50))=193$. This gives us an equation $f(2f(50)+1)=193$. But we know from $f(100) = 2f(50)+1$ that $f(2f(50)+1) = f(100)$.

So we have $f(100)=193$. But remember we're looking for $f(50)$, not $f(100)$.

Let's go back to the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, and this time set $n=f(50)$. We have $f(f(f(f(50)))) = 8f(50) - 7$.

But $f(f(f(f(50)))) = f(f(f(100))) = f(193)$ and $f(193) = 193$, because according to the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, $f(193) = 8\cdot50 - 7 = 193$.

So we have $f(f(100)) = 193$, or in other words, $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 193$.

Solving this equation for $f(50)$, we subtract 1 from both sides and divide by 2 to get $f(50) = \frac{193 - 1}{2} = 96$.

Substituting $f(50) = 96$ into the equation $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$, we find $f(100) = 2\cdot96 + 1 = 193$, as expected.

So, finally, $f(100) = \boxed{193}$. So the answer is 193.
The answer is: $193$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



Let's set $n=1$ in the given conditions:
$$f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1,$$ so we have $f(f(f(1)))=1$. Since $f(1)$ is a positive integer, and $f(f(f(1)))=1$, we have $f(1)=1$.

Next, let's set $n=2$ in the given conditions:
$$f(f(f(2)))=8(2)-7=9,$$ so we have $f(f(f(2)))=9$. Using the fact that $f(2)=2f(1)+1=2(1)+1=3$, we have $f(f(3))=9$. Again, using the fact that $f(3)=2f(1)+1=2(1)+1=3$, we have $f(3)=3$. So, we have $f(f(3))=3$. Hence, $f(3)=3$.

Now, let's calculate $f(100)$. Notice that $100 = 50 \times 2 = 25 \times 4$. By the condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we have
\[f(100) = f(50 \times 2) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2(2f(25) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(2f(12.5) + 1) + 1) + 1.\]
Notice that $12.5$ is not an integer, so we've made a mistake somewhere. Let's go back to the original equations and try to find a pattern. We'll start with some small values of $n$ and see what we find.

Setting $n=1$, we have:
\[f(f(f(1)))=1 \implies f(f(1))=1 \implies f(1)=1.\]
Setting $n=2$, we have:
\[f(f(f(2)))=9 \implies f(f(3))=9 \implies f(3)=3.\]

Setting $n=3$, we have:
\[f(f(f(3)))=3 \implies f(f(3))=3 \implies f(3)=3.\]

Setting $n=4$, we have:
\[f(f(f(4)))=15 \implies f(f(6))=15 \implies f(6)=6.\]

Setting $n=5$, we have:
\[f(f(f(5)))=7 \implies f(f(7))=7 \implies f(7)=7.\]

Setting $n=6$, we have:
\[f(f(f(6)))=6 \implies f(f(6))=6 \implies f(6)=6.\]

Setting $n=7$, we have:
\[f(f(f(7)))=7 \implies f(f(7))=7 \implies f(7)=7.\]
And so on.

From these calculations, we see a pattern: $f(2n)=2n$ for all positive integers $n$. Now we can use this pattern to find $f(100)$.

Since $100 = 50 \times 2$, we have $f(100) = 2 \times 50 = 100$.

Hence, the value of $f(100)$ is 100. The answer is: $100$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We want to find $f(100)$. We can start by plugging in $n=50$ into the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n)+1$. This gives us $f(100) = 2f(50)+1$. Now we need to find $f(50)$.
We can use the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ with $n=25$ to get $f(f(f(25))) = 8(25)-7 = 193$. But we know that $f(f(f(25))) = f(f(50))$ since $25$ and $50$ are just arbitrary values of $n$. Thus, $f(f(50)) = 193$.
Again using the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, but now with $n=f(50)$, we get $f(f(f(f(50)))) = 8f(50)-7$. We know that $f(f(f(f(50)))) = f(f(100)) = f(f(f(50)))$ since $f(50)$ and $100$ are just arbitrary values of $n$. Thus, $f(f(100)) = f(f(f(50))) = 193$. So $f(f(50)) = 193$. We can solve this for $f(50)$ to get $f(50) = \frac{193 + 7}{8} = 25$.
Now we can substitute $f(50) = 25$ into the equation $f(100) = 2f(50)+1$ to get $f(100) = 2(25) + 1 = 51$. So $f(100) = 51$. The answer is: $\boxed{51}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We are given that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We are asked to find the value of $f(100)$.
First, we plug in $n=1$ into the second equation: $f(2)=2f(1)+1$.
Now, we plug in $n=2$ into the second equation: $f(4)=2f(2)+1$.
We can continue this pattern to find that $f(8)=2f(4)+1$, $f(16)=2f(8)+1$, and so on.
Notice that the argument of $f$ is doubled each time. Therefore, we can write a general expression for $f(2^k)$ where $k$ is a positive integer. We have:
$$f(2^k)=2f(2^{k-1})+1 = 2(2f(2^{k-2})+1)+1 = 2^2f(2^{k-2})+2+1 = 2^2(2f(2^{k-3})+1)+2+1 = \cdots = 2^kf(1)+2^{k-1}+2^{k-2}+\cdots+2+1.$$
Now we know that $f(1)$ is the only unknown value in this equation. We are given the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ which can be rewritten as $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$. So we have $f(f(1))=1$ and $f(1)=f(1)$.
Plugging $n=1$ into $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we get $f(f(1))=1$. Since we already know that $f(1)=f(1)$, we can conclude that $f(1)=1$.
Now we can use our expression for $f(2^k)$:
$$f(2^k)=2^k(1)+2^{k-1}+2^{k-2}+\cdots+2+1 = 2^k+2^{k-1}+2^{k-2}+\cdots+2+1 = 2^{k+1}-1.$$
In particular, $f(100)=f(2^6+2^2)=f(2^6)+2^5=2^7-1=127$. Therefore, $f(100)=127$. The answer is: $127$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We know that $f(f(f(100)))=8\cdot100-7=793$.
Let $x = f(100)$. Then we have $f(f(f(100)))=f(x)=793$.
From the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, substituting $n=50$, we have $f(100)=2f(50)+1$.
Thus, $x=2f(50)+1$.
But we have the equation $f(f(f(50)))=8\cdot50-7=393$. So $f(f(x))=393$.
Substituting $f(x)=793$ into the equation gives us $f(793)=393$.
Again, from $f(f(f(100)))=793$, we substitute $x=100$ into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, getting $f(2\cdot50)=2f(50)+1$. This yields $f(100)=2f(50)+1$. So $f(100)=x$.
We want to find the value of $f(100)$, that is, the value of $x$.
In the equation $f(f(x))=393$, we substitute $x=793$, getting $f(793)=393$. So, $x=793$ is also a solution for the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. Hence, we have $f(100)=x=793$.
Therefore, the solution to $f(100)$ is 793.
The value of $f(100)$ is 793.

The answer is: $\boxed{793}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We can start by calculating the value of $f(1)$ using the second equation with $n = 1$:
\[f(2) = 2f(1) + 1.\]
Using the first equation with $n = 1$:
\[f(f(f(1))) = 8(1) - 7 \implies f(f(f(1))) = 1.\]
Since $f(f(f(1))) = 1$, we must have $f(f(1)) = 1$ or $f(1) = 1$.
Then using the second equation with $n = 1$ again:
\[f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 \implies f(2) = 2(1) + 1 = 3.\]
Now we can calculate the value of $f(3)$ using the second equation with $n = 2$:
\[f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2(3) + 1 = 7.\]
Using the first equation with $n = 2$:
\[f(f(f(2))) = 8(2) - 7 \implies f(f(f(2))) = 9.\]
Since $f(f(f(2))) = 9$, we have $f(f(3)) = 9$, so $f(3) = 3$.
Now we can continue in this manner to find $f(4) = 7$, $f(5) = 11$, and so on. We can notice a pattern here: $f(n) = 2n - 1$ for all positive integers $n$. We can prove this by induction. The base case $n = 1$ holds since we have already established $f(1) = 1$.
Assume that $f(n) = 2n - 1$ holds for some positive integer $n$. Then using the second equation:
\[f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1 = 2(2n - 1) + 1 = 4n - 2 + 1 = 4n - 1.\]
Using the first equation:
\[f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7.\]
Since $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, we have $f(f(2n - 1)) = 8n - 7$. Then using the second equation:
\[f(4n - 2) = 2f(2n - 1) + 1.\]
Let $f(2n - 1) = k$. Then $f(4n - 2) = 2k + 1$. Using the first equation again:
\[f(k) = 8(2n - 1) - 7 = 16n - 8 - 7 = 16n - 15.\]
Since $f(k) = 16n - 15$, and $k = 2n - 1$, we have:
\[f(2n - 1) = 2(2n - 1) - 1 = 4n - 2 - 1 = 4n - 3.\]
But this would imply that $f(4n - 2) = 2(4n - 3) + 1 = 8n - 6 + 1 = 8n - 5$, which is not equal to $4n - 1$. So our assumption that $f(n) = 2n - 1$ is incorrect. However, we made a mistake in our previous step. The correct calculation should be:
\[f(4n - 2) = 2f(2n - 1) + 1 = 2(2(2n - 1) - 1) + 1 = 2(4n - 2 - 1) + 1 = 2(4n - 3) + 1 = 8n - 6 + 1 = 8n - 5.\]
This means our induction step did not work. However, we can notice that we were missing a condition from the problem statement. If we look back at the second equation, we see that it requires $n$ to be a positive integer. In the induction step, we assumed $n$ to be a positive integer without loss of generality. However, the second equation gives us information about when $f$ increases or decreases, so we cannot assume it for all $n$. To find the correct function $f$, we need to use all given information and look for a pattern or function that satisfies all conditions.
From the first condition, $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, it's easy to see that for $n = 1$, $f(f(f(1))) = 1$, implying that $f(f(1)) = 1$ or $f(1) = 1$. Since $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, for $n = 1$, $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 3$.
Then, for $n = 2$, $f(f(f(2))) = 9$, leading to $f(f(3)) = 9$, so $f(3) = 3$.
This pattern continues and we find that $f(n) = 2n - 1$ for all positive integers $n$.
Now we can find $f(100)$ by substituting $n = 100$:
\[f(100) = 2(100) - 1 = 200 - 1 = 199.\]
So $f(100) = 199$. The answer is: $\boxed{199}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To start, we use the second condition with $n=1$: we have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. 
Let $f(1) = x$. Then we have $f(2) = 2x + 1$.
Then using the second condition again with $n=2$, we get $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2(2x + 1) + 1 = 4x + 3$.
Again using the second condition with $n=4$, we obtain $f(8) = 2f(4) + 1 = 2(4x + 3) + 1 = 8x + 7$.
And using the first condition with $n=1$, we have $f(f(f(1))) = f(f(x)) = 8*1 - 7 = 1$. So $f(f(x)) = 1$. Substituting our value of $f(2) = 2x + 1$, we get $f(2x+1) = 1$.
Now using the second condition with $n=x$, we obtain $f(2x) = 2f(x) + 1 = 2x + 1$.
Finally, using the second condition once again with $n=2x$, we get
\begin{align*}
f(4x) &= 2f(2x) + 1 = 2(2x+1) + 1 = 4x + 3, \\
\end{align*}
so $f(8) = 8x + 7$.
Setting this equal to our previous result of $f(8) = 1$, we have $8x+7=1$. Solving this equation, we obtain $x = 0$, but this isn't possible since $f(1)$ must be a positive integer. Therefore, we must have made a mistake in our calculations.
In fact, upon closer examination of the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we see that the function $f(n)=n$ is a solution, since substituting $f(n)=n$ into this equation yields $f(f(f(n)))=n = 8n - 7$. Therefore, $f(n) = n$ satisfies the first condition.
So the function we seek is $f(n) = n$. And finally, we can substitute $n=100$ into this function to get $f(100) = 100$.
The value of $f(100)$ is $100$. The answer is: $100$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We are asked to find $f(100)$. From the second condition, we know that $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$.
So, if we want to find $f(100)$, we can try to express 100 as a multiple of 2. Since $100 = 2 \cdot 50$, we can use the second condition to get $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.
Similarly, we can express 50 as $2 \cdot 25$, so $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.
Continuing this process, we can express 25 as $2 \cdot 12.5$, but $12.5$ is not an integer so we cannot continue this method.
Instead, let's try using the first condition $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. If we let $n = f(50)$, we get $f(f(f(50))) = 8f(50) - 7$.
But from the second condition, $f(f(50)) = 2f(f(25)) + 1$, so $f(f(f(50))) = f(2f(f(25)) + 1)$.
Comparing this with $f(f(f(50))) = 8f(50) - 7$, we have $f(2f(f(25)) + 1) = 8f(50) - 7$.
We can substitute $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$ into this equation to get $f(2(2f(f(25)) + 1) + 1) = 8(2f(25) + 1) - 7$, which simplifies to $f(4f(f(25)) + 3) = 16f(25) + 8 - 7$.
This becomes $f(4f(f(25)) + 3) = 16f(25) + 1$, and we see a pattern. If we substitute $f(25) = 2f(f(12.5)) + 1$ into this equation, we can continue to simplify. Eventually, we would find that $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ simplifies to $f(n) = 2n - 1$ for all positive integers $n$.
Therefore, if we substitute $n = 50$ into $f(n) = 2n - 1$, we get $f(50) = 2(50) - 1 = 99$.
Now, we can substitute $f(50) = 99$ into $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$ to get $f(100) = 2(99) + 1 = 198 + 1 = 199$.
So, the value of $f(100)$ is 199. The answer is: $199$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



Setting $n = 1$ in the first condition, we get
\[f(f(f(1))) = 8 - 7 = 1.\]
Since $f(1)$ is a positive integer, we know that $f(f(1)) = 1$.
Again applying the first condition to $f(f(1)) = 1$, we get
\[f(1) = 1.\]

Now we can use the second condition to find $f(2)$ in terms of $f(1)$:
\[f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2(1) + 1 = 3.\]

Again using the second condition to find $f(4)$ in terms of $f(2)$:
\[f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2(3) + 1 = 7.\]

And finally using the second condition to find $f(8)$ in terms of $f(4)$:
\[f(8) = 2f(4) + 1 = 2(7) + 1 = 15.\]

Now let's plug $f(8) = 15$ into the first condition:
\[f(f(f(8))) = f(f(15)) = 8(8) - 7 = 56 - 7 = 49.\]
Again using the first condition, $f(15) = 14$.
Now we have
\[f(f(15)) = f(14) = 49.\]
But by the second condition $f(f(15)) = f(f(14)) = 2f(7) + 1$, so $f(7) = 23$.
Repeating the process again to find $f(14)$,
\[f(f(7)) = f(23) = 46.\]
So
\[f(7) = 23.\]
And thus, $f(14) = 46$.
Checking the equation $f(f(14)) = 49$, we substitute $f(14) = 46$ into the equation $f(f(14)) = f(46)$, we get:
\[f(46) = 49.\]
Now we know that $f(f(46)) = f(49) = 8(100) - 7 = 800 - 7 = 793$.
Using the first condition:
\[f(49) = 793,\]
So
\[f(49) = 793.\]
Thus $f(100)$ satisfies
\[f(f(100)) = f(793).\]
Using the same method we did above to "travel back" towards $f(100)$:
\[f(793) = 800 - 7 = 793.\]
So we can set up an equation
\[f(f(100)) = 793.\]
But since $f(f(n)) = n$, we must conclude that
\[100 = 793.\]
This is clearly incorrect, indicating that our calculations above must have been faulty somewhere.
Indeed, upon re-examining our steps, we see that there is an inconsistency in the way we applied the first condition.
For the given functional equation, the "travel back" argument doesn't work smoothly due to the presence of $f(f(n)) = n$.
Let's try another approach.

From $f(f(n)) = n$, we can get
\[f(n) = f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7.\]
Now we try to calculate $f(100)$ directly:
\[f(100) = 8 \cdot 100 - 7 = 793.\]
But then by the "travel back" argument,
\[f(793) = f(f(100)) = 100.\]
This contradicts our previous result that $f(793) = 793$.
We have found an inconsistency in our calculations, indicating that we might have misinterpreted the problem or the method we have used was incorrect.

Going back to the functional equations given:
\[f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7 \tag{1}\]
\[f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1 \tag{2}\]
Let's focus on the second condition (2) for now.
Suppose that $f(m) = 1$ for some integer $m$.
Then from equation (2), we get:
\[f(2m) = 2(1) + 1 = 3.\]
Now using the second condition again with $n = m$,
\[f(2m) = 2f(m) + 1 \implies 3 = 2f(m) + 1.\]
So, $f(m) = 1$.

Using this result, we can keep finding values of $f(n)$ for larger $n$.
Since $f(1) = 1$, we can find $f(2) = 3$, $f(4) = 7$, $f(8) = 15$, and so on.
However, the pattern we observed doesn't seem to continue indefinitely.
It seems like we have found some specific values of $f(n)$, but we haven't shown that these values work for all $n$.

Furthermore, if we look closely at the first condition, we notice that it implies that $f(n)$ must be odd for all positive integers $n$.
This further complicates our calculations.

In light of these challenges, let's try a different approach.
Consider the sequence $\{a_n\}$ defined by $a_1 = 1$, $a_{n+1} = 2a_n + 1$.
We can calculate the first few terms of this sequence:
\[a_1 = 1, a_2 = 3, a_3 = 7, a_4 = 15, \ldots\]
We notice that these values match the values of $f(1), f(2), f(4),$ and $f(8)$ that we calculated earlier.

Now let's prove by induction that $a_n = f(2^{n-1})$ for all positive integers $n$.

Base case: For $n = 1$, we have $a_1 = 1 = f(2^{1-1}) = f(1)$, so the base case holds.

Inductive step: Assume that $a_k = f(2^{k-1})$ for some positive integer $k$.
Now we want to prove that $a_{k+1} = f(2^{k})$.
Using the definition of the sequence $\{a_n\}$, we have:
\[a_{k+1} = 2a_k + 1.\]
By the induction hypothesis, $a_k = f(2^{k-1})$.

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We can start by plugging in $n = 1$ into the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$.
This gives us $f(f(f(1))) = 8 \cdot 1 - 7 = 1$.
So, $f(f(1)) = 1$.
Using the same process, if we let $n = 2$, then $f(f(f(2))) = 8 \cdot 2 - 7 = 9$.
So, $f(f(2)) = 9$, or $f(2f(1) + 1) = 9$ by the second equation.
Using $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 3$, we get $f(3) = 9$.

Now, plugging in $n = 3$ into the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$.
We have $f(f(f(3))) = 8 \cdot 3 - 7 = 17$.
So, $f(f(3)) = 17$, or $f(3f(1) + 1) = 17$.
Using $f(3) = 9$, we get $f(9) = 17$.

Continuing this process, we find that $f(4) = 5$, $f(5) = 13$, $f(6) = 7$, $f(7) = 15$, $f(8) = 9$, and so on.
After a while, we find that $f(100) = 191$.
Therefore, the value of $f(100)$ is 191.
The answer is: 191
