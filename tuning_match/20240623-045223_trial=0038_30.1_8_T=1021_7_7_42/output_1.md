Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's simplify the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. This can be written as $(5x^2-8xy+5y^2) = (5x^2-10xy+5y^2) + 2xy = 5(x-y)^2 + 2xy$.

Next, we consider the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. Notice that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 2|x-2y| = 40$, so $|x-2y| = 20$.

Now we have two cases to consider:
Case 1: $x - 2y \geq 0$, then $x - 2y = 20$, or $x = 2y + 20$.

Case 2: $x - 2y < 0$, then $- (x - 2y) = 20$, or $x = 2y - 20$.

We substitute $x = 2y + 20$ into $5(x-y)^2 + 2xy$ to get
\begin{align*}
5(2y+20-y)^2 + 2(2y+20)y &= 5(y+20)^2 + 4y(y+10) \\
&= 5(y^2+40y+400) + 4y^2+40y \\
&= 5y^2 + 200y + 2000 + 4y^2 + 40y \\
&= 9y^2 + 240y + 2000.
\end{align*}

Similarly, substituting $x = 2y - 20$ into $5(x-y)^2 + 2xy$ we get
\begin{align*}
5(2y-20-y)^2 + 2(2y-20)y &= 5(y-20)^2 + 4y(y-10) \\
&= 5(y^2-40y+400) + 4y^2-40y \\
&= 5y^2 - 200y + 2000 + 4y^2 - 40y \\
&= 9y^2 - 240y + 2000.
\end{align*}

Comparing these two expressions, we see that they are both equal to $9y^2 \pm 240y + 2000$, which is a quadratic in $y$. The minimum value of a quadratic $ax^2 + bx + c$ is achieved at $x = -\frac{b}{2a}$, so the minimum value of $9y^2 \pm 240y + 2000$ is achieved at $y = -\frac{\pm 240}{2 \cdot 9} = \mp \frac{40}{3}$.

Substituting $y = -\frac{40}{3}$ into either expression, we get the minimum value
\begin{align*}
9\left(-\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 \pm 240\left(-\frac{40}{3}\right) + 2000 &= 9 \cdot \frac{1600}{9} \mp 3200 + 2000 \\
&= 1600 \mp 3200 + 2000 \\
&= -1600 + 2000 \\
&= 400.
\end{align*}

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $400$. The answer is: $\boxed{400}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We are given the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ and the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
We can rewrite the condition as $|x-2y| + |2x-y| = 40$.
Using the property $|a| + |b| = |a+b| + |a-b|$, we have $|(x-2y) + (2x-y)| + |(x-2y) - (2x-y)| = 40$.
Simplifying, we get $|3x-3y| + |-x+y| = 40$, or $3|x-y| + |x-y| = 40$.
Combining like terms, we have $4|x-y| = 40$, so $|x-y| = 10$.
Now we can use the property $|a| = b$ implies $a = b$ or $a = -b$ to find two cases to consider:
Case 1: $x-y = 10$.
Rearranging, we have $x = y + 10$.
Substituting into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get $5(y+10)^2 + 5y^2 - 8y(y+10)$.
Expanding and simplifying, we have $5(y^2 + 20y + 100) + 5y^2 - 8y^2 - 80y$, or $10y^2 + 100y + 500 - 3y^2 - 80y$, which simplifies to $7y^2 - 20y + 500$.

Case 2: $x-y = -10$.
Rearranging, we have $x = y - 10$.
Substituting into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get $5(y-10)^2 + 5y^2 - 8y(y-10)$.
Expanding and simplifying, we have $5(y^2 - 20y + 100) + 5y^2 - 8y^2 + 80y$, or $10y^2 - 200y + 500 + 5y^2 - 8y^2 + 80y$, which simplifies to $7y^2 - 120y + 500$.

Now we need to find the minimum value of both of these expressions.
For the first expression $7y^2 - 20y + 500$, the minimum occurs at $y = \frac{20}{14} = \frac{10}{7}$.
Substituting this value into the expression, we get $7\left(\frac{10}{7}\right)^2 - 20\left(\frac{10}{7}\right) + 500 = \frac{100}{7} - \frac{200}{7} + 500 = \frac{300}{7} + 500$.
For the second expression $7y^2 - 120y + 500$, the minimum occurs at $y = \frac{120}{14} = \frac{60}{7}$.
Substituting this value into the expression, we get $7\left(\frac{60}{7}\right)^2 - 120\left(\frac{60}{7}\right) + 500 = \frac{2520}{7} - \frac{7200}{7} + 500 = \frac{-4680}{7} + 500$.
Comparing the two expressions, we see that the minimum value occurs for the first case.
So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\frac{300}{7} + 500$.

However, this is not a whole number, so there must be an error in our work.
Let's reevaluate the conditions:
We know $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
We also know $|x-y| = 10$.
We have two possible cases to consider:
Case 1: $x-y = 10$.
Substituting into $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we have $|10| + |-10| = 20$, which is not equal to 40.
So this case does not satisfy the condition.
Case 2: $x-y = -10$.
Substituting into $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we have $|-10| + |30| = 40$, which is equal to 40.
So this case does satisfy the condition.
We only need to consider this case.
We already found the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ for this case to be $\frac{300}{7} + 500$.
However, this is not a whole number, so there must be an error in our work.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, we can rewrite the given equation as $|(2y - x) - (y - 2x)| = 40$, which simplifies to $|y + x| = 40$.
This implies that $y + x = 40$ or $y + x = -40$.

Now, we substitute $y = -\frac{x}{2} + 20$ and $y = -\frac{x}{2} - 20$ into $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, respectively.

For $y = -\frac{x}{2} + 20$:
$5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5x^2 + 5(-\frac{x}{2} + 20)^2 - 8x(-\frac{x}{2} + 20)$
$= 5x^2 + 5(\frac{x^2}{4} - 20x + 400) + 4x^2 - 160x$
$= \frac{25x^2}{4} + 20x^2 - 100x + 2000$
$= \frac{125x^2 + 80x^2 - 400x + 8000}{4}$
$= \frac{205x^2 - 400x + 8000}{4}$

For $y = -\frac{x}{2} - 20$:
$5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5x^2 + 5(-\frac{x}{2} - 20)^2 - 8x(-\frac{x}{2} - 20)$
$= 5x^2 + 5(\frac{x^2}{4} + 20x + 400) + 4x^2 + 160x$
$= \frac{25x^2}{4} + 20x^2 + 100x + 2000$
$= \frac{125x^2 + 80x^2 + 400x + 8000}{4}$
$= \frac{205x^2 + 400x + 8000}{4}$

Now, we can differentiate both expressions with respect to $x$ and find the minimum value.

For the first expression, $\frac{d}{dx}(\frac{205x^2 - 400x + 8000}{4}) = \frac{410x - 400}{4}$. Setting this equal to 0, we get $x = \frac{400}{410} = \frac{40}{41}$.

For the second expression, $\frac{d}{dx}(\frac{205x^2 + 400x + 8000}{4}) = \frac{410x + 400}{4}$. Setting this equal to 0, we get $x = -\frac{400}{410} = -\frac{40}{41}$.

Substituting $x = \frac{40}{41}$ into $y = -\frac{x}{2} + 20$ and $y = -\frac{x}{2} - 20$, we get $y = 20 - \frac{20}{41} = \frac{780}{41}$ and $y = -20 - \frac{20}{41} = -\frac{860}{41}$, respectively.

Finally, we substitute $x = \frac{40}{41}$ and $y = \frac{780}{41}$ into $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to find the minimum value.

$5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(\frac{40}{41})^2 + 5(\frac{780}{41})^2 - 8(\frac{40}{41})(\frac{780}{41})$
$= \frac{8000}{1681} + \frac{1560000}{1681} - \frac{249600}{1681}$
$= \frac{8000 + 929040 - 147840}{1681}$
$= \frac{756200}{1681}$
$= 448$

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $448$. The answer is: $448$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, let's look at the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. We can rewrite it as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$.
Using the property $|a| + |b| = |a+b| + |a-b|$, we can simplify this equation to $|2y-x + 2x-y| + |2y-x - (2x-y)| = 40$, which simplifies further to $|y+x| + |-x-y| = 40$, and then $|y+x| + |x+y| = 40$.
Since $|a| = |-a|$ for any real number $a$, we can replace $|y+x|$ with $|x+y|$, so we have $|x+y| + |x+y| = 40$, or $2|x+y| = 40$, or $|x+y| = 20$.
Now, let's look at the expression we want to minimize: $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite this as $5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy$.
We can use the identity $(a-b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2$ to rewrite $x^2+y^2$ as $(x+y)^2 - 2xy$. Substituting this into our expression gives $5((x+y)^2 - 2xy) - 8xy = 5(x+y)^2 - 18xy$.
We know that $|x+y| = 20$, so $(x+y)^2 \geq 0$, and $5(x+y)^2 \geq 0$.
Also, $-18xy \leq 0$, since the product of two numbers with opposite signs is always negative.
Therefore, $5(x+y)^2 - 18xy \geq 0$.
Hence, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0.

The answer is: $0$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, let's simplify the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.

We can use the property $|a-b| = |-(b-a)|$ to rewrite the equation as $|x-2y| + |-2(x-y)| = 40$.

Then, we can simplify further to get $|x-2y| + |2(y-x)| = 40$, which simplifies to $|x-2y| + |2y-2x| = 40$, or $|x-2y| + |-2(x-y)| = 40$.

Again using the property $|a-b| = |-(b-a)|$, this simplifies to $|x-2y| + |-2(y-x)| = 40$, or $|x-2y| + |-2y+2x| = 40$.

Now, $|x-2y| + |-2y+2x| = 40$ simplifies to $|x-2y| + |-2(y-x)| = 40$, which is equal to $|x-2y| + |2(x-y)| = 40$.

Finally, we can use the property $|a+b| = |a| + |b|$ to rewrite this as $|x-2y + 2(x-y)| = 40$, or $|x-2y + 2x-2y| = 40$.

This simplifies to $|3x-4y| = 40$.

Now, let's consider the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite it as $5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy$.

We know that $(x-2y)^2 + (2x-y)^2 = (3x-4y)^2$. Expanding both sides gives:
\[ x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2 + 4x^2 - 4xy + y^2 = 9x^2 - 24xy + 16y^2 \].
Simplifying this gives:
\[ 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = (3x-4y)^2 \].

So, the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is equal to $(3x-4y)^2$.

Since $|3x-4y| = 40$, the minimum value of $(3x-4y)^2$ is $0$ (when $3x-4y = 0$).

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $0$. The answer is: $0$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, we can rewrite the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$.
By the Triangle Inequality, we have $|2y-x| + |2x-y| \geq |(2y-x) - (2x-y)| = |y-3x| = 40$.
Therefore, we have $|y-3x| = 40$.
Now, let $u = y-3x$. Then $y = 3x + u$, and we substitute this into the expression we want to minimize:
$5x^2 + 5(3x+u)^2 - 8x(3x+u) = 5x^2 + 45x^2 + 30ux + 5u^2 - 24x^2 - 8ux = 26x^2 + 22ux + 5u^2$.

Now, we want to minimize this expression. To do this, we can complete the square:
$26x^2 + 22ux + 5u^2 = (5u^2 + 22ux + 121x^2/5) - 121x^2/5 + 26x^2 = (5u^2 + 22ux + 121x^2/5) + 26x^2 - 121x^2/5 = (5u^2 + 22ux + 121x^2/5) + 26x^2/5$.

Since $(5u^2 + 22ux + 121x^2/5)$ is always nonnegative, the minimum value of $26x^2 + 22ux + 5u^2$ is achieved when $(5u^2 + 22ux + 121x^2/5) = 0$, which means $u = -11x/5$.

Substituting $u = -11x/5$ into $|y-3x| = 40$, we get $|y - 3x + 11x/5| = 40$, which simplifies to $|5y - 16x| = 200$.

Substituting $y = 3x - 11x/5 = 14x/5$ into this equation, we get $|-70x + 16x| = 200$, which simplifies to $|-54x| = 200$. Since $|54x| = 200$, we have $x = \pm \frac{100}{27}$.

Substituting these values of $x$ into $y = 14x/5$, we get $y = \pm \frac{140}{27}$.

Now, we can substitute these values of $x$ and $y$ into the expression $26x^2 + 22ux + 5u^2$ to find its minimum value. We find that the minimum value is $-400$.
The answer is: $-\boxed{400}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We have the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, we know that $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$, so we have
$|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |(x-2y) + (y-2x)| = |x-2y+y-2x| = |-x-y| = |-(x+y)| = |x+y|$.
Thus, $|x+y| = 40$.
Now, let $s = x+y$ and $p = xy$. Then we have
$5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x+y)^2 - 2xy] - 8xy = 5[s^2 - 2p] - 8p$.
From $|x+y| = 40$, we have $s = 40$.
So the expression becomes $5[40^2 - 2p] - 8p = 8000 - 10p - 8p = 8000 - 18p$.
To minimize this expression, we need to maximize $p = xy$.
By AM-GM, $(x+y)^2/4 \geq xy$, so $40^2/4 \geq xy$, which means $400 \geq xy$. Hence, $p = xy \leq 400$.
Equality occurs when $x = y$, so $x = y = 20$. Therefore, the maximum value of $p$ is 400.
Substituting this back into the expression $8000 - 18p$, we get $8000 - 18(400) = 8000 - 7200 = 800$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 800.
The answer is: $800$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, let's rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $\frac{5}{2}((x-y)^2 + (x+y)^2)$.

Now, let's consider the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. Without loss of generality, we can assume that $x - 2y \ge 0$ and $y - 2x \ge 0$. This means that $x \ge 2y$ and $y \ge 2x$. If this is not the case, we can simply swap $x$ and $y$ or negate one of them without changing the value of the left-hand side of the equation. Under these conditions, the equation simplifies to:
\[x - 2y + 2x - y = 40.\]
This further simplifies to:
\[3x - 3y = 40 \Rightarrow x - y = \frac{40}{3}.\]

Now, we know that $(x - y)^2 + (x + y)^2$ is minimized when $x - y = 0$ because $(x - y)^2$ is always nonnegative, and the sum of two nonnegative quantities is minimized when both quantities are zero. This means that the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ occurs when $x = y$.

Substituting $x = y$ into the equation $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$, we get $0 = \frac{40}{3}$, which is a contradiction. So, we must have made a mistake in our reasoning.

Let's reconsider the constraint. We know that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. Again without loss of generality, we can assume that $x - 2y \ge 0$ and $y - 2x \ge 0$. This means that $x \ge 2y$ and $y \ge 2x$. If this is not the case, we can simply swap $x$ and $y$ or negate one of them without changing the value of the left-hand side of the equation. Under these conditions, the equation simplifies to:
\[x - 2y + 2x - y = 40.\]
This further simplifies to:
\[3x - 3y = 40 \Rightarrow x - y = \frac{40}{3}.\]

Now, let's consider another case: if $x - 2y \le 0$ and $y - 2x \ge 0$, then we have $x \le 2y$ and $y \ge 2x$. The equation then becomes:
\[-x + 2y + 2x - y = 40,\]
which simplifies to:
\[x + y = 40.\]

Similarly, if $x - 2y \ge 0$ and $y - 2x \le 0$, we get:
\[x - 2y - 2x + y = 40,\]
which simplifies to:
\[-x - y = 40,\]
or equivalently:
\[x + y = -40.\]

This is clearly impossible because $x$ and $y$ cannot both be positive and negative at the same time. Therefore, we must have made an error in our earlier reasoning.

To find the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we need to consider all possible combinations of the absolute values in the constraint equation. It turns out that the only valid case is when $x - 2y \le 0$ and $y - 2x \ge 0$. In this case, we have $x \le 2y$ and $y \ge 2x$, and the equation becomes:
\[-x + 2y + 2x - y = 40,\]
which simplifies to:
\[x + y = 40.\]

Let's substitute $x = y - \frac{40}{3}$ into this equation:
\[y - \frac{40}{3} + y = 40,\]
which simplifies to:
\[2y = \frac{160}{3},\]
and then:
\[y = \frac{80}{3}.\]
Substituting this back into $x = y - \frac{40}{3}$, we get:
\[x = \frac{40}{3}.\]

Now, we can find the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
\[5\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2+5\left(\frac{80}{3}\right)^2-8\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)\left(\frac{80}{3}\right).\]
Evaluating this expression, we get:
\[\frac{5(1600/9) + 5(6400/9) - 8(3200/9)}{1} = \frac{8000}{9}.\]

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $\frac{8000}{9}$. The answer is: $\boxed{\frac{8000}{9}}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's simplify the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
We know that $|a| = |-a|$ for any real number $a$, so we can replace $|x-2y|$ with $|2y-x|$ and $|y-2x|$ with $|2x-y|$ without changing the equation.
Then, the equation becomes $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, we know that $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$, so
$|2y-x| + |2x-y| \geq |(2y-x) + (2x-y)| = |y| = |-(2x-y)| = |-2x+y|$.
Therefore, $|2y-x| + |2x-y| \geq |-2x+y|$, and so $|2y-x| + |2x-y| \geq |-2x+y| = |-2(x-y)| = 2|x-y|$.
So, $2|x-y| \leq 40$ and $|x-y| \leq 20$.
Now, let's substitute $x-y = t$. Then, $x = y + t$, and the given expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ becomes
\[5(y+t)^2 + 5y^2 - 8y(y+t) = 5(y^2 + 2yt + t^2) + 5y^2 - 8y^2 - 8yt = 5y^2 + 10yt + 5t^2 - 3y^2 - 8yt = 2y^2 + 2yt + 5t^2 = (y + t)^2 + 3t^2.\]
We want to minimize this expression, given that $|x-y| = |t| \leq 20$.
To minimize $(y+t)^2 + 3t^2$, we set $y+t = 0$, so $y = -t$. Then the expression becomes $3t^2$.
Since $|t| \leq 20$, we know that $0 \leq 3t^2 \leq 3(20)^2 = 1200$.
Therefore, the minimum value of the given expression is 0.
The answer is: $0$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's rewrite the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, we have $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$ for all real numbers $a$ and $b$.
So we have $|x-2y| + |2y-x| \geq |(x-2y) + (2y-x)| = |0| = 0$.
The equality condition of the triangle inequality is satisfied when $a$ and $b$ have the same sign, or equivalently when $(x-2y)(2y-x) \geq 0$.
Expanding this, we get $4y^2 - 3xy + x^2 \geq 0$.
This simplifies to $(2y-x)^2 \geq 0$, which is always true.
So the equality condition is met, and we can apply the triangle inequality to the given equation to find the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.
The expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ can be written as $\frac{1}{2}((x-2y)^2 + (2y-x)^2)$.
By the triangle inequality, we have $(x-2y)^2 + (2y-x)^2 \geq 0$.
Multiplying both sides by $\frac{1}{2}$ gives $\frac{1}{2}((x-2y)^2 + (2y-x)^2) \geq 0$.
So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0.
The answer is: $0$
