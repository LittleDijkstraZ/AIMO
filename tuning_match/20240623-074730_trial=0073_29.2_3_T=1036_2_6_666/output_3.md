Here's the step by step solution:



The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. According to the zero product property, the product of two factors is zero if and only if at least one of the factors is zero. Therefore, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first case, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)$ must be zero. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, and $(-10, 0)$.

For the second case, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, both $(\vert x \vert - 8)$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)$ must be zero. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The two squares overlap at the origin $(0, 0)$, and together they form a larger square with side length $10 + 8 = 18$. The area of this square is $18^2 = 324$. So, the area of the convex polygon is $324$ square units.

Here is a Python code to compute the area of the convex polygon:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    side_length = 10 + 8
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 324

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
324
```
The area of the convex polygon is $324$ square units. The answer is $\boxed{324}$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Here's the step by step solution:



The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ equals to zero if and only if at least one of the factors equals to zero. 

So either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, -2)$, and $(-8, 2)$.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$.

The union of these two squares is the convex polygon whose area we need to find. The side length of each square is $20$, so the area of each square is $(20)^2 = 400$. Since there are two squares, the total area of the convex polygon is $2 \times 400 = 800$.

So the area of the convex polygon is $800$.

Here is a Python code to calculate the area of the polygon:
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    side_length = 20
    square_area = side_length ** 2
    number_of_squares = 2
    total_area = number_of_squares * square_area
    return total_area

total_area = polygon_area()
print(total_area)
```

CODE RESULTS 800

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
800
```
The area of the convex polygon is $800$. The answer is $\boxed{800}$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Here's the step by step solution:



Step 1: Analyzing the given equation, we notice that it equals to zero if either of the two terms equals to zero. That is,
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$$
or
$$((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$

Step 2: The first term equals to zero if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length 10.

Step 3: The second term equals to zero if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length 16.

Step 4: The convex polygon enclosed by the points satisfying the given equation is the intersection of the two squares. This intersection is a smaller square with side length 10.

Step 5: The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100.

So, the answer is: $100$. The area of the convex polygon is $100$ square units.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    side_length = 10
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 100

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
100
```
The area of the convex polygon is $100$ square units. The answer is $\boxed{100}$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

Here's the step by step solution:



The equation is satisfied if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
If $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$, which implies $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
If $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

These conditions define a square with vertices at $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$. The side length of the square is $16$, so the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Here's the step by step solution:



1. The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So, we have two cases to consider:
   Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
   Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

2. For Case 1, if $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. Similarly, if $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points must satisfy the condition $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

3. For Case 2, if $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$. Similarly, if $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that the points must satisfy the condition $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

4. The points that satisfy both Case 1 and Case 2 are the vertices of a square with side length 10 (since $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ imply that the square is formed by the points $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, -2)$, and $(-8, 2)$).

5. The area of this square is side length squared, which is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$
