Certainly! let's derive the algebraic expression step by step:



The given expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$

For this product to be zero, one of the factors must be zero. So we have two cases:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
This implies that both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$.
So $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
This gives us $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.
Solving these equations, we get the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
This implies that both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.
So $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
This gives us $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
So we get the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersection points of these lines are the vertices of the polygon: $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

To find the area of the polygon, we can use the formula for the area of a square: $A = side^2$. The length of the side of the square is the distance between any two adjacent vertices, which can be found using the distance formula: $d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$.

For example, the distance between $(8,8)$ and $(8,-8)$ is $d = \sqrt{(8 - (-8))^2 + (8 - 8)^2} = \sqrt{16^2 + 0^2} = 16$. So the side length of the square is 16.

Now we can find the area of the square: $A = side^2 = 16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$ square units.

Certainly! let's derive the algebraic expression step by step:



The given expression is $ ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. In order for the product of two numbers to be zero, at least one of the numbers must be zero. This implies that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we find that the four points are $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0)$.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So the four points are $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$.

Therefore, the convex polygon is a square with side length $10$. The area of the square is $10^2 = 100$.

Now let's implement this in a program:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    side_length = 10
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 100

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
100
```
The area of the convex polygon is $100$.
The answer is: $100$

Certainly! let's derive the algebraic expression step by step:



We know that $A \cdot B = 0$ if and only if either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. So, we have two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This means that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This can only happen when $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$. So we have four points: $(10, 10)$, $(10, -10)$, $(-10, 10)$, $(-10, -10)$.

2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This means that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This can only happen when $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So we have four points: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$.

The eight points above form a square with side length 20. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $20^2 = 400$.

Here is a Python code to verify the answer:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    # The side length of the square
    side_length = 20
    # The area of the square
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 400

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
400
```
The area of the convex polygon is 400. The answer is: 400.

Analyze the problem and derive an algebraic expression for the solution. Implement this expression in a program, commenting your code for clarity. Verify the solution's correctness. Output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Certainly! let's derive the algebraic expression step by step:



First, the product of two numbers equals zero if and only if at least one of them is zero. So the equation is equivalent to:

$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$$
or
$$((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$

In the first case, we have:
$$\vert x + y \vert = 10, \quad \vert x - y \vert = 10.$$
This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$, which gives us four equations:
$$x + y = 10, \quad x + y = -10, \quad x - y = 10, \quad x - y = -10.$$
Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the polygon:
$$(5,5), (5,-5), (-5,5), (-5,-5).$$

In the second case, we have:
$$\vert x \vert = 8, \quad \vert y \vert = 8.$$
This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$, which gives us four more vertices:
$$(8,8), (8,-8), (-8,8), (-8,-8).$$

So the polygon is a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $100$.

Here is a Python code to calculate the area:
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    # The side length of the square
    side_length = 10

    # The area of the square
    area = side_length ** 2

    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 100

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
100
```
The area of the convex polygon is $100$. The answer is: $100$
