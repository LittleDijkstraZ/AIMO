 The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

We first note that the right-hand side of the equation is always positive, so the number of solutions to the equation will be determined by the number of times the graph of $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ intersects the line $y = \frac{m}{100}$.

The graph of $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a V-shape with the vertices at $(1-2,0)$, $(1,0)$, and $(1+2,0)$, which are $(-1,0)$, $(1,0)$, and $(3,0)$, respectively. The graph is symmetric about the vertical line $x=1$.

The line $y = \frac{m}{100}$ is a horizontal line at a height of $\frac{m}{100}$.

For the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, the line $y = \frac{m}{100}$ must intersect the graph in four distinct points. This occurs when $\frac{m}{100}$ falls strictly between the $y$-coordinates of the two lower peaks of the graph.

The $y$-coordinates of the lower peaks are both 2. So the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be strictly between 0 and 2. That is, $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which implies $0 < m < 200$.

The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from 1 to 199. Therefore, there are 199 positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. The answer is: $199$.

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.
Let's first consider the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=0$.
This equation simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$, which further simplifies to $x-1 = 2$ or $x-1 = -2$.
So the solutions to the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=0$ are $x=3$ and $x=-1$.
Now let's consider the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ with $m > 0$.
For this equation to have 4 distinct solutions, the graph of $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ must intersect the line $y = \frac{m}{100}$ at 4 distinct points.
This means that $\frac{m}{100}$ must be strictly between $0$ and $2$, so $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$.
Multiplying all sides of the inequalities by $100$ gives $0 < m < 200$.
The value of $m$ is a positive integer, so the possible values of $m$ are the integers from 1 to 199.
Therefore, there are $\boxed{199}$ possible values of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.
The answer is: $199$

Assistant:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions. We know that the right side of the equation is nonnegative, so $m$ must be a nonnegative integer. The left side of the equation is a piecewise function that takes on three different forms depending on the value of $x$. We can break the solution into cases based on the value of $\frac{m}{100}$.

Case 1: $\frac{m}{100} < 2$

In this case, the equation becomes $\vert x-1 \vert - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. This equation has no solutions for $x$ because $\vert x-1 \vert$ is always nonnegative, but the right side is always greater than 2.

Case 2: $2 \leq \frac{m}{100} < 3$

In this case, the equation becomes $\vert x-1 \vert - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. This equation has two solutions for $x$, one when $(x-1) = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ and one when $(x-1) = -(2 + \frac{m}{100})$. Simplifying these gives $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = - \frac{m}{100} + 1$. These two solutions are distinct if and only if $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq - \frac{m}{100} + 1$, which simplifies to $m \neq -200$. Since $m$ is a positive integer, this condition is always satisfied.

Case 3: $\frac{m}{100} \geq 3$

In this case, the equation becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert x-1 \vert - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. This equation has four distinct solutions for $x$, one when $(x-1) = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, one when $(x-1) = -(2 + \frac{m}{100})$, one when $(x-1) = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, and one when $(x-1) = - (2 - \frac{m}{100})$. Simplifying these gives $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$, $x = - \frac{m}{100} + 1$, $x = 1 - \frac{m}{100}$, and $x = \frac{m}{100} - 1$. These four solutions are distinct if and only if $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq - \frac{m}{100} + 1$, $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq 1 - \frac{m}{100}$, $- \frac{m}{100} + 1 \neq 1 - \frac{m}{100}$, and $- \frac{m}{100} + 1 \neq \frac{m}{100} - 1$. These conditions are always satisfied.

Therefore, the only case in which the equation has four distinct solutions is Case 3, where $\frac{m}{100} \geq 3$. The smallest such value of $m$ is $300$, and the largest such value of $m$ is any integer greater than or equal to $300$. Therefore, the number of possible values of $m$ is infinite. However, the problem only asks for the number of positive integer values of $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions. Since the only case in which the equation has four distinct solutions is Case 3, and we have shown that this occurs for $\frac{m}{100} \geq 3$, or $m \geq 300$, the only positive integer values of $m$ that satisfy the condition are the integers from $300$ to infinity. The number of such positive integers is infinite. However, the problem asks for the number of positive integer values of $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions, and we have shown that this occurs only when $m \geq 300$. Therefore, the number of positive integer values of $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is the number of positive integers greater than or equal to $300$. The only positive integer greater than or equal to $300$ is $300$ itself. Thus, there is only one positive integer value of $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions. The answer is: 1

Assistant:


For the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ to have four distinct solutions, the right side must be strictly between 0 and 3. This is because the absolute value function reaches its maximum value of 2 at $|x - 1| = 2$, and then decreases to 0 as $|x - 1|$ goes to $\pm \infty$. Thus, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be in the interval $(0,3)$. This gives us $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 3$, or $0 < m < 300$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are $1, 2, 3, \ldots, 299$.
The number of such integers is $299$.
The value of $m$ is 299.
The answer is: $299$

Assistant:

 The problem asks for how many values of $m$ does the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have four distinct solutions. The right side of the equation is $\frac{m}{100}$, and since $m$ is a positive integer, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be positive. Therefore, the absolute value of the left side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, must also be positive. This means that $\vert x-1 \vert -2 > 0$, or $\vert x-1 \vert > 2$.
This implies that $x-1 > 2$ or $x-1 < -2$. Solving these two inequalities gives $x > 3$ or $x < -1$. So the solutions for $x$ must be less than -1 or greater than 3.
Now let's consider the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. The left side can be equal to $\frac{m}{100}$ in four different ways:
1. When $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. Since $\vert x-1 \vert > 2$, this means $x-1 > 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, or $x > 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.
2. When $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. Since $\vert x-1 \vert > 2$, this means $x-1 < -2 + \frac{m}{100}$, or $x < -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.
3. When $-\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, we have $-\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. This is equivalent to $\vert x-1 \vert = -2 - \frac{m}{100}$. Since $\vert x-1 \vert > 2$, this is impossible because the right side is negative.
4. When $-\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$, we have $-\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. This is equivalent to $\vert x-1 \vert = -2 + \frac{m}{100}$. Since $\vert x-1 \vert > 2$, this is also impossible because the right side is negative.
So the only two possible cases for the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ are:
1. $x > 3 + \frac{m}{100}$, and
2. $x < -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.
For these two cases to have four distinct solutions, the distance between $3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $-1 + \frac{m}{100}$ must be greater than $2$. This gives us the inequality $4 + \frac{2m}{100} > 2$, or $m > 50$.
Since $m$ is a positive integer, the smallest integer greater than 50 is 51. So there is only one value of $m$ that makes the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have four distinct solutions, and that value is $m=51$. The answer is: $1$

The problem requires us to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

We can start by considering the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. The function $f(x)$ has a graph which is a series of "V"s, with the points of the "V"s moving as $m$ changes. The number of distinct solutions to the equation $f(x) = \frac{m}{100}$ is equal to the number of "V"s the graph intersects at $y = \frac{m}{100}$.

The function $f(x)$ reaches a maximum value of $3$ at $x = 1$, a minimum value of $-1$ at $x = 3$, and a maximum value of $1$ at $x = 5$, before reaching a minimum value of $-3$ at $x = 7$. The function then repeats this pattern.

For the equation to have $4$ distinct solutions, we need $\frac{m}{100}$ to fall within the interval $(1,3)$. This means $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 3$, or $100 < m < 300$. The positive integers in this interval are the numbers from $101$ to $299$, inclusive. There are $199$ such numbers.

Therefore, there are $199$ positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. The answer is: $199$.

Assistant:

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

The absolute value function $\vert x \vert$ is defined as:
\[
\vert x \vert = \begin{cases} 
x & \text{if } x \geq 0 \\
-x & \text{if } x < 0 
\end{cases}
\]
Applying this to the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, we have four cases to consider:

Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$.

Case 2: $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = \frac{m}{100}$.

Case 3: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.

Case 4: $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.

Solving each case, we find that only in Case 1 and Case 2, the equation has 4 distinct solutions. 

Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$.
$\Rightarrow \vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100} +2$.
$\Rightarrow x-1 = \frac{m}{100} +2$ or $x-1 = -(\frac{m}{100} +2)$.
$\Rightarrow x = \frac{m}{100} +3$ or $x = 1 - \frac{m}{100} -2$.
$\Rightarrow x = \frac{m}{100} +3$ or $x = 1 - \frac{m}{100} -2$.
$\Rightarrow x = \frac{m}{100} +3$ or $x = 1 - \frac{m}{100} -2$.
$\Rightarrow x = \frac{m}{100} +3$ or $x = 1 - \frac{m}{100} -2$.
$\Rightarrow x = \frac{m}{100} +3$ or $x = 1 - \frac{m}{100} -2$.
$\Rightarrow x = \frac{m}{100} +3$ or $x = 1 - \frac{m}{100} -2$.
$\Rightarrow x = \frac{m}{100} +3$ or $x = 1 - \frac{m}{100} -2$.
$\Rightarrow x = \frac{m}{100} +3$ or $x = 1 - \frac{m}{100} -2$.
$\Rightarrow x = \frac{m}{100} +3$ or $x = 1 - \frac{m}{100} -2$.

Case 2: $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = \frac{m}{100}$.
$\Rightarrow -\vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100} -2$.
$\Rightarrow \vert x-1 \vert = -(\frac{m}{100} -2)$.
Since the absolute value is always non-negative, this equation has no solution.

From Case 1, we see that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100} +3 > 1 - \frac{m}{100} -2$.

Solving this inequality, we get $m < 150$.

Since $m$ is a positive integer, the possible values of $m$ are 1, 2, ..., 149.

So, there are 149 possible values of $m$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 149. The answer is: $149$

The problem is asking for how many positive integers $m$ does the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have $4$ distinct solutions.

To solve this problem, we first need to understand the nature of the equation. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is a combination of absolute value equations. The solutions to this equation will be the values of $x$ that make the equation true.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $2$, i.e., $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$.

Multiplying through by $100$, we get $100 < m < 200$.

Now, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality. The smallest positive integer greater than $100$ is $101$, and the largest positive integer less than $200$ is $199$.

To find the number of integers from $101$ to $199$, inclusive, we subtract the smaller integer from the larger one and add $1$:

$199 - 101 + 1 = 99$.

So, there are $99$ positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions.
The answer is: $99$

 The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions.

First, we know that $\frac{m}{100}$ is a positive number, so $m$ must be a positive integer.

Next, we consider the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. The graph of this function is a series of V-shapes, with the vertex of each V at $x = 1 \pm 2$, or $x = -1$ and $x = 3$. The function takes the value of $0$ at these points, and strictly positive values elsewhere.

Therefore, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have four distinct solutions if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly less than the distance between the vertex at $x=-1$ and the vertex at $x=3$, which is $4$. So $\frac{m}{100} < 4$. This implies $m < 400$.

The greatest integer less than $400$ is $399$, and since $m$ is a positive integer, the possible values for $m$ are $1$ to $399$. So, the number of possible values for $m$ is $399$. However, we need to check if the equation actually has $4$ distinct solutions for each $m$.

We know that $f(x)$ is a V-shaped function, with the distance between each "V" being $\frac{m}{100}$. For $f(x) = \frac{m}{100}$, the equation will have $4$ distinct solutions if $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 1$. This means $0 < m < 100$.

Therefore, the values of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions are from $1$ to $99$. The number of such values is $99$. So, the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $99$.
The answer is: $99$

Assistant:

 To solve this problem, we need to understand the properties of the absolute value function and the equation we are given. The equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has 4 distinct solutions. This means that the absolute value expression inside the equation will have two intervals where it equals a constant.

Let's denote $y = \vert x-1 \vert$. Then the equation becomes $\vert y - 2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$. This implies that $y - 2 = \pm \frac{m}{100}$.

So we have two cases:
1. $y - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$, which gives $y = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.
2. $y - 2 = -\frac{m}{100}$, which gives $y = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Now we substitute $y = \vert x-1 \vert$ back into the equations:
1. $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$,
2. $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.

The absolute value function $\vert x-1 \vert$ splits into two intervals: $x - 1$ when $x \geq 1$, and $1 - x$ when $x < 1$. So we have four sub-cases to consider:

1. For $x \geq 1$, we have:
   a. $x - 1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which gives $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.
   b. $x - 1 = -2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which gives $x = \frac{m}{100} - 1$.

2. For $x < 1$, we have:
   c. $1 - x = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which gives $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.
   d. $1 - x = -2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which gives $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.

For the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, we need the upper and lower bounds of the four intervals to be different. This gives us the following inequalities:

1. $3 + \frac{m}{100} > -1 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $m > -75$.
2. $3 + \frac{m}{100} > 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $m > 0$.
3. $-1 - \frac{m}{100} < 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $m < 75$.
4. $-1 - \frac{m}{100} < \frac{m}{100} - 1$, which simplifies to $m > 25$.

Therefore, the possible values of $m$ are those in the intersection of the four intervals, which is $25 < m < 75$ and $m > 0$. Since $m$ is a positive integer, the possible values of $m$ are from 26 to 74. The number of such $m$ is $74 - 26 + 1 = 49$.

The answer is: $49$

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.
This equation is a combination of absolute values and fractions, which makes it a bit tricky to solve.
However, we can break it down into smaller steps to solve it.

Step 1: Simplify the equation
Firstly, we simplify the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.
We can rewrite this equation as $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = 0.01m$.

Step 2: Solve the equation inside the absolute value
Next, we solve the equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \pm 0.01m$.
We can break this down into two separate equations:
1. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 0.01m$
2. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -0.01m$

Step 3: Solve for $\vert x-1 \vert$ in each equation
Now, we solve for $\vert x-1 \vert$ in each equation:
1. $\vert x-1 \vert = 0.01m + 2$
2. $\vert x-1 \vert = -0.01m + 2$

Step 4: Break down absolute value
Since the absolute value function $\vert x \vert = a$ splits into two cases: $x = a$ or $x = -a$, we can rewrite the above equations as:
1. $x-1 = 0.01m + 2$ or $x-1 = -(0.01m + 2)$
2. $x-1 = -0.01m + 2$ or $x-1 = 0.01m - 2$

Step 5: Solve for $x$ in each equation
Next, we solve for $x$ in each equation:
1. $x = 0.01m + 3$ or $x = -0.01m + 1$
2. $x = -0.01m + 3$ or $x = 0.01m - 1$

Step 6: Determine the conditions
For the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, the above equations must have 4 different solutions.
This occurs when the following conditions are met:
1. $0.01m + 3 > -0.01m + 1 \Rightarrow m < 100$
2. $0.01m + 3 > 0.01m - 1 \Rightarrow m > -300$ (This is always true since $m$ is a positive integer)
3. $-0.01m + 1 > 0.01m - 1 \Rightarrow m < 100$
4. $-0.01m + 1 > -0.01m + 3 \Rightarrow m > -300$ (This is always true since $m$ is a positive integer)
5. $0.01m - 1 < -0.01m + 3 \Rightarrow m < 100$
6. $0.01m - 1 < 0.01m - 1 \Rightarrow m > -300$ (This is always true since $m$ is a positive integer)
7. $-0.01m + 3 < 0.01m - 1 \Rightarrow m > 100$
8. $-0.01m + 3 < -0.01m + 3 \Rightarrow m < -300$ (This is never true since $m$ is a positive integer)

Combining the above conditions, we find that $0 < m < 100$. Since $m$ is a positive integer, the only possible values for $m$ are the integers from 1 to 99. So, there are 99 possible values for $m$.

The answer is: $99$.

To accomplish this, first list the problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge, and thens solve the problem step by step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:


First, let's list the constraints, conditions and related knowledge needed to solve the problem:

1. The equation has four distinct solutions.
2. The equation is of the form $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.
3. We need to find the value of $m$ that satisfies the given conditions.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can have four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $2$. This is because the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, changes its sign behavior at $x=1$. 

So, we have $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which simplifies to $100 < m < 200$. 

The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality. The integers in this range are exactly the integers from $101$ to $199$, inclusive. To find the number of these integers, we subtract the smallest integer in the range from the largest integer in the range and then add $1$ (because both endpoints are included). So, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the conditions is $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$.

So, there are $99$ positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions.

The answer is: $99$.
