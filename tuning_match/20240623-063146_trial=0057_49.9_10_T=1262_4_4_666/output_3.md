Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first list the problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge, and thens solve the problem step by step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints and conditions are:

1. $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$

This equation equals zero if either of the two factors is zero. Hence, we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
This implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

From Case 1, we have a rectangle with vertices at $(8, 12), (-8, 12), (-8, -12), (8, -12)$.
From Case 2, we have a square with side length 16 and vertices at $(8, 8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8), (8, -8)$.

The intersection of the two shapes forms a smaller square with side length 8 and vertices at $(4, 4), (-4, 4), (-4, -4), (4, -4)$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of the large square minus the area of the smaller square. The area of the large square is $16^2 = 256$, and the area of the smaller square is $8^2 = 64$. Hence, the area of the convex polygon is $256 - 64 = 192$. The answer is: $\boxed{192}$

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either one of the expressions must be zero for the equation to hold. This gives us two sets of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From the first and third equations, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
From the second and fourth equations, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

Taking the absolute values into account, we get four systems of equations:

1a. $x + y = 10$ and $x = 8$ and $x - y = 10$ and $y = 8$.
1b. $x + y = -10$ and $x = 8$ and $x - y = -10$ and $y = 8$.
1c. $x + y = 10$ and $x = -8$ and $x - y = 10$ and $y = -8$.
1d. $x + y = -10$ and $x = -8$ and $x - y = -10$ and $y = -8$.

Solving these systems, we find the following solutions:

1a. $(x, y) = (8, 2)$.
1b. $(x, y) = (8, -18)$.
1c. $(x, y) = (-8, 18)$.
1d. $(x, y) = (-8, -2)$.

These four points form a rectangle with side lengths 16 and 20. The area of this rectangle is $16 \times 20 = 320$. So the area of the convex polygon is 320. The answer is: 320

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.

1) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. The square of a real number is zero if and only if the number itself is zero. Therefore, $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

2) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. Similar to the first case, this implies $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, so $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

From the first set of equations, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only way both these equations can be true is if $x = 0$ and $y = 10$ or $x = 10$ and $y = 0$. This gives us two lines: $y = 10 - x$ and $y = x - 10$.

From the second set of equations, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us four lines: $y = 8 - x$, $y = -8 + x$, $y = x - 8$, and $y = -x - 8$.

The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 10 (the maximum value of $x$ or $y$). Thus, the area of the convex polygon is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$.

To accomplish this, first list the problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge, and thens solve the problem step by step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions, and related knowledge are as follows:

1. The equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
2. The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero.
3. The square of a real number is zero if and only if the real number is zero.
4. The absolute value of a real number is zero if and only if the real number is zero.
5. The solution set of the equation is the set of all points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equation.
6. The area of a polygon is the measure of the region enclosed by the polygon.

Now, we solve the problem step by step.

Since the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero, the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From the second condition, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies that either $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two parallel lines with a distance of 10 units between them.

Similarly, from the third condition, either $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies that either $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two parallel lines with a distance of 8 units between them.

The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 10 units.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of the square, which is $10^2 = 100$ square units.
The answer is: $100$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions, and related knowledge are:

1. The equation $A \cdot B = 0$ implies that $A = 0$ or $B = 0$.
2. $\vert x \vert$ and $\vert y \vert$ are always nonnegative.
3. The absolute value function $\vert x \vert = a$ has two solutions: $x = a$ and $x = -a$.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step.

From the equation, we have either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first case, $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. This gives us two possible solutions: $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.

Similarly, for the second case, $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$ implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us two possible solutions: $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.

For the third case, $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ implies $\vert x \vert = 8$. This gives us two possible solutions: $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.

And for the fourth case, $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$ implies $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us two possible solutions: $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

Combining all these solutions, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(8,8), (8,-8), (-8,8), (-8,-8), (10,0), (-10,0), (0,10), (0,-10)$.

The polygon is a square with side length $16$. The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of the polygon is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge are:

1. The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

2. The equation $A^2 = 0$ is satisfied if and only if $A = 0$.

3. So, the problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge reduce to either $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$, $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$, or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.

4. The solutions to these equations are $x + y = 10$, $x - y = 10$, $x = \pm 8$, or $y = \pm 8$.

5. Solving these equations, we get the points $(-10, 10)$, $(10, -10)$, $(8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, $(8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$.

Now, let's plot these points and connect them to form a convex polygon:

- $(-10, 10)$ and $(10, -10)$ form a rectangle with side lengths 20 and 20.
- $(8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, $(8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$ form a square with side length 16.

The convex polygon is formed by the union of this rectangle and this square. The area of the rectangle is $20 \times 20 = 400$, and the area of the square is $16 \times 16 = 256$. The total area of the convex polygon is $400 + 256 = 656$.
The answer is: $656$

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge are as follows:

1. The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero.
2. The absolute value of a real number is always non-negative.
3. The square of a real number is always non-negative.
4. The square of an absolute value is always non-negative.
5. The sum of two non-negative numbers is non-negative.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

The equation given is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

From constraint 1, we know that this equation will be zero if either of the two factors is zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
This can only happen if both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$.
This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
For the absolute values to be equal to 10, both $x + y$ and $x - y$ must be 10 or -10. Solving these two equations, we get $x = 5$ and $y = 5$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This can only happen if both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.
This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
For the absolute values to be equal to 8, both $x$ and $y$ must be 8 or -8.

So, the four vertices of the polygon are $(5, 5)$, $(5, -5)$, $(-5, 5)$, and $(-5, -5)$. These four points form a square.

The length of each side of the square is the distance between any two adjacent vertices. For example, the distance between $(5, 5)$ and $(5, -5)$ can be calculated using the distance formula:
$$\sqrt{(5 - 5)^2 + (5 - (-5))^2} = \sqrt{0 + 10^2} = 10.$$
So, the side length of the square is 10.

The area of a square is the square of the side length, so the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$

 The problem's constraints are:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \implies \vert x + y \vert = 10$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \implies \vert x - y \vert = 10$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \implies \vert x \vert = 8$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \implies \vert y \vert = 8$.
The conditions from the constraints are:
1. For constraint 1, $x + y = \pm 10$.
2. For constraint 2, $x - y = \pm 10$.
3. For constraint 3, $x = \pm 8$.
4. For constraint 4, $y = \pm 8$.
From these conditions, we can find the intersection points of the lines:
1. For condition 1 and condition 3, $(8,2)$ and $(8,-2)$.
2. For condition 1 and condition 4, $(2,8)$ and $(-2,8)$.
3. For condition 2 and condition 3, $(8, -2)$ and $(8,2)$.
4. For condition 2 and condition 4, $(-2,8)$ and $(2,-8)$.
The polygon formed by these points is a square with side length $10$. The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $\boxed{100}$
