Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ is true only when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$, resulting in the points $(5,5)$ and $(-5,-5)$.
2. Similarly, the expression $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, resulting in the points $(8,0)$, $(0,8)$, $(-8,0)$, and $(0,-8)$.
3. The points satisfying both conditions are $(5,5)$, $(-5,-5)$, $(8,0)$, $(0,8)$, $(-8,0)$, and $(0,-8)$, which form a square with side length $10$. The area of the square is $10^2 = 100$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

In the expression, we have product of two expressions equaling zero, which means either of the expressions must be zero. 

So, we have two cases to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
2. One of the expression equals zero but other is not zero, which results in a complex polygon (impossible in this case, as it's a convex polygon).

Now we solve the equations:

For case 1:

$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \implies \vert x + y \vert = 10 \implies x + y = \pm10$

$(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \implies \vert x \vert = 8 \implies x = \pm8$

$(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \implies \vert x - y \vert = 10 \implies x - y = \pm10$

$(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \implies \vert y \vert = 8 \implies y = \pm8$

This gives us a rectangle with length of 16 (from -8 to 8 on x-axis) and width of 20 (from -10 to 10 on y-axis), thus the area of the rectangle is $16 \times 20 = 320$.

The answer is: $\boxed{320}$

We are dealing with absolute values and squared terms, which makes this problem look intimidating. However, the condition $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that either $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$, and either $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$. By solving these four systems of equations, we find that $(x, y)$ must satisfy $x = 5, y = 5$, or $x = -5, y = -5$. Similarly, the condition $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$, which means that either $x = 8$ or $x = -8$, and either $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

Now we plot these points in a plane and connect them with line segments. The four points $(5, 5), (-5, -5), (8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$ form a square with side length $10$. Hence, the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

Let's see how we can implement this using Sympy:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solve, Eq, Abs

def square_area():
    # Variables for x and y
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # Equations
    eq1 = Eq(Abs(x + y), 10)
    eq2 = Eq(Abs(x - y), 10)
    eq3 = Eq(Abs(x), 8)
    eq4 = Eq(Abs(y), 8)

    # Solve for the possible values of x and y
    solutions_1 = solve([eq1, eq3], [x, y])
    solutions_2 = solve([eq2, eq4], [x, y])

    # Get the maximum x and y values
    max_x = max(solutions_1[0][0], solutions_2[0][0])
    max_y = max(solutions_1[0][1], solutions_2[0][1])

    # Calculate the area
    area = max_x * max_y

    return area

result = square_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 16

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output

```
This is not the correct output. Let's re-examine the problem and solution.

The actual solution gives four points $(5, 5), (-5, -5), (8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$. However, the code is not solving for these points correctly. 

The equations $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$ imply that $x = \pm 5$ and $y = \pm 5$. The equations $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$ are already correct.

Let's update the code:

```python

    # Variables for x and y
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    eq3 = Eq(x, 8)
    eq4 = Eq(y, 8)
    eq5 = Eq(x, -8)
    eq6 = Eq(y, -8)

    # Solve for the possible values of x and y

The problem is that we have not correctly obtained the solutions for the equations. 

Let's re-write the equations without the absolute values and solve for the four points separately:

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is a bit complex, but it can be simplified by noticing that a product is zero if at least one of the terms is zero. So we have two possibilities:
1. Either $ ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0 $ or $ ((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0 $.
2. Or both are zero.

In the first case, we have:
$ \vert x + y \vert = 10 $ and $ \vert x - y \vert = 10 $.
From these equations, we can conclude that $ x = \pm 10 $ and $ y = \pm 10 $.

In the second case, we have:
$ \vert x \vert = 8 $ and $ \vert y \vert = 8 $.
From these equations, we can conclude that $ x = \pm 8 $ and $ y = \pm 8 $.

So the points satisfying the equation are:
$ (+10, +10), (-10, -10), (+10, -10), (-10, +10), (+8, +8), (-8, -8), (+8, -8), (-8, +8) $.

These points form a square with side length 20. The area of the square is $ 20^2 = 400 $.

The answer is: $400$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The problem is asking for the area of a polygon where the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the given equation encloses. The polygon is defined by the points that satisfy the equation, and to find these points, we can set each factor of the product to zero and solve for $x$ and $y$.

1. Let's solve $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$: This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which further simplifies to $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.

2. Similarly, solve $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$: This implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which further simplifies to $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.

3. And, solve $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$: This implies $\vert x \vert = 8$, which further simplifies to $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.

4. Also, solve $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$: This implies $\vert y \vert = 8$, which further simplifies to $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

Now we have a system of equations, and we can find the points of intersection by solving these. For each combination of equations, we get the following:

- Intersection of $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$: Solve for $x$ and $y$, we get $x = 10, y = 0$.

- Intersection of $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$: Solve for $x$ and $y$, we get $x = 0, y = 10$.

- Intersection of $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$: Solve for $x$ and $y$, we get $x = -10, y = -20$. This point is not in the first quadrant, so we discard it.

- Intersection of $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$: Solve for $x$ and $y$, we get $x = -10, y = 0$. This point is not unique from the point we got in the first intersection.

- Intersection of $x = 8$ and $y = 8$: Solve for $x$ and $y$, we get $x = 8, y = 8$.

- Intersection of $x = 8$ and $y = -8$: Solve for $x$ and $y$, we get $x = 8, y = -8$.

- Intersection of $x = -8$ and $y = 8$: Solve for $x$ and $y$, we get $x = -8, y = 8$.

- Intersection of $x = -8$ and $y = -8$: Solve for $x$ and $y$, we get $x = -8, y = -8$. This point is not unique from the point we got in the sixth intersection.

So the vertices of the polygon are $(0, 10)$, $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$. Plotting these points, we find a hexagon with side length 10. To find the area, we can use the formula for the area of a regular hexagon with side length $a$, which is $\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2}a^2$. Plugging in $a = 10$, the area of the polygon is $\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2} \times 10^2 = 150\sqrt{3}$. However, this is not a valid solution as the area should be a positive integer.

After revisiting the problem, I realize that I misunderstood the question. The equation should not be simplified like that. The problem is not asking for the points that satisfy the equation, but for the area of the polygon enclosed by these points. 

The vertices of the polygon are the solutions of the system of equations we found. We can use the fact that the diagonals of a regular hexagon with side length $a$ are $a\sqrt{3}$. So, the distance between the points $(0, 10)$ and $(10, 0)$ (or any two opposite vertices) is $10\sqrt{3}$. The area of the hexagon can be found as the product of the length of half the diagonal and the perimeter, which is $6a$. So the area of the hexagon is $\frac{1}{2} \times 10\sqrt{3} \times 6 \times 10 = 300\sqrt{3}$. This still is not a valid solution.

After revisiting again, I realized that I misunderstood the question completely. The equation is satisfied by all points inside the polygon, not on the polygon. So, the polygon is actually a square with side length 16 (the maximum distance any point $(x, y)$ can be from the origin within the constraints $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$). The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. This is the correct solution.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256.

However, it appears that I misunderstood the question again. The equation should not be simplified like that. The problem is not asking for the points that satisfy the equation, but for the area of the polygon enclosed by these points.

The vertices of the polygon are the solutions of the system of equations we found. We can use the fact that the diagonals of a regular hexagon with side length $a$ are $a\sqrt{3}$. So, the distance between the points $(0, 10)$ and $(10, 0)$ (or any two opposite vertices) is $10\sqrt{3}$. The area of the hexagon can be found as the product of the length of half the diagonal and the perimeter, which is $6a$. So the area of the hexagon is $\frac{1}{2} \times 10\sqrt{3} \times 6 \times 10 = 300\sqrt{3}$. This still is not a valid solution.

The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. This is the correct solution.

So the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{256}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The equation $A \cdot B = 0$ implies that at least one of the factors must be zero. So we can either have $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Let's set each of the factors equal to zero separately.

2. For $A = (|x + y| - 10)^2 + (|x - y| - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations for $x$ and $y$, we get four lines $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.

3. For $B = (|x| - 8)^2 + (|y| - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these four equations for $x$ and $y$, we get four lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

4. Now we need to find the intersection points of these lines. The intersection points are the vertices of the polygon. There are 16 intersection points in total.

5. Finally, we need to calculate the area of the polygon. The polygon is a square with side length 16 (because the vertices are the intersections of the lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$), so its area is $16^2 = 256$.

The Python code to calculate the area of the polygon is as follows:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)

The area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is $\boxed{256}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, let's break down the equation:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \implies \vert x + y \vert = 10$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \implies \vert x - y \vert = 10$
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \implies \vert x \vert = 8$
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \implies \vert y \vert = 8$

From 3 and 4, we see that $x$ and $y$ must be in the interval $[-8, 8]$. 

From 1 and 2, we see that the absolute value of $x+y$ and $x-y$ must both be 10. This implies that either $x+y = 10$ or $x+y = -10$, and either $x-y = 10$ or $x-y = -10$. 

By analyzing these four cases, we can determine the shape of the polygon. If we plot the points in the coordinate plane, we can see that the polygon is a square with side length of 16 (since the maximum value of x or y is 8, and when $x+y = 10$ or $x-y = 10$, we have $x = 1$ and $y = 9$, or $x = 9$ and $y = 1$, which means the distance between these two points is $1 - (-9) = 10$, or $9 - 1 = 8$).

The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of the polygon is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: 256
