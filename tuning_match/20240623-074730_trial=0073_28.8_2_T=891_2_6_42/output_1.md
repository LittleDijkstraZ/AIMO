Here's the step by step solution:



Step 1: Recognize that the constraint equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is equivalent to $|x-2y| = |2x-y| = 20$.
Step 2: Using the property of absolute values, we can rewrite the constraint equation as $(x-2y)^2 = (2x-y)^2 = 400$.
Step 3: Expanding both equations, we get $x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2 = 4x^2 - 4xy + y^2 = 400$.
Step 4: Simplifying, we get $3x^2 - 3y^2 = 400$ and $x^2 - y^2 = 400$.
Step 5: Subtracting the second equation from the first equation, we get $2x^2 - 2y^2 = 0$, or $x^2 = y^2$.
Step 6: Since $x^2 = y^2$, we can substitute $y^2$ for $x^2$ in the constraint equation.
Step 7: Substituting $y^2$ for $x^2$ in the constraint equation, we get $x^2 - 4x^2 + 4y^2 = 4x^2 - 4x^2 + y^2 = 400$, or $-3x^2 + 3y^2 = 400$.
Step 8: Adding the equation $-3x^2 + 3y^2 = 400$ to the equation $3x^2 - 3y^2 = 400$, we get $6y^2 = 800$, or $y^2 = 133.33$.
Step 9: Since $y^2 = x^2$, we can substitute $x^2$ for $y^2$.
Step 10: Substituting $x^2$ for $y^2$ in the constraint equation, we get $x^2 - 4x^2 + 4x^2 = 4x^2 - 4x^2 + x^2 = 400$, or $x^2 = 133.33$.
Step 11: Since $x^2 = y^2 = 133.33$, we can substitute $133.33$ for $x^2$ and $y^2$ in the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.
Step 12: Substituting $133.33$ for $x^2$ and $y^2$ in the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get $5(133.33) + 5(133.33) - 8xy = 1333.33 - 8xy$.
Step 13: To minimize the expression $1333.33 - 8xy$, we need to maximize $8xy$.
Step 14: Since $x^2 = y^2 = 133.33$, we can substitute $x = y = \sqrt{133.33}$ into the equation $8xy$ to find the maximum value.
Step 15: Substituting $x = y = \sqrt{133.33}$ into the equation $8xy$, we get $8(\sqrt{133.33})^2 = 8(133.33) = 1066.64$.
Step 16: Subtracting the maximum value of $8xy$ from $1333.33$, we get $1333.33 - 1066.64 = 266.69$.
Step 17: Rounding to the nearest integer, we get $267$.

The minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $267$.
The answer is: $267$

Here's the step by step solution:



First, we observe that the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is equivalent to $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$, which simplifies to $2|x-2y| = 40$, or $|x-2y| = 20$. This means that the distance between $x$ and $2y$ is always 20.

Next, we want to minimize the function $f(x, y) = 5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. To do this, we can use the fact that $(x-2y)^2 + (2x-y)^2 = 400$. Expanding this gives $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = 400$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 400, which is achieved when $x$ and $y$ satisfy the equation $|x-2y| = 20$.

The answer is: $400$

Here's the step by step solution:



Step 1: Analyze the given condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. We can rewrite it as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$. Since the absolute value of a number is always non-negative, we have $|x-2y| = |2y-x|$. This implies that $x-2y = 2y-x$ or $x-2y = -(2y-x)$.

Solving $x-2y = 2y-x$, we get $x = 2y$. And solving $x-2y = -(2y-x)$, we get $x = y$.

So, the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ implies that $x = 2y$ or $x = y$.

Step 2: Substitute $x = 2y$ or $x = y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. 

If $x = 2y$, we substitute into the expression to get $5(2y)^2 + 5y^2 - 8(2y)y = 20y^2 + 5y^2 - 16y^2 = 9y^2$.

If $x = y$, we substitute into the expression to get $5y^2 + 5y^2 - 8y^2 = 2y^2$.

Step 3: Now we need to find the minimum value of $9y^2$ and $2y^2$. 

Since $y$ can be any real number, the minimum value of $9y^2$ is 0, which occurs when $y = 0$. However, when $y = 0$, $x = 2y = 0$, which doesn't satisfy the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. 

The minimum value of $2y^2$ is also 0, which occurs when $y = 0$. Again, this doesn't satisfy the condition.

Step 4: Notice that we made a mistake in step 3. The minimum value of $9y^2$ and $2y^2$ is not necessarily 0. We need to consider the case when $x = y$. In this case, the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ simplifies to $2x^2$. The minimum value of $2x^2$ is 0, which occurs when $x = 0$. This satisfies the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ when $x = y = 0$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 0.

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Here's the step by step solution:



First, let's denote $z = x - 2y$ and $w = y - 2x$. Then, we have $|z| + |w| = 40$. Also, we can express $x$ and $y$ in terms of $z$ and $w$: $x = \frac{w}{3}$ and $y = \frac{z}{3}$.

Now, substitute these expressions into the given function:

$$F(z, w) = 5\left(\frac{w}{3}\right)^2 + 5\left(\frac{z}{3}\right)^2 - 8\left(\frac{w}{3}\right)\left(\frac{z}{3}\right) = \frac{5}{9}(w^2 + z^2) - \frac{8}{9}zw.$$

To minimize $F(z, w)$, we can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality:

$$(w^2 + z^2) \geq 2|zw|,$$

which implies

$$F(z, w) \geq \frac{5}{9} \cdot 2|zw| - \frac{8}{9}zw = \frac{2}{9}|zw|.$$

Since $|z| + |w| = 40$, we know that $|zw| \leq \frac{(|z| + |w|)^2}{4} = \frac{40^2}{4} = 400$. Therefore, the minimum value of $F(z, w)$ is

$$\frac{2}{9} \cdot 400 = \frac{800}{9}.$$

However, this minimum value is achieved when $z = \pm 20$ and $w = \pm 20$. Substituting these values back into the expressions for $x$ and $y$, we find $x = \frac{w}{3} = \pm \frac{20}{3}$ and $y = \frac{z}{3} = \pm \frac{20}{3}$.

Substituting these values into the original function $f(x, y) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$, we find

$$f\left(\pm \frac{20}{3}, \pm \frac{20}{3}\right) = 5\left(\frac{20}{3}\right)^2 + 5\left(\frac{20}{3}\right)^2 - 8\left(\frac{20}{3}\right)\left(\frac{20}{3}\right) = \frac{800}{9}.$$

Therefore, the minimum value of the function $f(x, y)$ is $\frac{800}{9}$.
The answer is: $0$

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"

Assistant:

Here's the step by step solution:



1. First, we notice that the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is equivalent to $|x-2y| = |y-2x| = 20$, because the sum of two absolute values is a constant. This implies that $x-2y = \pm 20$ and $y-2x = \pm 20$. We can solve these two equations to get $x = 4y \pm 20$ and $y = 4x \pm 20$.

2. Substitute $x = 4y \pm 20$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get
$$5(4y \pm 20)^2 + 5y^2 - 8(4y \pm 20)y.$$
Expand and simplify this expression, we get a quadratic expression in $y$, say $f(y)$. The minimum value of this quadratic expression is the minimum value of $f(y)$.

3. To find the minimum value of $f(y)$, we can use the formula for the minimum of a quadratic function $f(y) = ay^2 + by + c$ is $-\frac{b^2}{4a} + c$.

4. After calculating, we find that the minimum value of $f(y)$ is $-400$.

So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $-400$.

The answer is: $-400$.

Assistant:

Here's the step by step solution:



1. We can rewrite the given equation as $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
2. Using the property of absolute value, we can split the equation into two cases:
   - Case 1: $x - 2y + y - 2x = 40$, which simplifies to $-x - y = 40$.
   - Case 2: $x - 2y - (y - 2x) = 40$, which simplifies to $x - 3y = 40$.
3. Now we have two linear equations, we can solve them simultaneously to find the relationship between $x$ and $y$.
4. Subtracting the two equations gives $2y = 0$, so $y = 0$.
5. Substituting $y = 0$ into the second equation gives $x = 40$.
6. Now we can substitute $x = 40$ and $y = 0$ into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ to find its minimum value.
7. We get $5(40)^2 + 5(0)^2 - 8(40)(0) = 8000$.

So the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is $8000$. The answer is: $8000$.
