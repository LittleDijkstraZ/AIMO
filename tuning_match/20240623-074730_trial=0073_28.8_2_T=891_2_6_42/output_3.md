Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Here's the step by step solution:



The expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These two equations represent two lines in the plane, and the intersection points of these lines form a square with side length 20.

Similarly, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which represent a square with side length 16.

The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for. This intersection is another square with side length 8 (the smaller square).

The area of a square is given by the square of its side length, so the area of the convex polygon is $8^2 = 64$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 64 square units.
The answer is: $64$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Here's the step by step solution:



Step 1: First, we observe that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to the following system of equations:

$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0,$$
$$((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$

Step 2: From the first equation, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we find that the solutions are:
$$(x, y) = (5, 5), (5, -5), (-5, 5), (-5, -5).$$

Step 3: From the second equation, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations, we find that the solutions are:
$$(x, y) = (8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8).$$

Step 4: Combining the solutions from the first and second equations, we have a total of 8 points:
$$(x, y) = (5, 5), (5, -5), (-5, 5), (-5, -5), (8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8).$$

Step 5: Plotting these points on a coordinate plane, we observe that they form a square with side length 10. Therefore, the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units.

Here's the step by step solution:



The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if at least one of the factors is zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

Each of these equations implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The solutions to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ are the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ in the first quadrant, and their reflections in the other quadrants. These lines form a square with side length 10.

The solutions to $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ are the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$ in the first quadrant, and their reflections in the other quadrants. These lines form a square with side length 8.

The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon whose area we want to find. The area of the larger square is $10^2 = 100$, and the area of the smaller square is $8^2 = 64$. The area of the convex polygon is the difference of these two areas, which is $100 - 64 = 36$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 36 square units.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    """Find the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points (x, y) satisfying (|x + y| - 10)^2 + (|x - y| - 10)^2)((|x| - 8)^2 + (|y| - 8)^2) = 0."""
    area_large_square = 10**2
    area_small_square = 8**2
    area_polygon = area_large_square - area_small_square
    return area_polygon

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)

The area of the convex polygon is 36 square units. The answer is $\boxed{36}$.

Here's the step by step solution:



1. The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square formed by the intersection of the lines $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. The vertices of this square are $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$.

2. Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So, the vertices of the square formed by the intersection of the lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$ are $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

3. The intersection of these two squares forms a smaller square with side length 6 (since the distance between the points $(8, 2)$ and $(8, -2)$ is 4, and we subtract 2 for the distance from the absolute value).

4. The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $6^2 = 36$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 36. The answer is: $36$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Here's the step by step solution:



The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. 

The first equation implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. These four equations represent four lines in the plane. The intersection points of these lines are the vertices of the polygon.

The second equation implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. These four lines also represent the sides of the polygon.

The polygon is a square with side length 16 (since the distance between the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$ is 16, for example). Therefore, the area of the polygon is $16^2 = 256$.

The answer is: $256$.

Here's the step by step solution:



The equation given is a product of two terms equals to zero. This means either the first term equals to zero or the second term equals to zero. 

For the first term, we have $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us four equations: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These equations represent four lines in the coordinate plane.

For the second term, we have $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us four more lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersection of these eight lines forms a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. So the area of the convex polygon is 100.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""

The area of the convex polygon is $100$. The answer is: $100$
