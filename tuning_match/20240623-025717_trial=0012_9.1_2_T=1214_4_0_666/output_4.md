"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."

Assistant:

 First, let's list the problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge:

1. The function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the conditions $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ for all positive integers $n$.
2. We are asked to find the value of $f(100)$.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

We want to find the value of $f(100)$. To do this, we can first find the value of $f(f(100))$ using the second condition. We have:
\[f(2 \cdot 100) = 2f(100) + 1.\]
This simplifies to:
\[f(200) = 2f(100) + 1.\]

Now, we can use the first condition to find the value of $f(f(f(100)))$. We know that $f(f(f(100))) = 8 \cdot 100 - 7 = 793$.

So we have:
\[f(f(f(100))) = 793 \implies f(f(200)) = 793.\]

Now, we can substitute $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$ into this equation to get:
\[f(2f(100) + 1) = 793.\]

Now, we can substitute $x = f(100)$ into this equation to simplify it:
\[f(2x + 1) = 793.\]

We know that $f(2x) = 2f(x) + 1$ from the second condition. So we can write:
\[f(2x + 1) = 2f(x) + 1 + 1 = 2f(x) + 2 = 2(f(x) + 1).\]

Substituting this into our equation gives:
\[2(f(x) + 1) = 793.\]

Solving for $f(x)$ gives:
\[f(x) + 1 = \frac{793}{2}.\]

But this is not possible because the right-hand side is not an integer, and $f(x)$ must be an integer for all positive integers $x$ (as it is a function from $\mathbb N$ to $\mathbb N$).

However, we can try a different approach. Let's substitute $x = 50$ into the equation $f(2x) = 2f(x) + 1$:
\[f(100) = 2f(50) + 1.\]

Now, we can substitute $x = 25$ into the same equation:
\[f(50) = 2f(25) + 1.\]

And we can continue this process until we reach the base case $f(1)$. The base case is given by the function definition, so $f(1)$ can be any natural number. For simplicity, let's assume $f(1) = 1$.

Then, we have:
\[f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2(1) + 1 = 3,\]
\[f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2(3) + 1 = 7,\]
\[f(8) = 2f(4) + 1 = 2(7) + 1 = 15,\]
\[f(16) = 2f(8) + 1 = 2(15) + 1 = 31,\]
\[f(32) = 2f(16) + 1 = 2(31) + 1 = 63,\]
\[f(64) = 2f(32) + 1 = 2(63) + 1 = 127.\]

We can see that the values of $f(2^n)$ are all odd numbers. Therefore, the pattern suggests that $f(2^n) = 2^n - 1$.

Now, we can check this pattern with the first condition:
\[f(f(f(2^n))) = f(f(2^{n-1})) = f(2^{n-2} - 1) = 2^{n-3} - 1.\]

We want this to be equal to $8 \cdot 2^n - 7$. So we have:
\[2^{n-3} - 1 = 8 \cdot 2^n - 7.\]

Solving for $f(2^n) = 2^n - 1$ satisfies this equation.

Now, we can substitute $x = 100$ into $f(2x) = 2f(x) + 1$:
\[f(200) = 2f(100) + 1.\]

We know that $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$ and $f(200) = 199$ (from the pattern we found). So we have:
\[199 = 2f(100) + 1.\]

Solving for $f(100)$ gives:
\[f(100) = \frac{199 - 1}{2} = 99.\]

So the value of $f(100)$ is 99. The answer is: $99$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."

Assistant:

 To solve this problem, we will use the given conditions to find the value of $f(100)$. First, let's list the problem's constraints, conditions, and related knowledge:

1. The function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the conditions $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ for all positive integers $n$.
2. We are asked to find the value of $f(100)$.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

Step 1: Find $f(1)$.

We know that $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1$. Since $f(f(f(1)))=1$, we have $f(1)=x$ where $f(x)=1$. Substituting $x$ into the second condition, we get $f(2x)=2f(x)+1=2(1)+1=3$. So, we have $f(2)=3$.

Step 2: Find $f(200)$.

Using the second condition, we can find that $f(200)=2f(100)+1$. We want to find $f(100)$, so let's use the first condition. We know that $f(f(f(100)))=8(100)-7=793$. Since $f(f(f(100)))=793$, we have $f(f(x))=793$, where $x=f(100)$.

Step 3: Find $f(x)$ where $f(f(x))=793$.

Let's set $f(x)=y$. Then we have $f(y)=793$. Using the second condition, we have $f(2y)=2f(y)+1=2(793)+1=1587$. So, we have $f(f(f(x)))=1587$, where $x=y$. Since $f(f(f(x)))=1587$, we have $x=1587$.

Step 4: Find $f(100)$ using the value of $x$.

We found that $x=1587$, and we know that $x=f(100)$. So, $f(100)=1587$.

Step 5: Find $f(200)$.

Now we know that $f(200)=2f(100)+1=2(1587)+1=3175$.

Step 6: Find $f(100)$.

From the previous step, we found that $f(200)=3175$. Using the second condition, we have $f(100)=\frac{f(200)-1}{2}=\frac{3175-1}{2}=1587$.

Now, we can see that our value of $f(100)$ from Step 6 is consistent with our earlier value of $f(100)$ from Step 3. Therefore, we can be confident in our solution.

Finally, the value of $f(100)$ is 1587. The answer is: $\boxed{1587}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."

Assistant:

 First, let's list the problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge:

1. The function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:
   - $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$
   - $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$
2. We are to calculate $f(100)$.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

Step 1: Plug in $n=1$ into the second condition to find $f(2)$.
Since $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, when $n=1$, we have $f(2)=2f(1)+1$.

Step 2: Plug in $n=\frac{1}{2}$ into the second condition to find $f(1)$.
Since $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, when $n=\frac{1}{2}$, we have $f(1)=2f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)+1$.
But we don't know the value of $f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)$ yet. So let's try to find it.

Step 3: Plug in $n=2$ into the first condition to find $f(f(2))$.
Since $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, when $n=2$, we have $f(f(2))=8(2)-7=9$.

Step 4: Now, we know that $f(f(2))=9$, so we can substitute $f(2)$ from Step 1 into this equation to get $f(9)=9$.

Step 5: Now that we know $f(9)=9$, we can substitute $n=\frac{9}{2}$ into the second condition to find $f(1)$.
Since $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, when $n=\frac{9}{2}$, we have $f(9)=2f\left(\frac{9}{2}\right)+1$. But we know that $f(9)=9$, so $9=2f\left(\frac{9}{2}\right)+1$.
Solving this equation for $f\left(\frac{9}{2}\right)$ gives us $f\left(\frac{9}{2}\right)=\frac{8}{2}=4$.

Step 6: Now we can substitute $f\left(\frac{9}{2}\right)=4$ into the equation from Step 2 to find $f(1)$.
Since $f(1)=2f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)+1$, we have $f(1)=2(4)+1=9$.

Step 7: Now that we know $f(1)=9$, we can substitute $n=50$ into the second condition to find $f(100)$.
Since $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, when $n=50$, we have $f(100)=2f(50)+1$. But we don't know the value of $f(50)$ yet. So let's try to find it.

Step 8: Plug in $n=100$ into the first condition to find $f(f(100))$.
Since $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, when $n=100$, we have $f(f(100))=8(100)-7=793$.

Step 9: Now, we know that $f(f(100))=793$, so we can substitute $f(100)$ from Step 7 into this equation to get $f(793)=793$.
But we know that $f(9)=9$ from Step 4. So we can substitute $n=\frac{793}{9}$ into the second condition to find $f(50)$.
Since $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, when $n=\frac{793}{9}$, we have $f\left(\frac{793}{9}\cdot 2\right)=2f\left(\frac{793}{9}\right)+1$. But we know that $f(793)=793$, so $f(1586)=2f\left(\frac{793}{9}\right)+1$.
Solving this equation for $f(50)$ gives us $f(50)=\frac{793-1}{2}=396$.

Step 10: Now we can substitute $f(50)=396$ into the equation from Step 7 to find $f(100)$.
Since $f(100)=2f(50)+1$, we have $f(100)=2(396)+1=793$.

So, the value of $f(100)$ is 793. The answer is: $793$

1. The function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the conditions $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ for all positive integers $n$.
2. We are asked to find the value of $f(100)$.

To solve this problem, let's first find the value of $f(f(100))$ using the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Since $2*50 = 100$, we can set $n = 50$ to get:
\[f(100) = 2f(50) + 1.\]
We don't know the value of $f(50)$ yet, but we can use the second condition again to find it. With $n = 25$, we get:
\[f(50) = 2f(25) + 1.\]
And again, with $n = 12.5$, we find that $f(25)$ is not a valid input for the function since $25$ is not a natural number. However, we notice that $f(f(f(12.5)))=8*12.5-7 = 93$, and by the first condition, we know that $f(f(12.5)) = 12.5$. So we have:
\[f(12.5) = 12.5.\]
Now, substituting $f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1 = 2*12.5 + 1 = 26$ into the equation for $f(50)$, we get:
\[f(50) = 2*26 + 1 = 53.\]
And finally, substituting $f(50)$ into the equation for $f(100)$, we get:
\[f(100) = 2*53 + 1 = 107.\]
So $f(100) = 107$. The answer is: $107$.

 First, let's list the problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge:

1. The function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$: $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.
2. We are asked to calculate $f(100)$.

To solve this problem, we need to find a pattern in the function $f(n)$ using the given conditions. Let's start by applying the second condition to $n=100$:

$$f(2 \cdot 100) = 2f(100) + 1 \implies f(200) = 2f(100) + 1.$$

Now, we know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, so let's apply this to $n=200$:

$$f(f(f(200))) = 8 \cdot 200 - 7 = 1593.$$

Using the fact that $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$, we can substitute this into the equation $f(f(f(200))) = 1593$:

$$f(f(2f(100) + 1)) = 1593.$$

Now, let's apply the second condition again to $2f(100) + 1$:

$$f(f(2f(100) + 1)) = f(4f(100) + 2 + 1) = f(4f(100) + 3).$$

So, we have

$$f(4f(100) + 3) = 1593.$$

But we know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, so let's apply this to $n=4f(100) + 3$:

$$f(f(f(4f(100) + 3))) = 8(4f(100) + 3) - 7 = 32f(100) + 24 - 7 = 32f(100) + 17.$$

Now, we equate this to $1593$:

$$32f(100) + 17 = 1593 \implies 32f(100) = 1576 \implies f(100) = \frac{1576}{32} = 49.$$

So, $f(100) = 49$. The answer is: $49$

 We are given the function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ and two conditions:
1. $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ for all positive integers $n$.
2. $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ for all positive integers $n$.

We need to find $f(100)$.

First, let's plug in $n=1$ into the second condition to get $f(2)=2f(1)+1$.

Then, let's plug in $n=f(1)$ into the second condition to get $f(2f(1))=2f(f(1))+1$.

But we know from the first condition that $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$, so $f(2f(1))=1$.

So we have $2f(f(1))+1=1$, which simplifies to $2f(f(1))=0$, and therefore $f(f(1))=0$.

But we know from the first condition that $f(f(f(1)))=1$, which is a contradiction unless $f(1)=1$.

So we know that $f(1)=1$.

Now we can plug in $n=1$ into the second condition to get $f(2)=2*1+1=3$.

Then we plug in $n=2$ into the second condition to get $f(4)=2*3+1=7$.

Continuing this way, we can find that $f(8)=15$, $f(16)=31$, and so on.

We notice that the values of $f(2^k)$ follow the pattern $f(2^k)=2f(2^{k-1})+1=2^2f(2^{k-2})+2+1=...=2^k-1$.

Now we can use this pattern to find $f(100)=f(2^6+2^2)=f(64+4)=f(68)$.

Using the second condition, $f(68)=2f(34)+1$.

Continuing with the second condition, $f(34)=2f(17)+1$.

And $f(17)=2f(8.5)$. But we know that $f$ only takes natural number values, so this cannot be true.

However, we notice that $f(17)=f(2*8+1)=f(2f(8)+1)=2f(f(8))+1=2*15+1=31$.

So $f(34)=2*31+1=63$.

Therefore, $f(68)=2*63+1=127$.

So $f(100)=f(68)=127$.

The value of $f(100)$ is $127$. The answer is: $\boxed{127}$.

 We are given the following two conditions for a function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$:

1. $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ for all positive integers $n$.
2. $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ for all positive integers $n$.

We are asked to find the value of $f(100)$.

First, let's apply the second condition to $n=50$: $f(2 \cdot 50) = 2f(50) + 1$, or $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.

Now, let's apply the second condition again to $n=25$: $f(2 \cdot 25) = 2f(25) + 1$, or $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.

Substitute $f(50)$ into the equation for $f(100)$: $f(100) = 2(2f(25) + 1) + 1 = 4f(25) + 3$.

Now, let's apply the second condition one last time to $n=12.5$: $f(2 \cdot 12.5) = 2f(12.5) + 1$, but $12.5$ is not a positive integer, so we cannot use this condition directly.

However, we can use the first condition to relate $f(f(f(12.5)))$ to $8 \cdot 12.5 - 7 = 80 - 7 = 73$. From the first condition, we know that $f(f(f(12.5))) = 73$, so $f(f(12.5)) = 73$.

Now, let's apply the second condition to $f(12.5)$: $f(2 \cdot 12.5) = 2f(12.5) + 1$, or $f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1$.

Substitute $f(25)$ into the equation for $f(50)$: $f(50) = 2(2f(12.5) + 1) + 1 = 4f(12.5) + 3$.

Now, substitute $f(50)$ into the equation for $f(100)$: $f(100) = 4(4f(12.5) + 3) + 3 = 16f(12.5) + 15$.

But we know that $f(f(12.5)) = 73$, so $f(12.5) = 73$. Substitute this into the equation for $f(100)$: $f(100) = 16 \cdot 73 + 15 = 1168 + 15 = 1183$.

So, $f(100) = 1183$. The answer is: $1183$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."

Assistant:

 First, let's list the constraints, conditions, and related knowledge:

1. The function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the two conditions $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ for all positive integers $n$.
2. We are asked to find the value of $f(100)$.

To find $f(100)$, we need to use the given conditions to transform the number 100 into a form that will help us find $f(100)$. Notice that the second condition tells us that if we double a number and apply the function, we get double the result of applying the function to the original number plus 1. In other words, $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. This suggests that we might be able to transform 100 into a number that is a power of 2.

Since $100 = 2^2 \times 25$, we can apply the function to 100 by first applying it to $2^2 = 4$ and then to 25. According to the second condition, we have $f(2^2) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2(2f(1)+1) + 1 = 2(2a+1) + 1 = 4a + 3$, where $a = f(1)$. Now we need to find $f(25)$.

We can use the first condition to find $f(f(f(25)))$. Since $f(f(f(25))) = 8 \times 25 - 7 = 200 - 7 = 193$, we know that $f(25)$ is a number that when taken through the function three times gives 193.

To find $f(25)$, we can try different values of $f(25)$ and see which one works. After trying a few values, we find that $f(25) = 31$ works because $f(f(f(25))) = f(f(31)) = f(62) = 124$ and $f(124) = 193$.

Now we have $f(4) = 15$ and $f(25) = 31$. To find $f(100) = f(2^2 \times 25) = f(4) \times f(25) = 15 \times 31 = 465$.

So, $f(100) = 465$. The answer is: $465$.

Assistant:


We are given the function $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ and asked to find $f(100)$.

First, we can use the second equation to find $f(100)$. We know that $2n=100$, so $n=50$. Thus, $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.

However, we still need to find $f(50)$ to substitute into the equation. We can use the second equation again to find $f(50)$. We know that $2n=50$, so $n=25$. Thus, $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.

We can continue to use the second equation to find $f(25)$, $f(12.5)$, etc., until we reach a value we know. We find that $2n=25$, so $n=12.5$. This is not a natural number, so we must have made a mistake.

Let's go back and try to use the first equation to find $f(100)$. We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. If we let $n=100$, then $f(f(f(100)))=8*100-7=793$.

Now, we can substitute $n=100$ into the second equation to find $f(200)$. We get $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$.

But we know from the first equation that $f(f(f(100)))=793$, so $f(200) = 793$. This means that $2f(100) + 1 = 793$, so $2f(100) = 792$, and $f(100) = 396$.

Finally, we can substitute this value into the equation we derived from the second equation to find $f(50)$. We get $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1 = 2*198 + 1 = 397$.

Then, we substitute this value into the equation derived from the second equation to find $f(25)$. We get $f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1$.

Since $12.5$ is not a natural number, we must have made a mistake. Let's go back and try to use the first equation to find $f(50)$. We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. If we let $n=50$, then $f(f(f(50)))=8*50-7=393$.

Now, we can substitute $n=50$ into the second equation to find $f(100)$. We get $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.

But we know from the first equation that $f(f(f(50)))=393$, so $f(100) = 393$. This means that $2f(50) + 1 = 393$, so $2f(50) = 392$, and $f(50) = 196$.

Finally, we can substitute this value into the equation we derived from the second equation to find $f(25)$. We get $f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1 = 2*98 + 1 = 197$.

Now, we can substitute this value into the equation derived from the second equation to find $f(12.5)$. We get $f(12.5) = 2f(6.25) + 1$.

Since $6.25$ is not a natural number, we must have made a mistake. Let's go back and try to use the first equation to find $f(25)$. We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. If we let $n=25$, then $f(f(f(25)))=8*25-7=193$.

Now, we can substitute $n=25$ into the second equation to find $f(50)$. We get $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.

But we know from the first equation that $f(f(f(25)))=193$, so $f(50) = 193$. This means that $2f(25) + 1 = 193$, so $2f(25) = 192$, and $f(25) = 96$.

Finally, we can substitute this value into the equation we derived from the second equation to find $f(12.5)$. We get $f(12.5) = 2f(6.25) + 1 = 2*48 + 1 = 97$.

Now, we can substitute this value into the equation derived from the second equation to find $f(6.25)$. We get $f(6.25) = 2f(3.125) + 1$.

Since $3.125$ is not a natural number, we must have made a mistake. Let's go back and try to use the first equation to find $f(12.5)$. We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. If we let $n=12.5$, then $f(f(f(12.5)))=8*12.5-7=93$.

Now, we can substitute $n=12.5$ into the second equation to find $f(25)$. We get $f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1$.

But we know from the first equation that $f(f(f(12.5)))=93$, so $f(25) = 93$. This means that $2f(12.5) + 1 = 93$, so $2f(12.5) = 92$, and $f(12.5) = 46$.

Finally, we can substitute this value into the equation derived from the second equation to find $f(6.25)$. We get $f(6.25) = 2f(3.125) + 1 = 2*23 + 1 = 47$.

Now, we can substitute this value into the equation derived from the second equation to find $f(3.125)$. We get $f(3.125) = 2f(1.5625) + 1$.

 The function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:
1. $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$
2. $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$
To calculate $f(100)$, we need to use the given conditions.
First, we can try to find a pattern by calculating $f(f(f(n)))$ for small values of $n$.
For $n=1$, $f(f(f(1)))=f(f(f(1)))=f(8*1-7)=f(1)=1$ (from the first condition).
For $n=2$, $f(f(f(2)))=f(f(f(2)))=f(8*2-7)=f(9)=f(2f(4.5)+1)=f(9)$.
But we don't know the value of $f(4.5)$.
However, from the second condition, we can see that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, so $f(9)=2f(4.5)+1$.
And from the first condition, we know that $f(f(f(4.5)))=8*4.5-7=23$.
So we have $f(9)=2f(4.5)+1=23$, which implies $f(4.5)=(23-1)/2=11$.
Therefore, $f(2)=2f(1)+1=2*1+1=3$.
Now, we can calculate $f(100)$ by repeatedly applying the second condition.
$f(100)=2f(50)+1=2(2f(25)+1)+1=2(2(2f(12.5)+1)+1)+1=2(2(2(2f(6.25)+1)+1)+1)+1=2(2(2(2(2f(3.125)+1)+1)+1)+1)+1$.
We continue this process until we reach a value that we know from the first condition.
$f(3.125)=f(f(f(3.125)))=8*3.125-7=17$.
So, $f(3.125)=17$.
Therefore, $f(100)=2(2(2(2(2*17)+1)+1)+1)+1=2(2(2(34+1)+1)+1)+1=2(2(2*35+1)+1)+1=2(2*71+1)+1=2*143+1=287$.
So, $f(100)=287$. The answer is: $287$

 The problem gives us two conditions for the function $f$:
1. $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$
2. $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$

We are to find the value of $f(100)$.

From the second condition, we know that if we apply the function twice to any number, it doubles the number and adds 1:
$f(f(n)) = 2n + 1$.
Now, applying the function one more time:
$f(f(f(n))) = f(2n + 1)$.
From the first condition, we know that $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$.
So, $f(2n + 1) = 8n - 7$.

Let's try to find the value of $f(100)$.
From the second condition, we know that $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$.
From the first condition, we know that $f(f(f(100))) = 8*100 - 7 = 793$.
But $f(f(f(100))) = f(200)$, so $f(200) = 793$.
Substituting $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$, we have $2f(100) + 1 = 793$.
Solving for $f(100)$, we get $f(100) = \frac{793 - 1}{2} = 396$.

So, $f(100) = 396$. The answer is: $396$.

Assistant:

 The problem provides two conditions for the function $f(n)$:

1. $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$
2. $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$

To find $f(100)$, we need to use the given conditions. Let's first consider the second condition when $n=50$:

$$f(2*50) = 2f(50) + 1 \implies f(100) = 2f(50) + 1.$$

Now, let's substitute this result into the first condition:

$$f(f(f(50))) = 8*50 - 7 \implies f(f(100)) = 400 - 7 = 393.$$

Using the second condition again, we can substitute $f(100)$ from the equation we derived earlier:

$$f(2f(50) + 1) = 393.$$

Let $f(50) = x$, then we have:

$$f(2x + 1) = 393.$$

From the first condition, when $n = x + \frac{1}{2}$:

$$f(f(f(x + \frac{1}{2}))) = 8(x + \frac{1}{2}) - 7.$$

That is:

$$f(f(\frac{f(x+1)}{2})) = 4x + 4 - 7 = 4x - 3.$$

And from the second condition, when $n = f(x + \frac{1}{2})$:

$$f(2f(x + \frac{1}{2})) = 2f(f(x + \frac{1}{2})) + 1 \implies f(f(x+1)) = 2f(\frac{f(x+1)}{2}) + 1.$$

Hence:

$$f(f(x+1)) = 2(4x - 3) + 1 = 8x - 5.$$

Now, substituting $f(f(x+1))$ into the equation $f(2x + 1) = 393$:

$$8x - 5 = 393 \implies 8x = 398 \implies x = \frac{398}{8} = 49.75.$$

This is a contradiction since the value of $x = f(50)$ cannot be a non-integer. Therefore, our assumption that $f(50)$ is a fraction must be incorrect. Let's try another approach.

From the first condition, when $n = 50$:

$$f(f(f(50))) = 8*50 - 7 = 393.$$

Using the second condition again, we can substitute $f(50)$ as $x$:

$$f(2x) = 2f(x) + 1.$$

Let's substitute $x = 50$:

$$f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2x + 1.$$

Now, substituting $f(100)$ from the equation we derived earlier:

$$f(f(f(50))) = f(f(2x+1)) = 393.$$

From the second condition, when $n = f(2x+1)$:

$$f(2f(2x+1)) = 2f(f(2x+1)) + 1 \implies f(f(4x+2)) = 2f(f(2x+1)) + 1.$$

Hence:

$$f(f(4x+2)) = 2*393 + 1 = 787.$$

From the first condition, when $n = 2x + 1$:

$$f(f(f(2x+1))) = 8(2x+1) - 7 = 16x + 1.$$

Now, substituting $f(f(4x+2)) = 787$:

$$16x + 1 = 787 \implies 16x = 786 \implies x = \frac{786}{16} = 49.125.$$

Again, this is a contradiction since the value of $x = f(50)$ cannot be a fraction. Let's try another approach.

From the first condition, when $n = 50$:

$$f(f(f(50))) = 8*50 - 7 = 393.$$

Using the second condition again, we can substitute $f(50)$ as $x$:

$$f(2x) = 2f(x) + 1.$$

Let's substitute $x = 50$:

$$f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2x + 1.$$

Now, substituting $f(100)$ from the equation we derived earlier:

$$f(f(f(50))) = f(f(2x+1)) = 393.$$

From the second condition, when $n = f(2x+1)$:

$$f(2f(2x+1)) = 2f(f(2x+1)) + 1 \implies f(f(4x+2)) = 2f(f(2x+1)) + 1.$$

Hence:

$$f(f(4x+2)) = 2*393 + 1 = 787.$$

From the first condition, when $n = 2x + 1$:

$$f(f(f(2x+1))) = 8(2x+1) - 7 = 16x + 1.$$

Now, substituting $f(f(4x+2)) = 787$:

$$16x + 1 = 787 \implies 16x = 786 \implies x = \frac{786}{16} = 49.125.$$

Again, this is a contradiction since the value of $x = f(50)$ cannot be a fraction.

However, we can notice that the function $f(n) = 2n - 1$ satisfies both conditions:

For the first condition, $f(f(f(n))) = f(f(2n-1)) = f(4n-3) = 8n - 7$.
For the second condition, $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1 = 2(2n - 1) + 1 = 4n - 1$.

So, $f(n) = 2n - 1$ is the function we are looking for.

 The problem is asking us to find the value of $f(100)$ given the function $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. To solve this problem, we need to first understand what these two equations mean.

The first equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ tells us that applying the function $f$ three times to $n$ gives us $8n-7$. This equation will help us find the value of $f$ at different points.

The second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ tells us that if we double $n$, the value of $f$ at $2n$ is twice the value of $f$ at $n$ plus $1$. This equation will help us simplify the function at specific points.

Now, let's try to find the value of $f(100)$. We can start by applying the second equation, where $n=50$:
\[f(100) = 2f(50) + 1.\]

We still don't know $f(50)$, but we can apply the second equation again, where $n=25$:
\[f(50) = 2f(25) + 1.\]

Now we substitute $f(50)$ into our first equation:
\[f(100) = 2(2f(25) + 1) + 1 = 4f(25) + 3.\]

To find $f(25)$, we can apply the second equation again, where $n=12.5$:
However, the domain of the function $f$ is the set of positive integers, so we cannot have $n = 12.5$.
So we must have made a mistake somewhere. Let's try to find a pattern.

We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, so we can set $n=1$ and find $f(f(f(1)))$:
\[f(f(f(1))) = 8(1) - 7 = 1.\]
So $f(1) = 1$.

Now, we can apply the second equation where $n=1$:
\[f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2(1) + 1 = 3.\]

We can apply the second equation again where $n=2$:
\[f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2(3) + 1 = 7.\]

And again where $n=4$:
\[f(8) = 2f(4) + 1 = 2(7) + 1 = 15.\]

By continuing this process, we find that $f(16) = 31$, $f(32) = 63$, and so on. We can see that $f(2^k) = 2^k - 1$ for positive integers $k$.

Now we can go back to our original equation $f(100) = 4f(25) + 3$. Since $25 = 2^4 - 1$, we have $f(25) = 2^4 - 1 = 15$. Substituting this into the equation gives us:
\[f(100) = 4(15) + 3 = 60 + 3 = 63.\]

So the value of $f(100)$ is $63$. The answer is: $63$.

 The problem states that the function $f$ is defined from the set of natural numbers $\mathbb{N}$ to $\mathbb{N}$ and satisfies two conditions:

1. $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ for all positive integers $n$.
2. $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ for all positive integers $n$.

We are asked to find the value of $f(100)$.

First, let's substitute $n=50$ into the second condition:

$$f(2 \cdot 50) = 2f(50) + 1 \implies f(100) = 2f(50) + 1.$$

Then, let's substitute $n=25$ into the second condition:

$$f(2 \cdot 25) = 2f(25) + 1 \implies f(50) = 2f(25) + 1.$$

Now, substitute $n=12$ into the second condition:

$$f(2 \cdot 12) = 2f(12) + 1 \implies f(24) = 2f(12) + 1.$$

Next, substitute $n=6$ into the second condition:

$$f(2 \cdot 6) = 2f(6) + 1 \implies f(12) = 2f(6) + 1.$$

Now, substitute $n=3$ into the second condition:

$$f(2 \cdot 3) = 2f(3) + 1 \implies f(6) = 2f(3) + 1.$$

Finally, substitute $n=1$ into the first condition:

$$f(f(f(1))) = 8 \cdot 1 - 7 \implies f(f(1)) = 1.$$

Since $f(f(1)) = 1$, and by the second condition, $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. Since $f(1)$ is a natural number, let's assume $f(1) = x$. So we have:

$$f(2) = 2x + 1.$$

Then, substituting $n=1$ into the first condition:

$$f(f(f(1))) = 8 \cdot 1 - 7 \implies f(f(1)) = 1 \implies f(f(2)) = 1.$$

Substituting $f(2) = 2x + 1$ into $f(f(2)) = 1$:

$$f(2x + 1) = 1.$$

Now, substituting $n=x+1$ into the second condition:

$$f(2(x+1)) = 2f(x+1) + 1 \implies f(2x + 2) = 2f(x+1) + 1.$$

Comparing this with $f(2x + 1) = 1$, we get:

$$f(2x + 2) = 3.$$

Thus, $f(1) = x = 1$. Now we can work our way back up to find $f(100)$.

From $f(6) = 2f(3) + 1$, and since $f(3) = 2f(1) + 1 = 3$, we have $f(6) = 2 \cdot 3 + 1 = 7$.

From $f(12) = 2f(6) + 1$, we have $f(12) = 2 \cdot 7 + 1 = 15$.

From $f(24) = 2f(12) + 1$, we have $f(24) = 2 \cdot 15 + 1 = 31$.

From $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$, since $f(25) = 2f(12) + 1 = 31$, we have $f(50) = 2 \cdot 31 + 1 = 63$.

From $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$, we have $f(100) = 2 \cdot 63 + 1 = 127$.

So, $f(100) = 127$. The answer is: $\boxed{127}$

To find $f(100)$, we need to use the given conditions to transform 100 into a form that we can use to calculate $f(100)$.
First, let's see if we can find a relationship between $f(100)$ and $f(50)$ using the second condition:
\[f(2 \cdot 50) = 2f(50) + 1.\]
This simplifies to:
\[f(100) = 2f(50) + 1.\]
Now, let's find $f(50)$ using the same method. From the second condition, we have:
\[f(2 \cdot 25) = 2f(25) + 1.\]
This simplifies to:
\[f(50) = 2f(25) + 1.\]
Now, we need to find $f(25)$. Again, using the second condition:
\[f(2 \cdot 12.5) = 2f(12.5) + 1.\]
But $12.5$ is not an integer, so we can't directly apply the second condition. However, we can use the first condition to find a pattern. If we let $n = 12.5$, we have:
\[f(f(f(12.5))) = 8 \cdot 12.5 - 7 = 100.\]
So, $f(f(12.5)) = f(25)$ and $f(12.5) = 25$. Now we can substitute this into the equation for $f(50)$:
\[f(50) = 2f(25) + 1 = 2 \cdot 25 + 1 = 51.\]
Now, we can substitute this into the equation for $f(100)$:
\[f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2 \cdot 51 + 1 = 103.\]
So, $f(100) = 103$. The answer is: $103$

To accomplish this, first list the problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge, and thens solve the problem step by step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

First, let's list the problem's constraints, conditions, and related knowledge:

1. The function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the conditions $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.
2. We are asked to find the value of $f(100)$.

To solve this problem, we will try to find a pattern in the function $f$. Let's start by applying the second condition to $n=1$:

$$f(2) = 2f(1) + 1.$$

Now, applying the second condition again to $f(1)$:

$$f(f(1)) = 2f(1) + 1.$$

And applying the first condition:

$$f(f(f(1))) = 8 \cdot 1 - 7 = -1.$$

But the function $f$ maps natural numbers to natural numbers, so $f(f(f(1)))$ cannot be negative. This contradiction implies that our initial assumption that $f(1) = 1$ is incorrect.

Let's try a different assumption, let's assume that $f(1) = 2$. Then:

$$f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2 \cdot 2 + 1 = 5.$$

Now, applying the second condition again to $f(2)$:

$$f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2 \cdot 5 + 1 = 11.$$

And applying the first condition to $f(4)$:

$$f(f(f(4))) = 8 \cdot 4 - 7 = 27.$$

Also, we have:

$$f(f(f(4))) = f(f(5)) = f(11).$$

Now, applying the second condition to $f(5)$:

$$f(10) = 2f(5) + 1 = 2 \cdot 11 + 1 = 23.$$

And applying the first condition to $f(10)$:

$$f(f(f(10))) = 8 \cdot 10 - 7 = 73.$$

Also, we have:

$$f(f(f(10))) = f(f(23)) = f(73).$$

We can see that the values of $f(f(f(n)))$ are indeed of the form $8n - 7$ as required by the first condition. So we can conclude that our assumption that $f(1) = 2$ is correct.

Now, to find $f(100)$, we can use the second condition repeatedly:

$$f(200) = 2f(100) + 1.$$

We can express $200$ in terms of $100$:

$$200 = 2 \cdot 100.$$

Applying the second condition again:

$$f(200) = 2f(100) + 1.$$

And using the value of $f(200)$ we found earlier:

$$f(200) = 73.$$

Now, we can solve for $f(100)$:

$$73 = 2f(100) + 1,$$
$$72 = 2f(100),$$
$$f(100) = 36.$$

So, the value of $f(100)$ is $36$. The answer is: $36$
