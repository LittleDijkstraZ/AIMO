Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first list the problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge, and thens solve the problem step by step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge are:

1. The expression $A \cdot B = 0$ is equivalent to $A = 0$ or $B = 0$.
2. $|x|$ denotes the absolute value of $x$.
3. The area of a square with side length $s$ is $\frac{s^2}{1}$.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

Given the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$, we can apply constraint 1 to rewrite the equation as:
\[(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad (\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0.\]

If the first equation holds, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that both $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$, and both $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$. Solving these four equations, we get four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length 10.

If the second equation holds, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that both $x = 8$ or $x = -8$, and both $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. Solving these four equations, we get four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length 16.

However, the second case doesn't meet the constraints of the problem since the square with side length 16 doesn't fit inside the square with side length 10. Therefore, the only valid solution is the square with side length 10.

The area of this square is $\frac{10^2}{1} = 100$.
The answer is: $100$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints are given by the equation
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]
This equation is satisfied if either of the factors is zero. Therefore, we have two sets of conditions to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 \neq 0$.
2. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 \neq 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first set of conditions, we have $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This is only possible if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(8,2)$, $(8,-2)$, $(-8,2)$, and $(-8,-2)$.

For the second set of conditions, we have $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This is only possible if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

Now we can see that the polygon is a square with side length $20$. The area of a square is given by the side length squared, so the area of the polygon is $20^2 = 400$. The answer is: $400$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge are as follows:

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if and only if at least one of the following two conditions holds:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From condition 1, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0)$ and $(-10, 0)$.

From condition 2, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8)$ and $(-8, -8)$.

The polygon is a square with side length $10$, so its area is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions, and related knowledge are:

1. The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:
   a) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
   b) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

2. $(\vert a \vert - b)^2 = 0$ if and only if $\vert a \vert = b$. Therefore, we have:
   a) $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$
   b) $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$

3. Solving the equations in 2(b) gives us $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
4. Solving the equations in 2(a) gives us two systems of equations:
   a) $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$
   b) $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \mp 10$

5. Solving the systems of equations in 4(a) gives us $x = 0, y = \pm 10$ and $x = \pm 10, y = 0$.
6. Solving the systems of equations in 4(b) gives us $x = \pm 5, y = \mp 5$.

The points from 3, 5, and 6 form the vertices of a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100.
The answer is: $100$

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints are as follows:

1. $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$
2. $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$

From the first constraint, we have:

$\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$,

which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

This gives us four cases:

1. $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$,
2. $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$,
3. $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$,
4. $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$.

From the second constraint, we have:

$\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$,

which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

This gives us four more cases:

5. $x = 8$ and $y = 8$,
6. $x = 8$ and $y = -8$,
7. $x = -8$ and $y = 8$,
8. $x = -8$ and $y = -8$.

Now we need to find the intersection of these cases. The only intersections are cases 1 and 5, 2 and 6, 3 and 7, 4 and 8. These intersections give us the vertices of the polygon: $(10,0)$, $(0,10)$, $(-10,0)$, $(0,-10)$, $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

Plotting these points, we see that the polygon is a square with side length $20$. The area of the square is $20^2 = 400$. The answer is: $400$

 The problem's constraints, conditions, and related knowledge are as follows:

1. The expression $ab = 0$ if and only if either $a = 0$ or $b = 0$.
2. The absolute value function $|x|$ is equal to $x$ if $x \geq 0$ and $-x$ if $x < 0$.
3. The area of a square with side length $s$ is $s^2$.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step.

The given equation is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

From the first constraint, we know that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
This case implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
From the second constraint, we know that the absolute value of a number is equal to the number itself if the number is nonnegative, and the negative of the number if the number is negative. So, we have four subcases:
- If $x + y \geq 0$ and $x - y \geq 0$, then $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$. Adding these two equations gives $2x = 20$, so $x = 10$. Substituting $x = 10$ into the equation $x + y = 10$ gives $y = 0$.
- If $x + y \geq 0$ and $x - y < 0$, then $x + y = 10$ and $y - x = 10$. Adding these two equations gives $2y = 20$, so $y = 10$. Substituting $y = 10$ into the equation $x + y = 10$ gives $x = 0$.
- If $x + y < 0$ and $x - y \geq 0$, then $-x - y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$. Adding these two equations gives $-2y = 20$, so $y = -10$. Substituting $y = -10$ into the equation $x + y = 10$ gives $x = 20$. However, this solution doesn't satisfy the condition $x - y = 10$. So, this case doesn't give any valid solutions.
- If $x + y < 0$ and $x - y < 0$, then $-x - y = 10$ and $y - x = 10$. Adding these two equations gives $2y = 20$, so $y = 10$. But this contradicts the condition $x + y < 0$. So, this case doesn't give any valid solutions either.
Therefore, the only valid solutions from Case 1 are $(x, y) = (10, 0)$ and $(x, y) = (0, 10)$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This case implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. Similarly to the above, we have four subcases:
- If $x \geq 0$ and $y \geq 0$, then $x = 8$ and $y = 8$.
- If $x \geq 0$ and $y < 0$, then $x = 8$ and $y = -8$.
- If $x < 0$ and $y \geq 0$, then $x = -8$ and $y = 8$.
- If $x < 0$ and $y < 0$, then $x = -8$ and $y = -8$.

Now, we have the coordinates of the vertices of the polygon: $(10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$. These points form a square with side length $20$. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.
The answer is: $400$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge are:

1. The equation is true if and only if both of the factors are zero.
2. The absolute value function $|\cdot|$ is always non-negative.
3. For a product to be zero, at least one of the factors must be zero.
4. The square of a real number is zero if and only if the number itself is zero.
5. The area of a rectangle is the product of its side lengths.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

The first factor of the equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. This factor is zero if and only if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This is equivalent to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

The second factor of the equation is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. This factor is zero if and only if both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This is equivalent to $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

From $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, we can conclude that the points $(x, y)$ are on a rectangle with side lengths $20$ (from $x+y=10$ and $x-y=10$) and $16$ (from $x=8$ and $y=8$).

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $20 \times 16 = 320$. The answer is: $\boxed{320}$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge are:
1. The equation is satisfied if either of the factors is zero.
2. $\vert a \vert$ denotes the absolute value of $a$.
3. The area of a square with side length $s$ is $s^2$.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the constraints
The equation is satisfied if either of the factors is zero. This gives us two constraints:

(1) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
(2) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

Step 2: Solve the constraints
For constraint (1), $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
This gives us four lines in the coordinate plane: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

For constraint (2), $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
This gives us four lines in the coordinate plane: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

Step 3: Identify the vertices of the polygon
The vertices of the polygon are the intersection points of these lines.
There are 16 intersection points, but only 8 of them are inside the square with side length 16 (formed by the lines $x = \pm8$ and $y = \pm8$).
These 8 points are: $(8,0)$, $(0,8)$, $(-8,0)$, $(0,-8)$, $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

Step 4: Calculate the area of the polygon
The polygon formed by these 8 points is a square with side length 16.
The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first list the problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge, and thens solve the problem step by step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions, and related knowledge include:

1. The equation is satisfied if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. Each of these equations is satisfied if the absolute value expressions equal zero, meaning the expressions inside the absolute value signs must be zero.
3. This gives us the constraints $x + y = 10$, $x - y = 10$, $x = 8$, and $y = 8$.

Now let's solve the problem step by step:

Step 1: Solve each equation to find the points that satisfy the constraints.

- For $x + y = 10$, when $x = 0$, $y = 10$. When $y = 0$, $x = 10$. So we have two points: $(0, 10)$ and $(10, 0)$.
- For $x - y = 10$, when $x = 0$, $y = -10$ (which is not valid because we are looking for natural numbers only). When $y = 0$, $x = 10$. So we have only one point: $(10, 0)$.
- For $x = 8$, when $y = 0$, we have the point $(8, 0)$.
- For $y = 8$, when $x = 0$, we have the point $(0, 8)$.

So the points that satisfy the constraints are $(0, 10)$, $(10, 0)$, $(8, 0)$, and $(0, 8)$.

Step 2: Plot the points on a coordinate plane to visualize the polygon.

The points form a square with side length 10.

Step 3: Calculate the area of the square.

The area of a square is given by side length squared. In this case, the side length is 10, so the area is $10^2 = 100$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$
