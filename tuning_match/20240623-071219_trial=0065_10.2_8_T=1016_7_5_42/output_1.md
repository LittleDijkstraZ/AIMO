Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we rewrite the given condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ using the property $|a| = |-a|$, we can change the order of $x$ and $y$ in the absolute value terms to get $|x-2y| + |2x-y| = 40$.

Now, using the property $|a+b| \leq |a| + |b|$, we can bound $|x-2y| + |2x-y|$ from above by $|(x-2y) + (2x-y)| = |3x-3y| = 3|x-y|$, so we have $3|x-y| = 40$. Solving for $|x-y|$ gives $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$.

Now, we want to minimize $f(x, y) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$. We can rewrite this as $f(x, y) = 5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x - y)^2 + 2xy] - 8xy = 5(x - y)^2$.

Since $|x - y| = \frac{40}{3}$, the minimum value of $(x - y)^2$ is $0$, as the square of any real number is nonnegative. Therefore, the minimum value of $f(x, y)$ is $5 \cdot 0 = 0$. However, this would mean $x = y$, which does not satisfy the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. So there must be some additional property or structure that can help us find the minimum of $f(x, y)$ that satisfies the given condition.

To see this, let's rewrite $f(x, y)$ as $f(x, y) = 5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy = 5(x^2 + y^2) - 4(2xy) = 5(x^2 + y^2) - 4[(x + y)^2 - (x - y)^2] = 5(x^2 + y^2) - 4(x + y)^2 + 4(x - y)^2$.

Since $(x + y)^2 \geq 0$, $4(x + y)^2 \geq 0$, and since $(x - y)^2 = \left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2$, $4(x - y)^2 = \frac{6400}{9}$, we have $f(x, y) = 5(x^2 + y^2) - 4(x + y)^2 + \frac{6400}{9} \geq 0 + 0 + \frac{6400}{9} = \frac{6400}{9}$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $f(x, y)$ is $\frac{6400}{9}$, which occurs when $x = \frac{40}{3}$ and $y = 0$ (or $x = 0$ and $y = \frac{40}{3}$), or $x = - \frac{40}{3}$ and $y = 0$ (or $x = 0$ and $y = - \frac{40}{3}$). But when we substitute these values into the original expression $f(x, y)$, we find that $f(x, y) = 0$, not $\frac{6400}{9}$. So, we made a mistake in our derivation. 

Let's start over, using a slightly different approach. From the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we know $|x-2y| = \frac{40}{3}$. Now, consider the function $f(x, y) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$. We can rewrite it as $f(x, y) = 5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x - y)^2 + 2xy] - 8xy = 5(x - y)^2 - 3xy$. 

Now, notice that the term $(x - y)^2 = \left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2$ is fixed. So to minimize $f(x, y)$, we need to minimize $-3xy$. 

To minimize $-3xy$, we can make use of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states that for any real numbers $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$ and $b_1, b_2, ..., b_n$, $(a_1^2 + a_2^2 + ... + a_n^2)(b_1^2 + b_2^2 + ... + b_n^2) \geq (a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 + ... + a_nb_n)^2$. 

Applying the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality with $a_1 = x$, $a_2 = y$, $b_1 = 1$, and $b_2 = 1$, we have $(x^2 + y^2)(1^2 + 1^2) \geq (x*1 + y*1)^2$, or $(x^2 + y^2)(2) \geq (x + y)^2$, or $2(x^2 + y^2) \geq (x + y)^2$.

Substituting $x + y = \frac{40}{3}$ (from the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$), we get $2(x^2 + y^2) \geq \left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2$, or $2(x^2 + y^2) \geq \frac{1600}{9}$, or $x^2 + y^2 \geq \frac{800}{9}$.

Substituting this back into the expression for $f(x, y)$, we have $f(x, y) = 5(x - y)^2 - 3xy \geq 5\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 - 3\left(\frac{800}{9}\right) = \frac{6400}{9} - \frac{2400}{3} = -\frac{6400}{9}$.

But we know that $f(x, y) \geq 0$, so there must be some mistake in our calculations. Let's try another approach.

Consider the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. Since $|a| = |-a|$, we can rewrite the condition as $|x-2y| = |2x-y|$. This equation tells us that the difference between $x$ and $2y$ is the same as the difference between $2x$ and $y$. This is only possible when $x = 2y$ or

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



We have the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. Expanding the absolute values, we get
\[|x-2y| + |y-2x| = (2x-y) - (x-2y) = x - y = 20.\]
So $x-y=20$. This simplifies to $x=y+20$.

Substitute $x=y+20$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to get
\begin{align*}
5(y+20)^2+5y^2-8(y+20)y &= 5(y^2+40y+400) + 5y^2 - 8(y^2+20y) \\
&= 5y^2+200y+2000 + 5y^2 - 8y^2-160y \\
&= 2y^2 + 40y + 2000.
\end{align*}
Now complete the square:
\[2(y^2 + 20y + 100) + 2000 - 200 = 2(y+10)^2 + 1800.\]
The expression $2(y+10)^2 + 1800$ is always greater than or equal to $1800$, so its minimum value is $1800$. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ subject to the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $1800$. The answer is: $\boxed{1800}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


Let's denote $z = x - 2y$ and $w = y - 2x$. We know that $|z| + |w| = 40$.

Now, let's express $x$ and $y$ in terms of $z$ and $w$:

From $z = x - 2y$, we have $x = z + 2y$.
And from $w = y - 2x$, we have $y = w + 2x$.

Now, substitute these expressions into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:

\begin{align*}
5x^2+5y^2-8xy &= 5(z + 2y)^2 + 5(w + 2x)^2 - 8(z + 2y)(w + 2x) \\
&= 5(z^2 + 4y^2 + 4zy) + 5(w^2 + 4x^2 + 4wx) - 8(zw + 2wx + 2wy + 4xy) \\
&= 5z^2 + 20y^2 + 20zy + 5w^2 + 20x^2 + 20wx - 8zw - 32wx - 32wy - 64xy \\
&= 5z^2 + 5w^2 + 20(x^2 + y^2) + 20(zy + wx - 4xy) \\
&= 5z^2 + 5w^2 + 20(x^2 + y^2) + 20(zw) \\
&= 5z^2 + 5w^2 + 20(x^2 + y^2) + 20|zw|.
\end{align*}

We know that $|zw| = |(x - 2y)(y - 2x)| = |z \cdot w| = |z| \cdot |w| = 40$.

So we have:
$$5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5z^2 + 5w^2 + 20(x^2 + y^2) + 20|zw| = 5z^2 + 5w^2 + 20(x^2 + y^2) + 20 \cdot 40 = 5z^2 + 5w^2 + 20(x^2 + y^2) + 800.$$

Since $x^2 + y^2$ is always non-negative, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is achieved when $z^2 + w^2$ is minimum. But we know from the triangle inequality that $|z| + |w| = 40$, so the minimum value of $z^2 + w^2$ is 0, which happens when $z = w = 0$ (i.e., when $x = 2y$ and $y = 2x$, or equivalently when $x = y = 0$). So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $5 \cdot 0^2 + 5 \cdot 0^2 - 8 \cdot 0 \cdot 0 + 800 = 800$. The minimum value is therefore 800.

Therefore the answer is $\boxed{800}$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we rewrite the given expression as $(5x^2 - 8xy + 5y^2) = (x^2 + 2xy + y^2) + 3(x^2 - 2xy + y^2) = (x+y)^2 + 3(x-y)^2$. Let $a = x+y$ and $b = x - y$. We know that $2a = (x+y) + (x-y) = 2x \implies x = \frac{a}{1}$ and $2b = (x+y) - (x-y) = 2y \implies y = \frac{b}{1}$. The equality $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ becomes $|a-2b| + |-a+2b| = 40$. We know that $|a-2b| + |-a+2b| = |a-2b| + |2b-a| = 40$. This simplifies to $2|a-2b| = 40 \implies |a-2b| = 20$. Now we are looking for the minimum value of $(a^2+3b^2)$. Now from $|a-2b| = 20$, we have that either $a - 2b = 20$ or $a - 2b = -20$. Consider each case. \underline{If $a - 2b = 20$}, after rearranging we get $a = 20 + 2b$. Substitute this into $(a^2+3b^2)$ to get \[(a^2+3b^2) = (20+2b)^2 + 3b^2 = 4b^2 + 80b + 400 + 3b^2 = 7b^2 + 80b + 400.\] The minimum of this occurs at $b = -\frac{80}{14} = -\frac{40}{7}$, and the minimum value is \[7\left(-\frac{40}{7}\right)^2 + 80\left(-\frac{40}{7}\right) + 400 = \frac{2000}{7}.\]Now if $a - 2b = -20$, then $a = -20 + 2b$ and substitute it into $(a^2+3b^2)$ to get \[((-20 + 2b)^2 + 3b^2) = 7b^2 - 80b + 400.\] The minimum of this occurs at $b = \frac{80}{14} = \frac{40}{7}$, and the minimum value is \[7\left(\frac{40}{7}\right)^2 - 80\left(\frac{40}{7}\right) + 400 = \frac{2000}{7}.\]

To conclude, since $\frac{2000}{7} > 0$, the minimum value occurs either at $b = -\frac{40}{7}$ or $b = \frac{40}{7}$, and we find that the minimum value of $(a^2+3b^2)$ under the constraint is $\frac{2000}{7}$. To obtain the value of $(x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy)$ that minimizes itself under the condition $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$, we substitute the values of $x$ and $y$ in terms of $a$ and $b$ into $(x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy)$. After calculating we see that \[(x^2+5y^2-8xy) = (a^2+3b^2).\] Therefore, under the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\boxed{\frac{2000}{7}}$.
The answer is: $\frac{2000}{7}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


Note that the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is always true (by substituting $x$ with $2y$ and $y$ with $2x$ in the left hand side we see it equals zero), thus it doesn't provide any restriction to the value of the expression we want to minimize, $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, which equals $(5x^2-8xy+5y^2)$, or $(5x^2-10xy+5y^2)+2xy$, or $(x-y)^2+2xy$. By the Titu's Lemma, since $(x-y)^2\geq 0$, we have that $(x-y)^2+4xy \geq 4xy$, thus $(x-y)^2+2xy \geq \frac{4xy}{2}=2xy$. Thus we have minimized our original expression: it equals at least $2xy$, and $2xy \geq -100$, since from our constraint we have $xy\leq -50$. Equality is obtained when $x = 2y$ and $y = 2x$, or in other words, when $x = y = 0$. Hence, the minimum value is -100. The answer is: $-100$.

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


By the definition of absolute value, $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be split into cases as follows:
Case 1: $(x-2y) + (y-2x) = 40$, which simplifies to $-x - y = 40$.
Case 2: $(x-2y) - (y-2x) = 40$, which simplifies to $3x - 3y = 40$, or $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$.
Case 3: $- (x-2y) + (y-2x) = 40$, which simplifies to $-3x + 3y = 40$, or $x - y = -\frac{40}{3}$.
Case 4: $- (x-2y) - (y-2x) = 40$, which simplifies to $-x + y = 40$, or $x - y = -40$.
Solving the system of equations $x - y = -\frac{40}{3}$ and $x - y = -40$, we find that there are no solutions, so we can discard these cases. Now we consider Case 2, $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$, and rearrange it to get $y = x - \frac{40}{3}$. Substituting this into the given equation, we get $5x^2 + 5\left(x - \frac{40}{3}\right)^2 - 8x\left(x - \frac{40}{3}\right)$, which simplifies to $5x^2 + \frac{2000}{9} - \frac{320x}{3} + 8x^2 - \frac{320x}{3}$, or $13x^2 - \frac{640x}{3} + \frac{2000}{9}$. This is a quadratic expression in $x$. The minimum value of a quadratic expression $ax^2+bx+c$ occurs at $x = -\frac{b}{2a}$. So in this case, the minimum value occurs at $x = \frac{640}{2 \cdot 13} = \frac{320}{13}$. Substituting this value into $y = x - \frac{40}{3}$, we get $y = \frac{320}{13} - \frac{40}{3} = \frac{960-520}{39} = \frac{440}{39}$. Finally, substitute $x = \frac{320}{13}$ and $y = \frac{440}{39}$ into the given expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$. After simplifying, we get the minimum value is $- \frac{1600}{13}$. Therefore, the minimum value of the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ given the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $-\frac{1600}{13}$. The answer is: $-\frac{1600}{13}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



We first simplify the given expression. Let's complete the square for the quadratic expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:

\begin{align*}
5x^2+5y^2-8xy &= 5(x^2 - \frac{8}{5}xy + y^2) \\
&= 5[(x^2 - \frac{8}{5}xy + (\frac{4}{5}y)^2) + (y^2 - (\frac{4}{5}y)^2)] \\
&= 5[(x-\frac{4}{5}y)^2 + (y-\frac{4}{5}x)^2].
\end{align*}

Now, we know that $(x-\frac{4}{5}y)^2 + (y-\frac{4}{5}x)^2 \geq 0$ for all real numbers $x$ and $y$.
And the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ only holds for a specific value of $(x, y)$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is achieved when $(x-\frac{4}{5}y)^2 + (y-\frac{4}{5}x)^2 = 0$.

This is possible only when $x = \frac{4}{5}y$ and $y = \frac{4}{5}x$.

Substituting $x = \frac{4}{5}y$ into $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we get:

$$| \frac{4}{5}y - 2y| + |y - 2*\frac{4}{5}y| = 40,$$
which simplifies to $|-\frac{6}{5}y| + |\frac{6}{5}y| = 40$.
This is true only when $y = \pm 10$.

Substituting $y = 10$ into $x = \frac{4}{5}y$, we get $x = 8$.

Substituting $y = -10$ into $x = \frac{4}{5}y$, we get $x = -8$.

So the minimum value is achieved when $(x, y)$ is either $(8, 10)$ or $(-8, -10)$.

For either of these points, the value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is the same. Let's substitute $(8, 10)$ into it:

\begin{align*}
5*8^2 + 5*10^2 - 8*8*10 &= 5*(64+100) - 640 \\
&= 5*164 - 640 \\
&= 820 - 640 \\
&= 180.
\end{align*}

So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 180.

The answer is: $180$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression to be minimized is $f(x, y) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$. We can rewrite this as:
$$f(x, y) = (5x^2 - 8xy + 5y^2) = (5x^2 - 10xy + 5y^2) + (-2xy + 5y^2)$$
$$ = (x-y)^2 + (-2xy + 5y^2).$$
Now, consider the constraint equation:
$$|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40.$$
We can apply the Triangle Inequality to this equation:
$$|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |x-2y| + |2(x-y)| = |x-2y| + 2|x-y| = 40.$$
Let $u = x-y$. The constraint equation becomes:
$$|u| + 2|u| = 40 \implies |u| = \frac{40}{3}.$$
Then we have $u = x - y = \pm \frac{40}{3}$.

Now substitute $u = x - y$ into $f(x, y)$:
$$f(x, y) = u^2 + (-2(u+y)y + 5y^2) = u^2 - 2uy - 2y^2 + 5y^2 = u^2 - 2uy + 3y^2.$$
Since $y = x - u$, we can substitute this into the expression above:
$$f(x, y) = u^2 - 2u(x - u) + 3(x - u)^2$$
$$= u^2 - 2ux + 2u^2 + 3(x^2 - 2ux + u^2)$$
$$= u^2 - 2ux + 2u^2 + 3x^2 - 6ux + 3u^2$$
$$= 5u^2 - 8ux + 3x^2 = (x-y)^2 + (-2(x-y)y + 3y^2).$$
Now, from the constraint equation $u = \pm \frac{40}{3}$, we can solve for $x$ or $y$:
From $u = x - y = \frac{40}{3}$, we have $x = y + \frac{40}{3}$, and from $u = x - y = -\frac{40}{3}$, we have $x = y - \frac{40}{3}$.

Substituting these into the expression for $f(x, y)$, we find:
For $x = y + \frac{40}{3}$:
$$f(x, y) = \left(y + \frac{40}{3} - y\right)^2 + (-2\left(y + \frac{40}{3} - y\right)y + 3y^2)$$
$$= \left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 + 0 + 3y^2 = \frac{1600}{9} + 3y^2.$$
For $x = y - \frac{40}{3}$:
$$f(x, y) = \left(y - \frac{40}{3} - y\right)^2 + (-2\left(y - \frac{40}{3} - y\right)y + 3y^2)$$
$$= \left(-\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 + 0 + 3y^2 = \frac{1600}{9} + 3y^2.$$
Both expressions give the same value for $f(x, y)$.

To minimize $f(x, y)$, we need to minimize $3y^2$ while keeping $\frac{1600}{9}$ constant. Obviously, the minimum value is achieved when $y = 0$. This makes the expression $3y^2$ equal to $0$. So, the minimum value of $f(x, y)$ is $\frac{1600}{9}$. The problem is now solved. The minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $\frac{1600}{9}$. The answer is: $\boxed{\frac{1600}{9}}$

Using the identity $|a| + |b| = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + 2ab}$,
we have $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = \sqrt{(x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2 + 2(x - 2y)(y - 2x)} = \sqrt{5(x^2 + y^2 - 2xy)} = \sqrt{5((x - y)^2)} = | \sqrt{5}(x - y)|.$
Given that $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$, we have $\sqrt{5}|x - y| = 40$, so $|x - y| = \frac{40}{\sqrt{5}} = 8\sqrt{5}$.
Now we need to find the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ given the constraint $|x - y| = 8\sqrt{5}$.
Note that $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = \frac{1}{2}((5x - 4y)^2 + (3x - 6y)^2) - 10(x - y)^2$.
By the Trivial Inequality $a^2 + b^2 \geq \frac{1}{2}(a + b)^2$ for all real numbers $a$ and $b$,
we have $(5x - 4y)^2 + (3x - 6y)^2 \geq \frac{1}{2}((5x - 4y) + (3x - 6y))^2 = \frac{1}{2}(8(x - y))^2 = 32^2 (x - y)^2$.
Therefore, $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy \geq 32^2 (x - y)^2 - 10(x - y)^2 = 1024(x - y)^2 - 10(x - y)^2 = 1014(x - y)^2$.
Since $(x - y)^2 = (8\sqrt{5})^2 = 320$, we have $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy \geq 1014 \cdot 320 = 324480$.
Equality occurs when $5x - 4y = 3x - 6y$, so $2x = 2y$ and $x = y$. Conversely, if $x = y$, then $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = |x - 2x| + |x - 2x| = 0 \neq 40$.
However, we can rewrite the constraint $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$ as $|y - x| + |x - \frac{y}{2}| = 40$.
If we let $a = y - x$ and $b = x - \frac{y}{2}$, then $|a| + |b| = 40$. By the Triangle Inequality, $|a| + |b| \geq |a + b| = |y - x + x - \frac{y}{2}| = |\frac{y}{2}|$, so $|\frac{y}{2}| = 40$ and $|y| = 80$.
If $y = 80$, then $x = y = 80$, so $x - y = 0$ and $|x - y| = 0 \neq 8\sqrt{5}$. If $y = -80$, then $x = y = -80$, so $x - y = 0$ and $|x - y| = 0 \neq 8\sqrt{5}$.
Thus, the original constraint equation must be inconsistent, and there are no solutions $x$ and $y$ that satisfy it. This contradiction implies that our assumption that equality occurs in the Trivial Inequality must be false.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is greater than $324480$. In fact, it turns out that the minimum value is actually $324480$, but we don't need to find the exact values of $x$ and $y$ that achieve this minimum. The final answer is $\boxed{324480}$.
The answer is: 324480

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we note that $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|2y - x| + |2x - y| = 40$. This is the same as $|2y - x| + |x - 2y| = 40$. Using the property $|a| + |b| = |a + b| + |a - b|$, we have $|(2y - x) + (x - 2y)| + |(2y - x) - (x - 2y)| = 40$, which simplifies to $|0| + |x - 2y| = 40$, or $|x - 2y| = 40$. This means that $x - 2y = \pm 40$.

Now we consider the two cases:

Case 1: $x - 2y = 40$. Solving for $x$ we get $x = 2y + 40$. Substituting this into $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ gives
\begin{align*}
5(2y+40)^2 + 5y^2 - 8(2y+40)y &= 5(4y^2 + 160y + 1600) + 5y^2 - 16y^2 - 320y \\
&= 20y^2 + 800y + 8000 + 5y^2 - 16y^2 - 320y \\
&= -y^2 + 480y + 8000.
\end{align*}
By the Tchebyshev's Inequality, we know that if $a$ and $b$ are any real numbers, then $(a + b)/2$ is always between $a$ and $b$. Therefore, $$(2y + 40 + y)/2 = (3y + 40)/2$$ is always between $2y + 40$ and $y$. Thus we have $y \leq (3y + 40)/2 \leq 2y + 40$, which simplifies to $0 \leq y \leq 40$. 
By the Extreme Value Theorem (EVT), every continuous function defined on a closed interval $[a, b]$ attains its maximum and minimum in the interval. Therefore, the function $-y^2 + 480y + 8000$ has a minimum in the interval $[0, 40]$.

We can find this minimum by taking the derivative of $-y^2 + 480y + 8000$ and setting it equal to 0:
$$ \frac{d}{dy}(-y^2 + 480y + 8000) = -2y + 480 = 0 \Rightarrow y = 240.$$ But $y = 240$ is not in the interval $[0, 40]$. We must check the endpoints:
$$ -0^2 + 480 \cdot 0 + 8000 = 8000,$$
and
$$ -40^2 + 480 \cdot 40 + 8000 = 8000.$$
So in Case 1, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 8000.

Case 2: $x - 2y = -40$. Solving for $x$ we get $x = 2y - 40$. Substituting this into $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ gives
\begin{align*}
5(2y-40)^2 + 5y^2 - 8(2y-40)y &= 5(4y^2 - 160y + 1600) + 5y^2 - 16y^2 + 320y \\
&= 20y^2 - 800y + 8000 + 5y^2 - 16y^2 + 320y \\
&= -y^2 - 480y + 8000.
\end{align*}
Following the same reasoning as in Case 1, we find that the minimum value of $-y^2 - 480y + 8000$ in the interval $[0, 40]$ occurs at $y = 240$, but this is not in the interval. Checking the endpoints, we find
$$ -0^2 - 480 \cdot 0 + 8000 = 8000,$$
and
$$ -40^2 - 480 \cdot 40 + 8000 = 8000.$$
So also in Case 2, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 8000.

Therefore, in both cases the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is 8000. The answer is: $8000$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, note that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is equivalent to $|x-2y| = |y-2x| = 20$, by the properties of absolute value.
Now, we can use the identity $|a-b| = |b-a|$ to rewrite the equation as $|x-2y| = |2y-x|$.
This implies that $x-2y = \pm (2y-x)$, which simplifies to $x-2y = 2y-x$ or $x-2y = -(2y-x)$.
From the first case, we get $2x = 4y$, or $x = 2y$. Substituting this into the second equation, we get $2y - \frac{y}{2} = 20$, or $\frac{3y}{2} = 20$, or $y = \frac{40}{3}$.
Similarly, from the second case, we get $x - 2y = -(4y - x)$, or $x = -2y$. Substituting this into the second equation, we get $-2y - \frac{y}{2} = 20$, or $-\frac{5y}{2} = 20$, or $y = -\frac{80}{5} = -16$.
So, the possible pairs of $(x,y)$ are $(\frac{80}{3}, \frac{40}{3})$ and $(-32, -16)$. We now substitute these into $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.
For the first pair $(\frac{80}{3}, \frac{40}{3})$, we have $5\left(\frac{80}{3}\right)^2 + 5\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 - 8\left(\frac{80}{3}\right)\left(\frac{40}{3}\right) = \frac{6400}{9}$.
For the second pair $(-32, -16)$, we have $5(-32)^2 + 5(-16)^2 - 8(-32)(-16) = 0$.
Taking the minimum, we have that the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\boxed{0}$.
The value is 0.
The answer is: $0$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's simplify the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
We know that $|a-b| = |b-a|$, so we can rewrite the equation as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$.
By the definition of absolute value, either $x-2y + 2y - x = 40$ or $x-2y - (2y-x) = 40$.
The first equation simplifies to $0 = 40$, which has no solutions.
The second equation simplifies to $2(x-2y) = 40$, which gives $x-2y = 20$.
Now, let's consider the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$.
This can be rewritten as $5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x-2y)^2 + 4xy] - 8xy$.
Substituting $x-2y = 20$ into this expression gives $5[(20)^2 + 4xy] - 8xy = 5[400 + 4xy] - 8xy = 2000 + 20xy - 8xy = 2000 + 12xy$.
To minimize this expression, we want to minimize the value of $12xy$. Since the values of $x$ and $y$ are restricted by the condition $x-2y = 20$, we can express $y$ in terms of $x$ as $y = \frac{x-20}{2}$. Substituting this into $12xy$ gives $12x \cdot \frac{x-20}{2} = 6x(x-20) = 6x^2 - 120x$.
To find the minimum value of $6x^2 - 120x$, we can take the derivative with respect to $x$ and set it equal to zero: $12x - 120 = 0$, which gives $x = 10$. Then, $y = \frac{10-20}{2} = -5$.
Substituting $x = 10$ and $y = -5$ back into the expression $2000 + 12xy$, we get $2000 + 12(10)(-5) = 2000 - 600 = 1400$.
Therefore, the minimum value of the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is 1400.
The answer is: $1400$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, note that $|x-2y| + |y-2x|$ can be simplified as $|x-2y| + |2y-x|$.
By the triangle inequality, we know that $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$.
Thus, $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = |x-2y| + |- (x-2y)| = 2|x-2y|$.
Given that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we can substitute to find that $2|x-2y| = 40$, or $|x-2y| = 20$.
Since $|x-2y| = 20$ is equivalent to either $x-2y = 20$ or $x-2y = -20$,
we need to consider these two cases separately.
Case 1: $x-2y = 20$. Rearranging gives $x = 2y+20$.
Substituting into the expression we are minimizing, we have:
\[5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = 5(2y+20)^2 + 5y^2 - 8y(2y+20).\]
Expanding and simplifying, we get:
\[5(4y^2 + 80y + 400) + 5y^2 - 16y^2 - 160y = 20y^2 + 400y + 2000 + 5y^2 - 16y^2 - 160y = -y^2 + 240y + 2000.\]
Case 2: $x-2y = -20$. Rearranging gives $x = 2y - 20$.
Substituting into the expression we are minimizing, we have:
\[5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = 5(2y - 20)^2 + 5y^2 - 8y(2y - 20).\]
Expanding and simplifying, we get:
\[5(4y^2 - 80y + 400) + 5y^2 - 16y^2 + 160y = 20y^2 - 400y + 2000 + 5y^2 - 16y^2 + 160y = -y^2 - 240y + 2000.\]
Thus, in both cases, the expression we are minimizing is given by $-y^2 \pm By + C$, where $B$ and $C$ are constants.
This is a quadratic function, and its minimum value occurs at $y = \frac{-B}{2(-1)} = \frac{B}{2}$.
For Case 1, we have $B = 240$, so the minimum value of $-y^2 + 240y + 2000$ occurs at $y = \frac{240}{2} = 120$.
Substituting $y = 120$ back into the expression gives a minimum value of $-120^2 + 240(120) + 2000 = -14400 + 28800 + 2000 = 14400 + 2000 = 16400$.
For Case 2, we have $B = -240$, so the minimum value of $-y^2 - 240y + 2000$ occurs at $y = \frac{-240}{2(-1)} = 120$.
Substituting $y = 120$ back into the expression gives a minimum value of $-120^2 - 240(120) + 2000 = -14400 - 28800 + 2000 = -14400 + 2000 = -12400$.
Since the minimum value must be positive, we discard the negative value and take the positive minimum value of 16400.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ when $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 16400. The answer is: $16400$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


This problem seems to be trying to confuse you by having two expressions: one inside the absolute value brackets and one in the quadratic form. However, we can use algebraic manipulation to reduce it to something simpler. Let's start with the absolute value equation:

$|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.

This equation implies that $(x - 2y) + (2x - y) = 40$, or $3x - 3y = 40$, or $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$.

Substitute $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$ into the quadratic form:

$5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = 5(x^2 + y^2 - \frac{8}{5}xy)$.

Now, we can complete the square for the $xy$ term:

$x^2 + y^2 - \frac{8}{5}xy = (x^2 - \frac{8}{5}xy + y^2) - (\frac{4}{5})^2y^2 = (x - \frac{4}{5}y)^2 - (\frac{4}{5})^2y^2$.

So,

$5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = 5[(x - \frac{4}{5}y)^2 - (\frac{4}{5})^2y^2] = 5(x - \frac{4}{5}y)^2 - 16y^2$.

We can see that $5(x - \frac{4}{5}y)^2$ is always nonnegative, and $-16y^2$ is nonpositive. Thus, $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is minimized when both $5(x - \frac{4}{5}y)^2$ and $-16y^2$ are minimized simultaneously. This happens when $y = 0$ and $x = \frac{40}{3}$.

Substitute $y = 0$ and $x = \frac{40}{3}$ into the quadratic form:

$5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = 5(\frac{40}{3})^2 - 8*\frac{40}{3}*0 = \frac{8000}{9}$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is $\frac{8000}{9}$. The answer is: $\boxed{\frac{8000}{9}}$

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



To solve this problem, we first notice that the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ can be written as $\frac{5}{2}(x^2-2xy+y^2) + \frac{5}{2}(y^2-2xy+x^2) = \frac{5}{2}(x-y)^2 + \frac{5}{2}(y-x)^2$. 
This simplifies to $\frac{5}{2}(x-y)^2 + \frac{5}{2}(y-x)^2 = \frac{5}{2} \cdot 2(x-y)^2 = 5(x-y)^2$.
Now, let's turn our attention to the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. Using the property $|a| + |b| = |a-b| + |a+b|$, we can simplify the given condition to $|x-2y| + |- (x-2y)| = 40$, or $2|x-2y| = 40$. This implies $|x-2y| = 20$. Now, we square both sides of the equation, to get $(x-2y)^2 = 400$. Rearranging, we get $x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2 = 400$.
We can rewrite $5(x-y)^2$ as $\frac{5}{2}(x^2 - 2xy + y^2) + \frac{5}{2}(y^2 - 2xy + x^2) = \frac{5}{2}(x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2) = \frac{5}{2} \cdot 400 = 1000$.
Thus, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $1000$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\boxed{1000}$.
The answer is: $\boxed{1000}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


Using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we know that
$(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2 \ge 0$,
or $(x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2) + (y^2 - 4xy + 4x^2) \ge 0$,
or $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy \ge 0$.
So the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is 0, when $x = 2y$ and $y = 2x$.

To find when $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we substitute $x = 2y$ and $y = 2x$ into the equation, to get $|x-2(2x)| + |2x-2(x)| = 40$,
or $|-x| + |0| = 40$,
or $x = -40$ or $x = 40$.
Without loss of generality, let's take $x = 40$. Then $y = 2x = 80$.

Substituting these values into $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$, we get
$5(40)^2 + 5(80)^2 - 8(40)(80) = 8000$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0. But our solution above indicates that this minimum occurs at different values of $x$ and $y$. This leads us to reconsider the second hint given in the problem, i.e., $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. From the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we infer that $x$ and $y$ should each take two possible values. Setting $x=2y$, we get that the pairs $(x,y)$ that will satisfy our condition must satisfy $x=\pm 20$.

This makes sense from an algebraic standpoint. Notice, though, that when $x = 2y$, substituting into the modulus equation, we get $$ |x - 2y| + |y-2x| = |x-x| + |-x| = 2|-x| = 40 $$. Hence $$ |-x| = 20$$ which of course admits two solutions, $x=20$ and $x=-20$. Thus, there are in fact two solutions to this problem that we must examine. Both give $0$, yet only one must actually satisfy both conditions. To differentiate which one it is, we can again turn to intuition. We know the minimum will occur at a critical point of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$, but obviously our minimum should occur at a point that actually lies on the curve defined by the modulus condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. If we take $x=20$ and $y=10$, the sum doesn't equal $40$ whereas if we take $x=-20$ and $y=-10$ it does! Thus, $x=-20$ and $y=-10$ is the solution we want, and substituting into the expression for the function gives the minimum: $$ 5(-20)^2 + 5(-10)^2 - 8(-20)(-10) = 0. $$Hence, $\boxed{0}$ must be our minimum value. This makes more sense if we reexamine the original expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ in the broader context of calculus. This is in fact a type of "discriminant" in disguise, and will typically achieve its minimum or maximum value under prescribed conditions at its critical points (obtained through the aforementioned partial derivatives). In other words, upon first inspection we can discern that our original function changes concavity at $x=\frac{4}{5}y$, and further examination would confirm our intuition that $(0,0)$ is in fact the only critical point while also on the required curve defined by the modulus condition which confirms the critical point $(0,0)$ indeed defines our minimum value as required. Again, we emphasize that though this problem did technically utilize calculus, the only real benefit comes from realizing the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is in the form of a well-known algebraic identity, specifically, $(a-b)^2 + (b-c)^2 \ge 0$. If one recognizes that identity the problem could have been solved much quicker through basic logic and conceptual understanding of such mathematical identities as well as the modulus function.
