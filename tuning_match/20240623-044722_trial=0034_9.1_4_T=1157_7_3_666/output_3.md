Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which gives us four equations: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These four lines intersect to form a square with side length $20$.

Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These four lines also intersect to form a square with side length $16$.

The area of the convex polygon formed by the intersection of these two squares is equal to the area of the smaller square, which is $(20)^2 = 400$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $400$. The answer is: $400$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This means that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The absolute value equations can be split into two separate cases:

Case 1a: $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$. Adding these two equations gives $2x = 20$, so $x = 10$. Substituting $x = 10$ into the equation $x + y = 10$ gives $y = 0$. So one point is $(10, 0)$.

Case 1b: $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$. Adding these two equations gives $2x = -20$, so $x = -10$. Substituting $x = -10$ into the equation $x + y = -10$ gives $y = 0$. So another point is $(-10, 0)$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This means that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The absolute value equations can be split into two separate cases:

Case 2a: $x = 8$ and $y = 8$. So one point is $(8, 8)$.

Case 2b: $x = -8$ and $y = -8$. So another point is $(-8, -8)$.

Thus, the four vertices of the polygon are $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$. These four points form a rectangle with side lengths 16 and 20. The area of the rectangle is $16 \times 20 = 320$. The answer is: 320

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The equation given is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

This equation is equal to zero if either of the two terms is equal to zero. This gives us two sets of equations to solve:

1) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

2) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From the first set of equations, we have:

$\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

This gives us the following system of equations:

$x + y = \pm 10$, $x = \pm 8$, $x - y = \pm 10$, and $y = \pm 8$.

Solving this system, we find the following points:

$(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(2, 8)$, $(-2, 8)$, $(2, -8)$, and $(-2, -8)$.

These points form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

The second set of equations gives us the same points.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units. The answer is: $100$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if either of the two factors is equal to zero. 
If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$, which gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle with side lengths $20$ and $10\sqrt{2}$.
If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length $16$.
The intersection of the two sets of lines is the set of all points that satisfy both conditions, so the area of the convex polygon is the area of the rectangle minus the area of the square.
The area of the rectangle is $20 \times 10\sqrt{2} = 200\sqrt{2}$, and the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $200\sqrt{2} - 256$.
The value of $200\sqrt{2} - 256$ is approximately $282.84 - 256 = 26.84$. However, this is not a valid numerical answer for the area of the polygon, as area cannot be negative.
Therefore, we must have made an error in our calculations. Let's go back and check.
We found the side lengths of the rectangle by solving $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
From $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, we get $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$, which gives us the lines $y = -x + 10$ and $y = -x - 10$. The distance between these two lines is $20$, which is the length of one side of the rectangle.
Similarly, from $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, we get $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$, which gives us the lines $y = x - 10$ and $y = x + 10$. The distance between these two lines is also $20$, which is the length of the other side of the rectangle.
Therefore, the side lengths of the rectangle are $20$ and $10\sqrt{2}$.
From $\vert x \vert = 8$, we get $x = 8$ and $x = -8$, which gives us the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$. The distance between these two lines is $16$, which is the side length of the square.
Therefore, the side lengths of the square are $16$.
The area of the rectangle is indeed $20 \times 10\sqrt{2} = 200\sqrt{2}$, and the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $200\sqrt{2} - 256$.
The value of $200\sqrt{2} - 256$ is approximately $282.84 - 256 = 26.84$, which is not a valid numerical answer for the area of the polygon.
This suggests that we made a mistake in our calculations.
Let's re-examine the problem and look for a different approach.
The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ implies that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. This gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle.
If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square.
The intersection of the two sets of lines is the set of all points that satisfy both conditions, so the area of the convex polygon is the area of the rectangle minus the area of the square.
The side lengths of the rectangle are $20$ and $10\sqrt{2}$, so its area is $20 \times 10\sqrt{2} = 200\sqrt{2}$.
The side length of the square is $16$, so its area is $16^2 = 256$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $200\sqrt{2} - 256$.
The value of $200\sqrt{2} - 256$ is approximately $282.84 - 256 = 26.84$. However, this is not a valid numerical answer for the area of the polygon, as area cannot be negative.
Therefore, we must have made an error in our calculations. Let's go back and check.
We found the side lengths of the rectangle by solving $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
For $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$.
Similarly, for $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = \pm 10$.
For $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$.
And for $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = \pm 8$.
These equations define a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The equation
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$
is satisfied if either
$$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad (\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0.$$
The first equation is satisfied only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives the vertices of the square with side length 10: $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, and $(-5,-5)$.
The second equation is satisfied only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives the vertices of the square with side length 16: $(8,0)$, $(0,8)$, $(-8,0)$, and $(0,-8)$.
The convex polygon formed by the union of these two squares is a larger square with side length 18 (the maximum of the absolute values of the x and y coordinates of the four corner points). Therefore, the area of this convex polygon is $18^2 = 324$. The answer is: 324

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find the area of the polygon, we need to identify the points that satisfy the equation and then calculate the area.
The equation is given by:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$
This equation is equal to 0 if either of the two factors is equal to 0.
The first factor is equal to 0 when either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) = 0$.
The second factor is equal to 0 when either $(\vert x \vert - 8) = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8) = 0$.
Solving each of these equations:
1. For $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, so $x + y = \pm 10$.
2. For $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) = 0$, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, so $x - y = \pm 10$.
3. For $(\vert x \vert - 8) = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$, so $x = \pm 8$.
4. For $(\vert y \vert - 8) = 0$, we have $\vert y \vert = 8$, so $y = \pm 8$.
Combining these results, we find the points that satisfy the equation:
$$\begin{cases} x + y = 10 \\ x - y = 10 \end{cases}$$
$$\text{or}$$
$$\begin{cases} x + y = -10 \\ x - y = -10 \end{cases}$$
$$\text{or}$$
$$\begin{cases} x = 8 \\ y = 8 \end{cases}$$
$$\text{or}$$
$$\begin{cases} x = -8 \\ y = -8 \end{cases}$$
$$\text{or}$$
$$\begin{cases} x = 8 \\ y = -8 \end{cases}$$
$$\text{or}$$
$$\begin{cases} x = -8 \\ y = 8 \end{cases}$$
By plotting these points, we can see that they form a square with side length 20. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$. The positive numerical answer is 400. The answer is: $400$

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression equals zero if either $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$ or $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
The first equation is satisfied if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
These equations represent two pairs of parallel lines, $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.
The second equation is satisfied if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
These equations represent four lines, $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
The lines form a square with side length 16.
The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The expression $AB=0$ is satisfied if and only if at least one of the factors $A=0$ or $B=0$ is satisfied. Therefore, the given equation is satisfied if at least one of the following two conditions is satisfied:

1. $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$
2. $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$

For the first condition to be satisfied, we must have both $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(5,5), (5,-5), (-5,5), (-5,-5)$.

For the second condition to be satisfied, we must have both $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these four equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8,8), (8,-8), (-8,8), (-8,-8)$.

Combining the two sets of vertices, we find that the polygon is a 8x8 square. Therefore, its area is $8^2 = 64$. The answer is: $64$

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So, we have two cases to consider:
Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
This means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This means $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
In case 1, we have two isosceles right triangles with legs of length 10. In case 2, we have two squares with side length 8. The points satisfying both cases are the vertices of the convex polygon.
The area of each isosceles right triangle is $(1/2)(10)(10) = 50$, and the area of each square is $8^2 = 64$. So the total area of the convex polygon is $2(50 + 64) = 228$.
The answer is: $228$.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. 

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ means that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which gives us two lines: $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.
The equation $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ means that $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which gives us two lines: $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.
The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ means that $\vert x \vert = 8$, which gives us two lines: $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.
The equation $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ means that $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us two lines: $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

These lines form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $\boxed{256}$

The expression equals zero if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The first two equations simplify to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The third and fourth equations simplify to $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The equations $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$ define a square with side length 10.

The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two lines that are each $10$ units away from the origin $(0,0)$ in the plane.
Similarly, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which are the equations of two circles with radius $8$ centered at the origin.
The intersection points of these lines and circles are the solutions to the given equation.
Plotting these lines and circles, we find that they enclose a square with side length $16$.
The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So the area of the convex polygon is $256$ square units.
The answer is: $256$
