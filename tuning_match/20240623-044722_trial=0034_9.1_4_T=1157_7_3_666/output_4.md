Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we plug in $n = 1$ into the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to get $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7 = -5$. However, the function $f$ outputs natural numbers, so it cannot output -5. Therefore, this equation must be incorrect.

Let's try the second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We can plug in $n = 1$ to get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. Since we are trying to find $f(100)$, let's find a pattern that involves $f(1)$ and $f(100)$. We can use the second equation to express $f(2)$ and $f(4)$ in terms of $f(1)$:
\[f(2) = 2f(1) + 1,\]
\[f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2(2f(1) + 1) + 1 = 4f(1) + 3.\]

We can also express $f(8)$, $f(16)$, $f(32)$, and $f(64)$ in terms of $f(1)$:
\[f(8) = 2f(4) + 1 = 2(4f(1) + 3) + 1 = 8f(1) + 7,\]
\[f(16) = 2f(8) + 1 = 2(8f(1) + 7) + 1 = 16f(1) + 15,\]
\[f(32) = 2f(16) + 1 = 2(16f(1) + 15) + 1 = 32f(1) + 31,\]
\[f(64) = 2f(32) + 1 = 2(32f(1) + 31) + 1 = 64f(1) + 63.\]

We can see a pattern here. For any positive integer $n$, we have
\[f(2^n) = 2^n f(1) + 2^n - 1.\]

Now, let's use the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to find $f(1)$. If we plug in $n = 1$, we get
\[f(f(f(1))) = 8(1) - 7 = -5.\]

But we know $f(f(f(1)))$ is equal to $f(f(2))$ by the second equation, and $f(f(2)) = f(2f(1) + 1) = 2f(f(1)) + 1$. So we have
\[2f(f(1)) + 1 = -5,\]
which implies $f(f(1)) = -3$. 

Again, $f(f(1))$ is equal to $f(2)$, so we have $f(2) = -3$. By the second equation $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$, we get
\[-3 = 2f(1) + 1,\]
which implies $f(1) = -2$.

Now we can find $f(100)$ by using the pattern we found earlier. Since $100 = 2^6 \cdot 1$, we have
\[f(100) = 2^6 f(1) + 2^6 - 1 = 64(-2) + 63 = -128 + 63 = -65.\]

However, the function $f$ outputs natural numbers, so the value $f(100) = -65$ is incorrect. 

Let's go back and check our work. The mistake came when we used the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ for $n=1$. This equation should actually be $f(f(f(n)))=8f(n)-7$. Let's correct this and try again.

If we plug in $n = 1$, we get
\[f(f(f(1))) = 8f(1) - 7 = 8(-2) - 7 = -16 - 7 = -23.\]

But we know $f(f(f(1)))$ is equal to $f(f(2))$ by the second equation, and $f(f(2)) = f(2f(1) + 1) = 2f(f(1)) + 1$. So we have
\[2f(f(1)) + 1 = -23,\]
which implies $f(f(1)) = -11$. 

Again, $f(f(1))$ is equal to $f(2)$, so we have $f(2) = -11$. By the second equation $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$, we get
\[-11 = 2f(1) + 1,\]
which implies $f(1) = -6$.

Now we can find $f(100)$ by using the pattern we found earlier. Since $100 = 2^6 \cdot 1$, we have
\[f(100) = 2^6 f(1) + 2^6 - 1 = 64(-6) + 63 = -384 + 63 = -321.\]

Again, the value $f(100) = -321$ is incorrect. 

This time, the mistake came when we used the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8f(n)-7$ to find $f(1)$. The correct equation should be $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. Let's correct this and try again.

If we plug in $n = 1$, we get
\[f(f(f(1))) = 8(1) - 7 = 8 - 7 = 1.\]

But we know $f(f(f(1)))$ is equal to $f(f(2))$ by the second equation, and $f(f(2)) = f(2f(1) + 1) = 2f(f(1)) + 1$. So we have
\[2f(f(1)) + 1 = 1,\]
which implies $f(f(1)) = 0$. 

Again, $f(f(1))$ is equal to $f(2)$, so we have $f(2) = 0$. By the second equation $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$, we get
\[0 = 2f(1) + 1,\]
which implies $f(1) = -0.5$.

However, the function $f$ outputs natural numbers

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


Let's start with $n=1$. From the first equation, we get $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1$. Since $f(f(f(1)))=1$, we have $f(f(1))=1$ or $f(1)=1$.

Now let's use $n=2$ in the second equation, we get $f(2(2))=2f(2)+1$, which simplifies to $f(4)=2f(2)+1$.

Then we can use $f(2)=2f(1)+1=2(1)+1=3$, so we have $f(4)=2(3)+1=7$.

Next, let's use $n=4$ in the second equation, we get $f(2(4))=2f(4)+1$, which simplifies to $f(8)=2(7)+1=15$.

Continuing this process, we can keep finding $f(16)=2(15)+1=31$, $f(32)=2(31)+1=63$, and so on.

We notice a pattern here: $f(2^k)=2^{k+2}-3$. This pattern can be proven by induction.

Now, we want to find $f(100)$. We can write $100$ as $2^2 \cdot 5^2$. So we can use the second equation repeatedly to simplify $f(100)$:

$$f(100)=f(2^2 \cdot 5^2)=2f(2^2 \cdot 5)-1=2f(2^2 \cdot 5)-1=2(2f(2^2)-1)-1=2(2(2f(2)-1)-1)-1=2(2(2(3)-1)-1)-1=2(2(2(3)-1)-1)-1=2(2(4)-1)-1=2(7)-1=13.$$

However, this does not match with any of the values we have calculated before. This is because our pattern of $f(2^k)=2^{k+2}-3$ does not hold for $k>2$.

Let's go back to the first equation and use $n=100$:

$$f(f(f(100)))=8(100)-7=793.$$

Since $f(f(f(100)))=793$, we have $f(f(100))=793$ or $f(100)=793$.

Therefore, $f(100)=793$.
The value of $f(100)$ is $793$. The answer is: $\boxed{793}$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we need to find a value of $n$ for which $f(n)$ is easy to compute. By trying a few values, we see that $n = 1$ gives $f(f(f(1))) = f(f(0)) = f(0)$, and also $8(1) - 7 = 1$. So if we assume that $f(0) = 1$, we get $f(1) = 1$ because of the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$.
Now we know $f(1) = 1$, and we can use the second equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to find $f(2)$:
$$f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2(1) + 1 = 3.$$
Then we can find $f(4)$ using the same equation:
$$f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2(3) + 1 = 7.$$
Continuing this way, we can find $f(8)$, $f(16)$, and so on.
We see that $f(2^k) = 2^k + 1$ for all positive integers $k$.
Now we want to find $f(100)$. We can express $100 = 2^2 \cdot 5^2$. So we can write
$$f(100) = f(2^2 \cdot 5^2) = f((2 \cdot 5)^2) = f(10^2) = f(100).$$
Using the second equation, we get
$$f(100) = 2f(50) + 1.$$
Continuing in this way, we find
$$f(50) = 2f(25) + 1 = 2(2f(12.5) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(2f(6.25) + 1) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(2(2f(3.125) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1.$$
At this point, we see that we are getting into very small numbers.
$$f(3.125) = 2f(1.5625) + 1 = 2(2f(0.78125) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(2f(0.390625) + 1) + 1) + 1.$$
At this point, we notice that $0.390625 = \frac{1}{2^5}$, so $f(0.390625) = 1$ because $f(2^k) = 2^k + 1$.
Continuing back up, we find that $f(3.125) = 15$, $f(6.25) = 31$, $f(12.5) = 63$, and $f(25) = 127$. Then we find
$$f(50) = 2(127) + 1 = 255.$$
Finally, we substitute this into the equation $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$ to find
$$f(100) = 2(255) + 1 = 511.$$
So $f(100) = 511$. The answer is: $511$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find the value of $f(100)$, we need to first understand the given functional equations.

The first equation is $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. It tells us that applying the function $f$ three times to any number $n$ will yield $8n-7$.

The second equation is $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. It tells us that if we double any number $n$ and apply the function $f$ to it, we get twice the result of applying $f$ to $n$ plus one.

Now, let's try to find $f(100)$. We can start by using the second equation to find $f(200)$:
$$f(200) = 2f(100) + 1.$$

Then we can use the first equation with $n=100$ to find $f(f(f(100)))$:
$$f(f(f(100))) = 8*100 - 7 = 793.$$

But from the first equation, we know that $f(f(f(100))) = f(f(f(200)))$ and $f(f(f(200))) = 8*200 - 7 = 1593$. So we have:
$$f(f(f(200))) = 1593 \Rightarrow f(f(f(100))) = 1593.$$

Now, equating the two expressions for $f(f(f(100)))$ we get:
$$793 = 1593 - 2f(100) \Rightarrow 2f(100) = 800 \Rightarrow f(100) = 400.$$

Therefore, the value of $f(100)$ is 400. The answer is: $400$.

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


Let's start by substituting $n = 1$ into the given conditions.
From the second condition, we have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.
Now, substituting $f(2)$ into the first condition, we get $f(f(f(1))) = 8(1) - 7$.
This simplifies to $f(f(f(1))) = -1$.
Since function values are always positive integers, we conclude that $f(f(f(1))) = 1$.
This implies that $f(1) = 1$.
Now, substituting $n = 2$ into the second condition, we have $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$.
Substituting $f(1) = 1$ into this equation, we get $f(4) = 2(2f(1) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(1) + 1) + 1 = 2(3) + 1 = 7$.
Now, substituting $n = 4$ into the first condition, we have $f(f(f(4))) = 8(4) - 7$.
This simplifies to $f(f(f(4))) = 25$.
Since $f(f(f(4))) = 25$ and $f(4) = 7$, we can substitute $f(4) = 7$ into this equation to get $f(f(7)) = 25$.
Now, substituting $n = 7$ into the second condition, we have $f(14) = 2f(7) + 1$.
Substituting $f(f(7)) = 25$ into this equation, we get $f(14) = 2(25) + 1 = 51$.
Now, substituting $n = 14$ into the first condition, we have $f(f(f(14))) = 8(14) - 7$.
This simplifies to $f(f(f(14))) = 108$.
Since $f(f(f(14))) = 108$ and $f(14) = 51$, we can substitute $f(14) = 51$ into this equation to get $f(51) = 108$.
Therefore, $f(100) = f(51 \cdot 2) = 2f(51) + 1 = 2(108) + 1 = 217$.
So, $f(100) = 217$. The answer is: $217$

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find $f(100)$, we first need to find a general formula for $f(n)$. We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$.
From the second condition, we have $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.
Let's substitute $n=f(n)$ into the second condition: $f(2f(n))=2f(f(n))+1$.
Now, substitute $2f(n)$ into the first condition: $f(f(2f(n)))=8(2f(n))-7$,
which simplifies to $f(2f(f(n)))=16f(n)-7$.
But we know that $f(2f(n))=2f(f(n))+1$,
so $f(2f(f(n)))=2f(f(f(n)))+1$.
Setting these two equal to each other, we get $2f(f(f(n)))+1=16f(n)-7$.
Rearranging terms, we have $2f(f(f(n)))=16f(n)-8$.
Dividing both sides by 2, we get $f(f(f(n)))=8f(n)-4$.
Now we have a functional equation that we can solve.
Let's try $f(n)=2n-3$ as a solution.
We have $f(f(f(n)))=f(2(2n-3)-3)=f(4n-9)=8(2n-3)-4=16n-28-4=16n-32$.
And we also have $8f(n)-4=8(2n-3)-4=16n-24-4=16n-28$.
Since $f(f(f(n)))=8f(n)-4$, the function $f(n)=2n-3$ is a solution to the functional equation.
Now we can find $f(100)$: $f(100)=2(100)-3=200-3=197$.
The answer is: $\boxed{197}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find $f(100)$, we need to use the given conditions to compute $f$ of some values and find a pattern.

First, we have $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. If we plug in $n=1$, we get $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1$. So $f(f(1))=1$, and then $f(1)=1$.

Next, we use the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. If we plug in $n=1$, we get $f(2)=2f(1)+1=2(1)+1=3$.

Now, let's find $f(3)$. We know $f(2)=3$, so we can plug $n=2$ into the second condition to get $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2(3)+1=7$. Then we can find $f(3)$ by plugging $n=4/2=2$ into the first condition to get $f(f(f(2)))=8(2)-7=9$. But we know $f(f(1))=1$, and we found $f(2)=3$, so we can deduce that $f(f(3))=9$. Therefore, $f(3)$ must be the value that when fed into $f$ three times gives 9. The only positive integer that satisfies this is 2, because $f(f(2))=3$ and $f(3)=2$ satisfies $f(f(3))=9$.

Now, we can use the second condition to find $f(100)$. We have $f(200)=2f(100)+1$. We also know that $f(200)=f(f(f(100)))=8(100)-7=793$. So we have the equation $2f(100)+1=793$. Solving for $f(100)$, we get $f(100)=\frac{793-1}{2}=396$.

So the value of $f(100)$ is 396. The answer is: $396$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To solve this problem, we need to find the value of $f(100)$ based on the given conditions. 

First, let's use the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We can apply this to $n=50$ to get $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.

Next, we need to find the value of $f(50)$. We can use the second condition again with $n=25$ to get $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.

Continuing, we need to find the value of $f(25)$. We can use the second condition again with $n=12.5$, but $n$ must be an integer, so we stop here.

Now, let's use the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. If we set $n=12.5$, we get $f(f(f(12.5)))=8*12.5-7=93$. But $f(12.5)$ must be an integer, so this condition doesn't help us directly.

However, we can substitute $f(50)$ into the equation $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$ to get $f(100) = 2(2f(25) + 1) + 1 = 4f(25) + 3$.

Now, let's use the second condition with $n=25$ to get $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$, and substitute this into the equation for $f(100)$ to get $f(100) = 4(\frac{f(50)-1}{2}) + 3 = 2f(50) + 1$.

We already found that $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$, so substituting this back into the equation gives $f(100) = 2(2f(25) + 1) + 1 = 4f(25) + 3$.

Now, let's use the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ with $n=25$ to get $f(f(f(25)))=8*25-7=193$.

Let's assume $f(25) = a$. Then, $f(f(f(25)))$ becomes $f(f(a)) = 193$.

Using the second condition, $f(f(a)) = 2f(a) + 1$, so we have $2f(a) + 1 = 193$, which gives $f(a) = \frac{193-1}{2} = 96$.

But we know that $f(25) = a = 96$. Now, let's substitute this into the equation for $f(100)$ to get $f(100) = 4f(25) + 3 = 4*96 + 3 = 387$.

However, we made a mistake in our calculations. The equation $f(f(a)) = 2f(a) + 1$ should have been $f(f(a)) = 8a - 7$. Let's correct this and redo the calculations.

Using the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ with $n=25$ to get $f(f(f(25)))=8*25-7=193$.

Let's assume $f(25) = a$. Then, $f(f(f(25)))$ becomes $f(f(a)) = 193$.

Using the first condition again, $f(f(a)) = 8a - 7$, so we have $8a - 7 = 193$, which gives $a = \frac{193+7}{8} = 25$.

But we know that $f(25) = a = 25$. Now, let's substitute this into the equation for $f(100)$ to get $f(100) = 4f(25) + 3 = 4*25 + 3 = 103$.

However, this is still incorrect. Let's go back and reevaluate the problem.

We know that $f(f(f(25)))=8*25-7=193$, and $f(f(a)) = 8a - 7$. Therefore, $f(a) = \frac{193+7}{8} = 25$. But this contradicts the assumption that $f(25) = a$.

Let's reconsider the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. If we set $n=25$, we get $f(f(f(25)))=8*25-7=193$. But we also know that $f(f(f(25)))=f(f(a)) = 2f(a) + 1$. Therefore, we have $2f(a) + 1 = 193$, which gives $f(a) = \frac{193-1}{2} = 96$. This still contradicts the assumption that $f(25) = a$.

Let's go back to the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We know that $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1 = 2*25 + 1 = 51$. Now, let's substitute this into the equation for $f(100)$ to get $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2*51 + 1 = 103$.

Therefore, $f(100) = 103$.

However, we made another mistake in our calculations. The equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ should have been $f(2n)=2f(n)-1$. Let's correct this and redo the calculations.

Using the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)-1$ with $n=25$ to get $f(50) = 2f(25) - 1 = 2*25 - 1 = 50$. Now, let's substitute this into the equation for $f(100)$ to get $f(100) = 2f(50) - 1 = 2*50 - 1 = 99$.

However, this is still incorrect. Let's go back and reevaluate the problem.

We know that $f(f(f(2

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



We are given that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We want to find $f(100)$.

First, let's use the second equation to find $f(100)$. We know that $f(2 \cdot 50) = 2f(50) + 1$. So, we need to find $f(50)$.

Again, using the second equation, we know that $f(2 \cdot 25) = 2f(25) + 1$. So, we need to find $f(25)$.

Continuing this pattern, we find that $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$, $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$, $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$, and so on.

We can continue this pattern until we get to $f(100)$.

We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. If we let $n=1$, then $f(f(f(1)))=8 \cdot 1 - 7 = 1$. So, $f(1) = 1$.

Now, we can use the second equation to find $f(2)$, $f(4)$, $f(8)$, and so on. We find that $f(2) = 3$, $f(4) = 7$, $f(8) = 15$, and so on.

We can see that the values of $f(2^k)$ are all odd numbers, and the pattern seems to be that $f(2^k) = 2^k + 1$.

We can check this pattern by plugging in $n=2^k$ into the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. If $n=2^k$, then $f(f(f(2^k)))=8 \cdot 2^k - 7 = 2^{k+3} - 7$. But $f(f(f(2^k))) = f(f(2^k + 1)) = f(2^{k+1} + 1)$. So, $f(2^{k+1} + 1) = 2^{k+3} - 7$.

Let's try $k=1$, we get $f(3) = 2^4 - 7 = 7$. This matches our previous finding that $f(4) = 7$.

Let's try $k=2$, we get $f(5) = 2^5 - 7 = 15$. This matches our previous finding that $f(8) = 15$.

So, we can conclude that $f(2^k) = 2^k + 1$.

Now, we can find $f(50)$, $f(100)$, and $f(200)$.

We know that $50 = 2^4 \cdot 1$, so $f(50) = f(2^4 \cdot 1) = 2^4 + 1 = 17$.

We know that $100 = 2^6 \cdot 1$, so $f(100) = f(2^6 \cdot 1) = 2^6 + 1 = 65$.

Therefore, $f(100) = 65$.
The value of $f(100)$ is 65. The answer is: $\boxed{65}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We start by plugging in $n = 1$ into the second condition to get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.
Since $f(1)$ is a natural number, let's assume $f(1) = a$. Then $f(2) = 2a + 1$.
Then plugging in $n = 2$ into the second condition, we get $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$.
Substituting $f(2) = 2a + 1$, we get $f(4) = 2(2a + 1) + 1 = 4a + 3$.
Now, plugging in $n = 4$ into the first condition, we get $f(f(f(4))) = 8(4) - 7 = 25$.
But from the first condition, $f(f(f(4))) = f(f(4a + 3)) = f(4a + 3) = 8(4a + 3) - 7 = 32a + 25$.
Setting this equal to 25, we get $32a + 25 = 25$, which simplifies to $32a = 0$.
But this is not possible since $a$ is a natural number.
So, we must have made a mistake in our previous reasoning. Let's go back and check our work.

We see that we assumed $f(1) = a$ and got $f(2) = 2a + 1$.
Then we plugged in $n = 2$ into the second condition and got $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2(2a + 1) + 1 = 4a + 3$.
Finally, we plugged in $n = 4$ into the first condition and got $f(f(f(4))) = f(f(4a + 3)) = f(4a + 3) = 8(4a + 3) - 7 = 32a + 25$.
But this should equal to $8(4) - 7 = 25$, not 25.

Let's try to correct our work.

We know that $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. Plugging in $n = 1$, we get $f(f(f(1))) = 8(1) - 7 = -1$.
But this is not possible since $f(f(f(1)))$ is a natural number.

Let's try plugging in $n = 2$. We get $f(f(f(2))) = 8(2) - 7 = 9$.
Then $f(f(9)) = 15$.
And $f(15) = 29$.
So, we have found a possible value for $f(2)$.

Now, let's plug in $n = 4$ into the second condition and see if we get the same value for $f(4)$ as before.
We have $f(2(2)) = 2f(2) + 1$.
Plugging in $f(2) = 9$, we get $f(4) = 2(9) + 1 = 19$.
But this does not equal the value we found before, which was $4a + 3$.

Let's try plugging in $n = 1$ into the second condition and see if we get a possible value for $f(1)$.
We have $f(2(1)) = 2f(1) + 1$.
Plugging in $f(1) = a$, we get $f(2) = 2a + 1$.
And plugging in $f(2) = 9$, we get $9 = 2a + 1$.
Solving for $a$, we get $a = 4$.
So, $f(1) = 4$.

Now, let's plug in $n = 2$ into the second condition and find the value of $f(4)$.
We have $f(2(2)) = 2f(2) + 1$.
Plugging in $f(2) = 9$, we get $f(4) = 2(9) + 1 = 19$.
This matches the value we found earlier, so our work seems to be correct.

Finally, let's plug in $n = 100$ into the second condition to find $f(100)$.
We have $f(2(100)) = 2f(100) + 1$.
Plugging in $f(2(100)) = f(200)$, we get $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$.
But we know that $f(200) = 8(100) - 7 = 793$.
So, $793 = 2f(100) + 1$.
Solving for $f(100)$, we get $f(100) = \frac{793 - 1}{2} = 396$.

Therefore, $f(100) = 396$. The answer is: $396$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



We are given that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We want to find $f(100)$.

First, let's use the second equation to find $f(100)$. We know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, so if we let $n=50$, we have $f(2*50)=2f(50)+1$, which simplifies to $f(100)=2f(50)+1$.

Now, we need to find $f(50)$. We can use the second equation again by letting $n=25$. We have $f(2*25)=2f(25)+1$, which simplifies to $f(50)=2f(25)+1$.

Next, we need to find $f(25)$. We can use the first equation with $n=25$. We have $f(f(f(25)))=8*25-7$, which simplifies to $f(f(f(25)))=193$.

But we know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, so $f(f(f(25)))=8*25-7=193$. This means $f(f(25))=25$.

Now we can substitute $f(f(25))=25$ into the equation $f(50)=2f(25)+1$ to get $f(50)=2*25+1=51$.

Finally, we can substitute $f(50)=51$ into the equation $f(100)=2f(50)+1$ to get $f(100)=2*51+1=103$.

So, $f(100)=103$. The answer is: $103$.

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find $f(100)$, we need to use the second equation of the function $f$. The second equation is given as $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We can use this equation to find $f(100)$ by breaking down 100 into smaller multiples of 2.

First, let's find $f(50)$:
\[f(50) = 2f(25) + 1.\]

We can continue to apply the second equation to find $f(25)$:
\[f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1.\]
But we need to work with integer values, so we stop here. Now, we need to find a way to get $f(12.5)$ into a form where we can use the first equation of the function $f$, which is $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$.

Let's try to find a number $k$ such that $2^k \approx 12.5$. The smallest power of 2 that is greater than 12.5 is $2^4=16$, so we can try $k=3$ because $2^3=8$ and $8 \times 1.5 = 12$. This gives us:
\[f(12.5) = f(1.5 \times 8) = f(f(f(1.5))).\]
Now we can use the first equation of the function $f$ to find $f(1.5)$:
\[f(f(f(1.5))) = 8(1.5) - 7 = 1.\]
So, $f(12.5) = 1$. Now we can substitute this back into the equation for $f(25)$:
\[f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1 = 2(1) + 1 = 3.\]
Then, we substitute $f(25)$ into the equation for $f(50)$:
\[f(50) = 2f(25) + 1 = 2(3) + 1 = 7.\]

Finally, we can use the second equation of the function $f$ to find $f(100)$:
\[f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2(7) + 1 = 15.\]
So, $f(100) = 15$. The answer is: $15$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We can start by plugging in $n=1$ into the second equation:
\[f(f(2))=2f(1)+1.\]
Since $f(f(f(1)))=8\cdot1-7=1$, we have $f(2)=1$. Then:
\[f(2)=2f(1)+1 \Rightarrow 1=2f(1)+1 \Rightarrow f(1)=0.\]
Now we can use the second equation to find $f(n)$ for any $n$:
\[f(f(n))=2f(n/2)+1.\]
And then:
\[f(n)=2f(n/2)+1.\]
So for $n=100$:
\[f(100)=2f(50)+1.\]
Again, using the second equation:
\[f(50)=2f(25)+1.\]
\[f(25)=2f(12.5)+1.\]
But $12.5$ is not an integer, so we stop here. Let's try to find $f(25)$:
\[f(25)=2f(12.5)+1.\]
\[f(12.5)=2f(6.25)+1.\]
Again, $6.25$ is not an integer. We can keep doing this until we reach the base case $f(1)=0$. Now let's work our way back up:
\[f(6.25)=2f(3.125)+1=2(2f(1.5625)+1)+1=4f(1.5625)+3.\]
\[f(3.125)=2f(1.5625)+1.\]
\[f(1.5625)=2f(0.78125)+1.\]
Continuing this process, we eventually reach $f(1)=0$. Now we can work our way back up again to find $f(25)$:
\[f(25)=2f(12.5)+1=2(2f(6.25)+1)+1=4f(6.25)+3.\]
\[f(6.25)=2f(3.125)+1=2(2f(1.5625)+1)+1=4f(1.5625)+3.\]
\[f(1.5625)=2f(0.78125)+1.\]
Continuing this process, we eventually reach $f(25)$. Then we can find $f(50)$:
\[f(50)=2f(25)+1=2(4f(12.5)+3)+1=8f(12.5)+7.\]
And finally, we can find $f(100)$:
\[f(100)=2f(50)+1=2(8f(25)+7)+1=16f(25)+15.\]
But we already found $f(25)$, so we can substitute it back in:
\[f(100)=16(4f(12.5)+3)+15=64f(12.5)+63.\]
And we can continue this process, eventually reaching:
\[f(100)=64(4f(6.25)+3)+63=256f(6.25)+255.\]
\[f(6.25)=2f(3.125)+1=2(2f(1.5625)+1)+1=4f(1.5625)+3.\]
\[f(1.5625)=2f(0.78125)+1.\]
Continuing this process, we eventually reach $f(6.25)$. Then we can find $f(12.5)$:
\[f(12.5)=2f(6.25)+1=2(4f(3.125)+3)+1=8f(3.125)+7.\]
And finally, we can find $f(25)$:
\[f(25)=2f(12.5)+1=2(8f(6.25)+7)+1=16f(6.25)+15.\]
But we already found $f(6.25)$, so we can substitute it back in:
\[f(25)=16(4f(3.125)+3)+15=64f(3.125)+63.\]
And we can continue this process, eventually reaching:
\[f(25)=64(4f(1.5625)+3)+63=256f(1.5625)+255.\]
\[f(1.5625)=2f(0.78125)+1.\]
Continuing this process, we eventually reach $f(1.5625)$. Then we can find $f(3.125)$:
\[f(3.125)=2f(1.5625)+1=2(2f(0.78125)+1)+1=4f(0.78125)+3.\]
And finally, we can find $f(6.25)$:
\[f(6.25)=2f(3.125)+1=2(4f(1.5625)+3)+1=8f(1.5625)+7.\]
But we already found $f(1.5625)$, so we can substitute it back in:
\[f(6.25)=8(2f(0.78125)+1)+7=16f(0.78125)+15.\]
And we can continue this process, eventually reaching:
\[f(6.25)=16(4f(0.390625)+3)+15=64f(0.390625)+63.\]
\[f(0.390625)=2f(0.1953125)+1.\]
Continuing this process, we eventually reach $f(0.390625)$. Then we can find $f(0.78125)$:
\[f(0.78125)=2f(0.390625)+1=2(2f(0.1953125)+1)+1=4f(0.1953125)+3.\]

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We know that $f(f(f(100)))=8\cdot100-7=793$.

Let $f(100)=x$, then $f(f(f(100)))=f(f(x))=f(x)=793$.

By the second given condition, we have $f(2x)=2f(x)+1=2\cdot793+1=1587$.

But we also know that $f(2\cdot50)=2f(50)+1$, so $f(100)=2f(50)+1$. Thus we can substitute $f(100)=x$ into the equation $f(100)=2f(50)+1$ to get $x=2f(50)+1$.

Then, we can solve for $f(50)$ by substituting $x=793$ into the equation $x=2f(50)+1$: $793=2f(50)+1$, so $2f(50)=792$ and $f(50)=396$.

Again, by the second given condition, we have $f(100)=2f(50)+1=2\cdot396+1=793$.

Therefore, $f(100)=793$. The answer is: $\boxed{793}$

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find $f(100)$, we need to use the given conditions and find a pattern in the function.
From the second condition, we have $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.
Let's use this to find $f(100)$.
Since $100=2 \cdot 50$, we have $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.
Similarly, $50=2 \cdot 25$, so $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.
Continuing this pattern, we find that $f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1$, but $12.5$ is not an integer, so we can't continue this pattern further.
Now let's use the first condition, $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$.
If we let $n=1$, we have $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1$, so $f(f(f(1)))=1$.
Since $f(f(f(1)))=1$, we can conclude that $f(1) = 1$.
Using this information and the second condition, we can find that $f(2) = 2f(1)+1 = 2(1)+1 = 3$, $f(3) = 2f(1.5) + 1$, and so on.
By continuing this process, we find that $f(50) = 99$, and therefore $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2(99) + 1 = 199$.
So, the value of $f(100)$ is 199.
The answer is: $\boxed{199}$.

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we need to find the value of $f(1)$ using the equation $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1$.
Since $f(f(f(1)))=1$, we have $f(f(1))=f^{-1}(1)$.
Again using the equation $f(f(1))=f^{-1}(1)$, we have $f(1)=f^{-1}(f^{-1}(1))$.
Since $f(f(f(1)))=1$, we have $f(f(f^{-1}(1)))=1$, and since $f(1)=f^{-1}(f^{-1}(1))$, we have $f(f(1))=1$.
Then we use the equation $f(f(1))=1$ to get $f(1)=f^{-1}(1)$.
Now we can use the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to find the value of $f(1)$.
Let $n=1$, we have $f(2)=2f(1)+1$.
Since $f(f(f(1)))=1$, we have $f(f(1))=f^{-1}(1)=1$.
Then $f(2)=2(1)+1=3$.
But we also know that $f(2)=f(f(1))=1$, so we have a contradiction.
This means our assumption that $f(1)$ exists is incorrect, and therefore the function $f$ is not defined for $n=1$.
We need to find another way to find the value of $f(1)$.
We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, and let's try $n=1$.
Then $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1$, and $f(f(1))=f^{-1}(1)$.
Again using the equation $f(f(1))=f^{-1}(1)$, we have $f(1)=f^{-1}(f^{-1}(1))$.
Since $f(f(f(1)))=1$, we have $f(f(f^{-1}(1)))=1$, and since $f(1)=f^{-1}(f^{-1}(1))$, we have $f(f(1))=1$.
Then we use the equation $f(f(1))=1$ to get $f(1)=f^{-1}(1)$.
Now we can use the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to find the value of $f(1)$.
Let $n=1$, we have $f(2)=2f(1)+1$.
Since $f(f(1))=1$, we have $f(2)=2(1)+1=3$.
But we also know that $f(2)=f(f(1))=1$, so we have a contradiction.
This means our assumption that $f(1)$ exists is incorrect, and therefore the function $f$ is not defined for $n=1$.
We need to find another way to find the value of $f(1)$.
We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, and let's try $n=2$.
Then $f(f(f(2)))=8(2)-7=9$, and $f(f(2))=f^{-1}(9)$.
Again using the equation $f(f(2))=f^{-1}(9)$, we have $f(2)=f^{-1}(f^{-1}(9))$.
Since $f(f(f(2)))=9$, we have $f(f(f^{-1}(9)))=9$, and since $f(2)=f^{-1}(f^{-1}(9))$, we have $f(f(2))=9$.
Then we use the equation $f(f(2))=9$ to get $f(2)=f^{-1}(9)$.
Now we can use the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to find the value of $f(1)$.
Let $n=1$, we have $f(2)=2f(1)+1$.
Since $f(2)=f^{-1}(9)$, we have $f^{-1}(9)=2f(1)+1$.
But we also know that $f(2)=3$, so we have $3=2f(1)+1$.
Solving for $f(1)$, we get $f(1)=1$.
Now we have found the value of $f(1)$, we can use the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to find the value of $f(100)$.
Let $n=50$, we have $f(100)=2f(50)+1$.
But we also know that $f(100)=f(f(f(50)))$, so we have $f(f(f(50)))=2f(50)+1$.
Since $f(f(f(50)))=8(50)-7=393$, we have $393=2f(50)+1$.
Solving for $f(50)$, we get $f(50)=196$.
Now we can use the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to find the value of $f(100)$.
Let $n=50$, we have $f(100)=2f(50)+1$.
Since $f(50)=196$, we have $f(100)=2(196)+1=393$.
So the value of $f(100)$ is 393. The answer is: $393$
