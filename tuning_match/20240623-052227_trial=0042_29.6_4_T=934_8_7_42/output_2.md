Approach:


We know that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.
By analyzing the graph of the function $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, we can find that there are $4$ distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to the height of the "bump" in the graph, which is $1$. So we have $\frac{m}{100} = 1$.

Solution:
To solve for $m$, we can multiply both sides of the equation by $100$: $m = 100$. So the value of $m$ that makes the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have $4$ distinct solutions is $100$. The answer is: $\boxed{1}$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"

Approach:


To solve this problem, we need to understand the behavior of the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ and find the number of values of $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions.

Step 1: Analyze the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$
The function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has the following piecewise form:

\[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = 
\begin{cases}
3-x, & \text{if } x < 1 \\
-(x-3), & \text{if } 1 \leq x < 3 \\
x-5, & \text{if } x \geq 3
\end{cases}\]

The graph of this function is a "V" shape with vertices at $(1, 1)$ and $(3, 1)$.

Step 2: Identify the values of $m$ that yield 4 distinct solutions
The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if $\frac{m}{100}$ is between $0$ and $1$ (inclusive). This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is bounded between $0$ and $1$. Thus, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be within this interval for there to be 4 distinct solutions.

Multiplying through by $100$, we have $0 \leq m \leq 100$.

Step 3: Count the number of positive integer values of $m$ in the range $[0, 100]$
There are exactly $101$ positive integers in the range $[0, 100]$.

But since $m$ cannot be $0$, there are actually $100$ positive integer values of $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the given condition is $100$.
The answer is: $100$

Approach:


We know that the equation $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. 

Let's consider the cases of $|x - 1|$ being less than or equal to 2 and greater than 2 separately.

Case 1: $|x - 1| \leq 2$ 

This implies that $-2 \leq x - 1 \leq 2$, which simplifies to $-1 \leq x \leq 3$.

In this case, the equation becomes $|-x + 1 - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ or $| -x - 1| = \frac{m}{100}$. 

This simplifies to $x + 1 = \frac{m}{100}$ or $x + 1 = -\frac{m}{100}$. 

For the first equation, $x = -\frac{m}{100} - 1$. As $x \leq 3$, we get $-\frac{m}{100} - 1 \leq 3$, which simplifies to $-\frac{m}{100} \leq 4$, or $m \geq -400$. 

For the second equation, $x = -(-\frac{m}{100}) - 1 = \frac{m}{100} - 1$. As $x \geq -1$, we get $\frac{m}{100} - 1 \geq -1$, which simplifies to $\frac{m}{100} \geq 0$, or $m \geq 0$.

Therefore, in this case, we have $m \geq 0$ and $m \geq -400$. As $m$ is positive, $m \geq 0$ is automatically satisfied. The lower bound for $m$ in this case is $0$.

Case 2: $|x - 1| > 2$ 

This implies that either $x - 1 > 2$ or $x - 1 < -2$, which simplifies to $x > 3$ or $x < -1$.

In this case, the equation becomes $|x - 1 - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ or $|x - 1 + 2| = \frac{m}{100}$.

This simplifies to $|x - 3| = \frac{m}{100}$ or $|x + 1| = \frac{m}{100}$.

For the first equation, $x - 3 = \frac{m}{100}$ or $x - 3 = -\frac{m}{100}$. 

For the second equation, $x + 1 = \frac{m}{100}$ or $x + 1 = -\frac{m}{100}$.

As $x > 3$, $x - 3 = \frac{m}{100}$ or $x - 3 = -\frac{m}{100}$ would give $x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$ or $x = -\frac{m}{100} + 3$. 

However, for the second equation, $x + 1 = \frac{m}{100}$ or $x + 1 = -\frac{m}{100}$ would give $x = \frac{m}{100} - 1$ or $x = -\frac{m}{100} - 1$. 

But as $x < -1$, $\frac{m}{100} - 1 < -1$, which implies $m < 100$, and $-\frac{m}{100} - 1 < -1$ ,which implies $m > -100$. But we know $m$ is positive, so $m > -100$ is automatically satisfied. The upper bound for $m$ in this case is 100.

Combining both cases, we have $0 \leq m \leq 100$. 

The total number of possible positive integer values of $m$ is the number of integers from 1 to 100, which is 100.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 100.

The answer is: $100$

Approach:


First, let's analyze the equation $ \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.

This equation has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} \leq 2$ because the absolute value expression on the left can take on a maximum value of $2$ in order to have $4$ distinct solutions. This implies that $m \leq 200$. 

Also, the absolute value expression on the left must be equal to $\frac{m}{100}$ exactly twice, because it is a even function (symmetric about the y-axis). This means that $\frac{m}{100}$ must be a value that the absolute value expression on the left can take on twice.

The absolute value expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ takes on the value of $2-\frac{m}{100}$ twice in the interval $[3-2\frac{m}{100}, 1+2\frac{m}{100}]$. This means that $2 - \frac{m}{100} > 0$, or equivalently, $m < 200$.

Therefore, the only value of $m$ that satisfies all these conditions is $m = 100$.

So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $1$. The answer is: $\boxed{1}$

Approach:


For a function to have 4 distinct solutions, the function must be an equation of two intersecting lines with two distinct roots each (one for the top half and one for the bottom half of the absolute value function). Therefore, we want to find how many values of $m$ will result in the right hand side to be a fractional value that intersects the graph of the absolute value function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$.
The right hand side is $\frac{m}{100}$, which must be a fraction between $0$ and $1$ for the equation to have $4$ distinct solutions (since the maximum value of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is $3$ and the minimum is $1$).
This means we want $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 1$, which simplifies to $0 < m < 100$. The integers in this range are the positive integers $m$ that make the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have $4$ distinct solutions.

Python code to find the count:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def count_values():
    count = 0
    for m in range(1, 100):  # m is a positive integer and it must be less than 100
        if 0 < m/100 < 1:
            count += 1
    return count

result = count_values()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 99

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
99
```
The answer is $\boxed{99}$.
The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is $\boxed{99}$.
The code finds the number of positive integers from $1$ to $100$ that are between $0$ and $1$ when divided by $100$. These are exactly the values of $m$ that result in the right hand side of the equation being a fractional value that intersects the graph of the absolute value function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. Since there are $99$ such positive integers, the count is $99$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $99$. The answer is: 99.

Assistant:

Approach:


We start by analyzing the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. This equation has 4 distinct solutions, which means that the absolute value expression on the left side of the equation will take the form of $|a-b|=c$, which has 2 solutions: $a-b=c$ and $a-b=-c$.

For each "layer" of absolute value, there will be a breakpoint where the expression inside the absolute value changes sign. For $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, these breakpoints are at $x=1$ and $x=3$.

We will consider these two cases separately:

1) $x<1$: In this case, the equation becomes $\vert -(x-1) - 2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert -x+1 - 2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert -x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert x+1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$.

2) $1 \le x \le 3$: In this case, the equation becomes $\vert x-1 - 2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert x-3 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$.

3) $x>3$: In this case, the equation becomes $\vert x-1 - 2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert x-3 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$.

Now, we need to count the number of solutions for each case:

1) For the case $x<1$, the equation $\vert x+1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$ has 2 solutions for any positive $\frac{m}{100}$. So, this case gives 2 solutions.

2) For the case $1 \le x \le 3$, the equation $\vert x-3 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$ will have 2 solutions if $\frac{m}{100} \le 2$, or $m \le 200$. So, this case gives 2 solutions for $m \le 200$.

3) For the case $x>3$, the equation $\vert x-3 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$ also has 2 solutions for any positive $\frac{m}{100}$. So, this case gives 2 solutions.

Combining all the cases, we see that the total number of solutions is 4 if and only if $m \le 200$. So, we need to count the number of positive integers $m$ for which $m \le 200$. This is simply equal to 200.

Therefore, there are 200 positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. The answer is: $\boxed{200}$.

1. We need to analyze the equation $||x-1|-2| = \frac{m}{100}$ and figure out how many values of $m$ will result in the equation having four distinct solutions. 

2. The equation $||x-1|-2|$ can have a maximum of three distinct solutions. It is a composition of two absolute value functions, and each absolute value function will create a V-shape graph with the maximum number of intersection points being three. 

3. Therefore, for the equation $||x-1|-2| = \frac{m}{100}$ to have four distinct solutions, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be small enough such that it falls into the "flat" region of the graph, where the graph of $||x-1|-2|$ is horizontal.

4. The "flat" region of the graph occurs when $||x-1|-2|$ is between 0 and 1, so $\frac{m}{100}$ must be between 0 and 1. This implies $0 \leq \frac{m}{100} \leq 1$, and thus $0 \leq m \leq 100$.

5. However, we are looking for positive integers $m$, so the possible values for $m$ are $1, 2, ..., 100$. 

6. Therefore, there are 100 positive integers $m$ that will result in the equation $||x-1|-2| = \frac{m}{100}$ having four distinct solutions.

But we are asked for the number of positive integers $m$ that make the equation have exactly 4 distinct solutions. So we have to find out how many of these 100 integers will actually result in 4 distinct solutions.

7. The equation $||x-1|-2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ falls into the "flat" region of the graph where $||x-1|-2|$ is between 0 and 1.

8. The "flat" region of the graph occurs when $||x-1|-2|$ is between 0 and 1, so $0 \leq |x-1|-2 \leq 1$. 

9. Solving these inequalities gives us $2 \leq |x-1| \leq 3$, which gives us two more inequalities: $-3 \leq x-1 \leq -2$ and $2 \leq x-1 \leq 3$. 

10. Solving these inequalities, we get $-2 \leq x \leq -1$ and $3 \leq x \leq 4$. 

11. This means that $x$ must be in the interval $[-2, -1]$ or $[3, 4]$ to result in 4 distinct solutions.

12. Substituting $x = \frac{m}{100} + 1$ in these intervals, we get two inequalities: $-2 \leq \frac{m}{100} \leq -1$ and $3 \leq \frac{m}{100} \leq 4$.

13. Solving these inequalities for $m$ gives us $-200 \leq m \leq -100$ and $300 \leq m \leq 400$.

14. But $m$ must be positive, so the second inequality $300 \leq m \leq 400$ is not valid. 

15. The first inequality $-200 \leq m \leq -100$ is also not valid because it gives negative values for $m$.

16. However, we made a mistake when solving the inequalities in step 10. The correct intervals should be $-3 \leq x-1 \leq -2$ and $2 \leq x-1 \leq 3$, which give us $-2 \leq x \leq -1$ and $3 \leq x \leq 4$.

17. Substituting $x = \frac{m}{100} + 1$ in these intervals gives us two inequalities: $-2 \leq \frac{m}{100} + 1 \leq -1$ and $3 \leq \frac{m}{100} + 1 \leq 4$.

18. Solving these inequalities for $m$ gives us $-300 \leq m \leq -100$ and $200 \leq m \leq 300$.

19. But again, $m$ must be positive, so only the second inequality $200 \leq m \leq 300$ is valid. 

20. The positive integers in this interval are from 200 to 300, which are exactly the integers from 200 to 300 inclusive. 

21. To count the number of these integers, we subtract the smallest integer from the largest and add 1. So the number of positive integers $m$ that will result in the equation having four distinct solutions is $300 - 200 + 1 = 101$.

But we are asked for the number of positive integers $m$ that make the equation have exactly 4 distinct solutions. So there are actually 101 positive integers $m$ that will result in 4 distinct solutions.
The answer is: $101$

Approach:


For a fixed positive integer $m$, the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} \in (0, 2)$. This is because the absolute value function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a triangular wave with a maximum value of 2 and minimum value of 0. 

So we want to find how many integers $m$ such that $\frac{m}{100} \in (0, 2)$. This is equivalent to $0 < m < 200$. The number of such positive integers $m$ is $200 - 1 = 199$.

So the solution to the problem is $199$.

Python Script:
# Python program to find the number of positive integers m

    m = list(range(1, 200))

Approach:

 The absolute value equation $|x - 1| - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is in the interval $[1, 2)$. Thus, the problem is equivalent to finding the number of positive integers $m$ such that $1 \le \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Multiplying all sides by $100$ we obtain $100 \le m < 200$. The number of positive integers $m$ in the interval $[100, 200)$ is $100$. So, the answer is $\boxed{100}$.

This problem involves understanding the behavior of the absolute value function and finding the number of solutions to an equation. We start with the equation $|x - 1| - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$ and find that this equation has four distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is in the interval $[1, 2)$. Then we translate this condition into an interval for $m$, and count the number of positive integers in this interval. This yields our final answer. The Python code to compute this problem is as follows:

```python

def count_m():
    lower_bound = 100
