Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Approach:


The given equation is equal to zero, which means that either of the two expressions in the product must be zero. Therefore, the points that satisfy the equation are the solutions to each of the following equations:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$,
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first equation, we have:
$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
This implies that both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

The solutions to these two equations are the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, respectively.

For the second equation, we have:
$(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This implies that both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The solutions to these two equations are the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$, respectively.

The resulting convex polygon is a square with side length 10, as shown below:

The area of the square is given by the formula $s^2$, where $s$ is the side length of the square. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $10^2 = 100$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    side_length = 10
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

The area of the convex polygon is 100 square units.The answer is $\boxed{100}$.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:



The equation $ab=0$ is equivalent to $a=0$ or $b=0$. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. 

The equations $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ are all equivalent to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ respectively. 

The lines $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ are the perpendicular bisectors of the line segments joining the points $(8,0)$ and $(-8,0)$, and the points $(0,8)$ and $(0,-8)$. These lines are also the perpendicular bisectors of the line segments joining the points $(0,8)$ and $(0,-8)$, and the points $(8,0)$ and $(-8,0)$ respectively. Therefore, these lines enclose a square. The length of each side of the square is the distance between the points $(8,0)$ and $(-8,0)$, which is $16$.

Therefore, the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $\boxed{256}$.

Approach:

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. Therefore, either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.
The solutions are the union of the solutions for each term.

For the first term, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

This gives us the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

For the second term, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

This gives us the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The solutions are the union of the solutions for each term, which form a square with side length 10.

To find the area of the square, we use the formula for the area of a square which is $side^2$. Therefore, the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_square():
    side_length = 10
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = area_of_square()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 100

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
100
```
The area of the convex polygon formed by the points $\left(x, y\right)$ is $100$ square units.The answer is: $100$
