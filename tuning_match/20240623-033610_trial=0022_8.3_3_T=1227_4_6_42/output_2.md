 The equation is given as \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\]. We want to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation has 4 distinct solutions.

First, let's consider the right side of the equation $\frac{m}{100}$. Since $m$ is a positive integer, $\frac{m}{100}$ is a positive rational number.

Now let's consider the left side of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. This expression is equal to a non-negative number, and it is equal to $\frac{m}{100}$.

The expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ can take on the values of 0, 1, 2. This is because the absolute value function $\vert \cdot \vert$ makes a quantity non-negative, and the expression inside the absolute value can vary between negative and positive values.

If $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = 0$, then $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$, which gives us two solutions: $x = 3$ and $x = -1$.

If $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = 1$, then $\vert x-1 \vert = 3$ or $\vert x-1 \vert = 1$. The first equation gives us two solutions: $x = 4$ and $x = -2$. The second equation gives us two solutions: $x = 2$ and $x = 0$.

If $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = 2$, then $\vert x-1 \vert = 4$ or $\vert x-1 \vert = 0$. The first equation gives us two solutions: $x = 5$ and $x = -3$. The second equation gives us one solution: $x = 1$.

So, for the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ to have 4 distinct solutions, we must have $\frac{m}{100} = 1$. This gives us $m = 100$.

Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ such that the equation has 4 distinct solutions, and that is $m = 100$. The answer is: $1$

 First, let's understand the problem. We are given an equation with an absolute value and we are asked to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions.

The equation is $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.

We know that the absolute value of a real number is always nonnegative, so the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must also be nonnegative. This implies that $m$ is a nonnegative integer.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 0 and 2. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ takes on all values between 0 and 2 exactly once as $x$ ranges over the real numbers.

So, we want $\frac{m}{100}$ to be strictly between 0 and 2, or equivalently, $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Multiplying all sides of the inequalities by 100 gives $0 < m < 200$.

The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are exactly the integers from 1 to 199.

Therefore, there are 199 positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. The answer is: $199$

The equation is $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. The number of distinct solutions is $4$. We need to find the value of $m$.

First, we need to understand the behavior of the absolute value function. The expression $\vert x-1 \vert$ represents the distance between $x$ and $1$ on the number line. So $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ represents the distance between the distance between $x$ and $1$ and $2$.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}=1$. This is because the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, can be equal to $1$ in exactly $4$ ways:

1. When $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 1$, we get $\vert x-1 \vert = 3$, which gives us $x-1 = 3$ or $x-1 = -3$, so $x = 4$ or $x = -2$.

2. When $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -1$, we get $\vert x-1 \vert = 1$, which gives us $x-1 = 1$ or $x-1 = -1$, so $x = 2$ or $x = 0$.

So the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}=1$, which means $m=100$.

Therefore, the value of $m$ that makes the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have $4$ distinct solutions is $100$. The answer is: $100$

The problem is asking for how many positive integers $m$ the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has 4 distinct solutions.

First, let's understand the equation. The expression on the left side, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, is a modulus of a modulus function. It is always non-negative, and its value lies between 0 and 3 (inclusive). This is because $\vert x-1 \vert$ is the distance of $x$ from 1 on the number line, and $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is the distance of this distance from 2.

The right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, is a positive fraction, and we want it to be less than or equal to 3. This gives us the inequality $m \leq 300$.

Now, we need to find out how many values of $m$ will result in 4 distinct solutions to the equation. The equation will be equivalent to two systems of equations:

1. $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$ and $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert \geq 0$.
2. $-\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$ and $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert \geq 0$.

For the first system, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$ means that the distance of the distance of $x$ from 1 from 2 is $\frac{m}{100}$. This will give us 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 1$. This gives $m = 100$.

For the second system, $-\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$ means that the distance of the distance of $x$ from 1 from 2 is $-\frac{m}{100}$. This will never be true, because the left side of the equation is always non-negative.

Therefore, the only value of $m$ that results in 4 distinct solutions is $m = 100$. All positive integers less than or equal to 300 are considered, so the only value of $m$ that works is 100.

The answer is: $1$.
The answer is: $1$

 The problem asks for how many positive integers $m$ the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

First, we need to understand the behavior of the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. The function is a "hump" function that takes the value of $0$ at $x=3$ and $x=-1$, and takes the value of $2$ at $x=1$ and $x=5$.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to the height of the "hump", which is $2$. Therefore, $m = 200$.

So the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $200$.
The answer is: $1$

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. 

The inner absolute value expression $\vert x-1 \vert -2$ can take on $3$ values: $- \frac{m}{100}, 0, \frac{m}{100}$. 

Let's consider each case:

1. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = - \frac{m}{100}$, then $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two sub-cases:

   a. If $2 - \frac{m}{100} > 0$, then $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 = -(2 - \frac{m}{100})$. Solving these gives $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

   b. If $2 - \frac{m}{100} \leq 0$, then there are no solutions because the absolute value of a quantity cannot be negative.

2. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 0$, then $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$. This gives us two sub-cases:

   a. If $x-1 = 2$, then $x = 3$.

   b. If $x-1 = -2$, then $x = -1$.

3. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, then $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two sub-cases:

   a. If $2 + \frac{m}{100} > 0$, then $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 = -(2 + \frac{m}{100})$. Solving these gives $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

   b. If $2 + \frac{m}{100} \leq 0$, then there are no solutions because the absolute value of a quantity cannot be negative.

So, the four distinct solutions are $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$, $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$, $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, and $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$. For these to be distinct, we must have $\frac{m}{100} > 1$, which implies $m > 100$. The largest value of $m$ that satisfies this condition and still results in a positive integer value for $\frac{m}{100}$ is $m = 99$. So, the only value of $m$ that makes the equation have $4$ distinct solutions is $m = 99$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition is $1$. The answer is: 1
