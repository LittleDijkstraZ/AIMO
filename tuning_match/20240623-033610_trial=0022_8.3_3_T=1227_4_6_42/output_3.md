Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first list the problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge, and thens solve the problem step by step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions, and related knowledge are as follows:

1. The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied only when each of the factors is equal to zero.
2. Each factor is a product of two quadratic expressions.
3. A product of factors equals zero if any of the factors equals zero.
4. Therefore, we need to solve the equations $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
5. Solving these equations gives us the possible values for $x$ and $y$.
6. The points $(x, y)$ that satisfy these equations are the vertices of the polygon.
7. To find the area of the polygon, we can use the Shoelace Formula.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. For $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$.
2. For $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = \pm 10$.
3. For $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$.
4. For $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = \pm 8$.

Combining these results, we find the possible vertices of the polygon:

$(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, $(10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(0, -10)$.

Now we can use the Shoelace Formula to find the area of the polygon. The Shoelace Formula states that if the vertices of a polygon are $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), \ldots, (x_n, y_n)$, then the area of the polygon is given by:

$$\frac{1}{2} \left| (x_1y_2 + x_2y_3 + \cdots + x_ny_1) - (y_1x_2 + y_2x_3 + \cdots + y_nx_1) \right|.$$

Applying the Shoelace Formula to the vertices $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, $(10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(0, -10)$, we get:

$$\frac{1}{2} \left| (8 \cdot 8 + 8 \cdot (-8) + (-8) \cdot 8 + (-8) \cdot (-8) + 10 \cdot 0 + 0 \cdot 10 + (-10) \cdot 0 + 0 \cdot (-10) - (8 \cdot 8 + 8 \cdot (-8) + (-8) \cdot 8 + (-8) \cdot (-8) + 0 \cdot 10 + 10 \cdot 0 + 0 \cdot (-10) + 0 \cdot 10)) \right|$$
$$= \frac{1}{2} \left| (64 - 64 - 64 + 64 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 - (64 - 64 - 64 + 64 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0)) \right|$$
$$= \frac{1}{2} \left| (0) - (0) \right|$$
$$= 0.$$

However, this result is incorrect because the Shoelace Formula gives the area of a polygon with the vertices in a specific order. The vertices we listed are not in a specific order, so we need to reorder them in a way that the Shoelace Formula gives a non-zero result.

Let's reorder the vertices in a clockwise direction starting from $(8, 8)$: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$. Now, applying the Shoelace Formula again, we get:

$$\frac{1}{2} \left| (8 \cdot (-8) + 8 \cdot (-8) + (-8) \cdot (-8) + (-8) \cdot 8 + 10 \cdot 0 + (-10) \cdot 0 + 0 \cdot 10 + 0 \cdot (-10) - (8 \cdot 8 + 8 \cdot (-8) + (-8) \cdot 8 + (-8) \cdot (-8) + 0 \cdot (-10) + 10 \cdot 0 + (-10) \cdot 0 + 0 \cdot 10)) \right|$$
$$= \frac{1}{2} \left| (-64 - 64 + 64 - 64 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 - (64 - 64 - 64 + 64 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0)) \right|$$
$$= \frac{1}{2} \left| (-128) - (-128) \right|$$
$$= \frac{1}{2} \left| 0 \right|$$
$$= 0.$$

Again, this result is incorrect because the Shoelace Formula gives the area of a polygon with the vertices in a specific order. The vertices we listed are not in a specific order, so we need to reorder them in a way that the Shoelace Formula gives a non-zero result.

Let's reorder the vertices in a clockwise direction starting from $(8, 8)$: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(0, 10)$, $(10, 0)$, $(0, -10)$, $(-10, 0)$. Now, applying the Shoelace Formula again, we get:

$$\frac{1}{2} \left| (8 \cdot (-8) + 8 \cdot (-8) + (-8) \cdot (-8) + (-8) \cdot 8 + 0 \cdot 10 + 10 \cdot 0 +

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first list the problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge, and thens solve the problem step by step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The four lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$ form a square with side length 10. The four lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$ form a square with side length 16.

The area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points that satisfy the given equation is the area of the larger square minus the area of the smaller square. The area of a square is the side length squared, so the area of the larger square is $10^2 = 100$, and the area of the smaller square is $8^2 = 64$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $100 - 64 = 36$. The answer is: $36$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints are:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From constraint 1, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
From constraint 2, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

There are four cases to consider:

Case 1: $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$.
This gives us two sub-cases:

Case 1a: $x + y = 10$ and $x = 8$. Solving for $y$ gives $y = 2$.
Case 1b: $x + y = -10$ and $x = 8$. Solving for $y$ gives $y = -18$.

Case 2: $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
This gives us two sub-cases:

Case 2a: $x + y = 10$ and $y = 8$. Solving for $x$ gives $x = 2$.
Case 2b: $x + y = -10$ and $y = 8$. Solving for $x$ gives $x = -18$.

Case 3: $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$.
This gives us two sub-cases:

Case 3a: $x - y = 10$ and $x = 8$. Solving for $y$ gives $y = -2$.
Case 3b: $x - y = -10$ and $x = 8$. Solving for $y$ gives $y = 18$.

Case 4: $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
This gives us two sub-cases:

Case 4a: $x - y = 10$ and $y = 8$. Solving for $x$ gives $x = 18$.
Case 4b: $x - y = -10$ and $y = 8$. Solving for $x$ gives $x = -2$.

So the points that satisfy the constraints are $(8,2)$, $(8,-18)$, $(2,8)$, $(-18,8)$, $(18,8)$, $(8,18)$, $(2,-8)$, and $(-18,-8)$. These points form a rectangle with side lengths 18 and 16. The area of this rectangle is $18 \times 16 = 288$. The answer is: $288$

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge are:

1. The equation is given as $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
2. The expression is equal to zero if either of the factors is zero.
3. The absolute value function $|x|$ is equal to $x$ if $x \geq 0$ and $-x$ if $x < 0$.
4. The area of a convex polygon can be found using the shoelace formula.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

Step 1: The equation is equal to zero if either of the factors is zero. This gives us two sets of equations to solve:

Set 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) = 0$.
Set 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8) = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8) = 0$.

Step 2: Solve Set 1:
For $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. This implies $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
Similarly, for $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) = 0$, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.

Step 3: Solve Set 2:
For $(\vert x \vert - 8) = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$, which implies $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
Similarly, for $(\vert y \vert - 8) = 0$, we have $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

Step 4: Combining the solutions from Step 2 and Step 3, we find the following points satisfying the equations:
$(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

Step 5: These points form a square with side length 16. To find the area of the square, we use the formula for the area of a square, which is $side^2$. So, the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

The first term is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. This term is zero only when both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. Solving these two equations gives us $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ or $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$. The solutions to these systems are $(5,5)$ and $(0,10)$ respectively.

The second term is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. This term is zero only when both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. Solving these two equations gives us $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

So the points that satisfy the given equation are $(5,5)$, $(0,10)$, $(8,8)$, $(-8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, and $(-8,-8)$. These points form a square with side length $10$. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions, and related knowledge are as follows:
1. The equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
2. The equation is equal to 0 if and only if either of the two factors is 0.
3. The equation is equal to 0 if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
4. Each of these equations is equal to 0 if and only if the absolute value expressions are equal to their respective arguments.
5. Therefore, the solutions are given by $|x + y| = 10$, $|x - y| = 10$, $|x| = 8$, or $|y| = 8$.

Now, we solve the problem step by step:

Step 1: Solve the equations $|x + y| = 10$, $|x - y| = 10$, $|x| = 8$, and $|y| = 8$.

For $|x + y| = 10$, we have $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
For $|x - y| = 10$, we have $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
For $|x| = 8$, we have $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
For $|y| = 8$, we have $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

Step 2: Combine the solutions to find the vertices of the polygon.

By combining the solutions, we find the vertices of the polygon to be:
$(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(2, 8)$, $(-2, 8)$, $(2, -8)$, and $(-2, -8)$.

Step 3: Plot the vertices on the coordinate plane to visualize the polygon.

Plotting the vertices on the coordinate plane, we find that they form a square with side length 16.

Step 4: Calculate the area of the square.

The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side. Since the side length is 16, the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first list the problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge, and thens solve the problem step by step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge are:

1. The equation $A \cdot B = 0$ implies that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$.
2. $\vert x \vert = a$ implies $x = a$ or $x = -a$.
3. The area of a square with side length $s$ is $s^2$.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

The equation can be rewritten as:
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0 \text{ or } ((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]

From the first constraint, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
From the second constraint, either $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

From $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, we get $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
From $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, we get $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
From $\vert x \vert = 8$, we get $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
From $\vert y \vert = 8$, we get $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

Solving these equations, we find that the points satisfying the equation are:
$(8,8), (8,-8), (-8,8), (-8,-8), (8,2), (8,-10), (-8,2), (-8,-10)$.

These points form a square with side length 16. Therefore, the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first list the problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge, and thens solve the problem step by step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints are given by the equation
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$
This equation is equal to zero if and only if either of the two factors is equal to zero. Therefore, we have two sets of conditions:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first set of conditions, we have
$$\vert x + y \vert = 10 \quad \text{and} \quad \vert x - y \vert = 10.$$
This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the square as $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, and $(-10, 0)$.

For the second set of conditions, we have
$$\vert x \vert = 8 \quad \text{and} \quad \vert y \vert = 8.$$
This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the square as $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The convex polygon formed by the union of these two squares is a $8 \times 10$ rectangle. The area of this rectangle is $8 \times 10 = 80$. The answer is: $80$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints are given by the equation:
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]

This equation is equal to zero if and only if at least one of the factors is equal to zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
In this case, both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the four points: $(8,2)$, $(8,-2)$, $(-8,2)$, and $(-8,-2)$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
In this case, both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations, we get the four points: $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

Therefore, the points that satisfy the given equation are: $(8,2)$, $(8,-2)$, $(-8,2)$, $(-8,-2)$, $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$. These points form a square with side length $16$. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$
