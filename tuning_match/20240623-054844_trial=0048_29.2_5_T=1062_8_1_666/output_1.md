Approach:

 We use the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality to solve this problem. First, we rewrite the given expression as $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = \frac{1}{2}((5x-4y)^2 + (4x-5y)^2)$. Next, we solve the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ using the triangle inequality, and we find that $|x-2y| = |y-2x| = 20$. Then we substitute $x = 2y$ into the rewritten expression to find its minimum value.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solve, simplify

def find_min():
    y = symbols('y')
    expr = 5*(2*y)**2 + 5*y**2 - 8*2*y*y
    min_value = simplify(expr)
    return min_value

result = find_min()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 9*y**2

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
9*y**2
```
Since $|y-2x| = 20$, we substitute $y = 2x$ into $9y^2$, and we get $9(2x)^2 = 36x^2$. To find the minimum value of $36x^2$, we take the derivative with respect to $x$ and set it equal to zero. The derivative of $36x^2$ is $72x$, and setting this equal to zero gives $x = 0$. Therefore, the minimum value of $36x^2$ is at $x = 0$, and it is $36(0)^2 = 0$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0.
The answer is: 0

Approach:

 We start by expressing the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ in a form that makes it easier to solve. We then substitute a new variable $z=x-y$ to simplify the problem further. After that, we use the method of completing the square to find the minimum value of the given expression.

Step 1: Rewrite the given equation
The given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten by noticing that $|x-2y| = |-(y-2x)|$:
\[|x-2y| + |x-2y| = 40.\]
This simplifies to $2|x-2y| = 40$, so $|x-2y| = 20$.

Step 2: Substitute a new variable $z=x-y$
Now we substitute $z=x-y$, then $y=x-z$ and substitute this into the equation $|x-2(x-z)| = 20$:
\[|x-2x+2z| = 20 \implies |-x+2z| = 20.\]
We can rewrite this as $|2z-x| = 20$.

Step 3: Solve for $z$
Now we have two cases to consider:
Case 1: $2z-x = 20$. Solving for $x$ gives $x = 2z-20$.
Case 2: $2z-x = -20$. Solving for $x$ gives $x = 2z+20$.

Step 4: Express the given expression in terms of $z$
The given expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ can be rewritten in terms of $z$:
\[5(x^2+y^2)-8xy = 5[(x-y)^2 + 2xy] - 8xy = 5[(x-y)^2] + 2xy = 5z^2 + 2(x-z)z = 5z^2 + 2xz - 2z^2 = 3z^2 + 2xz.\]

Step 5: Substitute the expression for $x$ from Step 3 into the expression from Step 4
For Case 1, we substitute $x = 2z-20$:
\[3z^2 + 2(2z-20)z = 3z^2 + 4z^2 - 40z = 7z^2 - 40z.\]
For Case 2, we substitute $x = 2z+20$:
\[3z^2 + 2(2z+20)z = 3z^2 + 4z^2 + 40z = 7z^2 + 40z.\]

Step 6: Complete the square
We complete the square for both expressions found in Step 5:
For Case 1, $7z^2 - 40z = 7(z^2 - \frac{40}{7}z) = 7\left[(z - \frac{20}{7})^2 - \left(\frac{20}{7}\right)^2\right] = 7\left(z - \frac{20}{7}\right)^2 - 400$.
For Case 2, $7z^2 + 40z = 7(z^2 + \frac{40}{7}z) = 7\left[(z + \frac{20}{7})^2 - \left(\frac{20}{7}\right)^2\right] = 7\left(z + \frac{20}{7}\right)^2 - 400$.

Step 7: Find the minimum value
The minimum value of the expressions found in Step 6 occurs when $z = \frac{20}{7}$. We substitute this value into the expressions found in Step 6 to find the minimum value of the given expression for both cases:
For Case 1, the minimum value is $7\left(\frac{20}{7} - \frac{20}{7}\right)^2 - 400 = -400$.
For Case 2, the minimum value is $7\left(-\frac{20}{7} + \frac{20}{7}\right)^2 - 400 = -400$.

Since both cases give the same minimum value, we can conclude that the minimum value of the given expression under the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $-400$. The answer is: $-400$

Approach:



This is a problem that involves finding the minimum value of a function under a constraint. We can use the method of Lagrange multipliers to solve this problem. Let's define the function to minimize as $f(x, y) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ and the constraint as $g(x, y) = |x - 2y| + |y - 2x| - 40$. We will look for the points where the gradient of $f$ and $g$ are parallel.

The gradient of $f$ is given by $\nabla f(x, y) = \begin{pmatrix} 10x - 8y \\ 10y - 8x \end{pmatrix}$ and the gradient of $g$ is given by $\nabla g(x, y)$ which is more complicated to compute. However, we can use the definition of absolute value to find the expression for $g$:

\[g(x, y) = \begin{cases} (x - 2y) + (y - 2x) - 40 = -3x - y - 40 & \text{if } x \ge 2y \text{ and } y \ge 2x \\ (2y - x) + (y - 2x) - 40 = -2x + 3y - 40 & \text{if } x < 2y \text{ and } y \ge 2x \\ (x - 2y) + (2x - y) - 40 = 3x - 3y - 40 & \text{if } x \ge 2y \text{ and } y < 2x \\ (2y - x) + (2x - y) - 40 = y - 40 & \text{if } x < 2y \text{ and } y < 2x \end{cases}\]
Computing the gradient of $g$ for each case is tedious but possible. Then we can set $\nabla f(x, y) = \lambda \nabla g(x, y)$ for some scalar $\lambda$ and solve the system of equations. This will give us the possible points where the minimum may occur. Finally, we can evaluate $f(x, y)$ at these points and find the minimum value.

However, this approach can be quite involved. A simpler approach is to observe that the function $f(x, y)$ is a quadratic form, and its value is determined by the matrix of coefficients:

\[A = \begin{pmatrix} 5 & -4 \\ -4 & 5 \end{pmatrix}\]
The eigenvalues of this matrix are $\lambda_1 = 9$ and $\lambda_2 = 1$, and their corresponding eigenvectors are $\mathbf{v}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$ and $\mathbf{v}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}$, respectively. Therefore, the function $f(x, y)$ can be written in the coordinate system of the eigenvectors as:

\[f(\alpha, \beta) = 9\alpha^2 + \beta^2\]
where $(x, y) = \alpha\mathbf{v}_1 + \beta\mathbf{v}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} 2\alpha + \beta \\ \alpha - 2\beta \end{pmatrix}$. The constraint equation can also be written in this coordinate system:

\[|2\alpha + \beta - 2(\alpha - 2\beta)| + |\alpha - 2\beta - 2(2\alpha + \beta)| = 40\]
which simplifies to $|\alpha| + |3\beta| = 20$. This constraint is satisfied by all points $(\alpha, \beta)$ on the lines $\alpha = 20$ and $\beta = \pm \frac{20}{3}$. The minimum value of $9\alpha^2 + \beta^2$ on this set of points is clearly achieved at the point $(\alpha, \beta) = (20, -\frac{20}{3})$, where $f(20, -\frac{20}{3}) = 9 \cdot 20^2 + \left(-\frac{20}{3}\right)^2 = 3600 + \frac{400}{9} = \frac{32600}{9}$.

Therefore, the minimum value of the function $f(x, y) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ subject to the constraint $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$ is $\frac{32600}{9}$.
The answer is: $\boxed{\frac{32600}{9}}$

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"

Approach:


To solve this problem, we need to first find the relationship between $x$ and $y$ from the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
We can rewrite the constraint as $|x-2y| = 40 - |y-2x|$.
Now, we consider two cases:
Case 1: $x - 2y \geq 0$ and $y - 2x \geq 0$. In this case, we have $x - 2y = 40 - (2x - y)$, which simplifies to $3x - 3y = 40 \Rightarrow x - y = \frac{40}{3}$.
Case 2: $x - 2y < 0$ and $y - 2x < 0$. In this case, we have $-(x - 2y) = 40 - -(y - 2x)$, which also simplifies to $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$.
In both cases, we find the same relationship $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$.
Now, we substitute $y = x - \frac{40}{3}$ into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$, and we get:
$$5x^2 + 5\left(x - \frac{40}{3}\right)^2 - 8x\left(x - \frac{40}{3}\right)$$
Simplify it, we get:
$$5x^2 + 5\left(x^2 - \frac{80}{3}x + \frac{1600}{9}\right) - 8x^2 + \frac{320}{3}x$$
$$= 5x^2 + 5x^2 - \frac{400}{3}x + \frac{8000}{9} - 8x^2 + \frac{320}{3}x$$
$$= -3x^2 + \frac{160}{3}x + \frac{8000}{9}$$
This is a quadratic function with a negative leading coefficient, so its minimum value occurs at the vertex. The x-coordinate of the vertex of a quadratic function $ax^2 + bx + c$ is given by $-\frac{b}{2a}$. So, the x-coordinate of the vertex of our function is $-\frac{\frac{160}{3}}{2(-3)} = \frac{80}{9}$.
Substitute $x = \frac{80}{9}$ into the equation $y = x - \frac{40}{3}$, we get $y = \frac{80}{9} - \frac{40}{3} = -\frac{40}{9}$.
So, the point $(\frac{80}{9}, -\frac{40}{9})$ is the point that minimizes the value of the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ under the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
Now, we substitute $x = \frac{80}{9}$ and $y = -\frac{40}{9}$ into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$:
$$5\left(\frac{80}{9}\right)^2 + 5\left(-\frac{40}{9}\right)^2 - 8\left(\frac{80}{9}\right)\left(-\frac{40}{9}\right)$$
$$= 5\cdot \frac{6400}{81} + 5\cdot \frac{1600}{81} + \frac{3200}{9}$$
$$= \frac{32000}{81} + \frac{8000}{81} + \frac{3200}{9}$$
$$= \frac{40000}{81} + \frac{24000}{81}$$
$$= \frac{64000}{81}$$
So, the minimum value of the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ under the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $\frac{64000}{81}$.
The answer is: $\frac{64000}{81}$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"

Approach:


To solve this problem, we first notice that the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is always true for any real numbers $x$ and $y$. Therefore, it doesn't impose any constraint on the values of $x$ and $y$. Thus, we only need to find the minimum value of the function $f(x, y) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ over all real numbers $x$ and $y$.

The function $f(x, y)$ can be rewritten as $f(x, y) = 5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x - y)^2 + 2xy] - 8xy = 5(x - y)^2 + 3xy$.

To minimize $f(x, y)$, we need to minimize both $(x - y)^2$ and $xy$. Since $(x - y)^2 \geq 0$ and $xy \geq -\frac{(x+y)^2}{4}$, we have $f(x, y) \geq -\frac{5}{4}(x+y)^2$. Thus, the minimum value of $f(x, y)$ is achieved when $(x - y)^2 = 0$ and $xy = 0$, which means $x = y$.

Substitute $y = x$ into $f(x, y)$, we have $f(x, x) = 5x^2 - 8x^2 + 5x^2 = 2x^2$. This function is always nonnegative and its minimum value is 0, which is achieved when $x = 0$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is 0 when $x = y = 0$.

However, this solution doesn't satisfy the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. Therefore, we need to find another solution.

We know that $f(x, y) = 5(x - y)^2 + 3xy$. If we let $x = -y$, then $f(x, -x) = 5(2x)^2 - 3x^2 = 17x^2$. The minimum value of this function is also 0, which is achieved when $x = 0$. But this solution also doesn't satisfy the given equation.

To find another solution, we can consider the cases when $x = 2y$ and $y = 2x$ separately.

If $x = 2y$, then $f(x, \frac{x}{2}) = 5x^2 + \frac{5x^2}{4} - 4x^2 = \frac{15x^2}{4}$. The minimum value of this function is 0, which is achieved when $x = 0$. But this solution also doesn't satisfy the given equation.

If $y = 2x$, then $f(x, 2x) = 5x^2 + 20x^2 - 16x^2 = 19x^2$. The minimum value of this function is 0, which is achieved when $x = 0$. But this solution also doesn't satisfy the given equation.

However, we notice that the function $f(x, y)$ has a symmetry property: $f(x, y) = f(y, x)$. Therefore, we can consider the cases when $x = 2y$ and $y = \frac{x}{2}$ separately.

If $x = 2y$, then $f(x, \frac{x}{2}) = 5x^2 + \frac{5x^2}{4} - 4x^2 = \frac{15x^2}{4}$. The minimum value of this function is 0, which is achieved when $x = 0$. But this solution also doesn't satisfy the given equation.

If $y = \frac{x}{2}$, then $f(x, \frac{x}{2}) = 5x^2 + \frac{5x^2}{4} - 4x^2 = \frac{15x^2}{4}$. The minimum value of this function is 0, which is achieved when $x = 0$. But this solution also doesn't satisfy the given equation.

We notice that the function $f(x, y)$ has a symmetry property: $f(x, y) = f(-x, -y)$. Therefore, we can consider the cases when $x = -2y$ and $y = -\frac{x}{2}$ separately.

If $x = -2y$, then $f(x, -\frac{x}{2}) = 5x^2 + \frac{5x^2}{4} - 4x^2 = \frac{15x^2}{4}$. The minimum value of this function is 0, which is achieved when $x = 0$. But this solution also doesn't satisfy the given equation.

If $y = -\frac{x}{2}$, then $f(x, -\frac{x}{2}) = 5x^2 + \frac{5x^2}{4} - 4x^2 = \frac{15x^2}{4}$. The minimum value of this function is 0, which is achieved when $x = 0$. But this solution also doesn't satisfy the given equation.

However, we notice that the function $f(x, y)$ has a symmetry property: $f(x, y) = f(-y, -x)$. Therefore, we can consider the cases when $x = -2y$ and $y = -2x$ separately.

If $x = -2y$, then $f(x, -\frac{x}{2}) = 5x^2 + \frac{5x^2}{4} - 4x^2 = \frac{15x^2}{4}$. The minimum value of this function is 0, which is achieved when $x = 0$. But this solution also doesn't satisfy the given equation.

If $y = -2x$, then $f(x, -2x) = 5x^2 + 20x^2 - 16x^2 = 19x^2$. The minimum value of this function is 0, which is achieved when $x = 0$. But this solution also doesn't satisfy the given equation.

We notice that the function $f(x, y)$ has a symmetry property: $f(x, y) = f(-y, x)$. Therefore, we can consider the cases when $x = -2y$ and $y = 2x$ separately.

Assistant:

Approach:

 We will first express the given condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ in terms of $X = x - 2y$ and $Y = y - 2x$. Then we can use the fact that $|X| + |Y| = 40$ to find the relationship between $x$ and $y$. Next, we substitute this relationship into the function $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ and find its minimum value.

1. Let's express $|x-2y|$ and $|y-2x|$ in terms of $X$ and $Y$:
   - $|x-2y| = |X| = |-X|$
   - $|y-2x| = |Y| = |-Y|$

2. Thus, $|X| + |Y| = 40$ implies that $|X| + |-Y| = 40$ or $|Y| + |-X| = 40$.

3. From this, we deduce that $X$ and $Y$ have the same absolute value, which implies that either $X = Y$ or $X = -Y$.

4. If $X = Y$, then $x - 2y = y - 2x$, which simplifies to $3x = 3y$, or $x = y$.

5. If $X = -Y$, then $x - 2y = -(y - 2x)$, which simplifies to $x - 2y = -y + 2x$, or $x = -2y$.

6. Now we substitute $x = y$ into the equation $|X| + |Y| = 40$: $|x - 2x| + |x - 2x| = 40$, which simplifies to $| -x| + | -x| = 40$ or $2|x| = 40$, so $|x| = 20$, and thus $x = \pm 20$.

7. Similarly, we substitute $x = -2y$ into the equation $|X| + |Y| = 40$: $| -2y - 2(-2y)| + |-2y - 2(-2y)| = 40$, which simplifies to $| -2y + 4y| + | -2y + 4y| = 40$ or $2|2y| = 40$, so $|2y| = 20$, and thus $2y = \pm 20$, so $y = \pm 10$.

8. So the solutions are $(x, y) = (20, 20)$ and $(x, y) = (-20, -10)$ and their symmetric counterparts with $x$ and $y$ swapped.

9. Now we substitute these values into the function $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
   - For $(x, y) = (20, 20)$: $5(20)^2 + 5(20)^2 - 8(20)(20) = 2000$.
   - For $(x, y) = (-20, -10)$: $5(-20)^2 + 5(-10)^2 - 8(-20)(-10) = 2000$.

10. The minimum value of the function is $2000$. The answer is: $2000$

Approach:


To minimize the value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ subject to the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. This method allows us to convert a constrained minimization problem into an unconstrained one by introducing a new variable, called the Lagrange multiplier, and forming a new function (called the Lagrangian) that combines the original function to be minimized with the constraint.

Let's define the Lagrangian function $L(x, y, \lambda) = 5x^2+5y^2-8xy + \lambda (|x-2y| + |y-2x| - 40)$.

We need to find the critical points of $L(x, y, \lambda)$, which are the solutions of the following system of equations:

1. $\frac{\partial L}{\partial x} = 10x - 8y + \lambda(-1 + 2 \cdot \text{sgn}(x - 2y)) = 0$
2. $\frac{\partial L}{\partial y} = 10y - 8x + \lambda(1 - 2 \cdot \text{sgn}(y - 2x)) = 0$
3. $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$

Solving this system of equations is quite challenging. However, we can simplify the problem by noting that the constraint $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$ implies that $x$ and $y$ must be integers. This is because the absolute value function $|.|$, when applied to a real number, gives the distance of that number from zero on the number line. So when we have a sum of absolute value functions, each term represents the distance between two numbers. For this sum to be a fixed value, the numbers must be integers.

By trying out integer values of $x$ and $y$ that satisfy the constraint, we find that the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ occurs at $(x, y) = (10, 0)$ or $(x, y) = (0, 10)$. Substituting these values into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we find that the minimum value is $-450$ when $(x, y) = (10, 0)$ or $(x, y) = (0, 10)$. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ subject to the given constraint is $-450$.

The value of the minimum of the function $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ subject to the constraint $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$ is $-450$. The answer is: $-450$.

Approach:

 We start by noting that the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is always true because $|a-b|=|b-a|$. So, we don't need to worry about this equation.

We want to find the minimum of $f(x, y) = 5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. To find the minimum of this function, we can complete the square for $x$ and $y$.

First, we rewrite the function as $f(x, y) = 5(x^2 - \frac{8}{5}xy) + 5(y^2)$. Then, we add and subtract $(\frac{4}{5}y)^2$ inside the first parenthesis and add and subtract $(\frac{4}{5}x)^2$ inside the second parenthesis. We get
$$f(x, y) = 5[(x^2 - \frac{8}{5}xy + (\frac{4}{5}y)^2) - (\frac{4}{5}y)^2] + 5[(y^2 + (\frac{4}{5}x)^2 - (\frac{4}{5}x)^2)]$$
$$= 5[(x - \frac{4}{5}y)^2 - (\frac{4}{5}y)^2] + 5[(y + \frac{4}{5}x)^2 - (\frac{4}{5}x)^2].$$
This simplifies to
$$f(x, y) = 5(x - \frac{4}{5}y)^2 - 5(\frac{4}{5}y)^2 + 5(y + \frac{4}{5}x)^2 - 5(\frac{4}{5}x)^2.$$
Further simplification gives
$$f(x, y) = 5(x - \frac{4}{5}y)^2 + 5(y + \frac{4}{5}x)^2 - \frac{32}{5}xy.$$
Since $(x - \frac{4}{5}y)^2$ and $(y + \frac{4}{5}x)^2$ are always non-negative, the minimum value of $f(x, y)$ is achieved when both $(x - \frac{4}{5}y)^2$ and $(y + \frac{4}{5}x)^2$ are zero. This happens when $x = \frac{4}{5}y$ and $y = -\frac{4}{5}x$.
Substituting these values into the function $f(x, y)$, we get
$$f(x, y) = 5(x - \frac{4}{5}y)^2 + 5(y + \frac{4}{5}x)^2 - \frac{32}{5}xy$$
$$= 5(x - \frac{4}{5}(\frac{4}{5}x))^2 + 5(-\frac{4}{5}x + \frac{4}{5}x)^2 - \frac{32}{5}x(\frac{4}{5}x)$$
$$= 5(0)^2 + 5(0)^2 - \frac{32}{5}x(\frac{4}{5}x)$$
$$= - \frac{32}{5}x(\frac{4}{5}x)$$
$$= - \frac{128}{25}x^2.$$
Since $x^2$ is always non-negative, the minimum value of $f(x, y)$ is $-\frac{128}{25}$. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $-\frac{128}{25}$. The answer is: $\boxed{-\frac{128}{25}}$

Approach:

 This problem is an optimization problem with a constraint. To solve it, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. First, let's define the function $f(x, y) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ and the constraint function $g(x, y) = |x - 2y| + |y - 2x| - 40$. The method of Lagrange multipliers states that the minimum of $f(x, y)$ subject to the constraint $g(x, y) = 0$ occurs at points where the gradient of $f(x, y)$ is a scalar multiple of the gradient of $g(x, y)$. In other words, the gradients are parallel.

Step 1: Calculate the gradients of $f(x, y)$ and $g(x, y)$.

$\nabla f(x, y) = \left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\right) = (10x - 8y, 10y - 8x)$

$\nabla g(x, y) = \left(\frac{\partial g}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial g}{\partial y}\right)$

For $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$, the gradient of $g(x, y)$ is complicated to compute directly. However, we know that $g(x, y) = 0$, so we can use the constraint to simplify the calculation.

If $x \geq 2y$, then $|x - 2y| = x - 2y$ and $|y - 2x| = -y + 2x$, so the constraint equation becomes $x - 2y - y + 2x = 40$, which simplifies to $3x - 3y = 40$ or $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$. Similarly, if $x < 2y$, then the constraint equation becomes $-x + 2y + y - 2x = 40$, which simplifies to $-3x + 3y = 40$ or $y - x = \frac{40}{3}$.

Step 2: Check the gradients at the points where the constraint holds.

For $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$, the gradient of $g(x, y)$ is $\left(1, -1\right)$. At these points, $\nabla f(x, y) = (10x - 8y, 10y - 8x) = k(1, -1)$, where $k$ is a scalar. Solving this equation gives $10x - 8y = k$ and $10y - 8x = -k$. Adding these two equations gives $2x = 0$, so $x = 0$. Substituting $x = 0$ into the constraint equation $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$ gives $y = -\frac{40}{3}$. Substituting these values into $f(x, y)$ gives $f(0, -\frac{40}{3}) = 5(0)^2 + 5\left(-\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 - 8(0)\left(-\frac{40}{3}\right) = \frac{6400}{9}$.

For $y - x = \frac{40}{3}$, the gradient of $g(x, y)$ is $\left(-1, 1\right)$. At these points, $\nabla f(x, y) = (10x - 8y, 10y - 8x) = k(-1, 1)$, where $k$ is a scalar. Solving this equation gives $10x - 8y = -k$ and $10y - 8x = k$. Adding these two equations gives $2y = 0$, so $y = 0$. Substituting $y = 0$ into the constraint equation $y - x = \frac{40}{3}$ gives $x = -\frac{40}{3}$. Substituting these values into $f(x, y)$ gives $f(-\frac{40}{3}, 0) = 5\left(-\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 + 5(0)^2 - 8\left(-\frac{40}{3}\right)(0) = \frac{6400}{9}$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $f(x, y)$ subject to the constraint $g(x, y) = 0$ is $\frac{6400}{9}$. The answer is: $\frac{6400}{9}$

Approach:


This problem involves finding the minimum value of a quadratic expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ subject to the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. 

First, we can simplify the constraint equation. The absolute value function can be expressed as a piecewise function:

$|a-b| = \begin{cases} a-b, & \text{if } a \geq b \\ -(a-b), & \text{if } a < b \end{cases}$

So, the constraint equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as:

$(x-2y) + (2x-y) = 40$ if $x \geq 2y$ and $y \geq 2x$

$-(x-2y) - (2x-y) = 40$ if $x < 2y$ or $y < 2x$

The first equation simplifies to $3x - 3y = 40 \implies x - y = \frac{40}{3}$.
The second equation simplifies to $-3x + 3y = 40 \implies x - y = -\frac{40}{3}$, which is not possible since $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$.
So, the constraint equation simplifies to $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$.

Now, we can substitute $y = x - \frac{40}{3}$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:

$5x^2+5\left(x - \frac{40}{3}\right)^2 - 8x\left(x - \frac{40}{3}\right)$

$= 5x^2 + 5\left(x^2 - \frac{80x}{3} + \frac{1600}{9}\right) - 8x^2 + \frac{320x}{3}$

$= 5x^2 + 5x^2 - \frac{400x}{3} + \frac{8000}{9} - 8x^2 + \frac{320x}{3}$

$= -3x^2 + \frac{120x}{3} + \frac{8000}{9}$

$= -3x^2 + 40x + \frac{8000}{9}$

Now, we can find the minimum value of this quadratic expression. The minimum value occurs at $x = -\frac{b}{2a}$, where $a$ and $b$ are the coefficients of the quadratic expression. In this case, $a = -3$ and $b = 40$, so the $x$-value that minimizes the expression is:

$x = -\frac{40}{2(-3)} = \frac{20}{3}$.

Substituting this back into $y = x - \frac{40}{3}$, we get:

$y = \frac{20}{3} - \frac{40}{3} = -\frac{20}{3}$.

Now, we can find the minimum value of the expression by substituting these values of $x$ and $y$:

$-3\left(\frac{20}{3}\right)^2 + 40\left(\frac{20}{3}\right) + \frac{8000}{9} = -\frac{1200}{9} + \frac{800}{3} + \frac{8000}{9} = \frac{-1200 + 2400 + 8000}{9} = \frac{7200}{9} = 800$.

So, the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ subject to the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 800. The answer is: $800$

Approach:


The given expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ can be written as $(5x^2 - 8xy + 5y^2)$, which is a perfect square. We can complete the square to simplify the expression. 

The given condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|2y - x| + |2x - y| = 40$. This condition gives us information about the relationship between $x$ and $y$, but it is not straightforward to solve for a specific relationship or value of $x$ or $y$.

However, by using the inequality $|a| + |b| \geq |a + b|$, we can see that the condition is always true for any real numbers $x$ and $y$.

So we only need to minimize $(5x^2 - 8xy + 5y^2)$ under the condition that $x$ and $y$ are real numbers.

We know that $(a - b)^2 \geq 0$, so $a^2 - 2ab + b^2 \geq 0$, which can be rearranged to $a^2 + b^2 \geq 2ab$.

Applying this to our expression, we have:

$(5x^2 - 8xy + 5y^2) = 5(x^2 - \frac{8}{5}xy + y^2) = 5[(x - \frac{4}{5}y)^2 + \frac{9}{25}y^2] \geq 0$.

The minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0.

Now, let's check if this value can be achieved given the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.

If we choose $x = \frac{4}{5}y$, the condition becomes $|y| + |y| = 40$, which gives $y = \pm 20$.

For $y = 20$, $x = \frac{4}{5} \cdot 20 = 16$.
For $y = -20$, $x = \frac{4}{5} \cdot -20 = -16$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0, and this value can be achieved under the given condition.
The answer is: $\boxed{0}$

Approach:


This problem is an optimization problem with a constraint. To solve this problem, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. First, we will find the gradient of the function $f(x, y) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ and the gradient of the constraint function $g(x, y) = |x-2y| + |y-2x|$. Then, we will set up the equation $\nabla f = \lambda \nabla g$, where $\lambda$ is the Lagrange multiplier. Finally, we will solve this equation for $x$ and $y$ and find the minimum value of $f(x, y)$.

Solution:

The gradient of $f(x, y)$ is $\nabla f = \begin{bmatrix} 10x - 8y \\ 10y - 8x \end{bmatrix}$.

The gradient of $g(x, y)$ is more complicated to compute. However, since $|a| + |b|$ is minimized when $a$ and $b$ have the same sign, we can deduce that $x - 2y$ and $y - 2x$ must have the same sign. This gives us two cases to consider:

1. If $x - 2y \geq 0$ and $y - 2x \geq 0$, then $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = (x - 2y) + (y - 2x) = -x - y = - (x + y)$. So, $x + y = -40$.

2. If $x - 2y < 0$ and $y - 2x < 0$, then $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = -(x - 2y) - (y - 2x) = x + y = 40$.

However, since $x - 2y \geq 0$ and $y - 2x \geq 0$ implies $x + y \leq 0$, which contradicts with $x + y = 40$, we must have $x - 2y < 0$ and $y - 2x < 0$. So, $x + y = 40$.

Now, we set up the equation $\nabla f = \lambda \nabla g$. This gives us the system of equations:

$$10x - 8y = -\lambda, \\ 10y - 8x = -\lambda, \\ x + y = 40.$$

Solving this system, we find $x = 20$ and $y = 20$. Substituting these values into the function $f(x, y)$, we get $f(20, 20) = 5(20)^2 + 5(20)^2 - 8(20)(20) = 2000$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is $2000$. The answer is: $2000$
