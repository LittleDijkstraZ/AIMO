Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:

 The equation is of the form $(A)(B) = 0$, which implies that either $A=0$ or $B=0$. This means that the given equation is satisfied if either $(|x+y| - 10)^2 + (|x-y| - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(|x| - 8)^2 + (|y| - 8)^2 = 0$. 

For the first case, $(|x+y| - 10)^2 + (|x-y| - 10)^2 = 0$, this implies that $|x+y| = 10$ and $|x-y| = 10$. This forms a square with side length 20, and its area is $20^2 = 400$.

For the second case, $(|x| - 8)^2 + (|y| - 8)^2 = 0$, this implies that $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. This forms a square with side length 16, and its area is $16^2 = 256$.

However, the second case does not contribute to the area of the convex polygon formed by the points satisfying the original equation. This is because the condition $(|x| - 8)^2 + (|y| - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$, which are outside the square formed by the points satisfying $(|x+y| - 10)^2 + (|x-y| - 10)^2 = 0$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of the square formed by the points satisfying $(|x+y| - 10)^2 + (|x-y| - 10)^2 = 0$, which is 400.
The answer is: $400$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:



First, let's analyze the given equation:

$((|x + y| - 10)^2 + (|x - y| - 10)^2)(( |x| - 8)^2 + ( |y| - 8)^2) = 0$

This equation is equal to zero if either of the following conditions hold:

1. $(|x + y| - 10)^2 + (|x - y| - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $( |x| - 8)^2 + ( |y| - 8)^2 = 0$

From condition 1, we have:

$|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$

The solutions to these equations are lines parallel to the x-axis and y-axis, respectively.

From condition 2, we have:

$|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$

The solutions to these equations are two vertical lines and two horizontal lines.

These lines enclose a rectangle with sides of length 16 and 20. The area of this rectangle is 16 * 20 = 320 square units.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 320 square units.

The answer is: $320$

Assistant:

Approach:


The expression is equal to zero when either of the factors is zero. So we have two sets of equations:

1. $|x+y| - 10 = 0 \Rightarrow |x+y| = 10 \Rightarrow x+y = 10 \text{ or } x+y = -10$.
2. $|x|-8 = 0 \Rightarrow |x| = 8 \Rightarrow x = 8 \text{ or } x = -8$.
3. $|y|-8 = 0 \Rightarrow |y| = 8 \Rightarrow y = 8 \text{ or } y = -8$.

The points that satisfy these equations form a square with vertices at (8,8), (8,-8), (-8,8), and (-8,-8). The side length of the square is 16, so the area is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: 256

Approach:

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero or both are zero. We can analyze each case separately.

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. This represents a square with side length 20 units and diagonals of length $20\sqrt{2}$.

Case 2: $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This also represents a square with side length 20 units and diagonals of length $20\sqrt{2}$.

Case 3: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x \vert = 8$. This represents a square with side length 16 units and diagonals of length $16\sqrt{2}$.

Case 4: $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert y \vert = 8$. This also represents a square with side length 16 units and diagonals of length $16\sqrt{2}$.

The intersection of the four squares is a square with side length 8 units and diagonals of length $8\sqrt{2}$.

The area of a square is given by the square of its side length. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $(8)^2 = 64$ square units. The answer is: $64$.

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:



To find the area of the polygon, we need to find the vertices of the polygon first. The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ will be zero if either of the two terms in the product is zero. Thus, we have the following four cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
3. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
4. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.

Now, let's solve each case to find the vertices of the polygon:

1. For the first case, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$. Similarly, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $x = 8$ and $y = 8$. So, the vertices of the polygon in this case are $(10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, $(-10, 0)$, and $(0, -10)$.

2. For the second case, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$, and $x = 8$ or $y = 8$. The vertices of the polygon in this case are the same as in the first case.

3. Similarly, for the third case, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$, and $y = 8$ or $x = 8$. The vertices of the polygon in this case are the same as in the first case.

4. For the last case, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$, and $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$. The solutions to this system are $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, and $(0, -10)$. The vertices of the polygon in this case are the same as in the first case.

Thus, all the vertices of the polygon are $(10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, $(-10, 0)$, and $(0, -10)$. These points form a square with side length 10. The area of the square is $10^2 = 100$. So, the area of the convex polygon is 100.

The answer is: $100$

Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:

 The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. This gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(10,0)$, $(-10,0)$, $(0,10)$, and $(0,-10)$.

Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with vertices at $(8,8)$, $(-8,8)$, $(-8,-8)$, and $(8,-8)$.

The intersection of the two figures is the convex polygon formed by the vertices of the rectangle and the square. The area of this convex polygon is equal to the area of the rectangle, which can be calculated as the product of the length and width. The length of the rectangle is $20$ (difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates) and the width is $20$ (difference between the maximum and minimum y-coordinates). Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $20 \times 20 = 400$.
The answer is: $400$

Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:

 The equation given in the problem is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. This gives us two systems of equations to solve.

Step 1: Solve the equations $|x+y| = 10$ and $|x-y| = 10$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x+y = 10$, $x+y = -10$, $x-y = 10$, and $x-y = -10$. These lines form the sides of a square.

Step 2: Solve the equations $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines also form the sides of a square.

Step 3: The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for. This polygon is a square with side length 10 (the distance between the lines $x+y = 10$ and $x+y = -10$, or the distance between the lines $x-y = 10$ and $x-y = -10$).

Step 4: To find the area of this square, we simply square the length of one of its sides. The area is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $\boxed{100}$.

Approach:

 The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if either of the two factors are zero. This gives us two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$

For the first case, either $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$, which form a rectangle.

For the second case, either $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length $16$.

The convex polygon is the intersection of the rectangle and the square, which is also a square with side length $10$. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

Approach:



The equation given in the problem is a product of two terms equal to zero. Therefore, for this equation to be true, either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. This gives us two sets of conditions to consider.

For the first term to be zero, we have:
$$\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad \vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0.$$
From these equations, we have:
$$\vert x + y \vert = 10 \quad \text{and} \quad \vert x - y \vert = 10.$$
For the second term to be zero, we have:
$$\vert x \vert - 8 = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad \vert y \vert - 8 = 0.$$
From these equations, we have:
$$\vert x \vert = 8 \quad \text{and} \quad \vert y \vert = 8.$$
This implies that the points $(x, y)$ must satisfy either of the two sets of conditions:
1. $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.
2. $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
The first set of conditions describes a square with side length $10$, and the second set describes a square with side length $8$.
The area of the convex polygon formed by the union of these two squares is the sum of their areas.

The area of the first square is $10^2 = 100$, and the area of the second square is $8^2 = 64$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $100 + 64 = 164$.

The answer is: $164$.

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only way both can be true is if $x = 0$ and $y = 0$.
Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $-8 \le x \le 8$ and $-8 \le y \le 8$.
Putting these together, we see that the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy both equations are the points in the square with corners at $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$. The area of this square is $16 \times 16 = 256$.

The Python code to calculate the area of the square is:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_square():
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

The given equation is of the form $AB=0$ which implies either $A=0$ or $B=0$. Therefore, either of the terms in the left-hand side of the equation should be equal to zero. This gives us two equations:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ which simplifies to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $x + y = \pm 10$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ which simplifies to $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ or $x - y = \pm 10$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ which simplifies to $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $x = \pm 8$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ which simplifies to $\vert y \vert = 8$ or $y = \pm 8$.

The solutions to these equations represent the vertices of the polygon. We can plot these vertices on a coordinate plane and determine the shape of the polygon. It is a square with side length 16 (from $-8$ to $8$ in both the $x$ and $y$ directions).

To find the area of the square, we can use the formula $Area = side^2$, so $Area = 16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$
