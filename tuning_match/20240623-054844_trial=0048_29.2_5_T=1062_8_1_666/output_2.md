Approach:


To solve this problem, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly four distinct solutions.

Step 1: Rewrite the equation as a piecewise function.
We can rewrite the equation as a piecewise function as follows:
$$\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$$
$$\Rightarrow \begin{cases} \vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100} \quad \text{if } \vert x-1 \vert -2 \ge 0 \\ -\vert x-1 \vert +2 = \frac{m}{100} \quad \text{if } \vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0 \end{cases}$$

Step 2: Solve the piecewise equations.
For the first equation, we have:
$$\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$$
$$\Rightarrow \vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100} + 2$$
This equation has two cases:
$$x-1 = \frac{m}{100} + 2 \quad \text{or} \quad x-1 = -\frac{m}{100} - 2$$
Solving these gives:
$$x = \frac{m}{100} + 3 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -\frac{m}{100} + 1$$

For the second equation, we have:
$$-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = \frac{m}{100}$$
$$\Rightarrow -\vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100} - 2$$
$$\Rightarrow \vert x-1 \vert = - \frac{m}{100} + 2$$
This equation has two cases:
$$x-1 = -\frac{m}{100} + 2 \quad \text{or} \quad x-1 = \frac{m}{100} - 2$$
Solving these gives:
$$x = -\frac{m}{100} + 3 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{m}{100} - 1$$

Step 3: Find the range of $m$.
To have four distinct solutions, we need the following conditions to hold:
$$0 < \frac{m}{100} + 2 < 3$$
$$0 < -\frac{m}{100} + 2 < 3$$
Solving these gives:
$$-200 < m < 100$$
$$100 < m < 200$$

Step 4: Count the number of positive integers $m$ in the range.
The positive integers $m$ that satisfy the conditions are the integers from $100$ to $199$. The number of such integers is $100$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly four distinct solutions is $100$. The answer is: $100$

Approach:


The equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2 - k$ for some $k \in \{0, 1\}$.

When $k = 0$, we have $| |x - 1| - 2| = 2$, which simplifies to $|x - 1| = 4$. Solving for $x$, we get $x = 5$ or $x = -3$.

When $k = 1$, we have $| |x - 1| - 2| = 1$, which simplifies to $|x - 1| = 3$. Solving for $x$, we get $x = 4$ or $x = -2$.

So, the values of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal to $2 - 0 = 2$ or $2 - 1 = 1$ in order for the equation to have 4 distinct solutions. This gives us two possibilities for $m$: $m = 200$ or $m = 100$.

We can check that both of these values of $m$ indeed give the equation 4 distinct solutions. Therefore, there are 2 possible values of $m$. The answer is: $2$

Approach:


1. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions means that there are 4 different values of $x$ that satisfy the equation.
2. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be solved by analyzing the cases of absolute values separately.
3. For each case, we solve the equation and find the number of distinct solutions.
4. If the number of distinct solutions is 4, we count the number of such $m$.

The Python script to solve the problem is as follows:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

def count_m():
    m = symbols('m')
    count = 0

    # iterate over possible values of m from 1 to 100
    for m_val in range(1, 101):
        # solve the equation for each m value
        num_solutions = len(solve(Eq(Abs(Abs(symbols('x') - 1) - 2), m_val / 100), symbols('x')))

        # if the number of solutions is 4, increment the count
        if num_solutions == 4:
            count += 1

    return count

result = count_m()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 100

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output

Approach:



The number of distinct solutions of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is 4, which means that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ changes its behavior at 4 different points in the $x$-axis.

This means that the right-hand side $\frac{m}{100}$ must be a value that splits the graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ into 4 distinct pieces. 

The graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a V-shape with its lowest point at $(1,2)$, and the V's opening upwards and downwards. 

For the right-hand side to split the graph into 4 distinct pieces, it must be a value that is greater than the height of the V but less than the distance from the lowest point to the top of the V. 

The height of the V is $2$ and the distance from the lowest point to the top of the V is $4$, so we are looking for a value of $\frac{m}{100}$ that is strictly between $2$ and $4$. 

Therefore, we have $2 < \frac{m}{100} < 4$. 

Multiplying all parts of the inequality by $100$ gives us $200 < m < 400$. 

The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from $201$ to $399$, inclusive. 

To find out how many integers are in this range, we subtract the smallest integer from the largest integer and then add $1$. 

So, the number of positive integers $m$ is $399 - 201 + 1 = 199$.

So, there are 199 positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

However, after careful review, we realized that we misunderstood the problem. The number of distinct solutions should be equal to $4$, not greater than $4$. This means we need to find the values of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ changes behavior exactly $4$ times.

As it turns out, there is a mistake in our reasoning. The number of distinct solutions of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is $4$ if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is the height of one of the "teeth" of the graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. 

In other words, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal to $2$. So, we must have $m = 200$.

Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$, namely $200$, for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

The number of such $m$ is $1$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ is $1$.

The answer is: 1

Approach:


To solve this problem, we need to find out how many positive integers $m$ make the equation $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ have 4 distinct solutions. 

Step 1: We can see that the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, is always positive. This means that the absolute value on the left side must be equal to a positive number. Hence, $| |x-1| - 2 | = k$, where $k = \frac{m}{100}$ and $k > 0$.

Step 2: The equation $| |x-1| - 2 | = k$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $0 < k \leq 2$. This is because $| |x-1| - 2 |$ is always between 0 and 2.

Step 3: To find the corresponding values of $m$, we need to solve the inequality $0 < \frac{m}{100} \leq 2$.

Step 4: Solving the inequality $0 < \frac{m}{100} \leq 2$ gives us $0 < m \leq 200$. The positive integers in this range are exactly the integers from 1 to 200.

Step 5: Counting the number of positive integers from 1 to 200 gives us 200. Therefore, there are 200 positive integers $m$ that make the equation have 4 distinct solutions. The answer is: $200$

To solve this problem, we need to find the value of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

Step 1: Analyzing the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$
The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions means that the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, will be equal to $\frac{m}{100}$, $-\frac{m}{100}$, $\frac{m}{100}$ and $-\frac{m}{100}$ four times respectively.

Step 2: Setting up the equations
From the above analysis, we can set up the following equations:

1. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$
2. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$
3. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$
4. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$

Step 3: Solving the equations
Solving each of the above equations separately will give us the values of $m$. However, since we are asked for the number of positive integers $m$, we can simply count the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy these equations.

Step 4: Counting the number of positive integers $m$
By trial and error, we can find that the only positive integers $m$ that satisfy these equations are $m = 200$.

The answer is: $1$

Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$, which is $200$, for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. So the number of positive integers $m$ is $1$. The answer is: $1$

Approach:


To solve this problem, we need to understand the structure of the equation and how it affects the number of solutions. The equation is of the form $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$.

First, let's analyze the expression $|x-1| - 2$. This expression will be equal to $k$ for two values of $x$ when $k \geq 0$, and no values of $x$ when $k < 0$. 

So, the equation $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ will have 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is a value that makes $|x-1| - 2$ equal to this value for two values of $x$, and another value that makes $|x-1| - 2$ equal to the negation of this value for two more values of $x$.

This means $\frac{m}{100}$ must be a value between 0 and 2, inclusive. Therefore, $m$ must be a value between 0 and 200, inclusive.

Now, we need to count how many values of $m$ in this range make $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ have 4 distinct solutions.

By inspection, we find that $m=100$ or $m=200$ will work. So, there are 2 possible values of $m$.
The answer is: $2$

Approach:


We start by analyzing the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}.\]
This equation has four distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to either $2$ or $1$. 
If $\frac{m}{100}=2$, then $m=200$.
If $\frac{m}{100}=1$, then $m=100$.
So the possible values of $m$ are $100$ and $200$.
However, the problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$, so we only consider $200$.

Approach:


We first need to solve the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ for $m$.
We know that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100} = 2$.
So we can substitute $\frac{m}{100} = 2$ into the equation to solve for $m$.
We get $m = 200$.
Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. Hence the answer is $1$. The answer is: $1$.
