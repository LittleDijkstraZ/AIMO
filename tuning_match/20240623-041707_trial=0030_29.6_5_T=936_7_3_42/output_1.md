Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ given the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. Define the function $F(x, y, \lambda) = 5x^2+5y^2-8xy + \lambda (|x-2y| + |y-2x| - 40)$. 

Now, we need to find the gradient of $F$ and set it equal to zero:
$\nabla F = \left(\frac{\partial F}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial F}{\partial y}, \frac{\partial F}{\partial \lambda}\right) = (0, 0, 0)$.

Taking the partial derivatives, we get:
$\frac{\partial F}{\partial x} = 10x - 8y + \lambda (-1 - 2) = 0$,
$\frac{\partial F}{\partial y} = 10y - 8x + \lambda (2 - 1) = 0$,
$\frac{\partial F}{\partial \lambda} = |x-2y| + |y-2x| - 40 = 0$.

Solving the first two equations simultaneously, we get:
$10x - 8y + \lambda (-3) = 0$,
$10y - 8x + \lambda (1) = 0$.

Multiplying the first equation by $10$ and the second equation by $8$, we have:
$100x - 80y + 30\lambda = 0$,
$80y - 64x + 8\lambda = 0$.

Adding these two equations, we get:
$36x + 22\lambda = 0 \implies x = -\frac{11\lambda}{18}$.

Substituting this into the constraint equation, we have:
$|-\frac{11\lambda}{18}-2y| + |y + \frac{22\lambda}{18}| - 40 = 0$.

This is a bit complicated to solve directly, but we can use the fact that the expression inside the absolute value is linear in $y$, and the absolute value function is symmetric about the origin. Therefore, the solution must satisfy $y = -\frac{11\lambda}{18}$.

Substituting this into the constraint equation, we get:
$|-2y - 2y| + |-2y + 2y| - 40 = 0$,
which simplifies to:
$|-4y| - 40 = 0$,
$-4y = \pm 40$,
$y = \pm 10$.

Substituting $y = 10$ into $y = -\frac{11\lambda}{18}$, we get:
$10 = -\frac{11\lambda}{18} \implies \lambda = -\frac{180}{11}$.

Substituting $y = -10$ into $y = -\frac{11\lambda}{18}$, we get:
$-10 = -\frac{11\lambda}{18} \implies \lambda = \frac{180}{11}$.

However, since $\lambda = -\frac{180}{11}$ corresponds to $y = 10$ and $\lambda = \frac{180}{11}$ corresponds to $y = -10$, we can ignore the negative value of $\lambda$ as it does not give a valid solution.

Now, we can substitute $y = 10$ into $x = -\frac{11\lambda}{18}$, to get $x = -10$.

Finally, we substitute $x = -10$ and $y = 10$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, to get:
$5(-10)^2 + 5(10)^2 - 8(-10)(10) = 500 + 500 + 800 = 1800$.

So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the given constraint is $1800$. The answer is: $1800$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We first note that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$.
This is equivalent to $|2y-x| + |x-2y| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$, so we have $|2y-x| + |x-2y| \geq |(2y-x) + (x-2y)| = 0$.
Since this is equal to 40, we must have equality, which means $(2y-x)(x-2y) \geq 0$.
This simplifies to $(x-2y)^2 \geq 0$, which is always true.
So we have $|2y-x| + |x-2y| = 0$ if and only if $2y-x = 0$ and $x-2y = 0$, which implies $x = 2y$.
Substituting $x = 2y$ into $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we get $|0| + |y-4y| = 40$, which simplifies to $|3y| = 40$.
So $y = \pm \frac{40}{3}$. Since $x = 2y$, we have $x = \pm \frac{80}{3}$.
Now we substitute $x = 2y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
\begin{align*}
5(2y)^2 + 5y^2 - 8(2y)(y) &= 20y^2 + 5y^2 - 16y^2 = 9y^2.
\end{align*}
Now we substitute $y = \pm \frac{40}{3}$:
\begin{align*}
9\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 &= \frac{4800}{9}.
\end{align*}
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\frac{4800}{9}$. The answer is: $ \frac{4800}{9}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we note that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$,
and this is equivalent to $|x-2y| - |2y-x| = 0$.
By the property of absolute values, $|a|-|b| = 0$ if and only if $|a| = |b|$.
So we have $|x-2y| = |2y-x|$, which implies $x-2y = 2y-x$ or $x-2y = -(2y-x)$.
The first case gives $x-2y = 2y-x$, which simplifies to $x = 2y$.
The second case gives $x-2y = -(2y-x)$, which simplifies to $x = y$.
So we have two cases: $x = 2y$ or $x = y$.

Case 1: $x = 2y$.
Substituting $x = 2y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get
\[5(2y)^2 + 5y^2 - 8(2y)(y) = 20y^2 + 5y^2 - 16y^2 = 9y^2.\]

Case 2: $x = y$.
Substituting $x = y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get
\[5y^2 + 5y^2 - 8y^2 = 2y^2.\]

Now we need to find the minimum value of $9y^2$ and $2y^2$ when $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
From $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we can substitute $x = 2y$ or $x = y$ into this equation and solve for $y$.
For $x = 2y$, we get $|2y-2y| + |y-4y| = 40$, which simplifies to $0 + 3|y| = 40$.
Solving for $y$, we get $|y| = \frac{40}{3}$, so $y = \pm \frac{40}{3}$.
For $x = y$, we get $|y-2y| + |y-2y| = 40$, which simplifies to $|-y| + |-y| = 40$, or $2|-y| = 40$.
Solving for $y$, we get $|-y| = 20$, so $y = \pm 20$.

Now we substitute the values of $y$ into the expressions $9y^2$ and $2y^2$ to find the minimum value.
For $y = \frac{40}{3}$, we get $9y^2 = 9 \left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 = 400$.
For $y = 20$, we get $2y^2 = 2(20)^2 = 800$.
So the minimum value is $400$.
The answer is: $400$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We first note that $|x-2y| + |y-2x|$ is always equal to $40$.
Then, let $z = x - 2y$ and $w = y - 2x$.
Then, we have $|z| + |w| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, we have $|z + w| \le |z| + |w|$, so $|(x - 2y) + (y - 2x)| \le 40$, which simplifies to $|-x - y| \le 40$.
Multiplying by $-1$, we get $|x + y| \ge 40$.
Now, we need to find the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.
We can rewrite this expression as $(5x^2 - 8xy + 5y^2) = (5x^2 - 10xy + 5y^2) + 2xy = (5(x - y)^2) + 2xy$.
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have $(x^2 + y^2)(1 + 1) \ge (x + y)^2$.
Substituting $x + y \ge 40$, we get $(x^2 + y^2) \ge 800$.
Then, we have $(5(x - y)^2) + 2xy \ge 400 + 2xy$.
To minimize this expression, we need to minimize $2xy$.
By AM-GM inequality, we have $2xy \ge -400$.
Thus, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $400 - 400 = 0$.
The answer is: $0$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We can rewrite the given equation as $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, $|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |x-2y + y-2x| = |x-2x+y-2y| = |0| = 0$.
But the left side of the equation is equal to 40, so we must have equality in the triangle inequality.
This means that the vectors $\begin{pmatrix} x-2y \\ y-2x \end{pmatrix}$ and $\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$ are parallel.
Thus, there exists a scalar $k$ such that $\begin{pmatrix} x-2y \\ y-2x \end{pmatrix} = k \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$.
This gives us the system of equations:
\begin{align*}
x - 2y &= -k, \\
y - 2x &= k.
\end{align*}
Adding the two equations, we get $-x - y = 0$, or $x = -y$.
Substituting this into the first equation, we get $-3y = -k$, or $k = 3y$.
Substituting this into the second equation, we get $y - 2(-y) = 3y$, or $y = 0$.
Since $x = -y$, we also have $x = 0$.
So the only solution to the system is $x = 0$ and $y = 0$.
Now we can find the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$.
Substituting $x = 0$ and $y = 0$, we get $5(0)^2 + 5(0)^2 - 8(0)(0) = 0$.
Therefore, the minimum value is 0. The answer is: $0$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we simplify the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
We can rewrite it as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$.
By the property of absolute value, $|a| = |-a|$, so this equation is equivalent to $|x-2y| + |- (x-2y)| = 40$,
which simplifies to $2|x-2y| = 40$.
So $|x-2y| = 20$.
This equation represents a set of all points $(x, y)$ that are 20 units away from the line $x = 2y$.

Next, we want to minimize the value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.
We can rewrite this as $5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy$.
By the identity $x^2+y^2 = (x-y)^2 + 2xy$, we can rewrite the expression as $5((x-y)^2 + 2xy) - 8xy$.
This simplifies to $5(x-y)^2 + 5xy$.
Now, we know that $|x-2y| = 20$, so $(x-2y)^2 = 400$.
Expanding this, we get $x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2 = 400$.
We can rearrange this to $5xy = 400 - 5(x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2)$, which simplifies to $5xy = 400 - 5(x^2 + y^2)$.
Substituting this into the expression we want to minimize, we have $5(x-y)^2 + 400 - 5(x^2 + y^2)$.
This simplifies to $5(x^2+y^2-2xy) + 400 - 5(x^2 + y^2)$.
Further simplification gives $5(x^2+y^2-2xy) + 400 - 5(x^2 + y^2)$, which simplifies to $-10xy + 400$.
To minimize this expression, we want to maximize $xy$.
By AM-GM, we know that $xy \leq \left(\frac{x+y}{2}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{x+y}{2}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{20}{2}\right)^2 = 100$.
Equality occurs when $x = y$, so the maximum value of $xy$ is $100$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $-10(100) + 400 = -1000 + 400 = -600$.
The answer is: $-600$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we use the fact $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ to get a relationship between $x$ and $y$.
We can rewrite $|x-2y| + |y-2x|$ as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, we have $|2y-x| + |2x-y| \ge |(2y-x) - (2x-y)| = |y-3x|$.
So, $|y-3x| = 40$.
We can rewrite this as $y-3x = 40$ or $y-3x = -40$.

Let's consider the first case $y-3x = 40$.
We can solve for $y$ to get $y = 3x + 40$.
Substitute this into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to get
\[5x^2+5(3x+40)^2-8x(3x+40).\]
Expanding and simplifying, we get
\[5x^2+5(9x^2+240x+1600)-24x^2-320x = 5x^2+45x^2+1200x+8000-24x^2-320x = 26x^2+880x+8000.\]

Now let's consider the second case $y-3x = -40$.
We can solve for $y$ to get $y = 3x - 40$.
Substitute this into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to get
\[5x^2+5(3x-40)^2-8x(3x-40).\]
Expanding and simplifying, we get
\[5x^2+5(9x^2-240x+1600)-24x^2+320x = 5x^2+45x^2-1200x+8000-24x^2+320x = 26x^2-880x+8000.\]

Now we have two expressions $26x^2+880x+8000$ and $26x^2-880x+8000$.
The minimum value of these two expressions occurs at $x = \frac{-880}{2*26} = \frac{-880}{52} = -\frac{440}{26} = -\frac{220}{13}$.

Substitute $x = -\frac{220}{13}$ into the expression $26x^2+880x+8000$, we get
\[26\left(-\frac{220}{13}\right)^2+880\left(-\frac{220}{13}\right)+8000 = 26\left(\frac{48400}{169}\right)-\frac{193600}{13}+8000 = \frac{1260800}{169}-\frac{2516800}{169}+\frac{1288000}{169} = \frac{-272000}{169}.\]
So, the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $\frac{-272000}{169}$.

However, this is not a positive numerical value, which contradicts the statement that the minimum value should be positive. Therefore, we must have made a mistake in our calculations.

Let's reconsider the second case $y-3x = -40$.
We can solve for $y$ to get $y = 3x - 40$.
Substitute this into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to get
\[5x^2+5(3x-40)^2-8x(3x-40).\]
Expanding and simplifying, we get
\[5x^2+5(9x^2-240x+1600)-24x^2+320x = 5x^2+45x^2-1200x+8000-24x^2+320x = 26x^2-880x+8000.\]

Now we have two expressions $26x^2+880x+8000$ and $26x^2-880x+8000$.
The minimum value of these two expressions occurs at $x = \frac{-880}{2*26} = \frac{-880}{52} = -\frac{440}{26} = -\frac{220}{13}$.

Substitute $x = -\frac{220}{13}$ into the expression $26x^2-880x+8000$, we get
\[26\left(-\frac{220}{13}\right)^2-880\left(-\frac{220}{13}\right)+8000 = 26\left(\frac{48400}{169}\right)+\frac{193600}{13}+8000 = \frac{1260800}{169}+\frac{2516800}{169}+\frac{1288000}{169} = \frac{5065600}{169}.\]
The value $\frac{5065600}{169}$ is positive and larger than 0, which matches the requirement of the problem.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $\frac{5065600}{169}$. However, this value is not in the simplest form. We can simplify it as follows:

\[\frac{5065600}{169} = \frac{3015625 + 1624975}{169} = \frac{3015625}{169} + \frac{1624975}{169} = 17850 + 9625 = 27475.\]
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| =

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, let's simplify the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.
We can rewrite it as $5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy$.
Now, let's complete the square for the terms $x^2 - 8xy + y^2$.
We have $(x - 4y)^2 = x^2 - 8xy + 16y^2$.
So, $5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x - 4y)^2 + 11y^2]$.
Thus, the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is always non-negative, because it is equal to $5[(x - 4y)^2 + 11y^2]$ and the square of any real number is non-negative.

Now, let's consider the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, we have $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = |(x - 2y) - (y - 2x)| = |x - 2y - y + 2x| = |3x - 3y| = 3|x - y| = 40$.
So, $|x - y| = \frac{40}{3}$.

Now, we want to find the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ subject to the constraint $|x - y| = \frac{40}{3}$.
Since $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5[(x - 4y)^2 + 11y^2]$ is always non-negative, the minimum value occurs when $(x - 4y)^2 = 0$ and $11y^2 = 0$.
From $(x - 4y)^2 = 0$, we have $x - 4y = 0$, or $x = 4y$.
From $11y^2 = 0$, we have $y = 0$.
Substituting $y = 0$ into $x = 4y$, we get $x = 0$.
So, the minimum value occurs when $x = 0$ and $y = 0$, and the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $5(0^2 + 0^2) - 8(0)(0) = 0$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 0. The answer is: $0$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


Using the inequality $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$, we have
\[|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |x-2y| + |2x-y| \geq |(x-2y) + (2x-y)| = |3x-3y| = 3|x-y|.\]
So, $3|x-y| = 40$ and $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$.
Now, let's define a new variable $z = x-y$. Then $y = x - z$, and we can substitute this into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
\begin{align*}
5x^2+5y^2-8xy &= 5x^2+5(x-z)^2-8x(x-z) \\
&= 5x^2+5(x^2-2xz+z^2)-8x^2+8xz \\
&= -3x^2+5z^2+10xz.
\end{align*}
Now, we use the fact that $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$ to find the value of $z$. We have
\[|x-y| = \frac{40}{3} \Rightarrow |z| = \frac{40}{3}.\]
Without loss of generality, we can assume that $z = \frac{40}{3}$ (we can also assume $z = -\frac{40}{3}$, and the final result will be the same). Then the expression becomes
\[-3x^2+5\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2+10xz = -3x^2+5\cdot\frac{1600}{9}+10x\cdot\frac{40}{3} = -3x^2+\frac{8000}{9}+\frac{400x}{3}.\]
Now, we want to minimize this expression. To do this, we can take the derivative with respect to $x$ and set it equal to 0:
\[\frac{d}{dx}\left(-3x^2+\frac{8000}{9}+\frac{400x}{3}\right) = -6x+\frac{400}{3} = 0.\]
Solving for $x$, we get $x = \frac{200}{9}$. Substituting this into the expression, we get
\[-3\left(\frac{200}{9}\right)^2+\frac{8000}{9}+\frac{400\cdot\frac{200}{9}}{3} = -\frac{120000}{81}+\frac{8000}{9}+\frac{80000}{27} = \frac{-120000+240000+240000}{81} = \frac{360000}{81} = \frac{120000}{27}.\]
Therefore, the minimum value of the expression is $\frac{120000}{27}$. However, this is not an integer. We must have made a mistake.
Let's go back and look at our steps. We know that $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$. If we assume $z = \frac{40}{3}$, we should also consider the possibility of $z = -\frac{40}{3}$. Let's try this. If $z = -\frac{40}{3}$, then $y = x + \frac{40}{3}$, and the expression becomes
\[-3x^2+5\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2-10x\cdot\frac{40}{3} = -3x^2+\frac{8000}{9}-\frac{400x}{3}.\]
Again, taking the derivative with respect to $x$ and setting it equal to 0, we get
\[\frac{d}{dx}\left(-3x^2+\frac{8000}{9}-\frac{400x}{3}\right) = -6x-\frac{400}{3} = 0.\]
Solving for $x$, we get $x = -\frac{200}{9}$. Substituting this into the expression, we get
\[-3\left(-\frac{200}{9}\right)^2+\frac{8000}{9}-\frac{400\cdot(-\frac{200}{9})}{3} = -\frac{120000}{81}+\frac{8000}{9}+\frac{80000}{27} = \frac{-120000+240000+240000}{81} = \frac{360000}{81} = \frac{120000}{27}.\]
Again, we get the same result. Therefore, the minimum value of the expression is indeed $\frac{120000}{27}$. We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 9:
\[\frac{120000}{27} = \frac{40000}{9}.\]
But wait, this is not an integer either. We must have made another mistake.
Let's go back and re-evaluate our steps. We made a mistake in our calculations when taking the derivative of the expression. Let's re-calculate the derivative and the minimum value.
The expression is $-3x^2+5\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2+10xz = -3x^2+\frac{8000}{9}+\frac{400x}{3}$.
Taking the derivative with respect to $x$, we get
\[\frac{d}{dx}\left(-3x^2+\frac{8000}{9}+\frac{400x}{3}\right) = -6x+\frac{400}{3}.\]
Setting this equal to 0, we get
\[-6x+\frac{400}{3} = 0 \Rightarrow -6x = -\frac{400}{3} \Rightarrow x = \frac{200}{9}.\]
But this is the same value we found before. So, let's substitute this value into the expression:
\[-3\left(\frac{200}{9}\right)^2+\frac{8000}{9}+\frac{400\cdot\frac{200}{9}}{3} = \frac{-120000}{81}+\frac{8000}{9}+\frac{80000}{27} = \frac{-120000+240000+240000}{81} = \frac{360000}{81} = \frac{120000}{27}.\]
We still

## QUESTION 1 - 9

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's simplify the expression $|x-2y| + |y-2x|$.
$|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |x-2y| + |2y-x| = |x-2y| - |x-2y| = 0$.
This is a contradiction because $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ and $0 \neq 40$.
So we must have made an error in our simplification.
Let's correct it:
$|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |x-2y| - |x-2y| = 0$.
We must have made a mistake in the second equality.
The correct one should be:
$|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |x-2y| - |-x+2y| = |x-2y| - |2y-x| = |x-2y| + |x-2y| = 2|x-2y|$.
Now we have:
$2|x-2y| = 40 \Rightarrow |x-2y| = 20$.
This is a condition that must be satisfied by $x$ and $y$.
Now let's go back to the original problem.
We want to find the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ given the condition $|x-2y| = 20$.
To simplify the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, let's complete the square:
$5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(x^2-y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x^2-2xy+y^2) - (y^2-2xy+x^2)] = 5[(x-y)^2 - (2xy-x^2-y^2)] = 5(x-y)^2 - 5(x^2-2xy+y^2) = 5(x-y)^2 - 5(x-y)^2 = 0$.
So the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is always equal to 0 regardless of the values of $x$ and $y$ as long as they satisfy the condition $|x-2y| = 20$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ given the condition $|x-2y| = 20$ is 0. The answer is: $0$
