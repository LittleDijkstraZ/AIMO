Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. This means that the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, must be equal to either $\frac{m}{100}$ or $-\frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two separate cases to consider:

Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$

Adding 2 to both sides gives $\vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100} + 2$.

This equation will have two solutions when $\frac{m}{100} + 2 > 0$. Simplifying this gives $m > -200$.

Case 2: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$

Adding 2 to both sides gives $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.

This equation will have two solutions when $2 - \frac{m}{100} > 0$. Simplifying this gives $m < 200$.

Putting these two cases together, we find that $m$ must be in the range $-200 < m < 200$. However, since $m$ is a positive integer, we only need to consider the positive values of $m$. The positive integers in the range $1$ to $199$ are the values that satisfy the equation and make it have 4 distinct solutions. The number of these positive integers is simply $199$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 199. The answer is: $199$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions, which means the right side $\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal to 2.
So we have $\frac{m}{100}=2$, which implies $m=200$.
Therefore, the value of $m$ is 200. The answer is: $1$

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}=2$.
This implies that $m=200$.
Therefore, the value of $m$ is 200. The answer is: $1$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$.

This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a piecewise function with four linear segments. It equals 2 only at four points.

So, we have $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, which implies $m = 200$.

Therefore, the value of $m$ that makes the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have 4 distinct solutions is 200. The answer is: $1$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To have 4 distinct solutions, we know from the theory of absolute value equations that the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be strictly between 1 and 2. This is because the expression on the left side of the equation, $| |x-1| -2 |$, will be equal to a constant $k$ exactly when $k$ is between 1 and 2. So we have $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Multiplying all sides of the inequalities by 100 gives $100 < m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from 101 to 199, inclusive. To count the number of these integers, we subtract the smallest integer from the largest and add 1. So the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition is $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$. The answer is: $99$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}=1$. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ oscillates between 0 and 4, and it equals 1 exactly twice in this interval. So, we have $\frac{m}{100}=1$, which implies $m=100$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 1. The answer is: $1$
