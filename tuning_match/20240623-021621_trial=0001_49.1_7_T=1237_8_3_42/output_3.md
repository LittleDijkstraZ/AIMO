"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:

 The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ is satisfied if either of the two factors is zero. If the first factor is zero, then both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us a square with side length $20$ centered at the origin. The square's vertices are $(\pm10,0), (0,\pm10)$. If the second factor is zero, then both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us a square with side length $16$ centered at the origin. The square's vertices are $(\pm8,0), (0,\pm8)$. The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon whose area we want to find.

To find the area of the intersection, we first find the area of each square:
- The larger square has side length $20$, so its area is $20^2 = 400$.
- The smaller square has side length $16$, so its area is $16^2 = 256$.

The intersection of the two squares is a square with side length equal to the difference of their side lengths divided by $2$, which is $(20 - 16) / 2 = 2$. So the area of the intersection is $2^2 = 4$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $4$. The answer is: $4$

Approach:


The equation $A \cdot B = 0$ implies that at least one of the factors must be zero. Therefore, we can split the original equation into two separate cases to solve.

Case 1: $A = ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$
For this case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that the points $(x, y)$ lie on a square with side length of 20 units. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$ square units.

Case 2: $B = ((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$
For this case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that the points $(x, y)$ lie on a square with side length of 16 units. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$ square units.

However, the area of the convex polygon formed by the intersection of these two cases is the area of the smaller square (since it is entirely contained within the larger square). Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:



The equation $AB=0$ is true if and only if $A=0$ or $B=0$. Therefore, the given equation is satisfied if either of the following two equations is true:
\[(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0,\]
\[(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0.\]
For the first equation to be true, we need $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we find that the points $(x, y)$ satisfying this equation are $(5, 5), (5, -5), (-5, 5),$ and $(-5, -5)$.
For the second equation to be true, we need $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations, we find that the points $(x, y)$ satisfying this equation are $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8),$ and $(-8, -8)$.
The points that satisfy either equation form a square with side length $10$. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$

Approach:

 The given equation is zero, which implies that either the first term or the second term is zero. So we have two cases to consider.

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This means that both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which simplifies to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This represents a square with side length 20.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This means that both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which simplifies to $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This represents a square with side length 16.

The area of the convex polygon formed by the intersection of these two squares is the area of the smaller square (Case 2) because it is entirely contained within the larger square (Case 1). The area of a square is given by side length squared, so the area of the convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:


The given equation is a product of two terms equals to zero. Hence, one of the terms must be zero. This gives us two separate equations to solve:
1. $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$
2. $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$

For the first equation, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solution to these absolute value equations are all points $(x, y)$ that are at a distance of 10 units from the origin in the x-y plane. These points form a square with side length 20. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.

For the second equation, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solution to these absolute value equations are all points $(x, y)$ that are at a distance of 8 units from the origin in the x- or y-directions. These points form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

However, the area of the convex polygon formed by the intersection of the two squares (which is the solution to both equations) should be considered. The intersection of the two squares is another square with side length equal to the difference of their side lengths, which is $20 - 16 = 4$. The area of this square is $4^2 = 16$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 16 square units. The answer is: $16$

Approach:


The given equation is the product of two expressions, which is equal to zero. This implies that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. 

We have two absolute value expressions in each of the expressions. We can break down the absolute value into cases. For example, $|x+y-10|=0$ implies $x+y=10$ or $x+y=-10$.

After considering all possible cases, we find that the given equation is satisfied if and only if $x=y=8$ or $x=-y=10$ or $x=y=-10$. 

These points form a square with side length 12 (from 8 to 10 or from 8 to -10), so the area of the square is $12^2 = 144$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 144.



```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    side_length = 12
    area = side_length**2
    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 144

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
144
```
The area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{144}$.The answer is: $144$.

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:

 The expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ is equal to zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy this equation are those for which the sum of the absolute values of the coordinates is always 10. Similarly, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means that the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy this equation are those for which the absolute values of both coordinates are always 8.

These two conditions combined define a square with side length 10 (since the sum of the absolute values of the coordinates is always 10) and whose vertices are at $(\pm 8, \pm 8)$ (since the absolute values of both coordinates are always 8).

The area of this square is calculated by the formula $side^2$, so the area is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$.

Approach:

 The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This is equivalent to $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations gives the vertices of the square as $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, -2)$, and $(-8, 2)$.

Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which are equivalent to $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives the vertices of the square as $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$.

The intersection of these two squares forms a smaller square with side length 6 (since the distance between the points $(8, 2)$ and $(8, -2)$ is 4). Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $6^2 = 36$. The answer is: $36$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:


The given equation is of the form $(A)(B) = 0$. This implies that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. So, we have two cases to consider:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For case 1, we have:
$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This forms a square with side length 10. The area of the square is $10^2 = 100$.

For case 2, we have:
$(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This forms a square with side length 16. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

However, we need to consider the intersection of these two cases. The intersection occurs when the points satisfy both cases simultaneously. This happens when the point lies on the square formed by case 1 (the inner square) because all points inside the square will satisfy both conditions of case 1 and case 2. So, we only need to consider the area of the inner square.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of the inner square, which is 100.

Python code to calculate the area:
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    # Side length of the square
    side_length = 10

    # Area of the square
    area = side_length ** 2

    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 100

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
100
```
The area of the convex polygon is $100$. The answer is $\boxed{100}$.
