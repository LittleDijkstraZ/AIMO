Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. This means that the expression on the left side of the equation will be equal to $\frac{m}{100}$ or $-\frac{m}{100}$ at $4$ different values of $x$.

The expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ will be equal to $\frac{m}{100}$ or $-\frac{m}{100}$ in different cases depending on the value of $m$. 

For $\frac{m}{100} \ge 2$, i.e., $m \ge 200$, the expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ will be equal to $\frac{m}{100}$ at $4$ different values of $x$.

For $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, i.e., $0 < m < 200$, the expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ will be equal to $\frac{m}{100}$ or $-\frac{m}{100}$ at $4$ different values of $x$.

For $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, i.e., $m = 200$, the expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ will be equal to $\frac{m}{100}$ or $-\frac{m}{100}$ at $4$ different values of $x$.

So, the possible values of $m$ are those in the range $0 < m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ in this range are $1, 2, 3, \ldots, 199$. 

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $199$. The answer is: $199$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. This is because the expression $| |x-1|-2|$ is a "V" shape with the "peak" at 2. So, for it to have 4 distinct solutions, the "height" of the "V" must be exactly 2.

Solving the equation $\frac{m}{100} = 2$ for $m$ gives $m = 200$. So, there is only 1 positive integer $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions, and that is $m=200$. The answer is: $1$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions. 

The expression on the left side, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, represents a "hump" function that reaches a maximum of 2 at $x=1$, and a minimum of 0 at $x=3$ and $x=-1$.

The right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be a number between 0 and 2 for the equation to have 4 distinct solutions. Therefore, $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$.

Solving these inequalities gives $0 < m < 200$.

Since $m$ is a positive integer, the possible values for $m$ are the integers from 1 to 199.

However, we need to find the number of these values that make the equation have exactly 4 distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}=1$. This gives $m=100$.

Therefore, there is only one value of $m$ that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions, namely $m=100$. The answer is: 1

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has 4 distinct solutions.
We know that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=k$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $0<k<1$.
In this case, $k=\frac{m}{100}$, so we have $0<\frac{m}{100}<1$.
This inequality simplifies to $0<m<100$.
So the positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition are the integers from 1 to 99.
There are 99 such positive integers.
The answer is: 99.
The answer is: $\boxed{99}$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$.
This is because the expression on the left side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, can only be equal to $2$ for four distinct values of $x$.

Setting $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, we can solve for $m$ to get $m = 200$.
Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions, and that is $m = 200$. The answer is: $\boxed{1}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The number of distinct solutions of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $4$ if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $2$. This is because the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, takes on the value of $2$ exactly four times.

Setting $\frac{m}{100}=2$, we find that $m = 200$. So there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions, and that is $m = 200$. The answer is: $1$.
