Interesting, let's analyze step by step:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, we can have two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x - y \vert = 10$
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8$
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert y \vert = 8$

From 1 and 2, we have $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$. These are lines. The intersection points of these lines are $(-10, 0), (10, 0), (0, -10)$ and $(0, 10)$. From 3 and 4, we have $x = 8$ or $x = -8$ and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. The intersection points of these lines are $(-8, -8), (-8, 8), (8, -8)$ and $(8, 8)$. These points form a square with side length $20$. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$. So the area of the convex polygon is $400$.
```python

    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    side_length = 20
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = polygon_area()

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to the system of equations:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$$
and
$$((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$
2. For the first equation, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These conditions define a square with side length 10 units.
3. For the second equation, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These conditions define a square with side length 16 units.
4. The intersection of the two squares is a smaller square with side length 8 units.
5. The area of a square is given by the square of the side length. Therefore, the area of the smaller square is $8^2 = 64$ square units. So, the area of the convex polygon is 64.

The answer is: $64$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. Therefore, each expression must be zero separately. 

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. This is a pair of parallel lines with distance $10$ from the origin.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ which implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This is a pair of parallel lines with distance $10$ from the origin, making a cross shape.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$. This is a pair of vertical lines with distance $8$ from the origin.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ which implies $\vert y \vert = 8$. This is a pair of horizontal lines with distance $8$ from the origin.

The intersection points of these lines form a rectangle with side lengths $16$ and $20$. The area of this rectangle is $16 \times 20 = 320$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $320$. The answer is: $320$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We have an equation and we want to find the area of the polygon enclosed by the points that satisfy the equation.
2. The equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. For the product of two numbers to be zero, either one of them must be zero. This gives us two equations:
   a. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
   b. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
3. For the first equation to be true, both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ must be zero, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two perpendicular lines, forming a cross shape.
4. For the second equation to be true, both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2$ must be zero, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us a square shape with side length 16.
5. The intersection of these two shapes is a smaller square with side length 8.
6. To find the area of the polygon, we need to calculate the area of the larger square and subtract the area of the smaller square.
7. The area of a square is calculated as side length squared. So, the area of the larger square is $16^2 = 256$, and the area of the smaller square is $8^2 = 64$.
8. Finally, the area of the polygon is $256 - 64 = 192$.

Since the question asks for a positive numerical answer, the result is $\boxed{192}$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    # calculate the area of the larger square
    area_larger_square = 16**2
    # calculate the area of the smaller square
    area_smaller_square = 8**2
    # calculate the area of the polygon
    area_polygon = area_larger_square - area_smaller_square
    return area_polygon

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 192

The area of the convex polygon is $192$. The answer is $\boxed{192}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, we have the system of equations:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$$ 
and
$$((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$

2. Each of these equations can only be true if the absolute value of the corresponding expression equals to zero, that is:
$$\vert x + y \vert = 10, \quad \vert x - y \vert = 10, \quad \vert x \vert = 8, \quad \vert y \vert = 8$$

3. Solving these equations will give us the vertices of the polygon:
$$x + y = 10 \text{ or } x + y = -10,$$
$$x - y = 10 \text{ or } x - y = -10,$$
$$x = 8 \text{ or } x = -8,$$
$$y = 8 \text{ or } y = -8.$$

4. By combining the solutions, we get the following vertices of the polygon:
$$(8, 2), (8, -2), (2, 8), (2, -8), (-8, 2), (-8, -2), (-2, 8), (-2, -8).$$

5. The polygon is a square with side length of 16. Therefore, the area is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The expression equals zero if either of the factors equals zero. Thus, we need to solve four systems of equations:
1) $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x| - 8 = 0$, $|y| - 8 = 0$.
2) $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x| - 8 = 0$, $|y| - 8 = 0$.
3) $|x - y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x| - 8 = 0$, $|y| - 8 = 0$.
4) $|x - y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x| - 8 = 0$, $|y| - 8 = 0$.

Solving each system, we find the vertices of the polygon:
1) (8, 8)
2) (8, -8)
3) (-8, 8)
4) (-8, -8)

Now, we can plot these points and find the area of the square with side length 16:
Area = side^2 = 16^2 = 256

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units.
The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Thus the equation $AB=0$ is equivalent to either $A=0$ or $B=0$. In our case this implies that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, and thus $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies that $|x| = |y| = 5$. The solutions $(x, y)$ that satisfy these conditions form a square with side length 10 centered at the origin.

Similarly, if $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, and thus $|x| = |y| = 8$. The solutions $(x, y)$ that satisfy these conditions form a square with side length 16 centered at the origin.

The union of these two squares is the convex polygon whose area we need to compute. The side length of the larger square is 10, so its area is $10^2 = 100$. The side length of the smaller square is 16, so its area is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore the area of the convex polygon is $256 - 100 = 156$.

```python

    # Area of the larger square
    area_larger_square = 10**2

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Given the equation $f(x, y) = ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$, the points that satisfy this equation are the solution to either of the two equations $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

Each of these equations represents a square with side length 16 centered at $(0, 0)$, $(0, 0)$, $(8, 0)$, and $(0, 8)$ respectively. The intersection of these squares forms a octagon. The area of this octagon can be found by subtracting the area of the four triangles formed by the vertices of the squares from the total area of the squares.

The side length of each square is 16, so the area of each square is $16^2 = 256$. There are four squares, so the total area of the squares is $4 * 256 = 1024$.

The vertices of the squares are: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$. The four triangles formed by the vertices of the squares are right triangles with legs of length 8, so the area of each triangle is $\frac{1}{2} * 8 * 8 = 32$. There are four triangles, so the total area of the triangles is $4 * 32 = 128$.

The area of the octagon is the total area of the squares minus the total area of the triangles, which is $1024 - 128 = 896$.

```python

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. This means that our equation equals zero if at least one of the following conditions hold:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x - y \vert = 10$
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8$
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert y \vert = 8$

By solving each absolute value equation we get the following vertices for the polygon:

1. $(x, y) = (8, 8), (-8, -8)$
2. $(x, y) = (8, -8), (-8, 8)$
3. $(x, y) = (10, 0)$ and $(x, y) = (-10, 0)$
4. $(x, y) = (0, 10)$ and $(x, y) = (0, -10)$

Plotting these points, we see that they form a square with side length $16$. The area of a square is given by side length squared, so the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, notice that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So we can split the equation into two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, or
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get $x = \pm 5, y = \pm 5$.

For the second case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

So the points satisfying the equation are: $(5, 5), (-5, -5), (5, -5), (-5, 5), (8, 8), (-8, -8), (8, -8), (-8, 8)$.

These points form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. So the area of the convex polygon is 100.

The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Step 1: Recognize that the equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ must be true for the whole equation to be zero.

Step 2: Note that $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which is a square with side length 10 and diagonals of length 10√2.

Step 3: Similarly, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which is a square with side length 8 and diagonals of length 8√2.

Step 4: The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for. It is a square with side length 8 (since the side length cannot be greater than 8).

Step 5: The area of this square is side length squared, so the area is $8^2 = 64$.
The answer is: $64$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, observe that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of them is zero. Thus, we get two separate conditions:
1. $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$, and
2. $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

For the first condition, we have $|x+y| = 10$ and $|x-y| = 10$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x+y=10$, $x+y=-10$, $x-y=10$, and $x-y=-10$.

For the second condition, we have $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x=8$, $x=-8$, $y=8$, and $y=-8$.

The lines intersect at the points $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(2, 8)$, $(-2, 8)$, $(2, -8)$, and $(-2, -8)$. These points form a square with side length $8\sqrt{2}$. The area of this square is $(8\sqrt{2})^2 = 128$.

The answer is: $128$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We are given a math problem where we need to find the area of the polygon enclosed by the points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

2. Notice that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, we can set each factor equal to zero and solve for the corresponding points.

3. Set $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$: This equation is satisfied when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

4. Set $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$: This equation is satisfied when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

5. Solving these equations, we find that the points that satisfy the original equation are: $\left(8, 8\right)$, $\left(-8, 8\right)$, $\left(8, -8\right)$, and $\left(-8, -8\right)$.

6. These points form a square with side length of 16 units.

7. The area of a square is given by the square of the length of one of its sides, so the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$
