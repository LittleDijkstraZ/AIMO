Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions,
we first consider the right side of the equation. Since $\frac{m}{100}$ is positive, we know that $m$ must be positive.
We also know that $\frac{m}{100}$ must be less than $2$, so $m$ must be less than $200$.
Now, let's consider the left side of the equation. The absolute value equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$
can be split into two cases: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.
For the first case, $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.
This splits into two further cases: $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x-1 = -(2 + \frac{m}{100})$.
For the second case, $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
This also splits into two further cases: $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x-1 = -(2 - \frac{m}{100})$.
In total, we have $4$ equations to solve for $x$ and find the number of distinct solutions.
For each equation, we can solve for $x$ and see if we get $4$ distinct solutions.
After solving each equation and counting the number of distinct solutions, we can determine the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition.
However, this process can be quite tedious. Instead, we can use the fact that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$
has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is between $0$ and $2$. This means $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$,
or equivalently, $0 < m < 200$. The positive integers in this range are $1, 2, 3, \dots, 199$.
However, we need to find the number of these integers that make the equation have $4$ distinct solutions.
By analyzing the equations we derived above, we find that the number of such integers is $100$.
Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $100$.
The answer is: $100$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


For the equation $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ to have $4$ distinct solutions,
the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be a positive number less than $2$.
This is because $| |x-1| - 2 |$ represents the distance between $x$ and $1$ that is $2$ units away from $2$.
The maximum value of $\frac{m}{100}$ is $2$ because $| |x-1| - 2 | \leq 2$.
And if $\frac{m}{100} \geq 2$, the equation will have at most $3$ distinct solutions.
Therefore, we need $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$.
Multiplying all sides by $100$, we have $0 < m < 200$.
The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are $1, 2, ..., 199$,
and there are $\boxed{199}$ such integers.
The answer is: $199$

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The number of distinct solutions of the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] is equal to $4$ if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $2$, inclusive. This is because the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a graph that goes up and down between $1$ and $2$, and the number of distinct solutions to $f(x) = \frac{m}{100}$ is equal to the number of times the horizontal line $y = \frac{m}{100}$ intersects the graph of $f(x)$.

If $\frac{m}{100} < 1$, then the equation has only $2$ distinct solutions. If $\frac{m}{100} > 2$, then the equation has more than $4$ distinct solutions. Therefore, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be in the interval $[1, 2]$.

Multiplying every member of this inequality by $100$ gives $1 \leq \frac{m}{100} \leq 2$, which is equivalent to $100 \leq m \leq 200$. The positive integers in this interval are $100, 101, 102, \ldots, 199, 200$, and there are $101$ integers in this list. Therefore, there are $101$ positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions. The answer is: $101$

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $2$. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a piecewise linear function with 4 segments, each of which has a slope of either $+1$ or $-1$. The function equals $0$ at $x=3$, $1$ at $x=1-2 = -1$, $3$ at $x=1+2 = 3$, and $1$ again at $x=1+2 = 3$. The function therefore crosses the horizontal line $y=\frac{m}{100}$ four times when $\frac{m}{100} = 2$.

So, the value of $m$ is $2 \times 100 = 200$.

However, $m$ must be a positive integer. The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition. In this case, there is only one positive integer $m$, which is $200$. So the answer is $\boxed{1}$.

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

The graph of $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a "hockey stick" with "sticks" at $y = \frac{1}{100}$, $y = \frac{2}{100}$, and $y = \frac{3}{100}$, and with the "tip" at $(1,2)$. The "hockey stick" is symmetric about the line $x = 1$. The equation has 4 distinct solutions when the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, falls strictly between the values of the "sticks".

That is, $\frac{1}{100} < \frac{m}{100} < \frac{2}{100}$, $\frac{2}{100} < \frac{m}{100} < \frac{3}{100}$. This gives the inequality $1 < m < 2$ and $2 < m < 3$.

The only integer $m$ that satisfies both of these inequalities is $m = 2$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the equation is 1. The answer is: $1$

Step-by-step Solution:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. This is because the expression on the left, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, can take on exactly 4 distinct values: $0, 1, 2, 3$. If it equals 2, then it will have 4 distinct solutions. Setting $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, we can solve for $m$ to get $m = 200$. So there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions, and that is $m = 200$. The answer is: $1$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.
Let's first consider the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=0$.
This simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$, and further simplifies to $x-1 = 2$ or $x-1 = -2$.
Solving these equations gives us $x = 3$ or $x = -1$.

Now, let's consider the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ for $m > 0$.
This equation will have 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is between $0$ and $2$.
In other words, $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which simplifies to $0 < m < 200$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is the number of positive integers between $0$ and $200$, not inclusive.
This is equal to the number of positive integers from $1$ to $200$, not inclusive, which is $200 - 1 = 199$.

However, we must exclude the value $m=0$ from this count, since we already considered that case when we solved the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=0$.

So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is $199 - 1 = 198$.
The answer is: $198$

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$.
To see this, consider the graph of $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. The graph is a V-shape with a peak at $y=2$.
If $\frac{m}{100} > 2$, then the equation has no solutions.
If $\frac{m}{100} < 2$, then the equation has less than 4 solutions.
Only when $\frac{m}{100} = 2$ does the equation have 4 distinct solutions.
So we have $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, which implies $m = 200$.
Thus, there is only one positive integer $m$ that satisfies the condition, and the answer is $1$. The answer is: $1$
