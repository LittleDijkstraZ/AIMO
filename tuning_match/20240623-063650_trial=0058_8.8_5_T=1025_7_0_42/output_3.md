Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if either of the following conditions is met:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first condition to be true, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two lines in the plane: $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, and their reflections across the axes. This forms a square with side length 10 and vertices at $(0, 10), (10, 0), (0, -10),$ and $(-10, 0)$.

For the second condition to be true, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of four lines in the plane: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$, and their reflections across the axes. This forms a square with side length 16 and vertices at $(8, 8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8),$ and $(8, -8)$.

The intersection of these two squares is a smaller square with side length 6 and vertices at $(4, 6), (-4, 6), (-4, -6),$ and $(4, -6)$. The area of this square is $6^2 = 36$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 36 square units. The answer is: $36$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's look at the equation more closely. The equation is equal to zero, which means that at least one of the factors must be zero. This gives us two conditions:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From condition 1, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle.

From condition 2, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. These lines form a square.

The points that satisfy both conditions, i.e., the intersection of the rectangle and the square, form a smaller square. The side length of the smaller square is 8 (since it's completely inside the square with side length 16). The area of a square is given by side length squared, so the area of the convex polygon is $8^2 = 64$. The answer is: $64$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Thus, the equation $AB=0$ is equivalent to $A=0$ or $B=0$. Using this fact, we can rewrite the given equation as two separate equations:
\begin{align*}
(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 &= 0, \\
(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 &= 0.
\end{align*}
The first equation implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only way for both of these absolute values to be equal to a constant is if $x = 0$ and $y = 0$. 
The second equation implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The only way for both of these absolute values to be equal to a constant is if $x = 8$ or $x = -8$, and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. 
So the points that satisfy the original equation are $(0,0)$, $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$. These points form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The equation
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0\]
is true exactly when either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ is true exactly when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives the vertices of a square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$, so the area of this square is $(10\sqrt{2})^2 = 200$.

The expression $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ is true exactly when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So these points form a square with side length $16$, and its area is $256$.

Therefore, the total area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of these two squares, which is $200 + 256 = \boxed{456}$.
The answer is: $456$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

For the product of two factors to be zero, either one of the factors must be zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
This equation implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
The only way for both of these absolute value equations to be true is if $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.
This gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This equation implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The only way for both of these absolute value equations to be true is if $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
This gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersection points of these lines form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10 \times 10 = 100$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, we can set each factor equal to zero and solve for $x$ and $y$.
For the first factor:
\[(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0.\]
This means that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
The solutions to these equations are the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.
For the second factor:
\[(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0.\]
This means that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The solutions to these equations are the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.
The intersections of these lines form a square with side length 10.
Therefore, the area of this square is $10^2 = \boxed{100}$. The answer is: 100

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The equation is satisfied only when both the factors are zero. This means either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

These conditions are equivalent to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The first two conditions represent two pairs of parallel lines, $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$, and $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.

The last two conditions represent two pairs of parallel lines, $x = 8$ and $x = -8$, and $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

These lines form a square with side length 10. Therefore, the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, which intersect at the point $(5,5)$. Similarly, the lines $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$ intersect at the point $(-5,-5)$. So we have a square with vertices at $(5,5)$, $(-5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, and $(5,-5)$. The side length of this square is $10\sqrt{2}$. The area of this square is $(10\sqrt{2})^2 = 200$.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$, which intersect at the point $(8,8)$. Similarly, the lines $x = -8$ and $y = -8$ intersect at the point $(-8,-8)$. So we have a square with vertices at $(8,8)$, $(-8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(8,-8)$. The side length of this square is $16$. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

However, since the square with side length $16$ is completely contained within the square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$, the area of the convex polygon formed by the points satisfying the given equation is equal to the area of the square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$, which is $200$. The answer is: $200$.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



A product is zero if and only if at least one of the factors is zero. Therefore, the given equation is satisfied if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

These equations are satisfied if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

If $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, then $x + y = \pm 10$ or $x + y = 0$.
If $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, then $x - y = \pm 10$ or $x - y = 0$.
If $\vert x \vert = 8$, then $x = \pm 8$.
If $\vert y \vert = 8$, then $y = \pm 8$.

The solutions to these equations are the vertices of a square with side length 10, centered at the origin. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$
