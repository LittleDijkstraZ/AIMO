Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge are:

1. The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ encloses a convex polygon.

2. We are to find the area of this convex polygon.

To solve this problem, we first need to understand when the product of two numbers is zero. This happens if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is zero if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first case, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we find the points that satisfy these conditions are $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(2, 8)$, $(-2, 8)$, $(2, -8)$, $(-2, -8)$.

For the second case, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Adding these points to our list of points, we have $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(2, 8)$, $(-2, 8)$, $(2, -8)$, $(-2, -8)$, $(8, 0)$, $(-8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, $(0, -8)$.

These points form a square with side length $20$, so the area of the square is $20^2 = 400$. The answer is: $400$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints are given by the equation
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$

This equation is equal to zero if either of the two factors is zero. That is,
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad ((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$

For the first factor to be zero, both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. Solving these absolute value equations gives us the lines $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.

For the second factor to be zero, both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. Solving these absolute value equations gives us the lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

The lines $x + y = \pm 10$, $x - y = \pm 10$, $x = \pm 8$, and $y = \pm 8$ enclose a rectangle with side lengths $20$ and $16$. The area of this rectangle is $20 \times 16 = 320$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $320$. The answer is: $320$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The problem's constraint is the equation
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]
This equation equals 0 if and only if at least one of the factors equals 0. Therefore, the constraints are:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The constraints $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$ can be rewritten as:
1. $-10 \le x + y \le 10$.
2. $-10 \le x - y \le 10$.
3. $-8 \le x \le 8$.
4. $-8 \le y \le 8$.

The intersection of these constraints is a square with side length 16 (from $-8$ to $8$ in both the $x$ and $y$ directions). The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $\boxed{256}$.

 The problem's constraints, conditions, and related knowledge:
The equation is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
For the product of two numbers to be zero, either one of the numbers must be zero. Therefore, we have two cases:
Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
For Case 1, both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ must be zero, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, and their reflections across the coordinate axes. The intersection points of these lines form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.
For Case 2, both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2$ must be zero, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$, and their reflections across the coordinate axes. The intersection points of these lines form a square with side length 8. The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares, which is $100 + 64 = 164$.
The answer is: $164$.

The problem gives us a complicated equation and asks us to find the area of the region it encloses. The first step is to simplify the equation and identify the constraints.

The equation is:
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]

This equation is the product of two terms. The product of two factors is zero if and only if one or both of the factors are zero. Thus, this equation is satisfied if either of the following two conditions is met:

1. $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$.
2. $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

For the first condition, the only way for a sum of squares to be zero is if each square is zero. This means that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The absolute value equations can be split into two cases:

Case 1: $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$. Adding these equations gives $2x = 20$, so $x = 10$ and substituting $x = 10$ into $x + y = 10$ gives $y = 0$.

Case 2: $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$. Adding these equations gives $2x = -20$, so $x = -10$ and substituting $x = -10$ into $x + y = -10$ gives $y = 0$.

For the second condition, the only way for a sum of squares to be zero is if each square is zero. This means that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The absolute value equations can be split into four cases:

Case 3: $x = 8$ and $y = 8$.
Case 4: $x = 8$ and $y = -8$.
Case 5: $x = -8$ and $y = 8$.
Case 6: $x = -8$ and $y = -8$.

So the set of points that satisfy the equation are the points that lie in one of these six cases.

The points from Cases 1 and 2 are $(10, 0)$ and $(-10, 0)$, and the points from Cases 3 to 6 are $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$. These points form a square with side length $20$. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$. The answer is: $400$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The constraints, conditions and related knowledge for the problem are:

1. The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ encloses a convex polygon.
2. We are to find the area of this polygon.

To solve this problem, we first need to understand the conditions that make the equation equal to zero. 

The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So, the equation is equal to zero if either:

a. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or
b. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For case a., both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ must be zero. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these equations are all points $(x, y)$ that lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, as well as their reflections across the coordinate axes. These lines form a square with side length 10.

For case b., both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2$ must be zero. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are all points $(x, y)$ that lie on the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$, as well as their reflections across the coordinate axes. These lines form a square with side length 8.

The convex polygon enclosed by the equation is the intersection of these two squares, which is a 8x8 square. The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$. The answer is: $\boxed{64}$.

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions, and related knowledge are as follows:

1. The equation is satisfied if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
2. Similarly, either $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
3. The absolute value function $|\cdot|$ splits into two cases: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, $x - y = -10$, $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, $y = -8$.
4. The intersection points of these lines can be found by solving the system of equations.

Now let's solve the problem step by step:

Step 1: Find the intersection points of the lines
- For $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, we get $x = 10$ and $y = 0$.
- For $x + y = 10$ and $x = 8$, we get $x = 8$ and $y = 2$.
- For $x + y = 10$ and $y = 8$, we get $x = 2$ and $y = 8$.
- For $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$, we get $x = 0$ and $y = -10$.
- For $x + y = -10$ and $x = -8$, we get $x = -8$ and $y = -2$.
- For $x + y = -10$ and $y = -8$, we get $x = -2$ and $y = -8$.
- For $x - y = -10$ and $x = 8$, we get $x = 8$ and $y = 18$. This point is not in the square region of $[-8, 8] \times [-8, 8]$.
- For $x - y = -10$ and $y = 8$, we get $x = -2$ and $y = 8$. This point is not in the square region of $[-8, 8] \times [-8, 8]$.
- For $x - y = 10$ and $x = -8$, we get $x = -8$ and $y = -18$. This point is not in the square region of $[-8, 8] \times [-8, 8]$.
- For $x - y = 10$ and $y = -8$, we get $x = 18$ and $y = -8$. This point is not in the square region of $[-8, 8] \times [-8, 8]$.

Step 2: Plot the intersection points and connect them to form the polygon
The intersection points are $(10, 0)$, $(8, 2)$, $(2, 8)$, $(0, -10)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(-2, -8)$, $(8, 18)$, and $(-8, -18)$. However, only the first six points $(10, 0)$, $(8, 2)$, $(2, 8)$, $(0, -10)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(-2, -8)$ are in the square region of $[-8, 8] \times [-8, 8]$. These points form a regular hexagon.

Step 3: Calculate the area of the hexagon
The side length of the hexagon is the distance between adjacent vertices. For example, the distance between $(10, 0)$ and $(8, 2)$ is $\sqrt{(10 - 8)^2 + (0 - 2)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 4} = \sqrt{8} = 2\sqrt{2}$. The area of a regular hexagon with side length $a$ is $\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2}a^2$. So the area of the hexagon is $\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2}(2\sqrt{2})^2 = 12\sqrt{3}$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $12\sqrt{3}$. The answer is: $12\sqrt{3}$

 The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is equal to zero if and only if at least one of the factors is equal to zero. The factors are $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. Each of these factors is a square, so it is equal to zero if and only if the expressions inside the square are equal to zero.

The expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon as $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0)$.

The expression $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon as $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$.

The vertices of the polygon are $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0), (8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$. These points form a square with side length 10. To find the area of the square, we can use the formula $s^2$ where $s$ is the side length. So the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units. The answer is: $100$

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints are the absolute value functions and the requirement that the product of two expressions equals zero. The conditions are that the expressions inside the absolute value functions must be equal to zero or that the product of the two expressions must be zero. The related knowledge includes the properties of absolute value, the fact that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero, and the formula for the area of a square.

The equation given is
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]

According to the constraint that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero, the above equation is equivalent to the following two sets of equations:
\[\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0, \quad \vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0, \quad \vert x \vert - 8 = 0, \quad \vert y \vert - 8 = 0.\]
These can be simplified to:
\[\vert x + y \vert = 10, \quad \vert x - y \vert = 10, \quad \vert x \vert = 8, \quad \vert y \vert = 8.\]
Solving the equations $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, we get $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

The equations $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ can be solved as follows:
For $x = 8$ and $y = 8$, $x + y = 16$ and $x - y = 0$, so the equations become $16 - 10 = 6$ and $0 - 10 = -10$, which are not true.
For $x = 8$ and $y = -8$, $x + y = 0$ and $x - y = 16$, so the equations become $0 - 10 = -10$ and $16 - 10 = 6$, which are not true.
For $x = -8$ and $y = 8$, $x + y = 0$ and $x - y = -16$, so the equations become $0 - 10 = -10$ and $-16 - 10 = -26$, which are not true.
For $x = -8$ and $y = -8$, $x + y = -16$ and $x - y = 0$, so the equations become $-16 - 10 = -26$ and $0 - 10 = -10$, which are not true.
Therefore, the solutions are $x = 8$ and $y = -8$, and $x = -8$ and $y = 8$. These represent two pairs of points: $(8, -8)$ and $(-8, 8)$.

The distance between these two points can be found by using the distance formula:
$\sqrt{(8 - (-8))^2 + ((-8) - 8)^2} = \sqrt{(16)^2 + (-16)^2} = \sqrt{256 + 256} = \sqrt{512} = 16\sqrt{2}$.
The length of one side of the square is therefore $16\sqrt{2}$.
The area of the square is then $(16\sqrt{2})^2 = 512$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 512 square units. The answer is: $512$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first list the problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge, and thens solve the problem step by step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints are given by the equation:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$

A product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So this equation is satisfied if either:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which means $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which means $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The first two conditions give us the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, which are the graphs of the equations $y = 10 - x$ and $y = x - 10$. The last two conditions give us the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$, which are the graphs of the equations $x = 8$ and $y = 8$.

The points where these lines intersect form a square. The vertices of the square are the solutions to the systems of equations formed by the pairs of these lines. The vertices of the square are $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-2, 8)$, and $(18, 8)$.

The side length of the square is the distance between any pair of adjacent vertices. Using the distance formula, the side length is $\sqrt{(8 - (-2))^2 + (2 - 8)^2} = \sqrt{100 + 36} = \sqrt{136} = 2\sqrt{34}$.

The area of a square is the square of the length of its side, so the area of the square is $(2\sqrt{34})^2 = 4 \cdot 34 = 136$. The answer is: $136$ square units.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions, and related knowledge are as follows:

1. The equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
2. The points $\left(x, y\right)$ that satisfy this equation are the coordinates of the vertices of the convex polygon.
3. The area of the convex polygon can be found by breaking it down into triangles and summing their areas.

To solve the problem, we first need to find the points $\left(x, y\right)$ that satisfy the equation.

Since the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero, the equation is satisfied if either $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$ or $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

If $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$, then both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$, which gives us the vertices of the square: $(10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, $(-10, 0)$, and $(0, -10)$.

If $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$, then both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$, which gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

Combining these two sets of vertices, we find that the convex polygon is a 8 by 10 rectangle. Therefore, its area is $8 \times 10 = 80$. The answer is: $80$

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. Therefore, either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

The first term is zero when $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x-y| - 10 = 0$. This gives us $|x+y| = 10$ and $|x-y| = 10$. The solutions to these absolute value equations are $x+y = 10$, $x+y = -10$, $x-y = 10$, and $x-y = -10$. These are the equations of lines in the coordinate plane.

The second term is zero when $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$. This gives us $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. The solutions to these absolute value equations are $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These are the equations of lines in the coordinate plane.

The lines $x+y = 10$, $x+y = -10$, $x-y = 10$, and $x-y = -10$ form a square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$. The lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$ form a square with side length 16. 

The intersection of these two squares is the region that satisfies both conditions, which is another square with side length 8. The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 64. The answer is: $64$

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions, and related knowledge are as follows:
The expression $AB=0$ is true if and only if $A=0$ or $B=0$. Thus, the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is equivalent to the system of equations:
\begin{align*}
(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 &= 0, \\
(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 &= 0.
\end{align*}
The first equation implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means that $x+y = \pm 10$ and $x-y = \pm 10$. These four equations can be simplified to:
\begin{align*}
x+y &= 10, \\
x+y &= -10, \\
x-y &= 10, \\
x-y &= -10.
\end{align*}
The second equation implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. These four equations can be simplified to:
\begin{align*}
x &= 8, \\
x &= -8, \\
y &= 8, \\
y &= -8.
\end{align*}
The system of equations has four solutions: $(8,8)$, $(-8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, and $(-8,-8)$. These points are the vertices of a square with side length 16. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions, and related knowledge are as follows:
The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ must be satisfied for all points $(x, y)$ inside the polygon.
The absolute value function $\vert a \vert$ is defined as $a$ if $a \geq 0$, and $-a$ if $a < 0$.
The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero.
The square of a number is zero if and only if the number is zero.

Now we solve the problem step by step:
For the expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$ to be zero, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us the constraints: $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length 10 units.
For the expression $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ to be zero, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us the constraints: $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. These lines form a square with side length 16 units.
The intersection of these two squares is the polygon we are looking for, which is a smaller square with side length 10 units.
The area of a square is given by the square of the side length, so the area of the polygon is $10^2 = 100$ square units.
The answer is: $100$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge include:
1. The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ must be satisfied for all points $(x, y)$ within the polygon.
2. The expression on the left side of the equation can only be zero if both factors are zero. This implies that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
3. Each of these equations implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
4. The absolute value equations $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$ define the sides of a square with side length 16.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. For $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy this equation form a square with side length 20 and vertices at $( \pm 10, 0)$ and $(0, \pm 10)$.
2. For $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy this equation form another square with side length 20 and vertices at $(\pm 10, 0)$ and $(0, \pm 10)$.
3. For $\vert x \vert = 8$, the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy this equation form a square with side length 16 and vertices at $(\pm 8, 0)$ and $(0, \pm 8)$.
4. For $\vert y \vert = 8$, the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy this equation form another square with side length 16 and vertices at $(\pm 8, 0)$ and $(0, \pm 8)$.

The intersection of all these squares is a square with side length 16. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points that satisfy the given equation is the area of a square with side length 16, which is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first list the problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge, and thens solve the problem step by step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge are as follows:

1. The equation is equal to zero if and only if both factors are equal to zero.
2. The absolute value function $|x|$ equals $x$ if $x \geq 0$ and $-x$ if $x < 0$.
3. The area of a convex polygon can be determined using the Shoelace formula or by decomposing the polygon into triangles and summing the areas of those triangles.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

First, we set each factor equal to zero and solve for the possible values of $x$ and $y$.

For the first factor:
$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$
This can only be true if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

This means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.
Solving these equations, we get four possible pairs of $(x, y)$: $(5, 5)$, $(5, -5)$, $(-5, 5)$, and $(-5, -5)$.

For the second factor:
$(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
This can only be true if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

This means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

Combining the constraints from the two factors, we find that the possible points $(x, y)$ are $(5, 5)$, $(5, -5)$, $(-5, 5)$, $(-5, -5)$, $(8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, $(-8, 0)$, and $(0, -8)$. These points form a square with side length $10$.

To find the area of the square, we simply square the length of one of its sides. The length of a side of the square is the distance between $(5, 5)$ and $(5, -5)$, which is $10$. Therefore, the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is $\boxed{100}$.
