Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $A \cdot B = 0$ means that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to two sets of equations:
1) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$.
2) $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
3) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$.
4) $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert y \vert = 8$.
From these equations, we can deduce that the polygon is a square with side length $16$. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, notice that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. This means that the equation is satisfied if and only if at least one of the following two equations is satisfied:

1. $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$, or
2. $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

For the first equation, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This means that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two lines parallel to the x-axis and y-axis respectively, which are 10 units away from the origin.

For the second equation, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This means that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two lines parallel to the y-axis and x-axis respectively, which are 8 units away from the origin.

Therefore, the points that satisfy the equation form a square with side length 10, because the lines $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ form a square with side length 10.

The area of this square is side length squared, which is $10^2 = 100$. So the area of this convex polygon is 100 square units. The answer is: $100$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


For the product of two expressions to be zero, one or both of them must be zero. This gives us four cases to consider.

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
3. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
4. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For each case, we have:

1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$. This gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x = 8$, and $x = -8$. These lines form a rectangle.
2. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us the same four lines as in case 1.
3. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$. This gives us four lines: $x - y = 10$, $x - y = -10$, $x = 8$, and $x = -8$. These lines form a rectangle that is the same as the rectangle in case 1.
4. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us the same four lines as in case 3.

Therefore, the points satisfying the given equation enclose a rectangle with side lengths of 16 and 20. The area of the rectangle is $16 \times 20 = 320$.
The answer is: $320$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term equals zero or the second term equals zero.
The first term is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, and this term equals zero if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
The second term is $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2$, and this term equals zero if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The solutions of $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ are the lines $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. The solutions of $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ are the lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
These lines form a square with side length 10, and the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. So the area of the convex polygon is 100.
The answer is: $100$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The equation given in the problem is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. This equation equals zero if either the first term equals zero or the second term equals zero.

The first term equals zero if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two concentric squares with side length 10 units, centered at the origin.

The second term equals zero if $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two squares with side length 16 units, centered at the origin, with one axis aligned to the x-axis and the other axis aligned to the y-axis.

The intersection of these two squares forms a polygon, which is a square with side length 8 units.

The area of a square is given by the square of its side length. So the area of the convex polygon is $8^2 = 64$ square units. The answer is: $64$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ equals to $0$ if and only if at least one of the factors equals to $0$. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies that $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ or $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$. Solving these systems of equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(10,0)$, $(0,10)$, $(-10,0)$, $(0,-10)$.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies that $x = 8$ and $y = 8$ or $x = -8$ and $y = -8$. So we get two more vertices of the polygon: $(8,8)$, $(-8,-8)$.

The polygon has 4 vertices and is a square with side length of $20$. Its area is $20^2 = 400$.
The answer is: $400$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we note that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. This means that either
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$$ or $$((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$
For the first equation to be zero, both terms must be zero:
$$\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$$ and $$\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0.$$
Solving these gives us $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, which simplifies to $x = 10$ and $y = 0$. Similarly, the second equation being zero gives us $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. 

Putting these points on the coordinate plane, we see that they form a square with side length 10. The area of the square is therefore $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's analyze the expression $A = ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$.
The expression $A = 0$ if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This is equivalent to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The first two equations represent two lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ in the coordinate plane, and the second two equations represent two lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$.
These lines enclose a square with side length $10$, since the distance between the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ is $10$ (by considering the point $(0, 10)$), and the distance between the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$ is also $10$ (by considering the point $(8, 0)$).
The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: 100
The answer is: $100$
