Approach:



We are given the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. We want to find how many positive integers $m$ makes the equation have $4$ distinct solutions.

First, let's consider the right side of the equation $\frac{m}{100}$. Since $m$ is a positive integer, $\frac{m}{100}$ is a positive fraction.

The left side of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a modulus function of a modulus function. Its value will be a non-negative number.

For the equation to have $4$ distinct solutions, the right side must be equal to the value of the left side at $4$ different points. This implies that $\frac{m}{100}$ must be between $0$ and $2$ (the range of the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$), and the distance between these $4$ points must be $\frac{1}{100}$.

The distance between the minimum and maximum value of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ in the interval $[0, 2]$ is $2$, so the $4$ points must be distributed in this interval with a distance of $\frac{1}{100}$ between each point. This means there are $3$ intervals of length $\frac{1}{100}$ in the interval $[0, 2]$.

The sum of the lengths of these $3$ intervals is $3*\frac{1}{100}=\frac{3}{100}$.

Since the right side $\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal to the value of the left side at these $4$ points, we can say $\frac{m}{100}=\frac{3}{100}$.

Solving for $m$ gives us $m=3$. Therefore, there is only $1$ positive integer $m$ that makes the equation have $4$ distinct solutions. The answer is: 1

Assistant:

Approach:


The equation $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions implies that the right hand side is strictly greater than $2$. This is because if $\frac{m}{100} \leq 2$, the equation would have at most $3$ distinct solutions. So we must have $\frac{m}{100} > 2$, which implies $m > 200$.

Now we want to find how many positive integers $m$ are greater than $200$ and at the same time $\frac{m}{100}$ is an integer. This is equivalent to finding how many positive multiples of $100$ are greater than $200$.

Solution:
The positive multiples of $100$ greater than $200$ are $300, 400, 500, \ldots$. To count the number of such multiples, we can find how many such numbers are in the form $100n$, where $n$ is a positive integer and $100n > 200$. This gives $n > 2$, so the smallest integer $n$ is $3$. Therefore, the number of such multiples is equal to the number of positive integers greater than $2$, which is infinite. However, we are asked to find the number of positive integers $m$, not $n$. To convert from $n$ to $m$, we can simply multiply each value of $n$ by $100$, so the corresponding values of $m$ are $300, 400, 500, \ldots$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the given conditions is infinite. The answer is: $\boxed{\infty}$.

The problem asks us to find the number of positive integer values for $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

To solve this problem, we need to consider the possible values of $\frac{m}{100}$ and the number of solutions each value gives to the equation.

1. If $\frac{m}{100} < 2$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have $2$ solutions.
2. If $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=2/100=0.02$ will have $4$ solutions.
3. If $\frac{m}{100} > 2$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have more than $4$ solutions.

So, the only value of $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $m=200$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $1$.

So, the solution is $\boxed{1}$.

This means that there is only one positive integer value for $m$ (which is $200$) for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

The answer is: $1$

Approach:



1. To find the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions, we first need to understand the nature of the solutions for a given $m$.
2. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is a piecewise function with $4$ cases based on the absolute value signs. We need to consider each case and analyze the number of solutions.
3. After analyzing the number of solutions for each case, we can determine the range of $m$ that gives $4$ distinct solutions.
4. Once we have the range of $m$, we can count the number of positive integers in that range to find the value of $m$ that satisfies the given condition.

The detailed steps for each case are as follows:

Case 1: $|x-1| - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$
Solving this equation gives $|x-1| = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.
This gives two sub-cases:
Case 1a: $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.
Case 1b: $-(x-1) = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Case 2: $-(|x-1| - 2) = \frac{m}{100}$
Solving this equation gives $|x-1| = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
This gives two sub-cases:
Case 2a: $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
Case 2b: $-(x-1) = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

By analyzing these cases, we can see that the equation has 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is between $1$ and $2$. This means $100 < m < 200$. The positive integers in this range are from $101$ to $199$, inclusive. To find the number of these integers, we subtract the smallest integer from the largest and then add 1. So, the number of positive integers $m$ is $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$.

So the answer is $\boxed{99}$. The Python script to calculate this would be:
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def number_of_m():
    return 199 - 101 + 1

result = number_of_m()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 99

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
99
```
Hence, the number of positive integers $m$ is $99$. The answer is: $\boxed{99}$

To find the value of $m$, we need to understand the properties of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ and the number of distinct solutions it can have.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is a piecewise function with four cases depending on the value of $x$. We can analyze each case and find the number of distinct solutions for each case.

1. If $\frac{m}{100} < 1$, there are no solutions, as the absolute value of any real number cannot be negative.

2. If $1 \leq \frac{m}{100} < 3$, there are two distinct solutions, as the absolute value of a quantity can be equal to a positive number in two ways: once by making the quantity positive, and once by making it negative.

3. If $\frac{m}{100} = 3$, there are three distinct solutions, as the absolute value of a quantity can be equal to $3$ in three ways: once by making the quantity $3$, once by making it $-3$, and once by making it $0$.

4. If $\frac{m}{100} > 3$, there are four distinct solutions, as the absolute value of a quantity can be equal to a positive number in two ways: once by making the quantity positive, and once by making it negative. Each of these can happen twice, once for the absolute value inside to equal $2+\frac{m}{100}$, and once for it to equal $2-\frac{m}{100}$.

Since the equation has $4$ distinct solutions, we need $\frac{m}{100} > 3$.

To find the value of $m$, we set $\frac{m}{100} = 3$, which gives $m = 300$.

Therefore, the positive integer $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $300$. The answer is: 300

Approach:

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is a problem that involves absolute value and is a bit tricky to solve algebraically. Instead, we can reason about the properties of absolute value to find the number of solutions for different values of $m$.

The expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ equals to a non-negative value. Therefore, the right hand side of the equation, which is $\frac{m}{100}$, must also be a non-negative value. This implies that $m \ge 0$. Also, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be less than $2$ because $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert \le 2$. This gives us $m \le 200$.

Next, we note that the expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ changes its shape at $x = 1 \pm 2$, which are $x = 3$ and $x = -1$. Therefore, we need to consider the intervals $(-\infty, -1)$, $[-1, 3)$, and $[3, \infty)$ separately.

In the interval $(-\infty, -1)$, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ becomes $\vert -(x-1) -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\vert -x+1 -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, then $\vert -x -1 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, and finally $\vert x+1 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. This equation has two solutions in the interval $(-\infty, -1)$ if and only if $\frac{m}{100} > 1$, i.e., $m > 100$.

In the interval $[-1, 3)$, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ becomes $\vert x-1 -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\vert x-3 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. This equation has two solutions in the interval $[-1, 3)$ if and only if $2 - \frac{m}{100} > 0$, i.e., $m < 200$.

In the interval $[3, \infty)$, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ becomes $\vert x-1 -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\vert x-3 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. This equation has two solutions in the interval $[3, \infty)$ if and only if $\frac{m}{100} < 1$, i.e., $m < 100$.

Combining all these results, we find that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $100 < m < 200$. Since $m$ is an integer, the number of such $m$ is $200 - 100 - 1 = 99$.

So the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ having 4 distinct solutions is 99. The answer is: $99$

Approach:


We are looking for the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has exactly 4 distinct solutions. This equation can be analyzed by considering the number of changes in the slope of the piecewise linear function defined by the left-hand side of the equation. The left-hand side of the equation is a "V" shape function with two "knees" at $x=1\pm2$, that is, at $x=-1$ and $x=3$. The right-hand side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, is a horizontal line that we can adjust its position to count the number of changes in the slope of the left-hand side function.

The number of changes in the slope of the left-hand side function is equal to the number of times it intersects the horizontal line $\frac{m}{100}$. Since the left-hand side function has a "V" shape with two "knees", it intersects the horizontal line exactly 4 times if and only if the line is between the two knees, that is, if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 0 and 2 (since the "amplitude" of the "V" shape is 2). Therefore, we have $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which implies $0 < m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ in this interval are exactly the integers from 1 to 199, of which there are 199. But we must exclude the case where the left-hand side function has only 3 changes in the slope (which occurs when the horizontal line is tangent to one of the knees or coincides with one of the knees). There are 2 such cases, namely when $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to 0 or 2. Therefore, we must subtract 2 from the total number of positive integers $m$, which gives $199 - 2 = 197$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has exactly 4 distinct solutions is 197.

The answer is: $197$

Assistant:

Approach:


We first note that the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a piecewise expression:

\[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=
\begin{cases} 
2-x & \text{if } x \le 1 \\
-(x-1)-2 & \text{if } 1 < x \le 3 \\
x-3 & \text{if } x > 3
\end{cases}\]

The function equals $\frac{m}{100}$ four times, so we can draw its graph and the graph of $y=\frac{m}{100}$. The intersections will give us the values of $m$ we want.

For the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ to have four distinct solutions, the graph of $y=\frac{m}{100}$ must intersect the function at four different points.

We can see that this happens when $\frac{1}{100} \le \frac{m}{100} \le \frac{2}{100}$.

To find the corresponding values of $m$, we multiply by $100$ and get $1 \le m \le 2$. 

However, $m$ must be a positive integer. So the only value of $m$ that satisfies the inequality is $m=2$.

Therefore, there is only $1$ value of $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions.

The value of $m$ is $2$. The answer is: $1$

We are looking for the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. 

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is equivalent to the following two cases:

1. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$.
2. $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = \frac{m}{100}$.

We can solve each of these cases separately to find the values of $m$ that give $4$ distinct solutions.

For case 1, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. The solutions to this equation are $x = 1 \pm (2 + \frac{m}{100})$. 

For case 2, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. The solutions to this equation are $x = 1 \pm (2 - \frac{m}{100})$.

For these solutions to be distinct, we require that $2 + \frac{m}{100} > 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ which simplifies to $m < 100$. 

Also, for these solutions to be real, we require that $2 + \frac{m}{100} > 0$ and $2 - \frac{m}{100} > 0$, which simplify to $m < 200$.

Therefore, the possible values of $m$ are the positive integers from $1$ to $100$.

However, we are looking for the number of positive integers $m$ for which the original equation has $4$ distinct solutions. By checking each value of $m$ from $1$ to $100$, we find that there are exactly $10$ values of $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions.

These values are $1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17,$ and $19$.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $10$.
The answer is: $10$

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. The right-hand side, $\frac{m}{100}$, is positive, so $m$ must be positive. Also, for the absolute value function, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=k$ (where $k \geq 0$) has four distinct solutions if and only if $0 \leq k < 1$. 

So we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $0 \leq \frac{m}{100} < 1$. This simplifies to $0 \leq m < 100$. 

Therefore, the number of such positive integers $m$ is $100$.

The Python code to solve this problem would be:

```python

To have 4 distinct solutions for the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, we need to consider the cases where the expression on the left side changes its shape twice. This happens when the right side $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $2$ and $1$.

1. When $\frac{m}{100}=2$, we have $m=200$.
2. When $\frac{m}{100}=1$, we have $m=100$.

Therefore, the possible values of $m$ are $100$ and $200$. But the problem asks for how many positive integers $m$ satisfy this condition, so we need to count these two values.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ is $2$.

Here is the Python code to find the solution:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def count_positive_integers():
    m_values = [100, 200]

Approach:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. Let's analyze the piecewise function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$:

1. When $\vert x-1 \vert -2 > 0$, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. The solutions to this equation are $x = 1 + 2 + \frac{m}{100} = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = 1 - 2 - \frac{m}{100} = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.
2. When $\vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0$, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. The solutions to this equation are $x = 1 + 2 - \frac{m}{100} = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = 1 - 2 + \frac{m}{100} = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

For the equation to have $4$ distinct solutions, the two solutions from the first case ($3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $-1 - \frac{m}{100}$) must be different from the two solutions from the second case ($3 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $-1 + \frac{m}{100}$). This means that $\frac{m}{100} > 2$, or $m > 200$.

On the other hand, the absolute value of the right-hand side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be less than $2$ for the equation to make sense. This means that $\frac{m}{100} < 2$, or $m < 200$.

Combining the two conditions, we have $200 > m > 200$, which is a contradiction. Therefore, there is no positive integer $m$ that makes the equation have $4$ distinct solutions.
However, we have made an error in our analysis. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ implies that $\frac{m}{100} > 0$, which means $m > 0$. So the condition for $m$ is $0 < m < 200$.
Under this condition, the two solutions from the first case will never be equal to the two solutions from the second case.
Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is the number of positive integers in the range $0 < m < 200$.
This is $199$, so the number of positive integers $m$ that make the equation have $4$ distinct solutions is $199$. The answer is: $199$

We are looking for the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. This equation is a piecewise function with 4 cases, depending on the value of $x$. For each case, we need to find the value of $x$ that satisfies the equation. Then, we count the number of positive integers $m$ that correspond to each case.

Let's start by looking at the piecewise function:

1. If $x - 1 \geq 2$, then the equation becomes $\vert x - 3 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$.
2. If $1 \leq x - 1 < 2$, then the equation becomes $\vert x - 1 - 2 \vert = \vert x - 3 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$.
3. If $x - 1 < 1$, then the equation becomes $\vert - (x - 1) - 2 \vert = \vert -x + 3 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$.

For each case, we need to find the value of $x$ that satisfies the equation. Then, we count the number of positive integers $m$ that correspond to each case.

1. In the first case, $x - 3 = \pm \frac{m}{100}$, which gives us $x = 3 \pm \frac{m}{100}$. For this equation to have 4 distinct solutions, we need the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ to be less than 2. This gives us $0 < m < 200$.

2. In the second case, $x - 1 - 2 = \pm \frac{m}{100}$, which gives us $x = 3 \pm \frac{m}{100}$. This case has the same solutions as the first case, so we still have $0 < m < 200$.

3. In the third case, $-x + 3 = \pm \frac{m}{100}$, which gives us $x = 3 \mp \frac{m}{100}$. For this equation to have 4 distinct solutions, we need the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ to be greater than 2. This gives us $200 < m < 400$.

Now, we count the number of positive integers $m$ that correspond to each case. For the first and second cases, we have $m$ in the range $1 < m < 200$. The number of positive integers in this range is $199$. For the third case, we have $m$ in the range $200 < m < 400$. The number of positive integers in this range is also $199$.

Therefore, the total number of positive integers $m$ that correspond to the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ having 4 distinct solutions is $199$.
The answer is: $199$.

Approach:


We start by analyzing the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.
We know that the absolute value function $\vert x \vert$ is piecewise defined as follows:
\[\vert x \vert = \begin{cases} 
x & \text{if } x \geq 0 \\
-x & \text{if } x < 0 
\end{cases}\]
Applying this to the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, we can split it into two cases:

Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$.
Solving this equation for $x$, we get $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. 
Again applying the absolute value definition, we get two sub-cases:

Sub-case 1.1: $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100} \implies x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.
Sub-case 1.2: $x-1 = -2 - \frac{m}{100} \implies x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Case 2: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.
Solving this equation for $x$, we get $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
Applying the absolute value definition again, we get two sub-cases:

Sub-case 2.1: $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100} \implies x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
Sub-case 2.2: $x-1 = -2 + \frac{m}{100} \implies x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

In summary, we have obtained 4 distinct solutions for the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$:
\[x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}, x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}, x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}, x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}.\]

For these solutions to be distinct, the values of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be different. 
This means that the values of $m$ must be different multiples of 100. 
Since we want $m$ to be a positive integer, the possible values of $m$ are the first four positive multiples of 100. 
Therefore, the only possible value of $m$ is 100.

The value of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 100.
The answer is: $1$
