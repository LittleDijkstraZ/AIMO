Certainly! let's derive the algebraic expression step by step:



The equation given is:
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0\]
The product of two numbers is zero if and only if either one of them is zero. Therefore, we have two separate cases:
Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. In this case, both terms must be zero, so $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm10$ and $x - y = \pm10$. Adding these two equations gives $2x = \pm20$, so $x = \pm10$. Subtracting these two equations gives $2y = \pm20$, so $y = \pm10$. Thus, the four points are $(10, 10), (10, -10), (-10, 10),$ and $(-10, -10)$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. In this case, both terms must be zero, so $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm8$ and $y = \pm8$. The four points are $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8),$ and $(-8, -8)$.

By plotting these points, we see that they form a square with side length $20$. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 400 square units.
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    # The side length of the square is 20 (the sum of the absolute values of the coordinates)
    side_length = 20

    # The area of the square is the side length squared
    area = side_length**2

    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 400

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output

```
The area of the convex polygon is $400$ square units. The answer is $\boxed{400}$.

Certainly! let's derive the algebraic expression step by step:



The equation given is: $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$

The product of two factors equals zero if and only if one or both of the factors equals zero. So, we have two cases:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the square as $(0,10)$, $(0,-10)$, $(10,0)$, and $(-10,0)$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
This implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the square as $(8,0)$, $(-8,0)$, $(0,8)$, and $(0,-8)$.

Now, we plot these points on a graph and connect them to form the convex polygon. The polygon is a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

The answer is: $100$.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Certainly! let's derive the algebraic expression step by step:



The expression $A \cdot B = 0$ is true if and only if $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. So in our case, one of the following must be true:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first equation to be true, both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$, which simplifies to $x = y = 5$ or $x = -y = 5$. So these are two points: $(5, 5)$ and $(5, -5)$.

For the second equation to be true, both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us the points $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

So the four points are: $(5, 5)$, $(5, -5)$, $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, and $(-8, -8)$. These points form a square with side length $10$, the area of which is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

Certainly! let's derive the algebraic expression step by step:



If the product of two real numbers is zero, then at least one of the numbers must be zero. So, we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. In this case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. In this case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

For Case 1, we have $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get four points: $(5, 5)$, $(-5, 5)$, $(5, -5)$, and $(-5, -5)$.
For Case 2, we have $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations, we get four more points: $(8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

So, the eight points are: $(5, 5)$, $(-5, 5)$, $(5, -5)$, $(-5, -5)$, $(8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.
These eight points enclose a square with side length $10$. Therefore, the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$.

The answer is: $100$

The given equation is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This equation implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these equations are all points on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, and their reflections across the axes.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This equation implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are all points on a square with side length 16 centered at the origin.

The intersection of the solutions to these two cases forms a square with side length 10 (the smaller square inscribed in the larger square). The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units.

Here is a Python code to compute the area of the square:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def square_area():
    side_length = 10
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = square_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 100

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
100
```
The answer is $\boxed{100}$.
