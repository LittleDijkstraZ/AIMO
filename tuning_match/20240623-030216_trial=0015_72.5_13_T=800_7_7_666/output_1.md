Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To begin with, we note that the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is equivalent to $|x-2y| = |2x-y|$.
This can be further simplified as $(x-2y) = \pm (2x-y)$, or equivalently, $x-2y = 2x-y$ or $x-2y = -(2x-y)$.
Solving these equations, we get $x=y$ or $x=-y$.
Now, we substitute these into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.
If $x=y$, we get $5x^2+5x^2-8x^2 = 2x^2$.
If $x=-y$, we get $5x^2+5(-x)^2-8x(-x) = 5x^2+5x^2+8x^2 = 18x^2$.
Thus, the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ simplifies to either $2x^2$ or $18x^2$.
Since we want the minimum value, we choose the smaller one, which is $2x^2$.
Now, we have to find the minimum value of $2x^2$ subject to the condition $|x-2x| + |2x-x| = 40$, or $|x-2x| + |x| = 40$, or $|x| + |x| = 40$, or $2|x| = 40$, or $|x| = 20$.
This means $x = \pm 20$.
Substituting $x = 20$ into $2x^2$, we get $2(20)^2 = 800$.
Hence, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 800. The answer is: $800$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we note that $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|2x - y| + |2y - x| = 40$. 
Using the property $|a| + |b| = |a+b| + |a-b|$, we can simplify this to $|2x - y - (2y - x)| + |2x - y + (2y - x)| = 40$, which simplifies to $|x - 3y| + |3x - y| = 40$. 
Now, consider the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = \frac{16}{5}(x^2 - 2xy + y^2) + \frac{9}{5}(x^2 - 2xy + y^2) = \frac{16}{5}(x-y)^2 + \frac{9}{5}(x-y)^2 = \frac{25}{5}(x-y)^2 = 5(x-y)^2$. 
Since $|x - 3y| + |3x - y| = 40$ holds for all real $x$ and $y$, $5(x-y)^2$ is minimized when $(x-3y)(3x-y) = 0$. 
This gives us two possibilities: $x - 3y = 0$ or $3x - y = 0$. 
If $x - 3y = 0$, then $x = 3y$. Substituting into the equation $|x - 3y| + |3x - y| = 40$, we get $|0| + |8y| = 40$, which gives $|8y| = 40$. This implies $y = \pm5$, and so $x = 15$ or $x = -15$. 
If $3x - y = 0$, then $y = 3x$. Substituting into the equation $|x - 3y| + |3x - y| = 40$, we get $|2x| + |4x| = 40$, which implies $|6x| = 40$. This implies $x = \pm\frac{20}{3}$, and so $y = \pm 20$. 
In all cases, we find that the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is achieved when $(x, y) = (15, 5)$ or $(x, y) = (-15, -5)$ or $(x, y) = \left(\frac{20}{3}, 20\right)$ or $(x, y) = \left(-\frac{20}{3}, -20\right)$. 
We calculate the value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ in each case:
When $(x, y) = (15, 5)$, the value is $5(15^2) + 5(5^2) - 8(15)(5) = 1125 + 125 - 600 = 750$.
When $(x, y) = (-15, -5)$, the value is $5(-15^2) + 5(-5^2) - 8(-15)(-5) = -1125 - 125 + 600 = -750$.
When $(x, y) = \left(\frac{20}{3}, 20\right)$, the value is $5\left(\frac{20}{3}\right)^2 + 5(20^2) - 8\left(\frac{20}{3}\right)(20) = \frac{2000}{3} + 2000 - \frac{3200}{3} = 0$.
When $(x, y) = \left(-\frac{20}{3}, -20\right)$, the value is $5\left(-\frac{20}{3}\right)^2 + 5(-20^2) - 8\left(-\frac{20}{3}\right)(-20) = \frac{2000}{3} + 2000 - \frac{3200}{3} = 0$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is 0. The answer is: $\boxed{0}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We start by expressing the function $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as a square:
\begin{align*}
5x^2+5y^2-8xy &= 4x^2+4y^2-8xy+x^2+y^2 \\
&= (2x-y)^2 + (x-2y)^2.
\end{align*}
Since $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we know that $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2 = 40^2 = 1600$.
By the triangle inequality, we have
\[|(x-2y) - (y-2x)| \leq |x-2y| + |y-2x|,\]
which simplifies to $|x-3y| \leq 40$.
Therefore, we know that $(x-3y)^2 \leq 1600$.
Expanding $(x-3y)^2$, we have
\[x^2 - 6xy + 9y^2 \leq 1600.\]
We can express $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ in terms of $(x-3y)^2$:
\begin{align*}
5x^2+5y^2-8xy &= 4(x^2-6xy+9y^2) - 3(x^2 - 6xy + 9y^2) \\
&= (4-3)(x^2 - 6xy + 9y^2) \\
&= x^2 - 6xy + 9y^2.
\end{align*}
We want to minimize $x^2 - 6xy + 9y^2$, which is equivalent to minimizing $(x-3y)^2$.
By the inequality $(x-3y)^2 \leq 1600$, the minimum value of $(x-3y)^2$ is 0 when $x=3y$.
Substituting $x=3y$ into the equation $|x-3y| \leq 40$, we get $|2y| \leq 40$, which simplifies to $-40 \leq 2y \leq 40$.
Dividing by 2, we have $-20 \leq y \leq 20$.
Then, $x=3y$ gives $-60 \leq x \leq 60$.
Therefore, when $(x,y)$ is in the range of $[-60,60] \times [-20,20]$, we have $(x-3y)^2 = 0$, and thus the minimum value of $x^2 - 6xy + 9y^2$ is 0.
Hence, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0. The answer is: $0$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To start with, let's denote $a = x - 2y$ and $b = y - 2x$. According to the problem, $|a| + |b| = 40$. 

By the triangle inequality, we have $|a| + |b| \geq |a + b|$. So $|a + b| \leq 40$. 

On the other hand, $a + b = (x - 2y) + (y - 2x) = -x - y$, so $|a + b| = |-x - y| = |-(x + y)| = |x + y|$. 

Thus, we have $|x + y| \leq 40$. 

Now, let's look at the expression we want to minimize, $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$. We can rewrite it as $\frac{1}{2} [(5x^2 - 8xy + 5y^2) + (5x^2 - 8xy + 5y^2)] = \frac{1}{2} [(5x - 4y)^2 + (4x - 5y)^2]$.

By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have
\[[(5x - 4y)^2 + (4x - 5y)^2] \geq (5x - 4y + 4x - 5y)^2 = (9x - 9y)^2 = 81(x - y)^2.\]

So $\frac{1}{2} [(5x - 4y)^2 + (4x - 5y)^2] \geq \frac{81}{2} (x - y)^2$.

Now, we know that $|x + y| \leq 40$, which means $-40 \leq x + y \leq 40$. Therefore, $-(x + y) \geq -40$, and $-(x - y) = -x + y \leq 40$. So $(x - y)^2 \leq 1600$.

Substituting this into our inequality, we get $\frac{81}{2} (x - y)^2 \geq \frac{81}{2} \cdot 1600 = 64800$. 

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is 64800. The answer is: 64800.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


Using the property $|a| + |b| = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + 2ab}$, we have
\[|x-2y| + |y-2x| = \sqrt{(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2 + 2(x-2y)(y-2x)} = 40.\]
Expanding, we get
\[(x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2) + (y^2 - 4xy + 4x^2) + 2(x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2) = 1600.\]
Simplifying, we get
\[10(x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2) = 1600,\]
\[x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2 = \frac{1600}{10} = 160.\]
Now, let's find the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$. Using the result from above, we have
\[5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = 5(x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2) = 5 \cdot 160 = 800.\]
So the minimum value is 800. The answer is: $\boxed{800}$.

## QUESTION 1 - 5

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


Let $z = x - 2y$ and $w = y - 2x$. Then $|z| + |w| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, $|z| + |w| \ge |z + w|$. So $|z + w| \le 40$.
Since $z + w = x - 2y + y - 2x = -x - y$, we have $| - x - y| \le 40$.
This is equivalent to $|x + y| \le 40$.
Now, we want to minimize the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$.
We can rewrite this as $5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy$.
We know that $(x + y)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + 2xy$.
So, $x^2 + y^2 = (x + y)^2 - 2xy$.
Substituting this into the expression, we get $5((x + y)^2 - 2xy) - 8xy$.
Simplifying, we have $5(x + y)^2 - 18xy$.
We want to minimize this expression given that $|x + y| \le 40$.
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we know that $(a^2 + b^2)(c^2 + d^2) \ge (ac + bd)^2$ for all real numbers $a, b, c, d$.
Setting $a = x$, $b = y$, $c = 1$, and $d = -1$, we have $(x^2 + y^2)(1^2 + (-1)^2) \ge (x - y)^2$.
So, $2(x^2 + y^2) \ge (x - y)^2$.
Substituting $x^2 + y^2 = (x + y)^2 - 2xy$, we get $2((x + y)^2 - 2xy) \ge (x - y)^2$.
Simplifying, we have $2(x + y)^2 - 4xy \ge (x - y)^2$.
Since $|x + y| \le 40$, we know that $(x + y)^2 \le 1600$.
So, $2(x + y)^2 - 4xy \ge 0$, which means $5(x + y)^2 - 18xy \ge -800$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is $-800$.
The value of the expression is $-800$. The answer is: $-800$
