Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's simplify the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
We know that $|a| = |-a|$ and $|a-b| = |b-a|$, so we can rewrite the equation as $|x-2y| + |2x-y| = 40$.
Now, we consider two cases:
Case 1: If $x - 2y \geq 0$ and $2x - y \geq 0$, then the equation becomes $x - 2y + 2x - y = 40$, which simplifies to $3x - 3y = 40$, or $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$.
Case 2: If $x - 2y < 0$ and $2x - y < 0$, then the equation becomes $-(x - 2y) - (2x - y) = 40$, which simplifies to $-x + 2y - 2x + y = 40$, or $-3x + 3y = 40$, or $x - y = -\frac{40}{3}$.
In both cases, we have $x - y = \pm \frac{40}{3}$.
Now, we substitute $x = y + \frac{40}{3}$ into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$:
\begin{align*}
5(y + \frac{40}{3})^2 + 5y^2 - 8y(y + \frac{40}{3}) &= 5(y^2 + \frac{80y}{3} + \frac{1600}{9}) + 5y^2 - 8y^2 - \frac{320y}{3} \\
&= 5y^2 + \frac{400y}{3} + \frac{8000}{9} + 5y^2 - 8y^2 - \frac{320y}{3} \\
&= 2y^2 - \frac{80y}{3} + \frac{8000}{9}.
\end{align*}
Now, let's consider the expression $2y^2 - \frac{80y}{3} + \frac{8000}{9}$.
This is a quadratic expression in terms of $y$, and its graph is a parabola opening upwards.
Therefore, its minimum value occurs at the vertex of the parabola.
The $y$-coordinate of the vertex of a parabola $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ is given by $-\frac{b}{2a}$.
In this case, $a = 2$ and $b = -\frac{80}{3}$, so the $y$-coordinate of the vertex is $-\frac{-\frac{80}{3}}{2 \cdot 2} = \frac{20}{3}$.
Substituting this value back into the expression gives the minimum value:
\[2(\frac{20}{3})^2 - \frac{80}{3} \cdot \frac{20}{3} + \frac{8000}{9} = \frac{800}{9} - \frac{1600}{9} + \frac{8000}{9} = \frac{6400}{9}.\]
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ satisfy the given equation is $\frac{6400}{9}$.
The answer is: $\frac{6400}{9}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's simplify the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
We can rewrite this as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$.
Using the property $|a| = |-a|$, we can further simplify this to $|x-2y| + |-x+2y| = 40$.
This can be further simplified to $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$, we know that $|x-2y| + |2y-x| \geq |(x-2y) + (2y-x)| = |0| = 0$.
So, the minimum value of $|x-2y| + |y-2x|$ is 0.
Now, let's go back to the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.
We can rewrite this as $5(x^2+y^2)-8xy$.
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we know that $(x^2+y^2)^2 \geq (x+y)^2(x-y)^2$.
Since $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40 = 0$, we know that $x = 2y$ or $y = 2x$.
If $x = 2y$, then $x^2+y^2 = 5y^2$, and $-8xy = -16y^2$.
If $y = 2x$, then $x^2+y^2 = 5x^2$, and $-8xy = -16x^2$.
In either case, we have $5(x^2+y^2)-8xy = 5(5x^2)-8(2x)^2 = 25x^2-32x^2 = -7x^2$.
Since $x^2$ is always non-negative, $-7x^2$ is always non-positive.
So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $-7x^2$.
But we also know that the minimum value of $|x-2y| + |y-2x|$ is 0.
So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $-7x^2$.
However, since we don't have a specific value of $x$ or $y$, we cannot find a numerical value for $-7x^2$.
But we know that $-7x^2$ is always non-positive, so the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0.
The answer is: 0

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2$.
Now, we are given that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, we know that $|a+b| \leq |a| + |b|$ for all real numbers $a$ and $b$.
So, we can rewrite the given equation as $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |(x-2y) + (y-2x)| = |x - 2y + y - 2x| = |-x - y| = |-(x+y)| = |x+y| = 40$.
Now, we want to minimize the value of $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2$ subject to the constraint $|x+y| = 40$.
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have $(x^2 + y^2) + ((2y)^2 + (2x)^2) \geq (x*2y + y*2x)^2 = (2xy + 2xy)^2 = (4xy)^2 = 16x^2y^2$.
Thus, $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2 = (x^2 + y^2) + ((2y)^2 + (2x)^2) - 8xy \geq 16x^2y^2 - 8xy$.
By AM-GM inequality, we have $16x^2y^2 - 8xy = 16x^2y^2 - 2*4xy \geq 2\sqrt{(16x^2y^2)*(4xy)} - 2*4xy = 2*4xy - 2*4xy = 0$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2$ is 0.
However, this minimum value does not satisfy the constraint $|x+y| = 40$.
The correct minimum value is achieved when $x = 20$ and $y = -20$, and we can check that this point satisfies the constraint.
Substituting these values, we find that the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $5(20)^2 + 5(-20)^2 - 8(20)(-20) = 2000 + 2000 + 3200 = 7200$. The answer is: $\boxed{7200}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We first note that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$.
Since $|a| = |-a|$, we have $|x-2y| = |2y-x|$, so we can remove the absolute values and get $x - 2y + 2y - x = 40$.
This simplifies to $0 = 40$, which is not true.
However, we made a mistake in our reasoning.
When we have $|a| = |-a|$, we know that $a$ and $-a$ are equal distances from 0 on the number line.
But in this case, we have $|x-2y| = |2y-x|$, which means $x - 2y$ and $2y - x$ are equal distances from 0 on the number line.
This implies $x - 2y = 2y - x$, so we get $2x = 4y$ or $x = 2y$.
Now we can substitute $x = 2y$ into the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ to get $|2y-2y| + |y-4y| = 40$, which simplifies to $0 + |-3y| = 40$, or $|-3y| = 40$.
Since the absolute value of a number is always non-negative, we have $-3y = \pm 40$.
If $-3y = 40$, then $y = -\frac{40}{3}$.
If $-3y = -40$, then $y = \frac{40}{3}$.
Now we substitute $y = -\frac{40}{3}$ into $x = 2y$ to get $x = 2(-\frac{40}{3}) = -\frac{80}{3}$.
And we substitute $y = \frac{40}{3}$ into $x = 2y$ to get $x = 2(\frac{40}{3}) = \frac{80}{3}$.
So we have two pairs of $(x, y)$ that satisfy the given condition, which are $(-\frac{80}{3}, -\frac{40}{3})$ and $(\frac{80}{3}, \frac{40}{3})$.
Now we substitute these pairs into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ to find the minimum value.
For $(-\frac{80}{3}, -\frac{40}{3})$, we get
\[5(-\frac{80}{3})^2 + 5(-\frac{40}{3})^2 - 8(-\frac{80}{3})(-\frac{40}{3}) = \frac{6400}{3}.\]
For $(\frac{80}{3}, \frac{40}{3})$, we get
\[5(\frac{80}{3})^2 + 5(\frac{40}{3})^2 - 8(\frac{80}{3})(\frac{40}{3}) = \frac{6400}{3}.\]
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is $\frac{6400}{3}$. The answer is: $\boxed{\frac{6400}{3}}$

## QUESTION 1 - 4

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


Let $A = x - 2y$ and $B = y - 2x$. Then we have the system of equations:
\begin{align*}
|A| + |B| &= 40, \\
A + B &= x - 2y + y - 2x = -x - y.
\end{align*}
From the first equation, we know that $|A| + |B|$ is always nonnegative, so $A$ and $B$ must have the same sign. Therefore, either both $A$ and $B$ are nonnegative or both are nonpositive.

If $A$ and $B$ are both nonnegative, then $A + B = -x - y \ge 0$, which implies $x + y \le 0$.
If $A$ and $B$ are both nonpositive, then $A + B = -x - y \le 0$, which implies $x + y \ge 0$.

In either case, we have $x + y = 0$. Then $y = -x$, and we substitute into the equation $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$:
\[|x + 2x| + |-x - 2x| = 40.\]
Simplifying, we get $|3x| + |-3x| = 40$, or $6|x| = 40$, so $|x| = \frac{20}{3}$.

Thus, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ occurs when $x = -\frac{20}{3}$ and $y = \frac{20}{3}$. We substitute these values into the expression:
\[5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = 5\left(-\frac{20}{3}\right)^2 + 5\left(\frac{20}{3}\right)^2 - 8\left(-\frac{20}{3}\right)\left(\frac{20}{3}\right).\]
Simplifying, we get
\[5\left(\frac{400}{9}\right) + 5\left(\frac{400}{9}\right) - 8\left(-\frac{400}{9}\right) = \frac{2000}{9} + \frac{2000}{9} + \frac{3200}{9} = \frac{7200}{9} = 800.\]
The minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is therefore 800. The answer is: $800$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's solve the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
We can split this into two cases:
Case 1: $x-2y \ge 0$ and $y-2x \ge 0$. In this case, the equation becomes $x - 2y + y - 2x = 40$, which simplifies to $-x - y = 40$.
Case 2: $x-2y < 0$ and $y-2x < 0$. In this case, the equation becomes $-(x-2y) - (y-2x) = 40$, which simplifies to $-x + 2y - y + 2x = 40$, or $x + y = 40$.
Now, let's consider the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite this as $5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy$. We know that $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2 \ge 0$, which expands to $x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2 + y^2 - 4xy + 4x^2 \ge 0$, or $5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy \ge 0$. So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0. However, we need to find the minimum value under the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
From the two cases we found earlier, we know that $x + y = 40$ or $-x - y = 40$. Substituting $y = 40 - x$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get $5x^2 + 5(40 - x)^2 - 8x(40 - x)$.
This simplifies to $5x^2 + 5(1600 - 80x + x^2) - 320x + 8x^2$, or $5x^2 + 8000 - 400x + 5x^2 - 320x + 8x^2$, which simplifies further to $18x^2 - 720x + 8000$.
To find the minimum value of this expression, we can take the derivative with respect to $x$ and set it equal to 0: $36x - 720 = 0$, which gives $x = 20$.
Substituting $x = 20$ back into $y = 40 - x$, we get $y = 20$.
So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is achieved when $x = 20$ and $y = 20$.
Substituting these values into the expression, we get $5(20)^2 + 5(20)^2 - 8(20)(20) = 2000 + 2000 - 3200 = 800$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 800. The answer is: $\boxed{800}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we rewrite the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ as $|2x-y| + |2y-x| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, we know that $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$, so we have $|2x-y| + |2y-x| \geq |(2x-y) + (2y-x)| = |x| = 40$.
This implies that $|x| = 40$, so $x = \pm 40$.
Without loss of generality, we can set $x = 40$ (since the expression is symmetric in $x$ and $y$), and substitute into the equation $|2x-y| + |2y-x| = 40$, we get $|2(40)-y| + |2y-40| = 40$.
Simplifying this, we have $|80-y| + |2y-40| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality again, we know that $|a| + |b| = |a-b|$, so we have $|80-y| + |2y-40| = |(80-y) - (2y-40)| = |80-y-2y+40| = |120-3y| = 40$.
This implies that $|120-3y| = 40$, so $120-3y = \pm 40$.
If $120-3y = 40$, then $3y = 80$, so $y = \frac{80}{3}$.
If $120-3y = -40$, then $3y = 160$, but this is not possible since $y$ is a real number.
Therefore, the only solution is $x = 40$ and $y = \frac{80}{3}$.
Now, we substitute these values into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get $5(40)^2 + 5\left(\frac{80}{3}\right)^2 - 8(40)\left(\frac{80}{3}\right) = 8000 - \frac{12800}{3} = \frac{24000}{3} - \frac{12800}{3} = \frac{11200}{3}$.
Thus, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\frac{11200}{3}$.
The answer is: $\frac{11200}{3}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The given expression is $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite it as $(5x^2 - 8xy + 5y^2)$, which can be factored as $(5x^2 - 8xy + 4y^2 + y^2) = ((x-2y)^2 + y^2)$.
Now, we are given the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. Since $|x-2y| = |-(y-2x)|$, we can rewrite the condition as $|x-2y| + |x-2y| = 40$, or $2|x-2y| = 40$. This simplifies to $|x-2y| = 20$.
Now, we know that $(x-2y)^2 \geq 0$, so $(x-2y)^2 \geq 0$. This implies that $(x-2y)^2 \geq 0$ and $y^2 \geq 0$, so $(x-2y)^2 + y^2 \geq 0$. But we know that $(x-2y)^2 + y^2 = ((x-2y)^2 + y^2) = (5x^2 - 8xy + 4y^2 + y^2) = 5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. So, $5x^2+5y^2-8xy \geq 0$.
Now, we need to find the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We know that $(x-2y)^2 + y^2 = 0$ if and only if $x=2y$ and $y=0$. This gives us the only solution $(x, y) = (0, 0)$. Substituting these values into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get $5(0)^2+5(0)^2-8(0)(0) = 0$.
Thus, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0. The answer is: $0$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We start by observing the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
We can rewrite this as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, we have $|2y-x| + |2x-y| \ge |(2y-x) - (2x-y)| = |y-3x|$.
So, we have $|y-3x| = 40$.
Now, let's express $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ in terms of $y-3x$:
\begin{align*}
5x^2+5y^2-8xy &= 5(x^2+y^2-2xy) \\
&= 5[(x-y)^2] \\
&= 5[(y-3x+2x)^2] \\
&= 5[(y-3x)^2 + 4x(y-3x) + 4x^2] \\
&= 5[(y-3x)^2 + 4x(y-3x) + 4(x^2-y^2+2xy)] \\
&= 5[(y-3x)^2 + 4x(y-3x) + 4((x-y)(x+y)+2xy)] \\
&= 5[(y-3x)^2 + 4x(y-3x) + 4(y-3x)(x+y)] \\
&= 5[(y-3x)(y-3x + 4x + 4y)] \\
&= 5[(y-3x)(7y+x)].
\end{align*}
Since $|y-3x| = 40$, we have $(y-3x)(7y+x) \ge -40 \cdot 40 = -1600$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $-1600$. The answer is: $\boxed{-1600}$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's simplify the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
By the property of absolute value, we know that $|a| = |-a|$ for any real number $a$.
So we can rewrite the equation as $|x-2y| + |-y+2x| = 40$.
Next, we can further simplify the equation using the property of absolute value $|a+b| = |a| + |b|$ for any real numbers $a$ and $b$.
So we have $|x-2y| + |2x-y| = 40$.
Now, we want to find the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.
Notice that the given equation $|x-2y| + |2x-y| = 40$ is independent of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.
So, we can find the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ without considering the constraint $|x-2y| + |2x-y| = 40$.
The expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ can be rewritten as $\frac{1}{2}((5x^2-8xy+5y^2) + (5x^2-8xy+5y^2))$.
Then, we complete the square in each parentheses:
\[5x^2-8xy+5y^2 = (x^2 - 2xy + y^2) + 4(x^2 - 2xy + y^2) = (x-y)^2 + 4(x-y)^2 = 5(x-y)^2.\]
So, $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(x-y)^2 \geq 0$.
The minimum value is 0, and it occurs when $x=y$.
Now we substitute $x=y$ into the given equation $|x-2y| + |2x-y| = 40$.
We get $|x-2x| + |2x-x| = | -x | + | x | = 2|x| = 40$.
So $|x| = 20$, and $x=y=\pm20$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0 when $x=y=\pm20$.
The answer is: $0$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We are given the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ and the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.

To find the minimum value of the expression, we can use the AM-GM inequality (Arithmetic Mean - Geometric Mean inequality). The AM-GM inequality states that for any non-negative real numbers $a$ and $b$, we have $(a+b)/2 \geq \sqrt{ab}$, which is equivalent to $a+b \geq 2\sqrt{ab}$.

Now, let's apply the AM-GM inequality to the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
\[5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x-y)^2 + 2xy] - 8xy.\]

By the AM-GM inequality, we have
\[(x-y)^2 + 2xy \geq 2\sqrt{(x-y)^2 \cdot 2xy} = 2\sqrt{2(x-y)^2 xy},\]
so
\[5[(x-y)^2 + 2xy] - 8xy \geq 5 \cdot 2\sqrt{2(x-y)^2 xy} - 8xy = 10\sqrt{2(x-y)^2 xy} - 8xy.\]

Now, we want to minimize the expression $10\sqrt{2(x-y)^2 xy} - 8xy$. To do this, we can use the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.

We can rewrite the condition as $|x-2y| + |2x-y| = 40$. By the triangle inequality, we have
\[|x-2y| + |2x-y| \geq |(x-2y) + (2x-y)| = |3x-3y| = 3|x-y|.\]

So we have $3|x-y| = 40$, which implies $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$.

Now, let's substitute $x-y = \frac{40}{3}$ or $x-y = -\frac{40}{3}$ into the expression $10\sqrt{2(x-y)^2 xy} - 8xy$.

If $x-y = \frac{40}{3}$, we have
\[10\sqrt{2(\frac{40}{3})^2 xy} - 8xy = 10\sqrt{2 \cdot \frac{1600}{9} xy} - 8xy = \frac{800}{3} \sqrt{xy} - 8xy.\]

By the AM-GM inequality, we have
\[xy \geq \left(\sqrt{xy}\right)^2 = (xy),\]
so
\[\frac{800}{3} \sqrt{xy} - 8xy \geq \frac{800}{3} \sqrt{(xy)} - 8(xy) = 0.\]

If $x-y = -\frac{40}{3}$, we have a similar result.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0, when $x-y = \pm \frac{40}{3}$.

The answer is: $0$
