Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. This gives us $m = 200$.
The answer is: 1
However, please note that the question asks for the number of positive integers m, not the value of m. 
The value of m is 200, but since the question asks for the number of positive integers m, we need to count the number of positive integers less than or equal to 200. The positive integers from 1 to 200 inclusive are 200 integers. 
So the number of positive integers m that satisfy the condition is 1. The answer is: 1

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $2$ (one time), and $1$ and $3$ (each two times).
So we must have $\frac{m}{100}=2,1,1,3,3$.
Multiplying each side of the equations by $100$ gives $m=200,100,100,300,300$.
Therefore, there are $5$ values of $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions. The answer is: 5.
The answer is: $5$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions.

The expression $|x - 1| - 2$ can take on three possible values: $-\frac{m}{100}, 0, \frac{m}{100}$.

If $|x - 1| - 2 = -\frac{m}{100}$, then $|x - 1| = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. This gives two equations: $x - 1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x - 1 = -(2 - \frac{m}{100})$. The first equation gives $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$, and the second gives $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

If $|x - 1| - 2 = 0$, then $|x - 1| = 2$. This gives two equations: $x - 1 = 2$ and $x - 1 = -2$. The first equation gives $x = 3$, and the second gives $x = -1$.

If $|x - 1| - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$, then $|x - 1| = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. This gives two equations: $x - 1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x - 1 = -(2 + \frac{m}{100})$. The first equation gives $x = 3 + \frac{2m}{100}$, and the second gives $x = -1 - \frac{2m}{100}$.

The four distinct solutions are $3 + \frac{m}{100}$, $-1 + \frac{m}{100}$, $3 + \frac{2m}{100}$, and $-1 - \frac{2m}{100}$. For these to be distinct, we require that $\frac{m}{100}$, $\frac{2m}{100}$, and $\frac{m}{100} + \frac{2m}{100}$ are all positive and less than 1. This means $0 < m < 100$. 

Since $m$ is a positive integer, the possible values for $m$ are $1, 2, ..., 99$. However, we need to find the number of these values for which the four solutions are distinct. This means we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $\frac{m}{100}$, $\frac{2m}{100}$, and $\frac{m}{100} + \frac{2m}{100}$ are all less than 1. 

Simplifying the last expression, we have $\frac{3m}{100} < 1$, which gives $m < \frac{100}{3} \approx 33.33$. 

So the possible values for $m$ are $1, 2, ..., 33$. There are 33 such values. 

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 33. The answer is: $33$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}=2$.

So we need to solve the equation $\frac{m}{100}=2$.

Multiplying both sides of the equation by 100 gives $m=200$.

Therefore, the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 200.
The answer is: 1

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to the positive difference between 2 and 3, which is 1. This is because the graph of the absolute value function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a V-shape with three distinct branches. The middle branch represents the "difference between 2 and 3", which is 1. Therefore, we must have $\frac{m}{100}=1$, so $m=100$. Thus, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions, and that integer is 100. The answer is: $\boxed{1}$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions.

We know that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=k$ (where $k$ is a nonnegative real number) has two cases:

Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2=k$ or $\vert x-1 \vert -2=-k$.

Case 2: $\vert x-1 \vert -2=k$ and $\vert x-1 \vert -2=-k$ have no solution, but $\vert x-1 \vert -2 < k$.

So, for the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ to have four distinct solutions, the equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2=\frac{m}{100}$ and $\vert x-1 \vert -2=-\frac{m}{100}$ must have two solutions each.

This means that $\frac{m}{100} < 2$, so $m < 200$.

Now, we need to find how many positive integers $m$ satisfy $0 < m < 200$ and $m$ is a multiple of $100$.

There are one such number, which is $100$.
The answer is: 1
