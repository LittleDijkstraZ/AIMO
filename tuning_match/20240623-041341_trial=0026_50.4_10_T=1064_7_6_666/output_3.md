Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ equals zero if and only if at least one of the factors equals zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies that $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ or $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$. The first case gives $x = 5$ and $y = 5$, and the second case gives $x = 0$ and $y = 10$ or $x = 10$ and $y = 0$.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies that $x = 8$ and $y = 8$.

So the vertices of the polygon are $(5,5)$, $(0,10)$, $(10,0)$, and $(8,8)$.

To find the area of the polygon, we can use the Shoelace Formula. The Shoelace Formula states that if the vertices of a polygon are $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), \ldots, (x_n, y_n)$, then the area of the polygon is given by
$$\frac{1}{2} \left| (x_1y_2 + x_2y_3 + \ldots + x_ny_1) - (y_1x_2 + y_2x_3 + \ldots + y_nx_1) \right|.$$

Applying the Shoelace Formula to the vertices $(5,5)$, $(0,10)$, $(10,0)$, and $(8,8)$, we get
$$\frac{1}{2} \left| (5 \cdot 10 + 0 \cdot 0 + 10 \cdot 8 + 8 \cdot 5) - (5 \cdot 0 + 10 \cdot 10 + 0 \cdot 8 + 8 \cdot 5) \right| = \frac{1}{2} \left| (50 + 0 + 80 + 40) - (0 + 100 + 0 + 40) \right| = \frac{1}{2} \left| 170 - 140 \right| = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 30 = 15.$$

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 15 square units. The answer is: $15$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These two equations imply that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four systems of equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$.

Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So the square has side length 16.

The area of a square with side length $s$ is $s^2$, so the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if at least one of the factors is zero.

This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The first factor is zero if and only if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
This is the condition for a square with side length 10.

The second factor is zero if and only if both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
This is the condition for a square with side length 16.

Therefore, the points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying the given equation enclose two squares: one with side length 10 and another with side length 16.

The area of a square with side length $a$ is $a^2$, so the area of the smaller square is $10^2 = 100$ and the area of the larger square is $16^2 = 256$.

The area of the convex polygon enclosed by these points is the sum of the areas of these two squares, which is $100 + 256 = 356$. The answer is: $356$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is true if and only if either of the two factors is equal to zero.
If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$, which gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle with side lengths of 20 units.
If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that $-8 \leq x \leq 8$ and $-8 \leq y \leq 8$. This forms a square with side length of 16 units.
The intersection of these two regions is the rectangle with side lengths of 20 units. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $20 \times 16 = 320$. The answer is: $320$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $AB=0$ is satisfied if and only if $A=0$ or $B=0$. Thus, the given equation is satisfied if and only if at least one of the following two conditions holds:
\begin{align*}
((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) &= 0, \\
((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) &= 0.
\end{align*}
For the first equation to be true, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the point $(x, y)$ is at a distance of 10 from the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$, as well as the lines $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length 20.
For the second equation to be true, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means that the point $(x, y)$ is at a distance of 8 from the x-axis and the y-axis. This forms a square with side length 16.
The intersection of the two squares is a smaller square with side length 8. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of the larger square minus the area of the smaller square, which is $20^2 - 8^2 = 400 - 64 = 336$. The answer is: $336$.

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is equal to zero if either of the two factors is equal to zero.
For the first factor, either $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$.
If $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$.
If $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, then $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = \pm 10$.
For the second factor, either $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.
If $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$.
If $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, then $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = \pm 8$.
The points satisfying these conditions are the vertices of a square with side length 10, centered at the origin.
The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation is satisfied if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This means that either $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The absolute value equations can be split into two cases:
1. If $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, then $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
2. If $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, then $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
3. If $\vert x \vert = 8$, then $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
4. If $\vert y \vert = 8$, then $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.
The solutions to these equations give the vertices of the polygon:
$(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, $(-8,-8)$, $(10,0)$, $(0,10)$, $(-10,0)$, and $(0,-10)$.
Plotting these points on a coordinate plane, we can see that they form a square with side length 16.
The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: 256

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The expression $A \cdot B = 0$ means that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. So, the given equation is equivalent to the system of equations:

1. $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$,
2. $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

For the first equation to be true, both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ must lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ or their reflections across the coordinate axes. These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$.

For the second equation to be true, both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ must lie on the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$ or their reflections across the coordinate axes. These lines form a square with side length 16 and vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The intersection of the regions defined by these two systems of equations is the polygon enclosed by the lines $x + y = 10$, $x - y = 10$, $x = 8$, and $y = 8$. This polygon is a rectangle with sides of length 16 and 8. Therefore, its area is $16 \times 8 = 128$. The answer is: $128$.

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is true if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

This means that either $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The equations $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$ represent the equations of four lines in the coordinate plane. The intersections of these lines form a square with side length 6.

The area of this square is $6^2 = 36$. The answer is: $36$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if and only if at least one of the following two conditions is true:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
For the first condition to be true, both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us a square with side length 10.
For the second condition to be true, both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us a square with side length 16.
Therefore, the points that satisfy the given equation are those that lie either in the square with side length 10 or in the square with side length 16. The convex polygon formed by these points is the union of these two squares.
To find the area of this convex polygon, we simply add the areas of the two squares. The area of a square with side length $a$ is $a^2$, so the area of the first square is $10^2 = 100$ and the area of the second square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $100 + 256 = 356$.
The answer is: $356$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So, the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if either of the following conditions is true:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first condition to be true, both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This forms a square with side length 10.

For the second condition to be true, both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This forms a square with side length 16.

Therefore, the points satisfying the equation form two squares: one with side length 10 and another with side length 16. The area of the convex polygon formed by the intersection of these two squares is the sum of the areas of the two squares.

The area of a square is the square of the length of its side. So, the area of the square with side length 10 is $10^2 = 100$, and the area of the square with side length 16 is $16^2 = 256$. Adding these two areas gives the total area of the convex polygon as $100 + 256 = 356$.
The answer is: $356$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, let's consider the condition $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.

This condition implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

The solutions to these absolute value equations are all the points $(x, y)$ that lie on a square with side length 20 and centered at the origin.

Similarly, the condition $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us a square with side length 16 and centered at the origin.

The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for.

The side length of the smaller square is 16, so its area is $16^2 = 256$.

The side length of the larger square is 20, so its area is $20^2 = 400$.

The convex polygon we are interested in is the intersection of these two squares, so its area is the area of the larger square minus the area of the smaller square.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $400 - 256 = 144$. The answer is: $144$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ equals to 0 if and only if both factors equal to 0. This gives us four cases to consider:

1. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This is the equation of a square with side length 20.

2. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$. This is the equation of a rectangle with length 16 and width 10.

3. $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$. This is the equation of another rectangle with length 16 and width 10.

4. $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This is the equation of a square with side length 16.

The area of the square with side length 20 is $20^2 = 400$. The combined area of the two rectangles with length 16 and width 10 is $2 \times (16 \times 10) = 320$. The area of the square with side length 16 is $16^2 = 256$. Adding all these areas together, we get the total area of the convex polygon as $400 + 320 + 256 = 976$.
The answer is: $976$

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $A \cdot B = 0$ implies that at least one of the factors must be zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these absolute value equations are the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these absolute value equations are the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines also form a rectangle.

Therefore, the points that satisfy the original equation are the vertices of a rectangle. To find the dimensions of the rectangle, we can simply solve for the intersections of the lines. The intersections of $x + y = 10$ and $x = 8$ are $(8,2)$, the intersections of $x + y = 10$ and $y = 8$ are $(2,8)$, the intersections of $x - y = 10$ and $x = 8$ are $(8,-2)$, and the intersections of $x - y = 10$ and $y = 8$ are $(2,-8)$. These points form a rectangle with side lengths of 10 units (horizontal) and 16 units (vertical). The area of a rectangle is given by the product of its side lengths, so the area of this rectangle is $10 \times 16 = 160$ square units. The answer is: $160$
