"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first list the problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge, and thens solve the problem step by step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

 The problem's constraints, conditions, and related knowledge are as follows:
The equation $AB = 0$ is equivalent to $A = 0$ or $B = 0$.
The absolute value $|x|$ is defined as $\max\{x, -x\}$.
The square of an absolute value is always non-negative, i.e., $|x|^2 \geq 0$.
The equation $|x|^2 = 0$ is equivalent to $x = 0$.

Now let's solve the problem step by step:
The given equation is
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$
Using the fact that $AB = 0$ is equivalent to $A = 0$ or $B = 0$, we have two cases:
Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
In this case, both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ must be equal to zero.
Using the fact that $|x|^2 = 0$ is equivalent to $x = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
This means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$, which gives us four equations: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.
Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, and $(-5,-5)$.
Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This case is similar to Case 1, and we find that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
The vertices of the polygon in this case are $(8,0)$, $(0,8)$, $(-8,0)$, and $(0,-8)$.
Combining the vertices from both cases, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, $(-5,-5)$, $(8,0)$, $(0,8)$, $(-8,0)$, and $(0,-8)$.
These vertices form a square with side length 10.
The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$

 The problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge:

The equation $A \cdot B = 0$ is true if and only if $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Thus, the given equation is equivalent to the two separate equations $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The solutions to $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ are $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which gives $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.

The solutions to $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ are $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which gives $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.

The solutions to $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ are $\vert x \vert = 8$, which gives $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.

The solutions to $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ are $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

Solving these equations, we get the points $(8, 2)$, $(8, -10)$, $(-8, 10)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(2, 8)$, $(-10, -8)$, $(10, 8)$, $(-2, -8)$.

The points form a square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$. The area of this square is $(10\sqrt{2})^2 = 200$. The answer is: $200$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge are as follows:

1. The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is true if and only if at least one of the following two equations is true:

   a) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
   b) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

2. The equation a) is true if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations, we get the four points $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, $(-5,-5)$.

3. The equation b) is true if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these four equations, we get the four points $(8,0)$, $(-8,0)$, $(0,8)$, $(0,-8)$.

4. Therefore, the eight points $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, $(-5,-5)$, $(8,0)$, $(-8,0)$, $(0,8)$, $(0,-8)$ are the vertices of the convex polygon.

5. To find the area of the convex polygon, we can use the Shoelace Formula. The Shoelace Formula for the area of a polygon with vertices $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$, ..., $(x_n, y_n)$ is given by:

   $$\frac{1}{2} |(x_1y_2 + x_2y_3 + \cdots + x_ny_1) - (y_1x_2 + y_2x_3 + \cdots + y_nx_1)|$$

6. Applying the Shoelace Formula to the eight points, we get:

   Area = $\frac{1}{2} |(5*5 + 5*-5 + -5*5 + -5*-5 + 8*0 + -8*0 + 0*8 + 0*-8) - (0*5 + 5*5 + 5*-5 + -5*5 + 0*-8 + 0*8 + 8*0 + -8*0)|$
   = $\frac{1}{2} |(25 - 25 + -25 + 25 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0) - (0 + 25 - 25 - 25 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0)|$
   = $\frac{1}{2} |0 - (-50)|$
   = $\frac{1}{2} * 50$
   = 25

So, the area of the convex polygon is 25 square units. The answer is: $\boxed{25}$

 The problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge:

The equation given in the problem is a product of two expressions equal to zero. Therefore, either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.

The expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ is zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. This gives us two lines: $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.

The expression $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ is zero if and only if $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us two more lines: $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.

The expression $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ is zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$. This gives us two lines: $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.

The expression $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2$ is zero if and only if $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us two more lines: $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

So the eight lines given by the equations above form a square with side length $10$. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units. The answer is: $100$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints are given by the equation:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$
This equation is equivalent to either:
$$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0,$$ or $$(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0.$$
From the first equation, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. This gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.
From the second equation, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.
The intersection points of these lines form a square with side length 10 (since the distance between the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$ is 10, and similarly for the lines $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$). The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100.
The answer is: $100$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first list the problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge, and thens solve the problem step by step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The equation given is $ ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0 $.
This equation equals zero if and only if at least one of the factors equals zero.
For the first factor to equal zero, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$.
Similarly, if $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = \pm 10$.
For the second factor to equal zero, either $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$.
Similarly, if $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = \pm 8$.
Combining the constraints from both factors, we have the following system of equations:
\[
\begin{cases}
x + y = \pm 10 \\
x - y = \pm 10 \\
x = \pm 8 \\
y = \pm 8
\end{cases}
\]
Solving this system of equations, we find that the vertices of the polygon are at the points $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(2, 8)$, $(-2, 8)$, $(2, -8)$, and $(-2, -8)$.
These points form a square with side length 10, so the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$
