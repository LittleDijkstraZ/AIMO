Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. This means that the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, must be equal to both $\frac{m}{100}$ and $-\frac{m}{100}$. Therefore, we have two separate cases to consider:

Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$
Solving this equation gives $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, so $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 = -2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
The solutions to these equations are $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$ respectively.

Case 2: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$
Solving this equation gives $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, so $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 = -2 + \frac{m}{100}$.
The solutions to these equations are $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$ respectively.

For these four solutions to be distinct, we require that the four numbers $3 + \frac{m}{100}$, $-1 - \frac{m}{100}$, $3 - \frac{m}{100}$, and $-1 + \frac{m}{100}$ are all different. This is only possible if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly greater than $2$, so $m > 200$. Moreover, the absolute values of these four numbers must also be different, which is only possible if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly less than $1$, so $m < 100$. Thus, $200 < m < 100$ is impossible and no such $m$ exists. However, we have made an error in our analysis. The absolute values of the four numbers will all be different if the distances between consecutive numbers are all different. That is, the distances from $3$ to $3 + \frac{m}{100}$, from $3 + \frac{m}{100}$ to $3 - \frac{m}{100}$, and so on, should all be different. We find that these distances are all equal to $\frac{m}{100}$. Thus, we only require that $\frac{m}{100}$ is greater than the distance between $3$ and $-1$, which is $4$. So we should have $m > 400$. But we have made another error. We have neglected the fact that $\frac{m}{100}$ should also be less than $1$, which ensures that $-1 + \frac{m}{100}$ is less than $3 - \frac{m}{100}$. So we should have $100 < m < 400$. The only positive integer in this range is $201$.

Therefore, the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $201$. The answer is: $1$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $2$. 

Therefore, we have $m = 200$. 

So the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy this equation is $1$.

The value of $m$ that makes the equation have four distinct solutions is $200$.
The answer is: $1$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The number of distinct solutions to the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is 4, which means that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four different x values that make the equation true.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is equivalent to two separate cases:

Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2=\frac{m}{100}$
Case 2: $\vert x-1 \vert -2=-\frac{m}{100}$

For Case 1, we have $\vert x-1 \vert =2+\frac{m}{100}$. This equation will have two solutions if $2+\frac{m}{100}>0$, or $m>-200$.

For Case 2, we have $\vert x-1 \vert =2-\frac{m}{100}$. This equation will have two solutions if $2-\frac{m}{100}>0$, or $m<200$.

Combining these two conditions, we find that $-200<m<200$. Since $m$ is a positive integer, the only positive integers $m$ that satisfy this condition are the integers from 1 to 199, inclusive.

Therefore, there are 199 positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. The answer is: 199

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is a value that makes the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ oscillate 4 times.

The function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ oscillates between 0 and 4.

To have 4 distinct solutions, we need $\frac{m}{100}$ to be in the interval $(0,4)$.

Multiplying through by 100, we get $0 < m < 400$.

The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are 1, 2, 3, ..., 399.

There are 399 positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions. The answer is: $399$

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $2$. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a shape of a "V" with the peak at $2$, and it takes the value of $2$ exactly once.
So we have $\frac{m}{100}=2$, which gives $m=200$. Therefore, the only positive integer value of $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is $200$.
The value of $m$ that satisfies the equation is $200$. The answer is: $\boxed{200}$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. This is because the absolute value function "flips" the sign of the expression inside it when it is less than zero, and thus the equation inside the absolute value will have $4$ distinct solutions when it equals to $2$, $-2$, or a value between $0$ and $1$.

Setting $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, we can solve for $m$:
\[m = 2 \cdot 100 = 200.\]

Therefore, there is only $1$ positive integer $m$ that makes the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have $4$ distinct solutions, which is $200$. The answer is: $1$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



For the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ to have 4 distinct solutions, the value $\frac{m}{100}$ must be less than 2 but greater than 0.
This means $0<\frac{m}{100}<2$, which simplifies to $0<m<200$.
The number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality is 199.
However, we are only interested in the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation has 4 distinct solutions.
From the graph of the function $y=\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, we can see that the equation has 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}=1$.
Therefore, there is only one value of $m$ that satisfies the condition, namely $m=100$.
The answer is: $1$
