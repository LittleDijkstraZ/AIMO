Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We first plug $n=1$ into the second equation to get $f(2)=2f(1)+1$.
Since $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1$, we have $f(1)$ is the only solution to the equation $f(f(f(n)))=1$.
From the first equation, we get $f(f(f(1)))=1$, so $f(f(1))=1$.
Plugging $n=1$ into the second equation again, we get $f(2)=2f(1)+1$.
Since $f(f(1))=1$, we have $f(2)=2f(1)+1$.
From the second equation, we also have $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.
So $f(2)=2f(1)+1$.
Setting this equal to $f(2n)$ for $n=1$, we get $f(2)=2f(1)+1$.
Comparing this with $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can see that $f(n)=n$ is a solution to the second equation.
We can check that $f(n)=n$ also satisfies the first equation.
If $f(n)=n$, then $f(f(f(n)))=f(f(n))=f(n)=n$.
And $8n-7$ is equal to $n$ only when $n=1$.
So $f(n)=n$ is indeed a solution to the problem.
Therefore, $f(100)=100$. The answer is: $100$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


Let's start by plugging $n=1$ into the given equations. From the first equation, we get $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1$, so $f(f(1))=1$. And from the second equation, we get $f(2)=2f(1)+1$. Since $f(f(1))=1$, we can substitute $f(1)$ into the second equation to get $f(2)=2f(1)+1$. 

Now, let's try to find $f(1)$. We know that $f(f(f(1)))=1$, so $f(f(1))=1$. Substituting $f(1)$ into the equation $f(2)=2f(1)+1$, we get $f(2)=2f(1)+1$. 

If $f(1)=1$, then $f(2)=2(1)+1=3$. But this doesn't work because $f(f(1))=1$, so $f(1)$ can't be 1.

If $f(1)=2$, then $f(2)=2(2)+1=5$. This works because $f(f(1))=f(2)=5$, and $5 \neq 1$.

So, we have found that $f(1)=2$. Now we can find $f(2)$ using $f(2)=2f(1)+1=2(2)+1=5$.

Now, let's try to find $f(3)$. We know that $f(2)=5$, so from the second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we get $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2(5)+1=11$. 

And from the first equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we get $f(f(f(3)))=8(3)-7=17$, so $f(f(3))=17$.

Now, substituting $f(3)$ into the second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we get $f(6)=2f(3)+1$. But we know that $f(6)=f(4)=11$, so we can set up the equation $11=2f(3)+1$. Solving for $f(3)$, we get $f(3)=(11-1)/2=5$.

But this doesn't work because we found earlier that $f(3)=f(2)/2=5/2$, which is not an integer, which is a contradiction. So, we must have made a mistake somewhere. 

Let's go back and check our work. We know that $f(1)=2$, $f(2)=5$, and $f(3)=5$. From the second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can find $f(6)=2f(3)+1=2(5)+1=11$, which matches with our previous calculation. 

So, we must have made a mistake when we were finding $f(3)$. Let's go back to the first equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and try to find $f(3)$ from that. We know that $f(f(f(3)))=17$, so $f(f(3))=17$. And from $f(f(3))=17$, we get $f(3)=f(17)$.

Now, substituting $f(3)$ into the second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we get $f(6)=2f(3)+1=2f(17)+1$. But we know that $f(6)=11$, so we can set up the equation $11=2f(17)+1$. Solving for $f(17)$, we get $f(17)=(11-1)/2=5$.

So, we have found that $f(3)=f(17)=5$.

Now, let's try to find $f(100)$. We know that $f(f(100))=8(100)-7=793$. And from $f(f(100))=793$, we get $f(100)=f(793)$.

We can continue this process to find $f(793)$ using the first equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. But this process can be quite tedious, so let's try to find a pattern or a shortcut.

Notice that $f(2)=5$, $f(4)=11$, $f(6)=17$, and so on. This suggests that $f(n)=6n-5$ for all positive integers $n$. 

To confirm this, let's check if this function satisfies the given conditions.

For the first condition, $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we have
$$f(f(f(n)))=f(f(6n-5))=f(6(6n-5)-5)=f(36n-30-5)=f(36n-35)=8n-7.$$

For the second condition, $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we have
$$f(2n)=f(6n)=6(6n)-5=36n-5=2f(3n)+1=2(6n-5)+1=12n-10+1=12n-9.$$
But this doesn't match with $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, so there must be a mistake somewhere.

Let's go back and check our work. We found that $f(n)=6n-5$. Let's check if this function satisfies the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We have
$$f(2n)=6(2n)-5=12n-5=2(6n-5)+1=12n-10+1=12n-9.$$
This matches with the second condition, so our function $f(n)=6n-5$ is correct.

Now, we can find $f(100)$ using this function:
$$f(100)=6(100)-5=600-5=595.$$

So, $f(100)=595$. The answer is: $\boxed{595}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find $f(100)$, we first need to find a pattern or relationship between the function $f(n)$ and its value. We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.
Let's start with $n=1$. From the second equation, we have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.
From the first equation with $n=1$, we have $f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = 1$.
Since $f(f(f(1))) = 1$, we have $f(f(1)) = 1$.
Now, from the second equation with $n=2$, we have $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$.
But we know $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. Substituting this into the equation, we get $f(4) = 2(2f(1) + 1) + 1 = 4f(1) + 3$.
From the first equation with $n=2$, we have $f(f(f(2))) = 8*2 - 7 = 9$. Since $f(f(f(2))) = 9$, we have $f(f(2)) = 9$.
But we know $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. Substituting this into the equation, we get $f(9) = 9$.
Now, from the second equation with $n=4$, we have $f(8) = 2f(4) + 1$. But we know $f(4) = 4f(1) + 3$. Substituting this into the equation, we get $f(8) = 2(4f(1) + 3) + 1 = 8f(1) + 7$.
From the first equation with $n=4$, we have $f(f(f(4))) = 8*4 - 7 = 25$. Since $f(f(f(4))) = 25$, we have $f(f(4)) = 25$.
But we know $f(4) = 4f(1) + 3$. Substituting this into the equation, we get $f(25) = 25$.
From the second equation with $n=8$, we have $f(16) = 2f(8) + 1$. But we know $f(8) = 8f(1) + 7$. Substituting this into the equation, we get $f(16) = 2(8f(1) + 7) + 1 = 16f(1) + 15$.
From the first equation with $n=8$, we have $f(f(f(8))) = 8*8 - 7 = 55$. Since $f(f(f(8))) = 55$, we have $f(f(8)) = 55$.
But we know $f(8) = 8f(1) + 7$. Substituting this into the equation, we get $f(55) = 55$.
From the second equation with $n=16$, we have $f(32) = 2f(16) + 1$. But we know $f(16) = 16f(1) + 15$. Substituting this into the equation, we get $f(32) = 2(16f(1) + 15) + 1 = 32f(1) + 31$.
From the first equation with $n=16$, we have $f(f(f(16))) = 8*16 - 7 = 121$. Since $f(f(f(16))) = 121$, we have $f(f(16)) = 121$.
But we know $f(16) = 16f(1) + 15$. Substituting this into the equation, we get $f(121) = 121$.
Now we can see a pattern: $f(1) = 1$, $f(9) = 9$, $f(25) = 25$, $f(55) = 55$, and $f(121) = 121$.
It seems that $f(n) = n$ when $n$ is a perfect square.
Since $100 = 10^2$, we have $f(100) = 100$.
Therefore, the value of $f(100)$ is 100. The answer is: $100$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find $f(100)$, we first need to find a pattern or relationship within the function $f$.

Using the second condition, we can express $f(f(f(100)))$ in terms of $f(100)$:
\[f(f(f(100)))=f(f(2f(50)+1))=f(2f(f(50))+1)=8(50)-7=393.\]

Now, we know that $f(f(f(100)))=393$, and from the first condition, we know that $f(f(f(100)))=8(100)-7=793$.

Setting these two equations equal to each other, we get:
\[393 = 793 - 400.\]

This implies that $f(100) = \frac{793-393}{400} = 1.$

We can verify this result by substituting $f(100) = 1$ back into the second condition:
\[f(2n)=2f(n)+1 \implies f(200) = 2f(100)+1 = 2(1)+1 = 3.\]

Now, we need to check if this value of $f(100)$ satisfies the first condition:
\[f(f(f(100)))=8(100)-7 \implies f(f(1)) = 793.\]

Since $f(1)$ is the value that maps to $1$, we need to find the value of $n$ such that $f(n) = 1$.

From the second condition, we have $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. If we let $n = \frac{1}{2}$, then $f(1) = 2f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) + 1$. But we don't have any information about $f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)$, so we need to look for another way.

From the first condition, we have $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. If we let $n = 1$, then $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7 = 1$. So, $f(f(1)) = 1$. Then, using the second condition again, we have $f(2f(1)+1) = 2f(f(1))+1 = 2(1)+1 = 3$. This means that $f(3) = 3$.

Now, we can use the second condition to find $f(1)$:
\[f(2n)=2f(n)+1 \implies f(2) = 2f(1)+1.\]
Since we know $f(3) = 3$, we can substitute $n = 1.5$ into this equation:
\[f(3) = 2f(1.5)+1 \implies 3 = 2f(1.5)+1 \implies f(1.5) = 1.\]
But this is a contradiction because we already determined that $f(1) = 1$ and we cannot have two different values for $f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)$. So, we must have made a mistake somewhere.

We noticed that when we substituted $f(100) = 1$ into the second condition, we got a contradiction. This means that our initial assumption that $f(100) = 1$ was incorrect. Let's try another value for $f(100)$.

If we let $f(100) = 2$, then from the second condition, we have $f(200) = 2f(100)+1 = 2(2)+1 = 5$.

Now, we check if this value of $f(100)$ satisfies the first condition:
\[f(f(f(100)))=8(100)-7 \implies f(f(2)) = 793.\]

Since $f(2) = 5$, then $f(f(2)) = f(5)$. We can use the second condition again to find $f(5)$:
\[f(2n)=2f(n)+1 \implies f(10) = 2f(5)+1.\]
But we know that $f(200) = 5$, so $f(10) = \frac{5}{2}$, which is not a valid natural number. So, this value of $f(100)$ also does not work.

Let's try another value. If we let $f(100) = 3$, then from the second condition, we have $f(200) = 2f(100)+1 = 2(3)+1 = 7$.

Now, we check if this value of $f(100)$ satisfies the first condition:
\[f(f(f(100)))=8(100)-7 \implies f(f(3)) = 793.\]

Since $f(3) = 3$, then $f(f(3)) = f(3)$. But we already know that $f(3) = 3$, so this value of $f(100)$ works.

Therefore, we have found that $f(100) = 3$.
The value of $f(100)$ is 3.
The answer is: $3$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We first try to find the value of $f(1)$.
Using the second equation with $n=1$, we have $f(2)=2f(1)+1$.
We then apply the first equation with $n=1$, we get $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1$.
Since $f(f(f(1)))=1$, we have $f(f(1))=1$.
Again applying the second equation with $n=f(1)$, we have $f(2f(1))=2f(f(1))+1$.
Substituting $f(f(1))=1$, we get $f(2)=2(1)+1=3$.
Now we substitute $f(2)=3$ into the equation $f(2)=2f(1)+1$, we get $3=2f(1)+1$, and solve for $f(1)$, we get $f(1)=1$.
Now that we have found $f(1)=1$, we can use the second equation to find $f(2)$, $f(3)$, and so on.
Continuing this process, we can find that $f(100)=99$. The answer is: $99$

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, we can easily check that $f(1)=1$.
Using the second equation, we have $f(2)=2f(1)+1=3$.
Then, using the second equation again, we have $f(4)=2f(2)+1=7$.
And finally, using the first equation, we have $f(f(f(4)))=f(7)=8(4)-7=25$.

Now, we have a pattern. We found that $f(1)=1$, $f(2)=3$, $f(4)=7$, and $f(7)=25$.
Notice that $f(7)=8(1)-7=1$, so $f(1)=7$.
Similarly, $f(3)=2f(1.5)+1=2f(2)+1=2(3)+1=7$.
And $f(6)=2f(3)+1=2(7)+1=15$.
Finally, $f(15)=8(2)-7=9$.

Now, we have another pattern. We found that $f(1)=7$, $f(2)=7$, $f(4)=7$, and $f(7)=9$.
It seems that $f(n)=7$ for all odd $n$, and $f(n)=8n-7$ for all even $n$.

Now, we can calculate $f(100)$. Since $100$ is even, we have $f(100)=8(100)-7=793$.

Therefore, $f(100)=793$. The answer is: $793$

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find $f(100)$, we need to apply the given functions iteratively. We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. So, we can start by finding $f(f(f(100)))$.
Using the given function $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can find $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$. But we know that $f(f(f(100))) = 8(100) - 7 = 793$. So, we have $f(f(f(100))) = f(200) = 793$.
Now we can substitute $f(200) = 793$ into the function $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to find $f(100)$.
$793 = 2f(100) + 1$. Rearranging the equation, we get $2f(100) = 792$ and therefore $f(100) = \frac{792}{2} = 396$.
So, $f(100) = 396$. The answer is: $\boxed{396}$

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, we are given that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. We want to find $f(100)$, so we want to find a way to express 100 in the form $f(f(f(n)))$ so we can use the given equation.

We are also given the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. This equation might be helpful in our search.

Now let's try to express 100 in the form $f(f(f(n)))$. We can start by setting $f(n)=100$. Then we can try to find a number $m$ such that $f(m)=100$.

We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, so if $f(n)=100$, then $m$ must be such that $f(m)=100$ is the solution to the equation $8n-7=100$.

Solving this equation, we get $8n=107$, and $n=\frac{107}{8}$, which is not a positive integer. So, we made a mistake. Let's try another approach.

Since $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can try to express 100 in the form $2f(n)+1$. Let's try to find a number $n$ such that $2f(n)+1=100$.

Solving this equation, we get $2f(n)=99$, and $f(n)=\frac{99}{2}$, which is not a positive integer. So, we made another mistake. Let's try another approach.

Since we are looking for a function that maps natural numbers to natural numbers, we can try to express 100 in the form $f(f(n))$. Let's try to find a number $m$ such that $f(m)=100$.

If $f(m)=100$, then we know that $m$ must be such that $f(f(n))=100$ is the solution to the equation $f(n)=m$. So, we want to find a number $m$ such that $f(m)=100$.

We know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, so let's try to express 100 in the form $2f(n)+1$. Solving the equation $2f(n)+1=100$, we get $2f(n)=99$, and $f(n)=\frac{99}{2}$, which is not a positive integer. So, we made another mistake.

Let's try another approach. We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, so let's try to express 100 in the form $8n-7$. Solving the equation $8n-7=100$, we get $8n=107$, and $n=\frac{107}{8}$, which is not a positive integer. So, we made another mistake.

Let's try another approach. We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Let's try to express 100 in the form $f(2f(n)+1)$.

If $f(2f(n)+1)=100$, then $2f(n)+1=m$, and we know that $f(m)=100$. So, we want to find a number $m$ such that $f(m)=100$.

We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, so let's try to express $m$ in the form $8n-7$. If $m=8n-7$, then we have $2f(n)+1=8n-7$.

Solving this equation, we get $2f(n)=8n-8$, and $f(n)=4n-4$.

Now we want to find a value of $n$ such that $f(n)=4n-4=100$. Solving this equation, we get $4n=104$, and $n=26$.

So, if $n=26$, then $m=2f(26)+1=2(100)+1=201$.

Now we need to check if $f(201)=100$. Using the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we have $f(f(f(26)))=8(26)-7=207$. But this is not equal to 100. So, we made a mistake again.

Let's try another approach. We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Let's try to express 100 in the form $f(f(2f(n)+1))$.

If $f(f(2f(n)+1))=100$, then $2f(n)+1=m$, and we know that $f(m)=100$. So, we want to find a number $m$ such that $f(m)=100$.

We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, so let's try to express $m$ in the form $8n-7$. If $m=8n-7$, then we have $2f(n)+1=8n-7$.

Solving this equation, we get $2f(n)=8n-8$, and $f(n)=4n-4$.

Now we want to find a value of $n$ such that $f(n)=4n-4=100$. Solving this equation, we get $4n=104$, and $n=26$.

So, if $n=26$, then $m=2f(26)+1=2(100)+1=201$.

Now we need to check if $f(201)=100$. Using the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we have $f(201)=2f(100)+1$. But we don't know the value of $f(100)$. So, we need to find it.

We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, so if $f(100)=100$, then we have $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7=100$.

Solving this equation, we get $8n=107$, and $n=\frac{107}{8}$, which is not a positive integer. So, we made another mistake.

Let's try another approach. We know that $f(f(f(n

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we can use the second condition to find $f(100)$. Since $100 = 2 \cdot 50$, we have $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.
Now we need to find the value of $f(50)$. Using the second condition again with $50 = 2 \cdot 25$, we have $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.
Continuing this process, we need to find the value of $f(25)$. Since $25 = 5^2$, we can use the first condition with $n=5$: $f(f(f(5))) = 8 \cdot 5 - 7 = 33$.
Since $f(f(f(5))) = 33$, we have $f(f(5)) = f^{-1}(33)$.
Now, we need to find the value of $f(5)$. Using the second condition with $5 = 2 \cdot 2 + 1$, we have $f(5) = 2f(2) + 1$.
Again, using the second condition, we have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. Since $f(1)$ is the base case, we need to find its value.
From the first equation, $f(f(f(1))) = 8 \cdot 1 - 7 = 1$, so $f(f(1)) = f^{-1}(1)$.
And from the second equation, $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. Substituting $f(f(1)) = f^{-1}(1)$ into this equation, we get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.
Now we can find the value of $f(5)$: $f(5) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2(2f(1) + 1) + 1 = 4f(1) + 3$.
And the value of $f(25)$: $f(25) = 2f(12) + 1$. Using the second condition repeatedly, we can find that $f(12) = 2f(6) + 1 = 2(2f(3) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(2f(1) + 1) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(4f(1) + 3) + 1) + 1 = 2(8f(1) + 7) + 1 = 16f(1) + 15$.
Substituting this into the equation for $f(25)$, we have $f(25) = 2(16f(1) + 15) + 1 = 32f(1) + 31$.
And finally, the value of $f(100)$: $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2(2f(25) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(32f(1) + 31) + 1) + 1 = 2(64f(1) + 63) + 1 = 128f(1) + 127$.
To find the value of $f(1)$, we can substitute $n=1$ into the first equation: $f(f(f(1))) = 8 \cdot 1 - 7 = 1$. Since $f(f(f(1))) = 1$, we have $f(f(1)) = f^{-1}(1)$.
Since $f(f(1)) = f^{-1}(1)$, we know that $f(1)$ is the value such that $f(f(1)) = f^{-1}(1)$. But $f^{-1}(1)$ means the value that maps to 1 under the function $f$.
From the first equation, we know that $f(f(f(1))) = 1$. So, $f(f(1))$ is the value that maps to 1 under the function $f$. Thus, $f(1)$ is the value such that $f(f(1)) = 1$.
We can conclude that $f(1) = 1$.
Substituting this into the equation for $f(100)$, we have $f(100) = 128 \cdot 1 + 127 = 255$.
Therefore, the value of $f(100)$ is 255. The answer is: $255$

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To solve this problem, we need to use the given functional equations to find the value of $f(100)$.

First, we can use the second equation, $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, to find the value of $f(100)$ in terms of $f(50)$.
Since $100 = 2 \cdot 50$, we can substitute $n=50$ into the equation to get $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.

Now, we need to find the value of $f(50)$.
Again, using the second equation, we can find the value of $f(50)$ in terms of $f(25)$.
Since $50 = 2 \cdot 25$, we can substitute $n=25$ into the equation to get $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.

Continuing this process, we can keep breaking down the numbers until we reach a number for which we can directly apply the first given equation.
After several steps, we find that $f(25)$ is the number for which we can directly apply the first equation.

Using the first equation, $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we can substitute $n=25$ to get $f(f(f(25)))=8 \cdot 25 - 7 = 200 - 7 = 193$.

Since $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$, we have $f(50) = 2f(f(f(25)))/8 + 1 = 2 \cdot 193/8 + 1 = 48.25$, which is not an integer, a contradiction.

Therefore, our initial assumption that the second equation holds for all positive integers $n$ must be false.

Let's try a different approach.
We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. If we substitute $n=1$, we get $f(f(f(1)))=8 \cdot 1 - 7 = 1$.

Since $f(f(f(1)))=1$, we have $f(1)$ must be a number such that when it's input into the function three times, it gives 1. The only number that satisfies this condition is 1. So $f(1)=1$.

Then, we can use the second equation to find the value of $f(2)$.
Substituting $n=1$ into the second equation, we get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2 \cdot 1 + 1 = 3$.

Similarly, we can find the value of $f(4)$, $f(8)$, $f(16)$, and so on, using the second equation.

Eventually, we will reach a number, say $f(32)$, for which the first equation can be applied directly.

Substituting $n=32$ into the first equation, we get $f(f(f(32)))=8 \cdot 32 - 7 = 256 - 7 = 249$. Since $f(64) = 2f(32) + 1$, we have $f(64) = 2f(f(f(32)))/8 + 1 = 2 \cdot 249/8 + 1 = 62.75$, which is not an integer, a contradiction.

Therefore, our initial assumption that the first equation holds for all positive integers $n$ must be false.

Let's try a different approach again.
From $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we know that $f(f(f(1)))=1$. Since $f(1)=1$, we have $f(f(1))=8 \cdot 1 - 7 = 1$. This means $f(1)$ is a number such that when it's input into the function twice, it gives 1. The only number that satisfies this condition is 1. So $f(1)=1$.

Then, we can use the second equation to find the value of $f(2)$.
Substituting $n=1$ into the second equation, we get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2 \cdot 1 + 1 = 3$.

Similarly, we can find the value of $f(4)$, $f(8)$, $f(16)$, and so on, using the second equation.

Eventually, we will reach a number, say $f(32)$, for which the second equation can be applied directly.

Substituting $n=32$ into the second equation, we get $f(64) = 2f(32) + 1$. Since we know $f(1)=1$, we can substitute $n=1$ into the first equation to get $f(f(f(1)))=8 \cdot 1 - 7 = 1$. Since $f(1)=1$, we have $f(f(1))=1$, so $f(1)$ is a number such that when it's input into the function twice, it gives 1. The only number that satisfies this condition is 1. So $f(1)=1$.

Then, we can use the second equation to find the value of $f(2)$.
Substituting $n=1$ into the second equation, we get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2 \cdot 1 + 1 = 3$.

Similarly, we can find the value of $f(4)$, $f(8)$, $f(16)$, and so on, using the second equation.

Eventually, we will reach a number, say $f(32)$, for which the first equation can be applied directly.

Substituting $n=32$ into the first equation, we get $f(f(f(32)))=8 \cdot 32 - 7 = 256 - 7 = 249$. Since $f(64) = 2f(32) + 1$, we have $f(64) = 2f(f(f(32)))/8 + 1 = 2 \cdot 249/8 + 1 = 62.75$, which is not an integer, a contradiction.

Therefore, our initial assumption that both equations hold for all positive integers $n$ must be false.

At this point, we realize that our original two equations are actually contradictory, and neither of them holds for all positive integers $n$.
However, we can still use the two equations to deduce some properties of the function $f$.

From the first equation, $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we can deduce that $f$ is a cyclic function with a cycle length of 3, i.e., $f(f(f(n)))=n$ for all positive

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



To find $f(100)$, we first need to understand the given function $f$. The function $f$ takes a natural number $n$ and returns another natural number. The two conditions given in the problem provide us information about how to compute $f(n)$ based on the value of $n$.

The first condition is $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. This condition gives us a way to compute $f(n)$ if we know $f(f(n))$. To find $f(f(n))$, we can apply the second condition. The second condition is $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.

Let's start by applying the second condition to $n=50$, since $f(f(f(50)))$ will be simpler to compute than $f(f(f(100)))$. We get
\[f(100)=2f(50)+1.\]
Now we need to find $f(50)$. We can use the second condition again with $n=25$:
\[f(100)=2[2f(25)+1]+1 = 4f(25)+3.\]
To find $f(25)$, we apply the second condition with $n=12.5$:
\[f(50)=2f(12.5)+1.\]
But the domain of the function $f$ is natural numbers, so $12.5$ is not in the domain and this equation doesn't make sense. We must have made a mistake in our calculations.

Let's reconsider our calculations. We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. If we try to apply the second condition to simplify this, we get a problem. For example, if we try to find $f(f(50))$ using the second condition, we would get $f(100) = 2f(50)+1$, which is the same equation we started with. This doesn't help us simplify the problem.

Instead, let's try a different approach. If we can find a value of $n$ such that $f(n)=2n+1$, then we can use this to simplify the first condition. If $f(n)=2n+1$, then
\[f(f(f(n)))=f(f(2n+1))=f(2(2n+1)+1)=f(4n+3).\]
We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, so
\[f(4n+3)=8n-7.\]
Setting $n=25$, we get
\[f(103)=8\cdot 25-7=197.\]
But this doesn't help us find $f(100)$ since $100 \neq 103$.

Let's try another approach. We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. If we can find a value of $n$ such that $f(f(n))=2n+1$, then we can simplify the first condition further. If $f(f(n))=2n+1$, then
\[f(f(f(n)))=f(2n+1).\]
We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, so
\[f(2n+1)=8n-7.\]
Setting $n=50$, we get
\[f(101)=8\cdot 50-7=393.\]
But this doesn't help us find $f(100)$ either.

We must have made a mistake somewhere in our calculations. Let's go back and reevaluate our calculations. It turns out that we made a mistake in our application of the second condition. Let's correct that.

We know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. If we set $n=25$, we get
\[f(50)=2f(25)+1.\]
But we know that $f(50)=100$ (since $f(50)$ is the input that gives $50$ when plugged into the function $f$), so we have
\[100=2f(25)+1.\]
Solving for $f(25)$, we get
\[f(25)=\frac{100-1}{2}=49.5,\]
which is not a natural number. This means we made a mistake in our calculations.

Let's go back to the beginning and reevaluate our calculations. We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. If we set $n=50$, we get
\[f(f(f(50)))=8\cdot 50-7=393.\]
And we know that $f(f(f(50)))=f(100)$. So we have
\[f(100)=393.\]
But this doesn't help us find $f(100)$. We must have made a mistake in our calculations.

Let's go back and reevaluate our calculations. It turns out that we made a mistake in our application of the first condition. Let's correct that.

We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. If we set $n=100$, we get
\[f(f(f(100)))=8\cdot 100-7=793.\]
And we know that $f(f(f(100)))=f(100)$. So we have
\[f(100)=793.\]
But this doesn't help us find $f(100)$ either.

Let's go back and reevaluate our calculations. It turns out that we made a mistake in our application of the second condition. Let's correct that.

We know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. If we set $n=50$, we get
\[f(100)=2f(50)+1.\]
But we know that $f(100)=793$ (since we calculated this earlier), so we have
\[793=2f(50)+1.\]
Solving for $f(50)$, we get
\[f(50)=\frac{793-1}{2}=396.\]
And we know that $f(50)$ is the output that gives $50$ when plugged into the function $f$. So we have found a value of $n$ such that $f(n)=2n+1$. This means we have found the value of $n$ that we were looking for. We can use this to simplify the first condition.

We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. If we set $n=50$, we get
\[f(f(f(50)))=8\cdot 50-7=393.\]
And we know that $f(f(f(50))

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find $f(100)$, we need to use the given equations to find the value of the function at $100$. 
We are given the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. 
We can start by finding $f(f(f(100)))$ and set it equal to $8(100) - 7 = 793$.
Next, we want to find $f(f(100))$, so we can substitute $n = f(100)$ into the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$.
This gives us $f(2f(100)) = 2f(f(100)) + 1$.
Now, we can substitute $f(f(100))$ with $x$, so we have $f(2x) = 2x + 1$.
Since we know that $f(f(f(100))) = 793$, we can substitute $f(f(100))$ with $x$ in the equation $f(f(f(100)))=8n-7$, so we get $f(x) = \frac{793 + 7}{8} = 101$.
Now we can substitute $x = f(100)$ in the equation $f(2x) = 2x + 1$, so we have $f(2f(100)) = 2f(100) + 1$.
Substituting $2f(100)$ with $2x$, we get $f(2x) = 2x + 1$.
So, we have $f(2 \cdot 101) = 2 \cdot 101 + 1$.
Simplifying this equation, we get $f(202) = 202 + 1 = 203$.
Finally, to find $f(100)$, we need to find a value of $x$ such that $f(x) = 100$.
From the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we have $f(f(f(x))) = 8x - 7$.
Substituting $x = 100$, we get $f(f(f(100))) = 8 \cdot 100 - 7 = 793$.
Now, we know that $f(f(100)) = x$, so we have $f(x) = 101$.
Since $f(f(100)) = x$, we have $f(101) = 100$.
Therefore, the value of $x$ that satisfies $f(x) = 100$ is $x = 101$.
So, $f(100) = 101$. The answer is: $101$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find $f(100)$, we need to use the given conditions.

First, let's find some values of $f(n)$ using the second condition:
$f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$,
$f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2(2f(1) + 1) + 1 = 4f(1) + 3$,
$f(8) = 2f(4) + 1 = 2(4f(1) + 3) + 1 = 8f(1) + 7$.

Now, we use the first condition:
$f(f(f(1))) = 8(1) - 7 = 1$, so $f(f(1)) = 1$,
$f(f(2)) = 2(1) + 1 = 3$, so $f(3) = 3$,
$f(f(4)) = 2(3) + 1 = 7$, so $f(7) = 7$,
$f(f(8)) = 2(7) + 1 = 15$, so $f(15) = 15$.

Continuing this process, we can find that $f(31) = 31$, $f(63) = 63$, $f(127) = 127$, and so on.

We observe a pattern that $f(2^n - 1) = 2^n - 1$ for all positive integers $n$.

Now, we can find $f(100)$ using this pattern. Since $100 = 2^6 + 2^3 + 2^2$, we can write $100$ as $2^6 - 1 + 2^3 + 2^2 = 63 + 8 + 4$.

Therefore, $f(100) = f(2^6 - 1 + 2^3 + 2^2) = f(63 + 8 + 4) = f(75)$.

Using the second condition again, we have $f(75) = 2f(37) + 1$.

Similarly, $f(37) = 2f(18) + 1$, $f(18) = 2f(9) + 1$, and $f(9) = 2f(4) + 1$.

Continuing this process, we can find that $f(9) = 7$, $f(18) = 15$, $f(37) = 31$, and $f(75) = 63$.

So, $f(100) = f(75) = 63$. The answer is: $63$

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's use the second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to find $f(100)$. We know that $100 = 2 \times 50$, so we can substitute $n = 50$ into the equation:
$$f(100) = 2f(50) + 1.$$
We don't know $f(50)$ yet, but we can keep going. We know that $50 = 2 \times 25$, so we can substitute $n = 25$ into the equation:
$$f(50) = 2f(25) + 1.$$
Again, we don't know $f(25)$ yet, but we can keep going. We know that $25 = 2 \times 12 + 1$, so we can substitute $n = 12$ into the equation:
$$f(25) = 2f(12) + 1.$$
And for $f(12)$, we know that $12 = 2 \times 6$, so we can substitute $n = 6$ into the equation:
$$f(12) = 2f(6).$$
And for $f(6)$, we know that $6 = 2 \times 3$, so we can substitute $n = 3$ into the equation:
$$f(6) = 2f(3).$$
And for $f(3)$, we can directly use the first equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ with $n=3$:
$$f(f(f(3))) = 8 \cdot 3 - 7 = 19,$$ so
$$f(f(3)) = f(19).$$
And again with $n=19$:
$$f(f(19)) = 8 \cdot 19 - 7 = 143,$$ so
$$f(19) = 143.$$
And now we can work our way back up:
$$f(3) = \frac{143}{2} = 71.5,$$ which isn't an integer, so we must have made a mistake somewhere. Let's try a different approach.

Notice that the function $f(n) = 2n - 1$ satisfies both given conditions. Indeed, if $f(n) = 2n - 1$, then $f(f(f(n))) = f(f(2n - 1)) = f(4n - 3) = 8n - 7$, so the first condition is satisfied. And for the second condition, we have $f(2n) = 2(2n - 1) + 1 = 4n - 1$, and $2f(n) + 1 = 2(2n - 1) + 1 = 4n - 1$. So both conditions are satisfied, and $f(n) = 2n - 1$ is a solution to the problem.

In particular, if we plug $n = 100$ into $f(n) = 2n - 1$, we get $f(100) = 2 \cdot 100 - 1 = 199$.
So the value of $f(100)$ is $199$.
The answer is: $199$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



To calculate $f(100)$, we first need to find a pattern in the function $f$. We are given the two conditions $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.

Let's start with $n=1$. From the second condition, we have $f(2)=2f(1)+1$.

Now, we apply the first condition with $n=1$, we get $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$.
Since $f(f(f(1)))=1$, we have $f(f(1))=1$ or $f(f(1))=f(1)$.

If $f(f(1))=f(1)$, then from the second condition, we have $f(2)=2f(1)+1$. But this contradicts the first condition with $n=1$, as $f(f(f(1)))=1 \neq 8*1-7=1$.

So we must have $f(f(1))=1$. Then from the second condition with $n=1$, we get $f(2)=2f(1)+1=3$.

Now we can substitute $n=2$ into the second condition, we get $f(4)=2f(2)+1=7$.

Now we substitute $n=4$ into the first condition, we get $f(f(f(4)))=8*4-7=25$. But we have $f(f(f(4)))=f(f(25))=f(25)$.

From the second condition with $n=25$, we have $f(50)=2f(25)+1$. From the second condition with $n=50$, we have $f(100)=2f(50)+1$. So we need to find the value of $f(25)$ to calculate $f(100)$.

From the first condition with $n=4$, we have $f(f(f(4)))=25$, so $f(f(25))=25$. Therefore, either $f(25)=1$ or $f(25)=25$. If $f(25)=1$, then from the second condition with $n=25$, we get $f(50)=2*1+1=3$, but this contradicts the second condition with $n=50$ ($f(100)=2*3+1=7 \neq 25$). So we must have $f(25)=25$.

Now we can substitute $n=25$ into the second condition, we get $f(50)=2f(25)+1=51$.
And substitute $n=50$ into the second condition, we get $f(100)=2f(50)+1=103$.

So the value of $f(100)$ is 103. The answer is: $103$

Step-by-step Solution:



Let's try to find $f(100)$ using the given information.

First, we know that $f(f(f(100))) = 8(100) - 7 = 793$.

Now, we want to find $f(100)$, so we need to find the value $x$ such that $f(x) = 100$.

We can use the second equation given in the problem, $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$.

Let's try to use this equation to find $f(100)$ by finding a value $n$ such that $2n = 100$, or $n = 50$. Then we have $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.

To find $f(50)$, we can use the same method. We know that $2 \cdot 50 = 100$, so $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$. But we also know from the first equation that $f(f(f(50))) = 8(50) - 7 = 393$.

Let's find the value $x$ such that $f(x) = 50$. Using the second equation, we have $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$. But we also know that $f(f(f(50))) = 393$, so we can substitute $f(50)$ with $\frac{393 - 1}{2} = \frac{392}{2} = 196$.

So, $f(100) = 2(196) + 1 = 393$. But this doesn't make sense, as we previously found that $f(f(f(100))) = 793$.

Let's try a different approach. From the second equation, we have $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. If we set $n = 1$, we get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.

From the first equation, we have $f(f(f(1))) = 8(1) - 7 = 1$. Since $f(f(f(1))) = 1$, we know that $f(1) = 1$.

So, $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2(1) + 1 = 3$.

Now, let's find $f(4)$, using the second equation again. We have $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2(3) + 1 = 7$.

Now, let's find $f(8)$, using the second equation again. We have $f(8) = 2f(4) + 1 = 2(7) + 1 = 15$.

We can continue this process to find $f(16) = 31$, $f(32) = 63$, and so on. We can see that the values of $f(2^n)$ are all one less than the powers of two.

So, $f(100) = f(64 + 32 + 4) = f(2^6 + 2^5 + 2^2) = 2^6 - 1 + 2^5 - 1 + 2^2 - 1 = 63 + 31 + 3 = 97$.

However, this doesn't match the value we previously found, $f(100) = 393$.

Let's go back and re-examine our work. We made a mistake when we said $f(f(f(50))) = 393$. Actually, $f(f(f(50))) = 8(50) - 7 = 393$, so $f(50) = \frac{393 - 1}{2} = \frac{392}{2} = 196$.

So, $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2(196) + 1 = 393$.

Therefore, the value of $f(100)$ is $393$. The answer is: $393$
