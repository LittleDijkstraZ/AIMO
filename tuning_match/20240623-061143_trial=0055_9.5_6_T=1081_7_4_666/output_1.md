Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we need to consider the constraint given by $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
First, let's simplify the constraint: $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40 \implies |x-2y| = 40 - |y-2x|$.
Now, let's consider the two cases:
Case 1: $x - 2y \ge 0$ and $y - 2x \ge 0$. Then $|x-2y| = x - 2y$ and $|y-2x| = y - 2x$. The constraint becomes $x - 2y = 40 - (y - 2x) \implies 3x - 3y = 40 \implies x - y = \frac{40}{3}$.
Case 2: $x - 2y < 0$ and $y - 2x < 0$. Then $|x-2y| = 2y - x$ and $|y-2x| = 2x - y$. The constraint becomes $2y - x = 40 - (2x - y) \implies 3y - 3x = 40 \implies y - x = \frac{40}{3}$.
Now, we can substitute $y = x + \frac{40}{3}$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
\[5x^2+5(x + \frac{40}{3})^2-8x(x + \frac{40}{3}) = 5x^2+5(x^2 + 2\cdot\frac{40}{3}x + (\frac{40}{3})^2) - 8x^2 - \frac{320}{3}x = 5x^2+5x^2 + \frac{400}{3}x + \frac{1600}{9} - 8x^2 - \frac{320}{3}x = -3x^2 + \frac{1600}{9}.\]
To minimize $-3x^2 + \frac{1600}{9}$, we need to minimize $x^2$. Since $x^2$ is always nonnegative, the minimum value occurs when $x^2 = 0$, which means $x = 0$. Substituting $x = 0$ into $y = x + \frac{40}{3}$ gives $y = \frac{40}{3}$.
Therefore, the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is:
\[5(0)^2+5(\frac{40}{3})^2-8(0)(\frac{40}{3}) = 0 + \frac{8000}{9} = \frac{8000}{9}.\]
The minimum value is $\frac{8000}{9}$. The answer is: $\boxed{\frac{8000}{9}}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


Let's first look at the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, we know that $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$. So we have
\[|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |(x-2y) + (y-2x)| = |-x - y| = |-(x+y)| = |x+y|.\]Therefore, $|x+y| = 40$.

Now let's look at the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite this as
\[5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x^2-2xy+y^2) + (x^2-6xy+y^2)] = 5[(x-y)^2 + (x-3y)^2].\]Let $a = x-y$ and $b = x-3y$, then we have
\[5[(x-y)^2 + (x-3y)^2] = 5(a^2 + b^2).\]By the triangle inequality again, we know that $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$. So we have
\[|a| + |b| = |x-y| + |x-3y| = |x-y| + 3|x-y| = 4|x-y| = 40.\]Hence, $|x-y| = 10$. Then $a^2 = (x-y)^2 = 100$.

Similarly, let $c = x+y$, then we have
\[|x+y| = 40 \Rightarrow c = 40.\]Then $b^2 = (x-3y)^2 = (x+y - 4y)^2 = (c - 4y)^2 = (40 - 4y)^2$.

Now we can substitute $a^2 = 100$ and $b^2 = (40 - 4y)^2$ into $5(a^2 + b^2)$, we get
\[5(100 + (40 - 4y)^2) = 500 + 5(40 - 4y)^2.\]To minimize this expression, we need to minimize $(40 - 4y)^2$. This is achieved when $y = 10$.

Substitute $y = 10$ into $c = 40$, we get $x = 30$.

Now substitute $x = 30$ and $y = 10$ into $5(a^2 + b^2)$, we get
\[5(100 + (20)^2) = 5(100 + 400) = 5 \times 500 = 2500.\]Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 2500.
The answer is: $\boxed{2500}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's look at the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
We can rewrite it as $|x-2y| + |-(x-2y)| = 40$, which simplifies to $2|x-2y| = 40$, or $|x-2y| = 20$.
This is the equation of a square with vertices at $(0,10)$, $(20,0)$, $(0,-10)$, and $(-20,0)$.
Now, let's look at the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.
We can rewrite it as $(5x^2-8xy+5y^2)$, which is the square of a binomial: $(√5x-√5y)^2$.
So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $0$, when $x=y$.
But we need to find the value of $x$ and $y$ that satisfy the equation $|x-2y| = 20$.
From the graph, we can see that the point $(x,y)$ that satisfies both equations is $(10,5)$.
Plugging these values into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get $5(10)^2+5(5)^2-8(10)(5) = 500+125-400 = 325$.
So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $325$.
The answer is: $325$.

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To solve this problem, we first need to simplify the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite it as $(5x^2 - 8xy + 5y^2)$. Now, we recognize that this is a quadratic expression in $x$ and $y$. We want to find the minimum value of this expression given the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.

We can simplify the condition as follows: $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$. The absolute value of a real number is always nonnegative, so we can square both sides of the equation without changing the solutions: $(|x-2y| + |2y-x|)^2 = 40^2 \implies (x-2y)^2 + 2|x-2y||2y-x| + (2y-x)^2 = 1600$.

Expanding the left side gives $x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2 + 4y^2 - 8xy + 4x^2 = 1600 \implies 10x^2 - 12xy + 8y^2 = 1600$.

Now, we need to solve this equation for $xy$. We can rewrite it as $xy = \frac{10x^2 + 8y^2 - 1600}{12}$.

Substitute this into the expression $(5x^2 - 8xy + 5y^2)$ to get $5x^2 - 8\left(\frac{10x^2 + 8y^2 - 1600}{12}\right) + 5y^2 = 5x^2 - \frac{80x^2 + 64y^2 - 12800}{12} + 5y^2$.

Multiply through by 12 to clear the fraction: $60x^2 - 80x^2 - 64y^2 + 12800 + 60y^2 = 60x^2 - 80x^2 + 60y^2 - 64y^2 + 12800 = -24y^2 + 12800$.

This is a quadratic expression in $y^2$ and it opens downwards because the coefficient of $y^2$ is negative. So, the minimum value occurs at the vertex of the quadratic. The vertex of a parabola $ax^2 + bx + c$ is given by $-\frac{b}{2a}$. In this case, the vertex is $-\frac{0}{-2*(-24)} = \frac{0}{48} = 0$.

Substitute $y^2 = 0$ back into the equation $-24y^2 + 12800 = -24*0 + 12800 = 12800$. So the minimum value of the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ given the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 12800. The answer is: $12800$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's rewrite the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ in a more convenient form.
By the property of absolute value, we know $|a - b| = |b - a|$, so we can rewrite the equation as $|x - 2y| + |2y - x| = 40$.
Since $|a + b| = |a| + |b|$, we can further simplify it to $|x - 2y| - |x - 2y| = 40$, which is simply $0 = 40$.
However, this equation is not possible, so there must be a mistake in our reasoning.
Let's go back to the original equation and consider the two cases for each absolute value separately:

Case 1: $x - 2y \ge 0$ and $2y - x \ge 0$.
In this case, the equation becomes $x - 2y + 2y - x = 40$, which simplifies to $0 = 40$, which is not possible.

Case 2: $x - 2y < 0$ and $2y - x < 0$.
In this case, the equation becomes $-(x - 2y) - (2y - x) = 40$, which simplifies to $-2(x - 2y) = 40$, or $x - 2y = -20$.

So, we must have $x - 2y = -20$.
Now, let's solve this equation for $y$ in terms of $x$:
$y = \frac{x + 20}{2}$.

Now, let's substitute this into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$:
$5x^2 + 5\left(\frac{x + 20}{2}\right)^2 - 8x\left(\frac{x + 20}{2}\right)$.

Simplifying, we get:
$5x^2 + \frac{5(x + 20)^2}{4} - 4x(x + 20)$.

Expanding and simplifying further, we get:
$5x^2 + \frac{5(x^2 + 40x + 400)}{4} - 4x^2 - 80x$.

Simplifying, we get:
$5x^2 + \frac{5x^2}{4} + 50x + 500 - 4x^2 - 80x$.

Simplifying further, we get:
$\frac{15x^2}{4} - 30x + 500$.

Let's call this expression $f(x)$:
$f(x) = \frac{15x^2}{4} - 30x + 500$.

To find the minimum value of $f(x)$, we can take the derivative with respect to $x$ and set it equal to 0:
$f'(x) = \frac{15x}{2} - 30 = 0$.

Solving for $x$, we get:
$x = \frac{60}{15} = 4$.

Now, we can find the corresponding value of $y$ using the equation $y = \frac{x + 20}{2}$:
$y = \frac{4 + 20}{2} = \frac{24}{2} = 12$.

Now, we can substitute $x = 4$ and $y = 12$ back into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ to find the minimum value:
$5(4)^2 + 5(12)^2 - 8(4)(12) = 80 + 720 - 384 = 416$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is 416. The answer is: $416$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


Let $u = x - 2y$ and $v = y - 2x$. Then, we have $|u| + |v| = 40$. We know that $|u| + |v| = |u + v| + |u - v|$ and by triangle inequality, $|u + v| + |u - v| \geq |(u + v) - (u - v)| = 2|v|$. Hence, we have $2|v| \leq |u| + |v| = 40$, which implies $|v| \leq 20$. Similarly, $|u| \leq 40$.
Now, we know that $u = x - 2y$ and $v = y - 2x$, so we can express $x$ and $y$ in terms of $u$ and $v$:
$$x = \frac{u + 2v}{3}, \quad y = \frac{2u + v}{3}.$$
Substitute these expressions into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$, we get
\begin{align*}
5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy &= 5 \left(\frac{u + 2v}{3}\right)^2 + 5 \left(\frac{2u + v}{3}\right)^2 - 8 \left(\frac{u + 2v}{3}\right) \left(\frac{2u + v}{3}\right) \\
&= \frac{5}{9} (u^2 + 4uv + 4v^2) + \frac{5}{9} (4u^2 + 4uv + v^2) - \frac{16}{9} (2u^2 + 3uv + 2v^2) \\
&= \frac{1}{9} (u^2 + 4v^2).
\end{align*}
Now, we need to find the minimum value of $u^2 + 4v^2$ under the constraint $|u| \leq 40$ and $|v| \leq 20$.
Since $u^2 + 4v^2 \geq 0$, the minimum value occurs when $u = 0$ and $v = 0$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is $\frac{1}{9} (0^2 + 4 \cdot 0^2) = 0$.
The answer is: $0$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To solve this problem, we first observe that $|x-2y| + |y-2x|$ can be rewritten as $|2x-y| + |2y-x|$.
Using the property $|a| + |b| \ge |a+b|$, we have $|2x-y| + |2y-x| \ge |(2x-y) + (2y-x)| = |x+y|$.
Given that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we can deduce that $|x+y| = 40$.
Now let's consider the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite this as $(5x^2-8xy+4y^2) + (y^2-8xy+10x^2) = (5x-4y)^2 + (y-2x)^2$.
We know that $(5x-4y)^2 \ge 0$ and $(y-2x)^2 \ge 0$, so the minimum value of $(5x-4y)^2 + (y-2x)^2$ occurs when both $(5x-4y)^2 = 0$ and $(y-2x)^2 = 0$, which implies $5x = 4y$ and $y = 2x$.
From $|x+y| = 40$, substituting $y = 2x$, we get $|x+2x| = 40$, or $|3x| = 40$. Thus $x = \pm \frac{40}{3}$.
For $x = \frac{40}{3}$, we have $y = \frac{80}{3}$, and the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $(5*\frac{40}{3}^2 - 8*\frac{40}{3}*\frac{80}{3} + 4*\frac{80}{3}^2) = 0$.
For $x = -\frac{40}{3}$, we have $y = -\frac{80}{3}$, and the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is also $0$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0. The answer is: $0$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



To find the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we first need to find a relationship between $x$ and $y$.

We can start by considering the given constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. Since $|a-b| = |b-a|$, we can rewrite the constraint as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$. Now, let's analyze the expression inside each absolute value:

- If $x-2y \geq 0$, then $|x-2y| = x-2y$.
- If $x-2y < 0$, then $|x-2y| = -(x-2y) = 2y - x$.

Similarly,

- If $2y-x \geq 0$, then $|2y-x| = 2y-x$.
- If $2y-x < 0$, then $|2y-x| = -(2y-x) = x - 2y$.

Now, we have the following cases to consider:

1) If $x-2y \geq 0$ and $2y-x \geq 0$, then the constraint equation becomes $(x-2y) + (2y-x) = 40 \implies 0 = 40$, which is not possible.

2) If $x-2y \geq 0$ and $2y-x < 0$, then the constraint equation becomes $(x-2y) + (x-2y) = 40 \implies 2(x-2y) = 40 \implies x-2y = 20$.

3) If $x-2y < 0$ and $2y-x \geq 0$, then the constraint equation becomes $(2y-x) + (2y-x) = 40 \implies 2(2y-x) = 40 \implies 2y-x = 20$.

4) If $x-2y < 0$ and $2y-x < 0$, then the constraint equation becomes $(2y-x) + (x-2y) = 40 \implies 0 = 40$, which is not possible.

From cases 2) and 3), we get $x-2y = 20$ and $2y-x = 20$. These are equivalent equations, so we can choose either one. Let's choose $x-2y = 20$ and solve for $y$:

$x - 2y = 20 \implies 2y = x - 20 \implies y = \frac{x}{2} - 10$.

Now, substitute this into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:

\begin{align*}
5x^2+5y^2-8xy &= 5x^2 + 5\left(\frac{x}{2} - 10\right)^2 - 8x\left(\frac{x}{2} - 10\right) \\
&= 5x^2 + 5\left(\frac{x^2}{4} - 10x + 100\right) - 4x^2 + 80x \\
&= \frac{15x^2}{4} - 60x + 500 + 80x \\
&= \frac{15x^2}{4} + 20x + 500.
\end{align*}

Now we want to minimize this expression. To do this, we can find the critical points by taking the derivative with respect to $x$ and setting it equal to zero:

$\frac{15x}{4} + 20 = 0 \implies \frac{15x}{4} = -20 \implies x = -\frac{160}{15}$.

However, this value of $x$ does not satisfy the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. Instead, we can substitute the value of $y$ in terms of $x$ back into the expression:

\begin{align*}
\frac{15x^2}{4} + 20x + 500 &= \frac{15(x^2)}{4} + 20x + 500 \\
&= \frac{15}{4}\left(x^2 + \frac{80}{3}x\right) + 500 \\
&= \frac{15}{4}\left(x + \frac{40}{3}\right)^2 + 500 - \frac{15}{4}\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 \\
&= \frac{15}{4}\left(x + \frac{40}{3}\right)^2 + 500 - \frac{15}{4}\left(\frac{1600}{9}\right) \\
&= \frac{15}{4}\left(x + \frac{40}{3}\right)^2 - \frac{2000}{3}.
\end{align*}

The minimum value of this expression is achieved when $x = -\frac{40}{3}$, at which point the expression evaluates to:

\begin{align*}
\frac{15}{4}\left(-\frac{40}{3} + \frac{40}{3}\right)^2 - \frac{2000}{3} &= -\frac{2000}{3}.
\end{align*}

So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $-\frac{2000}{3}$. However, this value doesn't make sense in the context of the original problem.

We must have made a mistake in our calculations. Let's retrace our steps.

We found that $y = \frac{x}{2} - 10$ from the constraint equation, and substituted this into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:

\begin{align*}
5x^2+5y^2-8xy &= 5x^2 + 5\left(\frac{x}{2} - 10\right)^2 - 8x\left(\frac{x}{2} - 10\right) \\
&= 5x^2 + 5\left(\frac{x^2}{4} - 10x + 100\right) - 4x^2 + 80x \\
&= \frac{15x^2}{4} - 60x + 500 + 80x \\
&= \frac{15x^2}{4}

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



We start with the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
This equation simplifies to $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$.
Since $|a| = |-a|$ for any real number $a$, we can further simplify to $|x-2y| + |- (x-2y)| = 40$, which is equivalent to $2|x-2y| = 40$.
Dividing both sides by 2 gives $|x-2y| = 20$.
Now we consider two cases:

Case 1: $x-2y = 20$ or $x-2y = -20$.

If $x-2y = 20$, then $x = 2y + 20$.
Substituting this into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get
\[5(2y+20)^2+5y^2-8(2y+20)y = 5(4y^2+80y+400)+5y^2-16y^2-160y = 20y^2+400y+2000+5y^2-16y^2-160y = -y^2+140y+2000.\]
Similarly, if $x-2y = -20$, then $x = 2y - 20$, and substituting this into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get
\[5(2y-20)^2+5y^2-8(2y-20)y = 5(4y^2-80y+400)+5y^2-16y^2+160y = 20y^2-400y+2000+5y^2-16y^2+160y = -y^2-240y+2000.\]
Comparing the two cases, we see that the expression $-y^2+140y+2000$ gives a smaller value when $x-2y = 20$.

Next, we need to find the minimum value of the expression $-y^2+140y+2000$.
This is a quadratic function in $y$, and its graph is a parabola opening downwards.
The $y$-coordinate of the vertex of the parabola is $-\frac{b}{2a} = -\frac{140}{2(-1)} = 70$.
Substituting $y = 70$ into the expression $-y^2+140y+2000$, we get
\[-(70)^2+140(70)+2000 = -4900+9800+2000 = 7000.\]
So the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $7000$. The answer is: $7000$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We are given that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. First, we can simplify the left-hand side:
\[|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |x-2y| + |-(x-2y)| = |x-2y| + |2y-x|.\]
By the triangle inequality, $|x-2y| + |2y-x|$ is equal to the distance between $x$ and $2y$, plus the distance between $2y$ and $x$. This sum is always equal to $40$.
Now, we are asked to find the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite this as:
\[5x^2+5y^2-8xy = \frac{1}{2}((5x-4y)^2 + (3x-3y)^2).\]
We know that $(5x-4y)^2 \ge 0$ and $(3x-3y)^2 \ge 0$, so the sum of these two squares is always non-negative. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ occurs when both $(5x-4y)^2 = 0$ and $(3x-3y)^2 = 0$. This happens when $5x = 4y$ and $3x = 3y$, or $x = y$. Substituting $x = y$ into the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we get:
\[|x-2x| + |x-2x| = | -x | + |-x| = 2|x| = 40.\]
So, $|x| = 20$, which means $x = \pm 20$.
Since we want the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, and the minimum of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is achieved when $x = y$, we can simply substitute $x = 20$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to get:
\[5(20)^2+5(20)^2-8(20)(20) = 2000.\]
So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 2000. The answer is: $2000$.
