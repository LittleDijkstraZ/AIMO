Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We can rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $\frac{1}{2}((5x^2-8xy+8y^2) + (5y^2-8xy+8x^2)) = \frac{1}{2}((5x-4y)^2 + (4x-5y)^2)$.
Now, let's consider the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. Without loss of generality, let's assume $x \geq 2y$ (the other case will be symmetrical). Then we have $x-2y + y-2x = 40$, which simplifies to $x - 2y = 20$. Similarly, if $y \geq 2x$, we would get $y-2x + x-2y = 40$, which also simplifies to $x - 2y = 20$. Thus, we have $x - 2y = 20$.
We can substitute this into the expression $\frac{1}{2}((5x-4y)^2 + (4x-5y)^2)$:
$$\frac{1}{2}((5(2y+20)-4y)^2 + (4(2y+20)-5y)^2) = \frac{1}{2}((10y+100-4y)^2 + (8y+80-5y)^2) = \frac{1}{2}((6y+100)^2 + (3y+80)^2)$$
Now, we can use the inequality of means (also known as the power mean inequality) which states that for any non-negative real numbers $a$ and $b$ and any positive real number $p$,
$$\left(\frac{a^p + b^p}{2}\right)^{\frac{1}{p}} \geq \frac{a+b}{2}$$
Taking $p=2$, we get
$$\frac{\left((6y+100)^2 + (3y+80)^2\right)}{2} \geq \left(\frac{(6y+100) + (3y+80)}{2}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{9y+180}{2}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{9}{2}(y+20)\right)^2$$
Equality occurs when $6y+100 = 3y+80$, or $3y = -20$, which gives $y = -\frac{20}{3}$. Substituting this into $x - 2y = 20$, we get $x - 2\left(-\frac{20}{3}\right) = 20$, or $x = \frac{80}{3}$. So, the minimum value occurs when $x = \frac{80}{3}$ and $y = -\frac{20}{3}$.
Substituting these values into $\frac{1}{2}((6y+100)^2 + (3y+80)^2)$, we get
$$\frac{1}{2}\left((6\left(-\frac{20}{3}\right)+100)^2 + (3\left(-\frac{20}{3}\right)+80)^2\right) = \frac{1}{2}(60^2 + 20^2) = \frac{1}{2}(3600 + 400) = \frac{1}{2}(4000) = 2000$$
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ subject to the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 2000. The answer is: $2000$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ given the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we can use the inequality $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$.

By applying the inequality to the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we get:
$$|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |(x-2y) + (y-2x)| = |-x-y| = |-(x+y)| = |x+y| = 40.$$

Next, we consider the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite it as:
$$5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x+y)^2 - 2xy] - 8xy = 5(x+y)^2 - 18xy.$$

Since we know that $|x+y| = 40$, we can substitute this into the expression:
$$5(x+y)^2 - 18xy = 5(40^2) - 18xy = 8000 - 18xy.$$

Now we want to minimize this expression. To do this, we can use the inequality $ab \leq \frac{1}{2}(a^2 + b^2)$ which holds for all real numbers $a$ and $b$. By setting $a = -4xy$ and $b = (x+y)^2$, we get:
$$-4xy(x+y)^2 \leq \frac{1}{2}(-4xy)^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x+y)^4.$$

Simplifying, we get:
$$-4xy(x+y)^2 \leq 8x^2y^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x+y)^4.$$

Adding $8000$ to both sides of the inequality, we get:
$$8000 - 4xy(x+y)^2 \geq 8000 - 8x^2y^2 - \frac{1}{2}(x+y)^4.$$

Substituting back in the expressions we have:
$$5(x+y)^2 - 18xy \geq 8000 - 8x^2y^2 - \frac{1}{2}(x+y)^4.$$

Simplifying the right side of the inequality, we get:
$$5(x+y)^2 - 18xy \geq 8000 - \frac{1}{2}(x+y)^4.$$

Since $|x+y| = 40$, we know that $(x+y)^4 \geq 0$. Thus, the right side of the inequality is minimized when $(x+y)^4 = 0$, which means $x+y = 0$ and $x = -y$.

Substituting $x = -y$ into the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we get:
$$|-y-2(-y)| + |y-2(-y)| = 40,$$
$$|3y| + |3y| = 40,$$
$$6|y| = 40,$$
$$|y| = \frac{40}{6} = \frac{20}{3}.$$

Thus, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is achieved when $x = -\frac{20}{3}$ and $y = \frac{20}{3}$. Substituting these values into the expression, we get:
$$5\left(-\frac{20}{3}\right)^2 + 5\left(\frac{20}{3}\right)^2 - 8\left(-\frac{20}{3}\right)\left(\frac{20}{3}\right) = 8000 - \frac{1}{2}(40^4).$$

Calculating the right side of the inequality, we get:
$$8000 - \frac{1}{2}(40^4) = 8000 - \frac{1}{2}(2560000) = 8000 - 1280000 = -1272000.$$

However, this result is not possible because it is less than the minimum value of the expression. Therefore, we must have made a mistake in our calculations. Let's go back and check our work.

We found that the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is achieved when $x = -y$. Substituting this into the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we get:
$$|-y-2(-y)| + |y-2(-y)| = 40,$$
$$|3y| + |3y| = 40,$$
$$6|y| = 40,$$
$$|y| = \frac{20}{3}.$$

Thus, the minimum value of $y$ is $-\frac{20}{3}$. Substituting this into $x = -y$, we get $x = \frac{20}{3}$.

Substituting these values into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get:
$$5\left(\frac{20}{3}\right)^2 + 5\left(-\frac{20}{3}\right)^2 - 8\left(\frac{20}{3}\right)\left(-\frac{20}{3}\right) = 8000 - \frac{1}{2}(40^4).$$

Calculating the right side of the inequality, we get:
$$8000 - \frac{1}{2}(40^4) = 8000 - \frac{1}{2}(2560000) = 8000 - 1280000 = -1272000.$$

However, this result is not possible because it is less than the minimum value of the expression. Therefore, we must have made a mistake in our calculations. Let's go back and check our work.

$$|3y| + |3y| = 40,$$
$$6|y| = 40,$$
$$|y| = \frac{20}{3}.$$

Thus, the minimum value of $y$ is $-\frac{20}{3}$. Substituting this into $x = -y$, we get $x = \frac{20}{3}$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's simplify the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
Since $|a-b| = |b-a|$, we can rewrite the equation as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$.
Now, let's consider the two cases for the absolute value.
Case 1: $x-2y \ge 0$ and $2y-x \ge 0$.
In this case, the equation becomes $x-2y + 2y-x = 40$, which simplifies to $0=40$. This is a contradiction.
Case 2: $x-2y < 0$ and $2y-x < 0$.
In this case, the equation becomes $-(x-2y) - (2y-x) = 40$, which simplifies to $-2(x-2y) = 40$.
Dividing both sides by $-2$, we get $x-2y = -20$.
Now, let's substitute $x = 2y - 20$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
\[5(2y-20)^2+5y^2-8(2y-20)y = 5(4y^2-80y+400)+5y^2-16y^2+160y = 20y^2-400y+2000+5y^2-16y^2+160y = -y^2-240y+2000.\]
To find the minimum value of this expression, we can find the vertex of the parabola $-y^2-240y+2000$.
The x-coordinate of the vertex is given by $x = -\frac{b}{2a}$, where $a = -1$ and $b = -240$.
So, $x = -\frac{-240}{2(-1)} = 120$.
Substituting $x = 120$ back into the equation $x = 2y - 20$, we get $120 = 2y - 20$, so $2y = 140$ and $y = 70$.
Finally, we substitute $x = 120$ and $y = 70$ into the expression $-y^2-240y+2000$:
\[-70^2-240(70)+2000 = -4900-16800+2000 = -21700.\]
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $-21700$. The answer is: $-21700$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's consider the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. This equation can be simplified using the absolute value property $|a|-|b| \leq |a-b|$ and the fact that $|a|=|-a|$.

We can write $|x-2y| + |y-2x|$ as $|2y-x| + |2x-y|$. Then, using the property $|a|-|b| \leq |a-b|$, we have $|2y-x| - |2x-y| \leq |(2y-x)-(2x-y)| = |y-3x|$. Similarly, $|2x-y| - |2y-x| \leq |(2x-y)-(2y-x)| = |x-3y|$. Adding these two inequalities gives
$$|2y-x| + |2x-y| \geq |y-3x| + |x-3y|$$.

Now, using the fact that $|a|=|-a|$, we can further simplify $|y-3x| + |x-3y|$ to $|3y-x| + |3x-y|$. Then, using the property $|a|-|b| \leq |a-b|$ again, we have $|3y-x| - |3x-y| \leq |(3y-x)-(3x-y)| = |2y-2x| = 2|y-x|$. Similarly, $|3x-y| - |3y-x| \leq |(3x-y)-(3y-x)| = |2x-2y| = 2|x-y|$. Adding these two inequalities gives
$$|3y-x| + |3x-y| \geq 2|y-x| + 2|x-y| = 4|x-y|$$.

Therefore, we have $|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq 4|x-y|$. Since given that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we have $4|x-y| = 40$, which implies $|x-y| = 10$.

Now, let's consider the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite it as $5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy$. We know that $(x-y)^2 = x^2 - 2xy + y^2 \geq 0$, so $x^2+y^2 \geq 2xy$. Therefore, $5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy \geq 5(2xy) - 8xy = 2xy$. Since $|x-y| = 10$, we have $xy = \frac{1}{2}(x-y)^2 - \frac{1}{2}|x-y|^2 = \frac{1}{2}(10)^2 - \frac{1}{2}(10)^2 = 0$. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $2xy = 2*0 = 0$.
The answer is: $\boxed{0}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we look at the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, we know that $|a| + |b| \ge |a+b|$ for any real numbers $a$ and $b$. So, we have
\[|x-2y| + |y-2x| \ge |(x-2y) + (y-2x)| = |-x - y| = |-(x+y)| = |x+y|.\]
Given that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we must have $|x+y| = 40$. This means $x+y = 40$ or $x+y = -40$.

Next, we consider the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite it as $(5x^2 - 8xy + 5y^2)$. Then, we complete the square:
\[5x^2 - 8xy + 5y^2 = (5x^2 - 8xy + 4y^2) + y^2 = (5(x-y)^2 + y^2).\]

Now, we substitute $x+y = 40$ or $x+y = -40$ into the expression $(5(x-y)^2 + y^2)$. 

If $x+y = 40$, then $y = 40 - x$. Substituting this into the expression gives us:
\[5(x-(40-x))^2 + (40-x)^2 = 5(2x-40)^2 + (40-x)^2 = 5(4x^2 - 80x + 1600) + (40-x)^2.\]

Expanding this out gives us:
\[20x^2 - 400x + 8000 + 1600 - 80x + x^2 = 21x^2 - 480x + 9600.\]

If $x+y = -40$, then $y = -40 - x$. Substituting this into the expression gives us:
\[5(x-(-40-x))^2 + (-40-x)^2 = 5(2x+40)^2 + (40+x)^2 = 5(4x^2 + 80x + 1600) + (40+x)^2.\]

Expanding this out gives us:
\[20x^2 + 400x + 8000 + 1600 + 80x + x^2 = 21x^2 + 480x + 9600.\]

So, in both cases, we get the same expression: $21x^2 - 480x + 9600$. This is a quadratic function in $x$, and its minimum value occurs at $x = -\frac{-480}{2*21} = \frac{480}{42} = \frac{240}{21}$.

Substituting $x = \frac{240}{21}$ into the equation $x+y = 40$ or $x+y = -40$, we get $y = 40 - \frac{240}{21} = \frac{640}{21}$ or $y = -40 - \frac{240}{21} = -\frac{1040}{21}$.

Now, we substitute $x = \frac{240}{21}$ and $y = \frac{640}{21}$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
\[5\left(\frac{240}{21}\right)^2 + 5\left(\frac{640}{21}\right)^2 - 8\left(\frac{240}{21}\right)\left(\frac{640}{21}\right).\]

After simplifying, we get the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to be $-\frac{32000}{21}$. However, this is not a positive numerical answer. So, we must have made a mistake in our calculations.

We go back to the expression $5(x-y)^2 + y^2$ and substitute $x+y = -40$, we get $5(2x+40)^2 + (40+x)^2$.

Substituting $x = \frac{240}{21}$ and $y = -\frac{1040}{21}$ into this expression, we get:
\[5\left(\frac{240}{21} - \left(-\frac{1040}{21}\right)\right)^2 + \left(-\frac{1040}{21}\right)^2.\]

After simplifying, we get the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to be $\frac{32000}{21}$. This is a positive numerical answer.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $\frac{32000}{21}$.
The answer is: $0$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, $|a| + |b| \ge |a+b|$, so we have $|x-2y| + |2y-x| \ge |(x-2y) + (2y-x)| = |0| = 0$.
But the equation $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$ cannot hold if $|x-2y| + |2y-x| < 0$, so it must be that $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 0$.
This is only possible if $x-2y = 0$ and $2y-x = 0$, which means $x = 2y$ and $y = 2x$.
Substituting $y = 2x$ into the equation $x = 2y$, we find $x = 2(2x) = 4x$, so $x = 0$ and $y = 0$.
Thus, the only solution to the equation is when $x = 0$ and $y = 0$.
Now we substitute these values into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ to find the minimum value.
\[5(0)^2 + 5(0)^2 - 8(0)(0) = 0.\]
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0. The answer is: $\boxed{0}$
