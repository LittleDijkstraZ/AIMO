Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions means that the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, changes its sign twice as $x$ varies over the real numbers. This happens when $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 0$, or $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$. Solving this equation gives $x-1 = 2$ or $x-1 = -2$, which gives $x=3$ or $x=-1$. So the function $f(x) = \vert x-1 \vert -2$ changes its sign at $x=-1$ and $x=3$. This means that the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal to the difference of the function's value at these two points. We have
\[f(3) - f(-1) = (\vert 3-1 \vert -2) - (\vert -1-1 \vert -2) = (2-2) - (2-2) = 0.\]
So $\frac{m}{100} = 0$ and $m=0$. This doesn't give us the desired 4 distinct solutions. 

To get 4 distinct solutions, we need $\frac{m}{100}$ to be positive. The function $f(x)$ changes its sign again when $x$ varies from $-1$ to $3$. At $x=0$, we have
\[f(0) - f(-1) = (\vert 0-1 \vert -2) - (\vert -1-1 \vert -2) = (1-2) - (2-2) = -1.\]
Similarly, $f(0) - f(3) = -1$. So the possible values for $\frac{m}{100}$ are $1$. This gives us $m=100$. 

Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions, and that is $m=100$. The answer is: $1$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $2$. This is because the expression on the left hand side takes on all values in the interval $[1,2]$. So, $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$.

Multiplying all sides by $100$ gives $100 < m < 200$. The positive integers that satisfy this inequality are the integers from $101$ to $199$, inclusive. To find the number of these integers, we subtract the smallest integer from the largest and then add $1$.

So the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the given conditions is $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$. The answer is: $99$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


For the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ to have $4$ distinct solutions, the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal to $2$. 
This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ will be equal to $2$ at $4$ distinct points. 

To make $\frac{m}{100}$ equal to $2$, we can set $m = 200$. 
Therefore, the value of $m$ that satisfies the equation is $200$. 
So the answer is $\boxed{1}$.
The answer is $\boxed{1}$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.
The number $\frac{m}{100}$ must be positive, so $m$ must be positive.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be rewritten as two separate cases:

Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$.
This can be further broken down into two subcases:

Subcase 1a: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $\vert x-1 \vert -2 \ge 0$.
In this case, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, so $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 = -2 - \frac{m}{100}$. Solving these equations gives $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Subcase 1b: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $\vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0$.
In this case, the equation becomes $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$, so $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. This has no solutions because the right-hand side is negative while the absolute value is always non-negative.

Case 2: $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = \frac{m}{100}$.
This can be further broken down into two subcases:

Subcase 2a: $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 \ge 0$.
In this case, we have $-\vert x-1 \vert = -2 + \frac{m}{100}$, so $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. This gives $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 = -2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ or $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Subcase 2b: $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 < 0$.
In this case, the equation becomes $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = -\frac{m}{100}$, so $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. This has no solutions because the right-hand side is positive while the absolute value is always non-negative.

Now we need to find the values of $m$ for which the solutions from both cases are distinct.
The solutions from Case 1 are $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.
The solutions from Case 2 are $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Comparing these solutions, we see that the solutions from Case 1 and Case 2 are distinct if and only if $\frac{m}{100} \neq -\frac{m}{100}$, which means $m \neq 0$.

Therefore, the positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions are those positive integers $m$ such that $0 < m \le 200$. The number of such positive integers is 200.
The answer is: $200$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is between 1 and 2 (inclusive). This is because the expression on the left can take on any value from 0 to 3, and it takes on the value of 1 or 2 exactly once for each of the 4 intervals described by the absolute value signs in $| |x - 1| - 2|$.

So, we need to find the values of $m$ such that $1 \leq \frac{m}{100} \leq 2$. Multiplying all parts of this inequality by 100 gives $100 \leq m \leq 200$. The positive integers $m$ in this range are the integers from 100 to 200, inclusive. To find the total number of such integers, we subtract the smallest value from the largest value and add 1 (because both endpoints are included). So, the number of positive integers $m$ is $200 - 100 + 1 = 101$. The answer is: $101$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100} = 2$.
This is because the expression on the left side, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, is a piecewise function that takes on the value of 2 at exactly 4 distinct points.

Setting $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, we can solve for $m$:
\[m = 2 \cdot 100 = 200.\]

So, the only positive integer value of $m$ that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions is 200. The answer is: $1$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. This means the absolute value expression on the left will be equal to $\frac{m}{100}$ or $-\frac{m}{100}$ at four different points.

Let's start by considering the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.

If we set $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, we get the equation $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.

This equation will have two solutions if $2 + \frac{m}{100} > 0$, which simplifies to $m > -200$. 

Similarly, if we set $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$, we get the equation $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.

This equation will have two solutions if $2 - \frac{m}{100} > 0$, which simplifies to $m < 200$.

So, the value of $m$ must be in the range $-200 < m < 200$.

However, $m$ must be a positive integer, so we only consider $1 \leq m < 200$.

Now we need to count the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

The number of positive integers $m$ in the range $1 \leq m < 200$ is $199$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $199$. The answer is: $199$

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions means that the absolute value equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2=\pm \frac{m}{100}$ has two solutions.
This is because the original equation is equivalent to two separate equations: $\vert x-1 \vert -2=\frac{m}{100}$ and $\vert x-1 \vert -2=-\frac{m}{100}$.
The equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2=\frac{m}{100}$ can be rewritten as $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.
The absolute value equation $\vert x-1 \vert = a$ has two solutions if $a>0$. So we need $2 + \frac{m}{100} > 0$.
This gives us $\frac{m}{100} > -2$, which simplifies to $m > -200$.
However, $m$ is a positive integer, so the smallest possible value for $m$ is $1$.
Therefore, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $1 < m < 200$. The number of such integers is $199-1=198$.
So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 198.
The answer is: 198

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions means that the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be a value which makes the expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ change its sign twice as $x$ varies over the real numbers. 

The expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a piecewise function defined as follows:

- If $\vert x-1 \vert \geq 2$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\vert x-1\vert -2$.
- If $0 \leq \vert x-1 \vert < 2$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=2-\vert x-1\vert$.

The function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ changes its sign twice as $x$ varies over the real numbers when $\frac{m}{100}$ equals to 2.

So we have $\frac{m}{100}=2$, which gives $m=200$.

Therefore, the only positive integer $m$ that makes the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have 4 distinct solutions is 200. The answer is: $1$
