Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ is satisfied only when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This happens when $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, or $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$, or $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$, or $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$. These give us the lines $x + y = 10$, $x - y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, and $x - y = -10$.

The expression $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ is satisfied only when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersection of these lines form a square with vertices at $(8,8)$, $(-8,8)$, $(-8,-8)$, and $(8,-8)$. The side length of the square is $16$, so the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The product of two numbers is zero if and only if one or both of the numbers are zero. Therefore, the equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ must be true for the points in the polygon.

For $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

For $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So we get four more lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersection of these lines form a square with side length 10 (because the distance between the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$ is 10, which is also the distance between the lines $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$).

The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation given is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

For the product of two numbers to be zero, either one of the numbers must be zero. So, we have two cases:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
This can only happen if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ are zero. This happens when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This can only happen if both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2$ are zero. This happens when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

Now, let's analyze these cases.

Case 1: $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$
This implies that the points lie on two lines: $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$.

Case 2: $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$
This implies that the points lie on a square with side length 16.

The intersection of these two sets of points is a square with side length 10 (the points where the lines intersect the square from Case 2). So, the area of the convex polygon is the area of this square, which is $10^2 = 100$.

The answer is: $100$

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression is equal to zero if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The first two equations are satisfied if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, and the last two equations are satisfied if $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
These conditions define a square with side length 16. Therefore, the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
This means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
The solutions to these equations are lines in the $xy$-plane.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This means $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The solutions to these equations are two pairs of parallel lines, one for $x$ and one for $y$.

The intersection of all these lines form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation implies that at least one of the factors is zero, which is equivalent to saying that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. These conditions are equivalent to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$. 
The solutions to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ are the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$. The solutions to $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ are the lines $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$. The solutions to $\vert x \vert = 8$ are the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$. The solutions to $\vert y \vert = 8$ are the lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$. 
The intersection of these lines forms a rectangle with side lengths 16 and 20, so the area of the rectangle is $16 \times 20 = 320$. The answer is: $320$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is true if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. 
This means that either $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$. 
The first two equations represent a square with side length 20, and the last two equations represent a square with side length 16. 
The area of the square with side length 20 is $20^2 = 400$, and the area of the square with side length 16 is $16^2 = 256$. 
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $400 + 256 = 656$. The answer is: 656

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four systems of equations gives the vertices of the square as $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, -2)$, and $(-8, 2)$.

Similarly, the expression $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So the square's sides have length $20$.

Therefore, the area of the square is $20^2 = 400$. The answer is: $400$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation given is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. For the product of two numbers to be zero, either one of the numbers must be zero. Therefore, either
\begin{align*}
(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 &= 0, \text{ or} \\
(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 &= 0.
\end{align*}
If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which means $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$. Adding these equations gives $2x = 20$, so $x = 10$, and subtracting the second equation from the first gives $2y = 0$, so $y = 0$.
If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which means $x = 8$ and $y = 8$.
So the points that satisfy the equation are $(10, 0)$ and $(8, 8)$. These points form a line segment, which is the convex polygon in question. The length of the line segment is the distance between $(10, 0)$ and $(8, 8)$, which can be found using the distance formula:
\[\sqrt{(10 - 8)^2 + (0 - 8)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 64} = \sqrt{68}.\]
The area of a line segment (or line segment-like polygon) is zero. However, the question asks for the area of the convex polygon formed by these points. In this case, the convex polygon is simply the line segment itself. The area of a line segment is technically undefined, but for the purposes of this problem, we can consider the area of the convex polygon to be zero. The area of the convex polygon is 0. The answer is: $0$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ are zero, or both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2$ are zero.

The first case, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These two equations give us four lines in the plane: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

The second case, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These two equations give us four lines in the plane: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 10, because the lines $x + y = 10$, $x - y = 10$, $x = 8$, and $y = 8$ intersect at the point $(8, 2)$, and the lines $x + y = -10$, $x - y = -10$, $x = -8$, and $y = -8$ intersect at the point $(-8, -2)$. The distance between these two points is $\sqrt{(8 - (-8))^2 + (2 - (-2))^2} = \sqrt{16^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{256 + 16} = \sqrt{272} = 2\sqrt{68} = 2 \cdot 2\sqrt{17} = 4\sqrt{17}$. But this distance is also the diagonal of the square, so using the Pythagorean theorem, the side length of the square is $\frac{4\sqrt{17}}{\sqrt{2}} = 4\sqrt{\frac{17}{2}} = 4\sqrt{\frac{34}{4}} = 4\sqrt{8.5} = 4 \cdot 2\sqrt{1.7} = 8\sqrt{1.7}$. The area of the square is then $(8\sqrt{1.7})^2 = 64 \cdot 1.7 = 108.8$.

However, since the side length of the square cannot be negative, we must have taken the positive square root in our calculations. Therefore, the area of the square is $108.8$.
The answer is: $108.8$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation is satisfied if either $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$ or $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
For the first case, either $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that either $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, or $x - y = -10$. These are the equations of lines in the coordinate plane, and the four lines enclose a square with side length $20$ and area $400$.
For the second case, either $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that either $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, or $y = -8$. These are the equations of lines in the coordinate plane, and the four lines enclose a square with side length $16$ and area $256$.
Since the two cases cannot happen simultaneously, the points satisfying the given equation are those that lie on the boundary of the two squares. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon formed by these points is the sum of the areas of the two squares, which is $400 + 256 = 656$. The answer is: $656$

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if either of the following conditions is true:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
The first condition implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two squares in the $xy$-plane centered at the origin with side length $10$.
The second condition implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two squares in the $xy$-plane centered at the origin with side length $8$.
The intersection of these squares forms a square with side length $10 - 8 = 2$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of the square with side length $2$, which is $2^2 = 4$. The answer is: $4$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression equals zero if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This means that either $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The solutions to these equations are:
- $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ gives the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.
- $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ gives the lines $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.
- $\vert x \vert = 8$ gives the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.
- $\vert y \vert = 8$ gives the lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.
These lines enclose a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$
