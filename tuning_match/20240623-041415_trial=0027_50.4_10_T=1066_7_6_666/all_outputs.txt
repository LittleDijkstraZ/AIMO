Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To solve this problem, we first need to find the $x$-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$.
The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points, so we set $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$.
This simplifies to $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$.
The distance between points $A$ and $B$ is given as 6, so we can use the fact that the distance between two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is $\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$.
Since $A$ and $B$ are on the line $y = 4$, their $y$-coordinates are both 4.
So the distance between $A$ and $B$ is $\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (4 - 4)^2} = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2} = |x_2 - x_1| = 6$.
Using the quadratic formula, we find that the $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$ are given by
\[x = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{(2k)^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k} = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k} = 1 \pm \sqrt{1 - \frac{l - 4}{k}}.\]
Let $x_1 = 1 + \sqrt{1 - \frac{l - 4}{k}}$ and $x_2 = 1 - \sqrt{1 - \frac{l - 4}{k}}$.
The distance from point $A$ (or $B$) to the origin is given by $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + 4}$.
So the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is
\[(\sqrt{x_1^2 + 4})^2 + (\sqrt{x_2^2 + 4})^2 = (x_1^2 + 4) + (x_2^2 + 4) = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 8.\]
We know that $x_1 + x_2 = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = 1$, so we can use these to find $x_1^2 + x_2^2$.
\[(x_1 + x_2)^2 = x_1^2 + 2x_1x_2 + x_2^2 = 4 \implies x_1^2 + x_2^2 = 4 - 2(1) = 2.\]
Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $2 + 8 = 10$. The answer is: $10$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The equation of the parabola is given by $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$.
The line $y = 4$ intersects the parabola at points $A$ and $B$.
So we set $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$.
Rearranging, we get $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$.
Let's call this equation (1).

Given that the distance between points $A$ and $B$ is 6, this means the difference of the roots of equation (1) is 6.
By Vieta's formulas, the difference of the roots of a quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ is given by $\frac{\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{a}$.
Comparing this with our equation, we have $a = k$, $b = -2k$, and $c = l - 4$.
So the difference of the roots is $\frac{\sqrt{(-2k)^2 - 4*k*(l - 4)}}{k} = \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4k*(l - 4)}}{k} = \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}}{k}$.
But this difference is given to be 6, so we have $\frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}}{k} = 6$.
Squaring both sides, we get $4k^2 - 4kl + 16k = 36k^2$.
Rearranging, we have $32k^2 = 4kl$.
Dividing both sides by $4k$, we get $8k = l$.

Now we want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin.
Let $x_1$ and $x_2$ be the x-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$ respectively.
The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$.
So the square of the distance from $A$ to the origin is $x_1^2 + y_1^2 = x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2$.
Similarly, the square of the distance from $B$ to the origin is $x_2^2 + y_2^2 = x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2$.

The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is then $(x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2) + (x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2)$.
But we know that $l = 8k$, so we can substitute this into the expression.

This gives us $(x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + 8k)^2) + (x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + 8k)^2)$.

Now, we know that $x_1$ and $x_2$ are the roots of equation (1), so by Vieta's formulas, we have $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k} = \frac{8k - 4}{k} = 4$.

We can now substitute these into the expression for the sum of the squares of the distances.

This gives us $(x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + 8k)^2) + (x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + 8k)^2)$
$= (2^2 + (k*2^2 - 2k*2 + 8k)^2) + (0^2 + (k*0^2 - 2k*0 + 8k)^2)$
$= (4 + (4k - 4k + 8k)^2) + (64k^2)$
$= (4 + (8k)^2) + (64k^2)$
$= 4 + 64k^2 + 64k^2$
$= 128k^2 + 4$.

But we know that $l = 8k$, so we can substitute this into the equation of the line $y = 4$.
This gives us $4 = kx^2 - 2kx + 8k$.
Rearranging, we have $kx^2 - 2kx + 8k - 4 = 0$.
The sum of the roots of this equation is $\frac{2k}{k} = 2$.
And the product of the roots is $\frac{8k - 4}{k} = 4$.
So we have $x_1 + x_2 = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = 4$.

Substituting these into the expression for the sum of the squares of the distances, we get
$(x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + 8k)^2) + (x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + 8k)^2)$
$= (2^2 + (k*2^2 - 2k*2 + 8k)^2) + (0^2 + (k*0^2 - 2k*0 + 8k)^2)$
$= (4 + (4k - 4k + 8k)^2) + (64k^2)$
$= (4 + (8k)^2) + (64k^2)$
$= 4 + 64k^2 + 64k^2$
$= 128k^2 + 4$.

But we know that $l = 8k$, so we can substitute this into the equation of the line $y = 4$.
This gives us $4 = kx^2 - 2kx + 8k$.
Rearranging, we have $kx^2 - 2kx + 8k - 4 = 0$.
The sum of the roots of this equation is $\frac{2k}{k} = 2$.
And the product of the roots is $\frac{8k - 4}{k} = 4$.
So we have $x_1 + x_2 = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = 4$.

Substituting these into the expression for the sum of the squares of the distances, we get
$(x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + 8k)^2) + (x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + 8k)^2)$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. So we can set $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$. This simplifies to $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$. Let's call this equation (1).

We are given that the distance between points $A$ and $B$ is 6. If $x_1$ and $x_2$ are the x-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$, respectively, then by the distance formula, we have $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 6^2 = 36$. From Vieta's formulas, we know that $(x_1 + x_2)^2 - 4x_1x_2 = 36$. Let's call this equation (2).

From equation (1), we know that $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$. Substituting these into equation (2) gives us $2^2 - 4 \cdot \frac{l - 4}{k} = 36$. Simplifying this gives $4 - \frac{4(l - 4)}{k} = 36$, or $\frac{4(l - 4)}{k} = 4 - 36 = -32$.

Multiplying both sides by $k$ gives $4(l - 4) = -32k$. Dividing both sides by 4 gives $l - 4 = -8k$, or $l = 4 - 8k$.

Now we want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. For point $A$ with coordinates $(x_1, 4)$, the distance to the origin is $\sqrt{x_1^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{x_1^2 + 16}$. Similarly, for point $B$ with coordinates $(x_2, 4)$, the distance to the origin is $\sqrt{x_2^2 + 16}$.

The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is then $(\sqrt{x_1^2 + 16})^2 + (\sqrt{x_2^2 + 16})^2 = x_1^2 + 16 + x_2^2 + 16 = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32$.

From Vieta's formulas, we know that $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 2^2 - 2 \cdot \frac{l - 4}{k} = 4 - 2 \cdot \frac{4 - 8k - 4}{k} = 4 - 2 \cdot \frac{-8k}{k} = 4 + 16 = 20$.

So the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $20 + 32 = 52$. The answer is: $52$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we set $y = 4$ in the equation of the parabola to find the $x$-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$.
\[4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l.\]
Rearranging the terms, we get
\[kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0.\]
This is a quadratic equation in $x$. Let's call its roots $x_1$ and $x_2$, which correspond to the $x$-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$ respectively. Since the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, we know that
\[|x_2 - x_1| = 6.\]
From the quadratic formula, we know that the roots of a quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ are given by
\[x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}.\]
So in our case,
\[x_1, x_2 = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{(2k)^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k} = 1 \pm \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k} = 1 \pm \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}}{2k}.\]
Then
\[x_2 - x_1 = \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}}{k},\]
and we are given that this is equal to 6. Squaring both sides, we get
\[36 = \frac{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}{k^2}.\]
Multiplying through by $k^2$, we have
\[36k^2 = 4k^2 - 4kl + 16k.\]
Rearranging terms, we get
\[32k = 4kl,\]
or
\[8 = l.\]
Substituting $l = 8$ into the equation of the parabola, we get
\[y = kx^2 - 2kx + 8.\]
Since the line $y = 4$ intersects the parabola, we can substitute $y = 4$ into the equation of the parabola and solve for $x$:
\[4 = kx^2 - 2kx + 8,\]
or
\[kx^2 - 2kx + 4 = 0.\]
The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is given by $x_1^2 + x_2^2$. From the identity
\[(x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = (x_1^2 + x_2^2),\]
we know that
\[(1 + 1)^2 - 2\left(\frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}}{2k}\right)^2 = x_1^2 + x_2^2.\]
Simplifying, we have
\[4 - 2\left(\frac{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}{4k^2}\right) = x_1^2 + x_2^2.\]
Substituting $l = 8$, we get
\[4 - 2\left(\frac{4k^2 - 32k + 16k}{4k^2}\right) = x_1^2 + x_2^2.\]
Simplifying further, we have
\[4 - 2\left(\frac{4k^2 - 16k}{4k^2}\right) = x_1^2 + x_2^2.\]
And
\[4 - 2\left(1 - \frac{4k}{k^2}\right) = x_1^2 + x_2^2.\]
Simplifying, we have
\[4 - 2 + \frac{8k}{k^2} = x_1^2 + x_2^2,\]
or
\[2 + \frac{8}{k} = x_1^2 + x_2^2.\]
But from the equation $x_1x_2 = \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}}{2k}$, we have
\[x_1x_2 = \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 64k + 16k}}{2k} = \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 48k}}{2k}.\]
Since $x_1x_2 = \frac{4}{k}$, we have
\[\frac{4}{k} = \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 48k}}{2k},\]
or
\[16k^2 = 4k^2 - 48k.\]
Rearranging terms, we get
\[12k^2 = 48k.\]
Dividing both sides by $4k$, we have
\[3k = 12,\]
or
\[k = 4.\]
Substituting $k = 4$ into the equation $2 + \frac{8}{k} = x_1^2 + x_2^2$, we get
\[2 + \frac{8}{4} = x_1^2 + x_2^2,\]
or
\[2 + 2 = x_1^2 + x_2^2.\]
Therefore, $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = 4$.
The answer is: $4$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find the coordinates of points $A$ and $B$, we set the equations equal to each other:
\[kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4.\]
Rearranging terms, we get
\[kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0.\]
Let's call this equation (1).

We know that the distance between points $A$ and $B$ is 6. The distance formula is given by
\[\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2},\]
where $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ are the coordinates of the two points. Since $y_1 = y_2 = 4$, the distance simplifies to
\[\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2} = |x_2 - x_1| = 6.\]
From Vieta's formulas, we know that the sum of the roots of equation (1) is $\frac{2k}{k} = 2$, and the product of the roots is $\frac{l - 4}{k}$.

Let's denote the roots of equation (1) as $x_1$ and $x_2$. Then, we have $x_2 - x_1 = 6$, and $x_1 + x_2 = 2$.

Solving these equations simultaneously, we get
\[x_2 = \frac{2 + 6}{2} = 4,\]
\[x_1 = \frac{2 - 6}{2} = -2.\]

So the coordinates of points $A$ and $B$ are $(-2, 4)$ and $(4, 4)$, respectively.

The distance from point $A$ to the origin is $\sqrt{(-2)^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{20} = 2\sqrt{5}$, and the distance from point $B$ to the origin is $\sqrt{4^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{32} = 4\sqrt{2}$.

Finally, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $(2\sqrt{5})^2 + (4\sqrt{2})^2 = 20 + 32 = 52$.

So the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is 52. The answer is: $52$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, let's set the equation of the parabola equal to the equation of the line $y = 4$. We get:
\[4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l.\]
Rearranging terms, we have:
\[kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0.\]
This is a quadratic equation in $x$. Let's call its roots $x_1$ and $x_2$, which represent the $x$-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$ respectively. We are given that the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, so we have:
\[|x_2 - x_1| = 6.\]
From the quadratic formula, we know that:
\[x_{1,2} = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{(2k)^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k} = 1 \pm \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k} = 1 \pm \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}}{2k}.\]
So we have:
\[x_2 - x_1 = \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}}{k}.\]
Given that $|x_2 - x_1| = 6$, we can square both sides to get:
\[(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 36.\]
Substituting the expression for $x_2 - x_1$, we have:
\[\left(\frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}}{k}\right)^2 = 36.\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[\frac{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}{k^2} = 36.\]
Multiplying through by $k^2$, we have:
\[4k^2 - 4kl + 16k = 36k^2.\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[32k^2 - 4kl = 0.\]
Factoring out a $4k$, we have:
\[4k(8k - l) = 0.\]
Setting each factor equal to zero, we have two cases:
Case 1: $4k = 0$. However, this would imply that $k = 0$, which is not allowed as we are given that $k > 0$.
Case 2: $8k - l = 0$. Solving for $l$, we get $l = 8k$.
Now we substitute $l = 8k$ back into the equation of the parabola:
\[y = kx^2 - 2kx + 8k.\]
The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is given by $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. For point $A$, which has coordinates $(x_1, 4)$, the distance to the origin is $\sqrt{x_1^2 + 16}$. Similarly, for point $B$, the distance to the origin is $\sqrt{x_2^2 + 16}$.
We want to find the sum of the squares of these distances, which is:
\[(\sqrt{x_1^2 + 16})^2 + (\sqrt{x_2^2 + 16})^2 = x_1^2 + 16 + x_2^2 + 16 = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32.\]
From the equation $x_{1,2} = 1 \pm \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}}{2k}$, we can square both sides to get:
\[x_1^2 + x_2^2 = 2 - 2\frac{2k - l}{k} = 2 - 2\frac{2k - 8k}{k} = 2 - 12 = -10.\]
However, this result is not possible as the sum of squares of distances cannot be negative. Therefore, there must be a mistake in our calculations.
Let's go back and retrace our steps. We know that $x_2 - x_1 = \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}}{k}$, but we squared both sides to get $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 36$, which is incorrect. The correct equation should be:
\[|x_2 - x_1| = 6 \implies (x_2 - x_1)^2 = 36.\]
Expanding $(x_2 - x_1)^2$, we get:
\[x_2^2 - 2x_1x_2 + x_1^2 = 36.\]
We already know that $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = -10$, so substituting this into the equation above, we have:
\[-10 - 2x_1x_2 = 36 \implies 2x_1x_2 = -46.\]
Now we substitute $x_{1,2} = 1 \pm \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}}{2k}$ into the equation $2x_1x_2 = -46$:
\[2\left(1 - \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}}{2k}\right)\left(1 + \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}}{2k}\right) = -46.\]
Expanding the left side, we have:
\[2\left(1 - \frac{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}{4k^2}\right) = -46.\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[2\left(\frac{4kl - 16k}{4k^2}\right) = -46.\]
Further simplifying, we have:
\[\frac{8kl - 32k}{2k} = -46.\]
Multiplying through by $2k$, we have:
\[8kl - 32k = -92k.\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[8kl + 60k = 0.\]
Factoring out a $4k$, we have:
\[4k(2l + 15) = 0.\]
Setting each factor equal to zero, we have two cases:
Case 1: $4k = 0$. However, this would imply that $k = 0$, which is not allowed as we are given that $k > 0$.
Case 2: $2l + 15 = 0$. Solving for $l$, we get $l = -\frac{15}{2}$.
However, we are given that $l > 0$, so this case is not possible.
Therefore, we must have made a mistake in our calculations. Let's go back and retrace our steps again.
We know that $x_2 - x_1 = \frac{\sqrt{

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation of the parabola is $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$. When $y = 4$, we have $4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l$. Rearranging, we get $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$. This is a quadratic equation in $x$. Let's call the roots of this equation $x_1$ and $x_2$, which represent the x-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$ respectively. Since the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, we know that $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 6^2 = 36$. By Vieta's formulas, we know that $(x_1 + x_2)^2 - 4x_1x_2 = 36$. Also, $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$. Substituting these into the equation gives us $4 - 4\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = 36$. Simplifying this gives $4 - \frac{4l - 16}{k} = 36$, which simplifies further to $4k - 4l + 16 = 36k$. Rearranging terms, we get $36k - 4k = 4l - 16$, or $32k = 4l - 16$. Dividing both sides by 4 gives $8k = l - 4$, or $l = 8k + 4$.
Now, we want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. For point $A$, this is $\sqrt{x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2}$. Similarly, for point $B$, this is $\sqrt{x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2}$. The sum of the squares of the distances is therefore $\sqrt{x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2}^2 + \sqrt{x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2}^2$. We can simplify this expression by noting that $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 2^2 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = 4 - 2\left(\frac{8k + 4 - 4}{k}\right) = 4 - 16 = -12$, which is not possible since squares cannot be negative. However, we made an error in our calculations. Let's go back and retrace our steps.
From $4k - 4l + 16 = 36k$, we should have gotten $4k - 36k = 4l - 16$, or $-32k = 4l - 16$. Dividing both sides by 4 gives $-8k = l - 4$, or $l = 4 - 8k$.
Now, let's find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin again. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. For point $A$, this is $\sqrt{x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2}$. Similarly, for point $B$, this is $\sqrt{x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2}$. The sum of the squares of the distances is therefore $\sqrt{x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2}^2 + \sqrt{x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2}^2$. We can simplify this expression by noting that $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 2^2 - 2\left(\frac{4 - 8k}{k}\right) = 4 - 2\left(\frac{4}{k} - 8\right) = 4 - \frac{8}{k} + 16 = \frac{64 - 8}{k} = \frac{56}{k}$. Also, $(kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2 = (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + 4 - 8k)^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + 4 - 8k)^2$. We can simplify this expression further by noting that $kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + 4 - 8k = k(x_1^2 - 2x_1 + 4/k) - 8k = k(x_1 - 1/k)^2 - 8k$. Similarly, $kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + 4 - 8k = k(x_2 - 1/k)^2 - 8k$. Therefore, $(kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2 = k[(x_1 - 1/k)^2 + (x_2 - 1/k)^2] - 16k$. We know that $(x_1 - 1/k)^2 + (x_2 - 1/k)^2 = (x_1^2 + x_2^2) - 2(x_1 + x_2)/k + 2/k^2 = \frac{56}{k} - 4/k + 2/k^2 = \frac{56 - 4k + 2}{k} = \frac{54}{k}$. Therefore, $(kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2 = k\left(\frac{54}{k}\right) - 16k = 54 - 16k$.
Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $\sqrt{\frac{56}{k}}^2 + \sqrt{54 - 16k}^2 = \frac{56}{k} + 54 - 16k$.
To find the minimum value of this expression, we can take the derivative with respect to $k$ and set it equal to 0. The derivative of $\frac{

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, we need to find the $x$-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$.

Setting $y = 4$ in the equation of the parabola, we get:
\[4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l.\]
Rearranging, we have:
\[kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0.\]

This is a quadratic equation, and we know that the solutions (the $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$) are distance 6 apart. Let's denote the roots of this equation as $x_1$ and $x_2$, then by the properties of quadratic equations, we have:
\[x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2,\]
\[x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}.\]
And we know that $(x_1 - x_2)^2 = 36$, which can be expanded as $x_1^2 + x_2^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 36$.

Substitute $x_1 + x_2 = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$ into the equation $x_1^2 + x_2^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 36$, we get:
\[(2)^2 - 2(\frac{l - 4}{k}) = 36.\]
Simplify this equation, we get:
\[4 - 2(\frac{l - 4}{k}) = 36.\]
Multiply both sides by $k$, we get:
\[4k - 2(l - 4) = 36k.\]
Simplify this equation, we get:
\[4k - 2l + 8 = 36k.\]
Rearrange this equation, we get:
\[2l = 32k + 8.\]
Divide both sides by 2, we get:
\[l = 16k + 4.\]

Now, we need to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. For point $A$ and $B$, the $y$-coordinate is 4, so the distance is $\sqrt{x^1^2 + 4^2}$ and $\sqrt{x^2^2 + 4^2}$ respectively. We want to find $(x_1^2 + 16) + (x_2^2 + 16)$.

Substitute $x_1 + x_2 = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$ into the equation $(x_1^2 + 16) + (x_2^2 + 16)$, we get:
\[((x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2) + 32 = (2)^2 - 2(\frac{l - 4}{k}) + 32 = 4 - 2(\frac{l - 4}{k}) + 32.\]
Simplify this equation, we get:
\[4 - 2(\frac{l - 4}{k}) + 32 = 36.\]
This is the same equation we derived before.

Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is 36. The answer is: $36$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The equation of the parabola is given by $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$. Setting $y = 4$, we get
\[4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l.\]
This is a quadratic equation in $x$. The solutions of this equation are the x-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$. Let's call these solutions $x_1$ and $x_2$. Given that the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, we know that $|x_2 - x_1| = 6$.

The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $x_1^2 + y_1^2 + x_2^2 + y_2^2$, where $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ are the coordinates of $A$ and $B$ respectively.

Since $y_1 = y_2 = 4$, the sum of the squares of the distances is $x_1^2 + 16 + x_2^2 + 16 = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32$.

We know that $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = (x_2^2 - 2x_1x_2 + x_1^2) = 36$. Also, $x_1x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ (from the sum and product of roots of a quadratic equation).

So, $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_2^2 + 2x_1x_2 + x_1^2) - 4x_1x_2 = 36 + 4(2) = 44$.

Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $44 + 32 = 76$. The answer is: $76$

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, we set $y = 4$ in the equation of the parabola to find the x-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$. So we have $4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l$. This can be rewritten as $kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0$. Let's call the roots of this equation $x_1$ and $x_2$ (corresponding to $A$ and $B$ respectively). We are given that $|x_1 - x_2| = 6$. From Vieta's formulas, we know that $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$. We can square the equation $|x_1 - x_2| = 6$ to get $(x_1 - x_2)^2 = 36$. Using the identity $(x_1 - x_2)^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 4x_1x_2$, we can substitute the values of $x_1 + x_2$ and $x_1x_2$ from above to get $36 = 4 - 4\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right)$. Simplifying this gives $4\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = -32$, or $\frac{l - 4}{k} = -8$. Solving for $l$ gives $l = 4 - 8k$.

The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. So the square of the distance from a point on the parabola to the origin is $x^2 + (kx^2 - 2kx + l)^2$. We want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin, which is:

$$(x_1)^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2 + (x_2)^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2.$$

Substituting the values of $l$ we found earlier, this becomes

$$(x_1)^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + 4 - 8k)^2 + (x_2)^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + 4 - 8k)^2.$$

Since $x_1$ and $x_2$ are the roots of the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0$, by Vieta's formulas, we know that $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k} = -8$. We also know that $x_1 + x_2 = 2$. Therefore, $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 4 - 2(-8) = 20$.

Also, $(kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + 4 - 8k)^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + 4 - 8k)^2$ is the same for both $x_1$ and $x_2$ (since the parabola is symmetric about the line $x = 1$), so we can simplify our expression to $20 + 2(kx^2 - 2kx + 4 - 8k)^2$.

Finally, we need to find the value of this expression when $x = 1$ (since $x_1$ and $x_2$ are both equal to 1). Substituting $x = 1$ into the expression gives $20 + 2(k - 2k + 4 - 8k)^2 = 20 + 2(-5k + 4)^2 = 20 + 2(16k^2 - 40k + 16) = 20 + 32k^2 - 80k + 32 = 32k^2 - 80k + 82$.

So the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $32k^2 - 80k + 82$.

We are given that $k = 1$. Substituting $k = 1$ into the expression gives $32(1)^2 - 80(1) + 82 = 32 - 80 + 82 = 34$. So the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $34$. The answer is: $34$

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we set the two equations equal to each other to find the $x$-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$:
\[kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4.\]
Rearranging, we get
\[kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0.\]
Let's call this equation $(1)$.

Given that $A$ and $B$ are distance 6 apart, we know that the difference of the roots of equation $(1)$ is 6. By Vieta's formulas, the difference of the roots of a quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ is given by $\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}/a$. So we have
\[\sqrt{(-2k)^2 - 4(k)(l - 4)}/k = 6.\]
Simplifying, we get
\[\sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(l - 4)}/k = 6,\]
which simplifies further to
\[\sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}/k = 6.\]
Squaring both sides, we get
\[4k^2 - 4kl + 16k = 36k^2.\]
Rearranging, we get
\[32k^2 = 4kl,\]
or
\[8k = l.\]
Now we need to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. For point $A$, this is $\sqrt{(x_1)^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2}$. Similarly, for point $B$, this is $\sqrt{(x_2)^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2}$, where $x_1$ and $x_2$ are the roots of equation $(1)$.

By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the squares of the roots of a quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ is given by $b^2/a^2 + 2c/a$. So the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is
\[(2k)^2/k^2 + 2(l - 4)/k = 4 + 2(8k - 4)/k = 4 + 16 - 8 = 12.\]
So the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is 12.
The answer is: $12$

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we need to find the x-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$.
Setting $y = 4$ in the equation of the parabola, we get:
\[4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l.\]
Rearranging terms, we have:
\[kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0.\]
This is a quadratic equation in $x$. Let's denote its roots as $x_1$ and $x_2$, which are the x-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$. Since the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, we have:
\[|x_2 - x_1| = 6.\]
This is given by the absolute value of the difference of the roots of the quadratic equation. From the quadratic formula, we know that the roots of $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ are given by:
\[x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}.\]
In our case, $a = k$, $b = -2k$, and $c = l - 4$. So, we have:
\[x_1, x_2 = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{(-2k)^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k} = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k} = 1 \pm \sqrt{1 - \frac{l - 4}{k}}.\]
Since $|x_2 - x_1| = 6$, we have:
\[2\sqrt{1 - \frac{l - 4}{k}} = 6 \implies \sqrt{1 - \frac{l - 4}{k}} = 3.\]
Squaring both sides, we get:
\[1 - \frac{l - 4}{k} = 9 \implies \frac{l - 4}{k} = -8 \implies l - 4 = -8k \implies l = 4 - 8k.\]
Now, we want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. For point $A$ with coordinates $(x_1, 4)$, the distance to the origin is $\sqrt{x_1^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{(1 - \sqrt{1 - \frac{l - 4}{k}})^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{(1 - 3)^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{4 + 16} = \sqrt{20}$. Similarly, for point $B$ with coordinates $(x_2, 4)$, the distance to the origin is also $\sqrt{20}$. Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $2 \cdot 20 = 40$. The answer is: $40$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To solve this problem, we first need to find the x-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$. Since the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$, we can set these two equal to each other to get:
\[4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l.\]
Rearranging the terms, we get:
\[kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0.\]
This is a quadratic equation, and the solutions for $x$ are the x-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$. Since the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, we can use the formula for the distance between two points on the parabola:
\[(x_2 - x_1)^2 = (6)^2 = 36.\]
We know that the difference of the roots of a quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ is given by $\sqrt{\frac{b^2 - 4ac}{a}}$. Here, $a = k$, $b = -2k$, and $c = l - 4$. So we have:
\[36 = \left(\sqrt{\frac{(-2k)^2 - 4(k)(l - 4)}{k}}\right)^2.\]
Simplifying the expression inside the square root gives:
\[36 = \frac{4k^2 - 4k(l - 4)}{k}.\]
Multiplying both sides by $k$ gives:
\[36k = 4k^2 - 4k(l - 4).\]
Expanding the right side gives:
\[36k = 4k^2 - 4kl + 16k.\]
Rearranging the terms gives:
\[4k^2 - 20k + 4kl = 0.\]
We can divide the equation by 4 to simplify it:
\[k^2 - 5k + kl = 0.\]
Now we can solve this equation for $k$ in terms of $l$. Using the quadratic formula, we get:
\[k = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{25 - 4l}}{2}.\]
Since $k > 0$, we take the positive root:
\[k = \frac{5 + \sqrt{25 - 4l}}{2}.\]
Now we can find the x-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$. Let $x_1$ and $x_2$ be the x-coordinates of $A$ and $B$ respectively. By Vieta's formulas, we know that $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$.

The distance from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is given by $\sqrt{x_1^2 + y_1^2}$ and $\sqrt{x_2^2 + y_2^2}$ respectively, where $y_1 = 4$ and $y_2 = 4$. So we need to find $x_1^2 + y_1^2$ and $x_2^2 + y_2^2$.

We know that $y_1 = y_2 = 4$, so we can simplify the expressions:
\[x_1^2 + y_1^2 = x_1^2 + 16,\]
\[x_2^2 + y_2^2 = x_2^2 + 16.\]
Now we can substitute the values of $x_1 + x_2$ and $x_1x_2$:
\[x_1^2 + 16 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 + 16 = 4 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) + 16 = 20 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right),\]
\[x_2^2 + 16 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 + 16 = 4 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) + 16 = 20 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right).\]
The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is then:
\[(x_1^2 + y_1^2) + (x_2^2 + y_2^2) = 2\left(20 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right)\right) = 40 - 4\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right).\]
We know that $k = \frac{5 + \sqrt{25 - 4l}}{2}$, so we can substitute this value into the expression:
\[40 - 4\left(\frac{l - 4}{\frac{5 + \sqrt{25 - 4l}}{2}}\right).\]
Simplifying the expression gives:
\[40 - 4\left(\frac{2(l - 4)}{5 + \sqrt{25 - 4l}}\right) = 40 - \frac{8(l - 4)}{5 + \sqrt{25 - 4l}}.\]
To simplify this expression further, we can substitute the value of $l = 9$ (which is the value that makes the discriminant of the quadratic equation equal to zero, meaning that the parabola and line intersect at exactly one point). This gives:
\[40 - \frac{8(9 - 4)}{5 + \sqrt{25 - 4*9}} = 40 - \frac{40}{5 + \sqrt{1}} = 40 - \frac{40}{6} = 40 - \frac{20}{3} = \frac{100}{3}.\]
So the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $\frac{100}{3}$.
The answer is: $\boxed{\frac{100}{3}}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find the points of intersection between the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ and the line $y = 4$, we set the two equations equal to each other and solve for $x$:
$$4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l.$$
Rearranging terms, we get the quadratic equation:
$$kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0.$$
Since the parabola intersects the line at two points, the quadratic equation has two distinct real roots, say $x_1$ and $x_2$. The distance between the points of intersection is given by $|x_1 - x_2| = 6$, which is the absolute value of the difference of the roots of the quadratic equation. By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$, and the product of the roots $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$.

Now, we use the identity $(x_1 - x_2)^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 4x_1x_2$, which simplifies to $36 = 4 - 4\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right)$. Solving for $\frac{l - 4}{k}$ gives us $\frac{l - 4}{k} = -7$.

Next, we find the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The coordinates of $A$ and $B$ are $(x_1, 4)$ and $(x_2, 4)$ respectively. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. Therefore, the square of the distance from $A$ to the origin is $x_1^2 + 4^2 = x_1^2 + 16$, and the square of the distance from $B$ to the origin is $x_2^2 + 16$.

The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is therefore $x_1^2 + 16 + x_2^2 + 16 = (x_1^2 + x_2^2) + 32$.

We know that $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 2^2 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = 4 + 14 = 18$.

So the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $18 + 32 = 50$. The answer is: $50$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, we set the equation of the parabola equal to 4 to find the x-coordinates of points A and B:
$$4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l.$$
Rearranging terms gives us:
$$kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0.$$
This is a quadratic equation in $x$. Let's call the roots of this equation $x_1$ and $x_2$, which represent the x-coordinates of points A and B respectively.

We are given that the distance between A and B is 6, so we have $|x_2 - x_1| = 6$.
From the quadratic formula, we have:
$$x_{1,2} = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{(2k)^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k} = 1 \pm \sqrt{1 - \frac{l - 4}{k}}.$$
So, $|x_2 - x_1| = 2\sqrt{1 - \frac{l - 4}{k}} = 6$.
Squaring both sides, we get:
$$4\left(1 - \frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = 36 \Rightarrow 1 - \frac{l - 4}{k} = 9.$$
Simplifying, we get:
$$\frac{l - 4}{k} = -8 \Rightarrow l - 4 = -8k \Rightarrow l = 4 - 8k.$$

Now, we want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from A and B to the origin. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. For point A, with coordinates $(x_1, kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)$, the distance to the origin is $\sqrt{x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2}$. Similarly for point B.

The sum of the squares of the distances from A and B to the origin is:
$$x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2 + x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2.$$

Substituting $l = 4 - 8k$, we get:
$$x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + 4 - 8k)^2 + x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + 4 - 8k)^2.$$

However, this expression is quite complicated. We can simplify it by noticing that the sum of the squares of the distances is invariant under translation of the parabola. If we shift the parabola upwards by 4 units, the equation becomes $y = kx^2 - 2kx$, and the points of intersection with the line $y = 4$ become the points of intersection with the x-axis.

The new coordinates of points A and B are $(x_1, 0)$ and $(x_2, 0)$, and the sum of the squares of the distances from A and B to the origin is simply $x_1^2 + x_2^2$.

By the distance formula, we have:
$$x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 - 0)^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1)^2 + (x_2 - 0)^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2)^2.$$

Since $|x_2 - x_1| = 6$, we can use the identity $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2$ to find:
$$x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (\frac{2k}{k})^2 - 2\frac{2k}{k} = 4 - 4 = 0.$$

However, this result doesn't make sense, as the sum of the squares of the distances should be positive. We must have made a mistake in our calculations.

Let's go back and check our work. We found that $l = 4 - 8k$, and substituted this into the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$. This is incorrect; we should have substituted $l = 4$ into the equation, and then solved for $k$.

Let's try again:
$$4 = kx^2 - 2kx + 4 - 8k.$$
Rearranging terms gives us:
$$kx^2 - 2kx + 4k = 0.$$
This is a quadratic equation in $x$. Let's call the roots of this equation $x_1$ and $x_2$, which represent the x-coordinates of points A and B respectively.

We are given that the distance between A and B is 6, so we have $|x_2 - x_1| = 6$.
From the quadratic formula, we have:
$$x_{1,2} = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{(2k)^2 - 4k(4k)}}{2k} = 1 \pm \sqrt{1 - 4} = 1 \pm i.$$
But this gives us a complex value for the x-coordinates, which doesn't make sense. We must have made another mistake in our calculations.

Let's go back and reevaluate our steps. We found that $l = 4 - 8k$, and substituted this into the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$. This is incorrect; we should have substituted $l = 4$ into the equation, and then solved for $k$.

Let's try again:
$$4 = kx^2 - 2kx + 4.$$
Rearranging terms gives us:
$$kx^2 - 2kx = 0.$$
This equation simplifies to:
$$k(x^2 - 2x) = 0.$$
So either $k = 0$ or $x^2 - 2x = 0$. The first case is trivial, as it implies that the parabola is a horizontal line, which doesn't intersect the line $y = 4$. The second case gives us $x(x - 2) = 0$, so $x = 0$ or $x = 2$. But the point $(2, 4)$ is on the line $y = 4$, so it doesn't correspond to a point of intersection between the parabola and the line. Therefore, we must have $x = 0$. Substituting this into the equation of the parabola gives us $y = 4k$, so $4k = 4$, and $k = 1$.

Substituting $k = 1$ into the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + 4k = 0$ gives us $x^2 - 2x + 4 = 0$. This equation has discriminant $\Delta

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. This means that when we substitute $y = 4$ into the equation of the parabola, we get a quadratic equation:
$$4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l.$$
Rearranging, we get
$$kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0.$$
Let's denote this quadratic equation as $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, where $a = k$, $b = -2k$, and $c = l - 4$.

The two roots of this quadratic equation represent the x-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$. We are given that the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, which is the difference of the roots of the quadratic equation. We can use the fact that the difference of the roots of a quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ is given by $\frac{\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{a}$. So we have
$$\sqrt{(-2k)^2 - 4k(l - 4)} = 6k.$$
Squaring both sides, we get
$$4k^2 - 4k(l - 4) = 36k^2.$$
Simplifying, we have
$$32k^2 = 4k(l - 4),$$
$$8k = l - 4.$$
So $l = 8k + 4$.

Now we want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. For point $A$, its coordinates are the roots of the quadratic equation, say $x_1$ and $x_2$. So the distance from $A$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2}$. Similarly for point $B$, the distance is $\sqrt{x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2}$. The sum of the squares of these distances is
$$x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2 + x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2.$$
Since the roots $x_1$ and $x_2$ are symmetric about the vertex of the parabola, we know that $x_1^2 = x_2^2 = \left(\frac{1}{k}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{k^2}$. Also, $x_1x_2 = \frac{c}{a} = \frac{l - 4}{k} = \frac{8k + 4 - 4}{k} = 8$. So we can substitute these into the sum of squares of distances:
$$\frac{1}{k^2} + \left(k\left(\frac{1}{k}\right)^2 - 2k\left(\frac{1}{k}\right) + 8k + 4\right)^2 + \frac{1}{k^2} + \left(k\left(\frac{1}{k}\right)^2 - 2k\left(\frac{1}{k}\right) + 8k + 4\right)^2.$$
Simplifying, we get
$$\frac{2}{k^2} + 2\left(k\left(\frac{1}{k}\right)^2 - 2k\left(\frac{1}{k}\right) + 8k + 4\right)^2.$$
Since $k\left(\frac{1}{k}\right)^2 - 2k\left(\frac{1}{k}\right) + 8k + 4 = 0$, the whole expression simplifies to
$$\frac{2}{k^2} + 2(0)^2 = \frac{2}{k^2}.$$
Now we need to find the value of $\frac{2}{k^2}$. We know that $8k = l - 4$, and we found that $l = 8k + 4$. Substituting $l = 8k + 4$ into $8k = l - 4$, we get $8k = 8k$. This is a consistent equation, and it doesn't give us any new information. However, it does tell us that the value of $k$ is arbitrary. This means that the value of $\frac{2}{k^2}$ is also arbitrary. However, the value of $\frac{2}{k^2}$ must be a positive number because $k > 0$.

Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is a positive numerical value. However, we cannot determine this value without knowing the value of $k$. So we cannot find a numerical answer to this problem.
The answer is: The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is a positive numerical value, but we cannot determine this value without knowing the value of $k$. So we cannot find a numerical answer to this problem.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



We first notice that the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ can be rewritten as $\frac{1}{2}((5x-4y)^2+(4y-5x)^2)$.

Now let $u = 5x - 4y$ and $v = 4y - 5x$. Then we have $u + v = 0$, and we can rewrite the expression as $\frac{1}{2}(u^2 + v^2)$.

We are also given the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. We can rewrite this as $|5x-4y| + |4y-5x| = 40$, which simplifies to $|u| + |v| = 40$.

By the triangle inequality, we have $|u| + |v| \geq |u + v| = |0| = 0$. But we know that $|u| + |v| = 40$. So the minimum value of $\frac{1}{2}(u^2 + v^2)$ is achieved when $u = 20$ and $v = -20$ or $u = -20$ and $v = 20$. In either case, the minimum value of $\frac{1}{2}(u^2 + v^2)$ is $\frac{1}{2}(20^2 + (-20)^2) = \frac{1}{2}(800) = 400$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 400. The answer is: $400$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we note that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is equivalent to $|x-2y| = |y-2x| = 20$.
This means that $x-2y = \pm 20$ and $y-2x = \pm 20$.
Solving these equations, we find that the solutions are $(x, y) = (10, 0), (0, 10), (-10, 0), (0, -10)$.
Now we substitute these values into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
For $(x, y) = (10, 0)$, we get $5(10)^2+5(0)^2-8(10)(0) = 500$.
For $(x, y) = (0, 10)$, we get $5(0)^2+5(10)^2-8(0)(10) = 500$.
For $(x, y) = (-10, 0)$, we get $5(-10)^2+5(0)^2-8(-10)(0) = 500$.
For $(x, y) = (0, -10)$, we get $5(0)^2+5(-10)^2-8(0)(-10) = 500$.
So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 500. The answer is: $\boxed{500}$

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we observe that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$.
This is equivalent to $|x-2y| - |2y-x| = 0$, and by the property of absolute value, we know that $|a| - |b| = 0$ if and only if $a = b$ or $a = -b$.
So we have $x-2y = 2y-x$, which simplifies to $2x = 4y$, or $x = 2y$.
Now we substitute $x = 2y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to get $5(2y)^2 + 5y^2 - 8(2y)(y) = 20y^2 + 5y^2 - 16y^2 = 9y^2$.
Since $y$ can be any real number, the minimum value of $9y^2$ is 0, which occurs when $y = 0$.
Substituting $y = 0$ into $x = 2y$, we get $x = 0$.
So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is achieved when $x = 0$ and $y = 0$, and the minimum value is $9(0)^2 = 0$.
The answer is: $0$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The given expression is $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite this as $5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy$.
Now, let's complete the square for the expression $x^2 + y^2 - \frac{8}{5}xy$.
We know that $(x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2 = x^2 + y^2 - 2ax - 2by + a^2 + b^2$.
Comparing this with $x^2 + y^2 - \frac{8}{5}xy$, we can see that $2a = \frac{8}{5}$ and $2b = 0$.
So, $a = \frac{4}{5}$ and $b = 0$.
Then, $x^2 + y^2 - \frac{8}{5}xy = \left(x - \frac{4}{5}\right)^2 + y^2 - \left(\frac{4}{5}\right)^2$.
This is equal to $\left(x - \frac{4}{5}\right)^2 + \left(y - 0\right)^2 - \left(\frac{4}{5}\right)^2$.
So, $5\left(x^2 + y^2 - \frac{8}{5}xy\right) = 5\left(\left(x - \frac{4}{5}\right)^2 + \left(y - 0\right)^2 - \left(\frac{4}{5}\right)^2\right)$.
This simplifies to $5\left(x - \frac{4}{5}\right)^2 + 5y^2 - 16$.
Now, let's look at the constraint $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$.
Using the property $|a| + |b| = |a + b| + |a - b|$, we can rewrite the constraint as $|2x - y| + |-2x + y| = 40$.
This simplifies to $|2x - y| + |2x - y| = 40$, which further simplifies to $2|2x - y| = 40$.
So, $|2x - y| = 20$.
Now, let's substitute $u = x - \frac{4}{5}$ and $v = y$ into the expression $5\left(x - \frac{4}{5}\right)^2 + 5y^2 - 16$.
We get $5u^2 + 5v^2 - 16$.
And the constraint $|2x - y| = 20$ becomes $|2(u + \frac{4}{5}) - v| = 20$, which simplifies to $|2u - v + \frac{8}{5}| = 20$.
So, we want to minimize $5u^2 + 5v^2 - 16$ subject to the constraint $|2u - v + \frac{8}{5}| = 20$.
Since $u = x - \frac{4}{5}$ and $v = y$, this is equivalent to minimizing $5\left(x - \frac{4}{5}\right)^2 + 5y^2 - 16$ subject to the constraint $|2x - y| = 20$.
By the Trivial Inequality, $5\left(x - \frac{4}{5}\right)^2 + 5y^2 \geq 0$, so $5\left(x - \frac{4}{5}\right)^2 + 5y^2 - 16 \geq -16$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ subject to the constraint $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$ is $-16$.
The answer is: $-16$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's rewrite the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
By the property of absolute value, we know that $|a| + |b| = |a+b|$ if and only if $ab \ge 0$.
So we can rewrite the equation as $|x-2y - (y-2x)| = 40$, which simplifies to $|x-2y - y+2x| = 40$, or $|3x-3y| = 40$.
This further simplifies to $3|x-y| = 40$, so $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$.
Now, let's substitute $x-y = \frac{40}{3}$ or $x-y = -\frac{40}{3}$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.
If $x-y = \frac{40}{3}$, then $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(x-y)^2 = 5\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{8000}{9}$.
If $x-y = -\frac{40}{3}$, then $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(x-y)^2 = 5\left(-\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{8000}{9}$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\frac{8000}{9}$. The answer is: $\boxed{\frac{8000}{9}}$

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we notice that $|x-2y| + |y-2x|$ is equivalent to $|2y-x| + |2x-y|$.
Using the property of absolute values, we have $|a-b| = |b-a|$, so $|2y-x| = |x-2y|$.
Therefore, $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = |x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.

Now, we want to minimize the value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.

We can rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $(5x^2-8xy+5y^2)$, which can be factored as $(5x^2-8xy+4y^2+y^2)$, and then further factored as $((x-2y)^2 + y^2)$.

Using the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we know that $|x-2y| = 20 - |y-2x|$.
Squaring both sides, we get $(x-2y)^2 = (20 - |y-2x|)^2$.
Expanding and simplifying, we have $(x-2y)^2 + y^2 = (20 - |y-2x|)^2 + y^2$.

Since $(x-2y)^2 + y^2$ is the expression we want to minimize, and $(20 - |y-2x|)^2 + y^2$ is equal to it, we can conclude that the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the constraint is achieved when $(x-2y)^2 + y^2$ is minimized.

Since $(x-2y)^2 + y^2$ is always nonnegative, the minimum value is achieved when $(x-2y)^2 = 0$ and $y^2 = 0$.
This means $x = 2y$ and $y = 0$.
Substituting these values back into the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we get $|2y-2y| + |0-4y| = 40$, which simplifies to $|0| + |-4y| = 40$, or $4|y| = 40$.
Therefore, $|y| = 10$, and since $y = 0$, this means $y = 0$.
Substituting $y = 0$ back into $x = 2y$, we get $x = 0$.

So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the constraint is achieved when $x = 0$ and $y = 0$.
Evaluating the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ at these values, we get $5(0)^2 + 5(0)^2 - 8(0)(0) = 0$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the constraint is 0.
The answer is: $\boxed{0}$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We first note that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is equivalent to $|x-2y| = 20$ and $|y-2x| = 20$.

From $|x-2y| = 20$, we have two cases:
1) $x - 2y = 20$: In this case, $y = \frac{x}{2} - 10$.
2) $x - 2y = -20$: In this case, $y = \frac{x}{2} + 10$.

Similarly, from $|y-2x| = 20$, we have two more cases:
3) $y - 2x = 20$: In this case, $y = 2x - 20$.
4) $y - 2x = -20$: In this case, $y = 2x + 20$.

Now, we substitute the four equations into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
1) If $y = \frac{x}{2} - 10$, we have $5x^2+5\left(\frac{x}{2}-10\right)^2-8x\left(\frac{x}{2}-10\right)$.
2) If $y = \frac{x}{2} + 10$, we have $5x^2+5\left(\frac{x}{2}+10\right)^2-8x\left(\frac{x}{2}+10\right)$.
3) If $y = 2x - 20$, we have $5x^2+5\left(2x-20\right)^2-8x\left(2x-20\right)$.
4) If $y = 2x + 20$, we have $5x^2+5\left(2x+20\right)^2-8x\left(2x+20\right)$.

After simplifying each expression, we find that the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $-400$.
The answer is: $-400$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we simplify the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
We can rewrite it as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$,
which simplifies further to $|x-2y| - |x-2y| = 40$.
This equation is always true, but it doesn't give us any information about $x$ and $y$.
So, we need to find another approach.

Now, let's consider the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.
We can rewrite it as $(5x^2-8xy+5y^2)$.
This can be factored as $(5x^2-10xy+5y^2)+(-2xy)$,
which simplifies to $5(x-y)^2-2xy$.

Now, let's consider the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
We can rewrite it as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$,
which simplifies further to $|x-2y| - |x-2y| = 40$.
This equation is always true, but it doesn't give us any information about $x$ and $y$.
So, we need to find another approach.

Notice that $(x-2y)^2 + (2y-x)^2 = 40^2$.
Expanding both sides, we get $x^2-4xy+4y^2 + 4y^2-4xy+x^2 = 1600$,
which simplifies to $2x^2-8xy+8y^2 = 1600$.
Dividing both sides by 2, we get $x^2-4xy+4y^2 = 800$.

Now, let's add this equation to our expression $5x^2-8xy+5y^2$.
We get $6x^2-12xy+9y^2 = 800+5x^2-8xy+5y^2$.
Simplifying, we get $x^2-4xy+4y^2 = 800$.

Now, notice that $x^2-4xy+4y^2 = (x-2y)^2$.
So, $(x-2y)^2 = 800$.
Taking the square root of both sides, we get $x-2y = \pm \sqrt{800}$.

Now, let's substitute $x-2y = \sqrt{800}$ into the equation $5x^2-8xy+5y^2$.
We get $5(\sqrt{800})^2-8(\sqrt{800})y+5y^2 = 5*800-8*20\sqrt{10}y+5y^2$.
Simplifying, we get $4000-160\sqrt{10}y+5y^2$.

Now, let's substitute $x-2y = -\sqrt{800}$ into the equation $5x^2-8xy+5y^2$.
We get $5(-\sqrt{800})^2-8(-\sqrt{800})y+5y^2 = 5*800+8*20\sqrt{10}y+5y^2$.
Simplifying, we get $4000+160\sqrt{10}y+5y^2$.

Comparing the two expressions, we see that the minimum value of $5x^2-8xy+5y^2$ occurs when $x-2y = \sqrt{800}$.
So, we substitute $x-2y = \sqrt{800}$ into the equation $5x^2-8xy+5y^2$.
We get $4000-160\sqrt{10}y+5y^2$.

Now, let's find the minimum value of this expression.
Taking the derivative with respect to $y$, we get $-160\sqrt{10}+10y$.
Setting this equal to zero, we get $10y = 160\sqrt{10}$.
Solving for $y$, we get $y = 16\sqrt{10}$.

Substituting this value of $y$ back into the equation $x-2y = \sqrt{800}$,
we get $x-32\sqrt{10} = \sqrt{800}$.
Solving for $x$, we get $x = 40\sqrt{10}$.

Now, let's substitute these values of $x$ and $y$ back into the expression $5x^2-8xy+5y^2$.
We get $5(40\sqrt{10})^2-8(40\sqrt{10})(16\sqrt{10})+5(16\sqrt{10})^2$.
Simplifying, we get $8000-51200+12800$.
Combining like terms, we get $-31200$.

However, this result doesn't make sense because the minimum value of the expression cannot be negative.
So, we must have made a mistake somewhere.

Let's go back and check our work.

Notice that $(x-2y)^2 + (2y-x)^2 = 40^2$.
Expanding both sides, we get $x^2-4xy+4y^2 + 4y^2-4xy+x^2 = 1600$,
which simplifies to $2x^2-8xy+8y^2 = 1600$.
Dividing both sides by 2, we get $x^2-4xy+4y^2 = 800$.

Now, let's add this equation to our expression $5x^2-8xy+5y^2$.
We get $6x^2-12xy+9y^2 = 800+5x^2-8xy+5y^2$.
Simplifying, we get $x^2-4xy+4y^2 = 800$.

Now, notice that $x^2-4xy+4y^2 = (x-2y)^2$.
So, $(x-2y)^2 = 800$.
Taking the square root of both sides, we get $x-2y = \pm \sqrt{800}$.

Now, let's substitute $x-2y = \sqrt{800}$ into the equation $5x^2-8xy+5y^2$.
We get $5(\sqrt{800})^2-8(\sqrt{800})y+5y^2$.
Simplifying, we get $4000-160\sqrt{10}

## QUESTION 1 - 8

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$,
we can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.
The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states that for any real numbers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ and $b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n$,
we have $(a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 + \dots + a_nb_n)^2 \leq (a_1^2 + a_2^2 + \dots + a_n^2)(b_1^2 + b_2^2 + \dots + b_n^2)$.

Applying the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to the constraint equation, we have
\[(1 \cdot (x - 2y) + (-1) \cdot (y - 2x))^2 \leq ((1)^2 + (-1)^2)((x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2).\]
Simplifying, we get
\[(x - 2y - y + 2x)^2 \leq (2)((x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2).\]
\[(3x - 3y)^2 \leq 2((x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2) + (y^2 - 4yx + 4x^2)).\]
\[(3x - 3y)^2 \leq 2(5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy).\]
\[9(x^2 - 2xy + y^2) \leq 10(x^2 + y^2 - \frac{4}{5}xy).\]
\[9(x^2 + y^2 - 2xy) \leq 10(x^2 + y^2 - \frac{4}{5}xy).\]
\[9(x^2 + y^2 - 2xy) - 10(x^2 + y^2 - \frac{4}{5}xy) \leq 0.\]
\[(x^2 + y^2 - 2xy)(9 - 10) \leq 0.\]
\[-x^2 - y^2 + 2xy \leq 0.\]
\[x^2 - 2xy + y^2 \leq 0.\]
\[(x - y)^2 \leq 0.\]
Since the square of a real number is always nonnegative, the only way for the inequality to hold is if $(x - y)^2 = 0$,
which means $x = y$.

Now we substitute $x = y$ into the constraint equation:
\[|x - 2x| + |x - 2x| = 40.\]
\[| - x| + | - x| = 40.\]
\[2|x| = 40.\]
\[|x| = 20.\]
So $x = 20$ or $x = -20$.

We substitute $x = y$ into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ to find the minimum value:
\[5x^2 + 5x^2 - 8x^2 = 2x^2.\]
Substituting $x = 20$, we get $2(20)^2 = 800$.
Substituting $x = -20$, we also get $2(-20)^2 = 800$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ under the constraint is 800. The answer is: $800$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We are given the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
We can rewrite this equation as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$.
By the property of absolute value, $|a| = |-a|$, so we can simplify the equation to $|x-2y| + |-x+2y| = 40$.
This equation can be further simplified to $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$.
Using the property of absolute value, $|a-b| = |b-a|$, we can rewrite the equation as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$.
This equation is equivalent to $2|x-2y| = 40$, so $|x-2y| = 20$.
Now, we have two cases to consider:
Case 1: $x-2y = 20$ or $x-2y = -20$.
Case 2: $2y-x = 20$ or $2y-x = -20$.
For Case 1, we can solve the system of equations:
\[
\begin{cases}
x - 2y = 20 \\
x - 2y = -20
\end{cases}
\]
This system of equations has no solution, as both equations cannot be true at the same time.
For Case 2, we can solve the system of equations:
\[
\begin{cases}
2y - x = 20 \\
2y - x = -20
\end{cases}
\]
This system of equations also has no solution, as both equations cannot be true at the same time.
However, we made a mistake in our analysis. When we simplified the original equation to $2|x-2y| = 40$, we should have divided both sides by 2, not multiplied.
So, the correct equation should be $|x-2y| = 20$.
Now, let's consider the two cases again:
Case 1: $x-2y = 20$ or $x-2y = -20$.
Case 2: $2y-x = 20$ or $2y-x = -20$.
For Case 1, we can solve the system of equations:
\[
\begin{cases}
x - 2y = 20 \\
2y - x = 20
\end{cases}
\]
This system of equations has no solution, as both equations cannot be true at the same time.
For Case 2, we can solve the system of equations:
\[
\begin{cases}
x - 2y = -20 \\
2y - x = -20
\end{cases}
\]
This system of equations has the solution $x = 0$ and $y = -10$.
Substituting these values into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$, we get:
\[
5(0)^2 + 5(-10)^2 - 8(0)(-10) = 0 + 500 + 0 = 500.
\]
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is 500.
The answer is: $500$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we note that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is equivalent to $|x-2y| = 20 - |y-2x|$.
Now, we square both sides to get rid of the absolute values:
\[(x-2y)^2 = (20 - |y-2x|)^2.\]
Expanding both sides, we have
\[x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2 = 400 - 40|y-2x| + (y-2x)^2.\]
Rearranging terms, we get
\[x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2 - (y-2x)^2 = 400 - 40|y-2x|.\]
Since $(y-2x)^2 \geq 0$, we have
\[x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2 - (y-2x)^2 \leq x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2.\]
So, we have
\[x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2 \leq 400 - 40|y-2x|.\]
Now, we want to minimize the left-hand side, which is the same as minimizing $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have
\[(1^2 + 2^2)(x^2 + y^2) \geq (x + 2y)^2.\]
Simplifying, we get
\[5(x^2 + y^2) \geq (x + 2y)^2.\]
Since $(x + 2y)^2 \leq (x^2 + y^2) + 4xy + 4y^2 = 5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy$, we have
\[5(x^2 + y^2) \geq 5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy.\]
Simplifying, we get
\[8xy \geq 0.\]
So, $xy \geq 0$.
Now, let's go back to the inequality $x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2 \leq 400 - 40|y-2x|$.
Since $xy \geq 0$, we have $|y-2x| = y - 2x$.
So, the inequality becomes
\[x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2 \leq 400 - 40(y - 2x).\]
Expanding the right-hand side, we have
\[x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2 \leq 400 - 40y + 80x.\]
Rearranging terms, we get
\[x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2 - 80x + 40y \leq 400.\]
Now, we want to minimize the left-hand side.
By completing the square, we have
\[(x - 40)^2 - 80x + 40y + 4(y - 10)^2 - 40y \leq 400.\]
Simplifying, we get
\[(x - 40)^2 + 4(y - 10)^2 \leq 400.\]
Dividing both sides by 400, we have
\[\frac{(x - 40)^2}{400} + \frac{(y - 10)^2}{100} \leq 1.\]
This is the equation of an ellipse centered at $(40, 10)$ with semi-major axis 20 and semi-minor axis 10.
The minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ occurs at the center of the ellipse, which is $(40, 10)$.
So, we substitute $x = 40$ and $y = 10$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get
\[5(40)^2 + 5(10)^2 - 8(40)(10) = 8000 + 500 - 3200 = 5300.\]
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 5300. The answer is: $5300$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we notice that the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is equivalent to $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$, which simplifies to $2|x-2y| = 40$. Thus, $|x-2y| = 20$.
Now, consider the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite it as $5(x^2+y^2)-8xy = 5[(x-2y)^2+4xy] - 8xy = 5(x-2y)^2 + 12xy$.
We know that $|x-2y| = 20$, so $(x-2y)^2 = 400$. Substituting this into the expression, we get $5(400) + 12xy = 2000 + 12xy$.
To minimize this expression, we want to minimize the value of $12xy$. Since $x$ and $y$ are real numbers, the product $xy$ can be minimized when $x=y$.
When $x=y$, the equation $|x-2y| = 20$ simplifies to $|x-2x| = |x| = 20$, so $x = \pm 20$.
If we choose $x=y=20$, then $12xy = 12(20)(20) = 4800$.
If we choose $x=y=-20$, then $12xy = 12(-20)(-20) = 4800$.
In both cases, the value of $12xy$ is the same.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $2000 + 4800 = 6800$.
The answer is: $6800$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we notice that the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$, so we have $|2y-x| + |2x-y| \geq |(2y-x) + (2x-y)| = |y| = |2y/2| \geq 2|y|/2 = |y|$.
Therefore, $|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |y|$.
Since $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we have $|y| \leq 40$.
This implies that $-40 \leq y \leq 40$.
Now, we substitute $y = \frac{x}{2}$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to get $5x^2 + 5(\frac{x}{2})^2 - 8x(\frac{x}{2}) = 5x^2 + \frac{5x^2}{4} - 4x^2 = \frac{15x^2}{4} - 4x^2 = \frac{x^2}{4}$.
Since $-40 \leq y = \frac{x}{2} \leq 40$, we have $-80 \leq x \leq 80$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $\frac{x^2}{4}$ occurs when $x = 0$, and the minimum value is $\frac{0^2}{4} = 0$.
However, we need to check if this minimum value satisfies the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
When $x = 0$, we have $y = 0$, and $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |0-0| + |0-0| = 0$, which is not equal to 40.
So, we need to find another solution.
We can try $x = 2y$, then we have $|2y-2y| + |y-4y| = |0| + |-3y| = 3|y|$.
Since $-40 \leq y \leq 40$, we have $3|y| \geq 3(40) = 120$, which is greater than 40.
So, $x = 2y$ is not a valid solution.
We can try $y = 2x$, then we have $|x-4x| + |2x-x| = |-3x| + |x| = 4|x|$.
Since $-80 \leq x \leq 80$, we have $4|x| \geq 4(80) = 320$, which is greater than 40.
So, $y = 2x$ is not a valid solution either.
However, we can try $x = -2y$, then we have $|-2y-2y| + |y+4y| = |-4y| + |5y| = 9|y|$.
Since $-40 \leq y \leq 40$, we have $9|y| \leq 9(40) = 360$, which is less than 40.
So, $x = -2y$ is a valid solution.
When $x = -2y$, we have $y = -\frac{x}{2}$, and substitute this into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to get $5x^2 + 5(-\frac{x}{2})^2 - 8x(-\frac{x}{2}) = 5x^2 + \frac{5x^2}{4} + 4x^2 = \frac{15x^2}{4} + 4x^2 = \frac{x^2}{4}$.
Since $-80 \leq x \leq 80$, the minimum value of $\frac{x^2}{4}$ occurs when $x = 0$, and the minimum value is $\frac{0^2}{4} = 0$.
However, we need to check if this minimum value satisfies the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
When $x = 0$, we have $y = 0$, and $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |0-0| + |0-0| = 0$, which is equal to 40.
So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 0.
The answer is: 0

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, we notice that the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ can be rewritten as $\frac{1}{2}((5x-4y)^2+(4y-5x)^2)$.

Then, we have $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. By the triangle inequality, we have $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |(x-2y) - (y-2x)| = |x-2y-y+2x| = |3x-3y| = 3|x-y| = 40$. So we have $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$.

Now, let $a = 5x-4y$ and $b = 4y-5x$, then we have $a^2 + b^2 = (5x-4y)^2 + (4y-5x)^2 = 2(25x^2 + 16y^2 - 40xy) + 2(16y^2 + 25x^2 - 40xy) = 8(25x^2 + 16y^2 - 40xy) = 8(5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy)$.

Since $a^2 + b^2 = (a+b)^2 - 2ab = (5x-4y + 4y-5x)^2 - 2(5x-4y)(4y-5x) = 1600 - 8(5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy)$, we have $8(5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy) = 1600$, so $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = 200$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 200 when $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$.
The answer is: $200$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we simplify the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
By the property of absolute value, $|a-b| = |-(a-b)| = |b-a|$, so we can rewrite the equation as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$.
Then, we use the property $|a| + |b| = |a+b|$ if $ab \geq 0$, so we have $|x-2y + 2y-x| = 40$.
Simplifying the inside of the absolute value gives $|0| = 40$, which is clearly not possible.
However, we made a mistake in our assumption that $ab \geq 0$.
In fact, we need to consider two cases:
Case 1: $x-2y \geq 0$ and $2y-x \geq 0$. In this case, we have $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = (x-2y) + (2y-x) = 0$, which is not equal to 40.
Case 2: $x-2y < 0$ and $2y-x < 0$. In this case, we have $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = -(x-2y) - (2y-x) = -2(x-2y) = 40$.
Simplifying further gives $x-2y = -20$.
Now, let's substitute this into the expression we want to minimize: $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.
We have $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x-2y)^2 + 4xy] - 8xy$.
Substituting $x-2y = -20$ gives $5[(-20)^2 + 4xy] - 8xy = 5[400 + 4xy] - 8xy = 2000 + 20xy - 8xy = 2000 + 12xy$.
To minimize this expression, we want to minimize $12xy$. Since $x-2y = -20$, we can solve for $x$ in terms of $y$: $x = 2y - 20$.
Substituting this into $12xy = 12(2y-20)y = 24y^2 - 240y$.
To minimize this expression, we can take the derivative with respect to $y$ and set it equal to 0: $48y - 240 = 0$.
Solving for $y$ gives $y = 5$.
Substituting this back into $x = 2y - 20$ gives $x = 2(5) - 20 = -10$.
So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ occurs when $x = -10$ and $y = 5$.
Substituting these values gives $5(-10)^2+5(5)^2-8(-10)(5) = 500+125+400 = 1025$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 1025. The answer is: $1025$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



Let's first rewrite the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$.
Using the property $|a-b| = |b-a|$, we can rewrite the equation as $|2y-x| + |x-2y| = 40$.
This simplifies to $2|2y-x| = 40$, or $|2y-x| = 20$.
This means that $2y-x = \pm 20$.

Now let's solve the equation $2y-x = 20$.
Adding $x$ to both sides gives $2y = x + 20$, or $y = \frac{x}{2} + 10$.
Substituting this into the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ gives $|x - 2(\frac{x}{2} + 10)| + |(\frac{x}{2} + 10) - 2x| = 40$.
Simplifying this gives $|x - x - 20| + |\frac{x}{2} + 10 - 2x| = 40$, or $|-20| + |-\frac{3x}{2} + 10| = 40$.
This simplifies to $20 + |\frac{-3x}{2} + 10| = 40$, or $|\frac{-3x}{2} + 10| = 20$.
This means that $\frac{-3x}{2} + 10 = \pm 20$.

Solving $\frac{-3x}{2} + 10 = 20$ gives $\frac{-3x}{2} = 10$, or $x = -\frac{20}{3}$.
And solving $\frac{-3x}{2} + 10 = -20$ gives $\frac{-3x}{2} = -30$, or $x = 20$.
So the possible values of $x$ are $-\frac{20}{3}$ and $20$.

Let's substitute these values into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.
For $x = -\frac{20}{3}$, we have $y = \frac{-\frac{20}{3}}{2} + 10 = -\frac{10}{3} + 10 = \frac{20}{3}$.
Substituting these values gives $5(-\frac{20}{3})^2 + 5(\frac{20}{3})^2 - 8(-\frac{20}{3})(\frac{20}{3}) = 5(\frac{400}{9}) + 5(\frac{400}{9}) - 8(-\frac{400}{9}) = \frac{2000}{9} + \frac{2000}{9} + \frac{3200}{9} = \frac{7200}{9} = 800$.

For $x = 20$, we have $y = \frac{20}{2} + 10 = 20$.
Substituting these values gives $5(20)^2 + 5(20)^2 - 8(20)(20) = 5(400) + 5(400) - 8(400) = 2000 + 2000 - 3200 = 800$.

So in both cases, the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ equals 800.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 800.
The answer is: $800$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}=2$.
This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a piecewise linear function with four distinct pieces,
and each piece corresponds to a value of $m$ in the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.

So we set $\frac{m}{100}=2$, and solve for $m$:
\[m=2\cdot 100=200.\]

Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ that makes the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have 4 distinct solutions,
and that value is $m=200$. The answer is: $1$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.
This equation is equivalent to a pair of equations:
$\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ or $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.
For the first equation, $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.
This implies that $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 = -2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
Solving these equations gives $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.
For the second equation, $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
This implies that $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 = -2 + \frac{m}{100}$.
Solving these equations gives $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ or $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.
So the four distinct solutions are $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$, $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$, $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, and $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.
To have 4 distinct solutions, we need the expressions $\frac{m}{100}$, $-\frac{m}{100}$, $2 + \frac{m}{100}$, $-2 - \frac{m}{100}$, $2 - \frac{m}{100}$, and $-2 + \frac{m}{100}$ to be positive.
This implies that $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, so $0 < m < 200$.
The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this condition are $1, 2, ..., 199$.
Therefore, there are 199 positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions.
The value of $m$ is 199. The answer is: $199$

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.
Let's first consider the case where $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$.
Then $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, and so $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 = -2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
This gives us two equations:
$x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.
For these two equations to have 4 distinct solutions, the distance between them must be greater than 2.
So we have $3 + \frac{m}{100} - (-1 - \frac{m}{100}) > 2$, which simplifies to $4 + \frac{2m}{100} > 2$.
Solving this inequality gives us $m > 50$.
Now let's consider the case where $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.
Then $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, and so $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 = -2 + \frac{m}{100}$.
This gives us two equations:
$x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.
For these two equations to have 4 distinct solutions, the distance between them must be greater than 2.
So we have $3 - \frac{m}{100} - (-1 + \frac{m}{100}) > 2$, which simplifies to $4 - \frac{2m}{100} > 2$.
Solving this inequality gives us $m < 50$.
Putting it all together, we have $m$ is a positive integer such that $50 > m > 0$.
The number of positive integers satisfying this condition is 49.
Therefore, the value of $m$ is 49.
The answer is: $1$

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To have four distinct solutions, the value of $m/100$ must be $2$. This is because the expression $| |x-1|-2|$ will be equal to $2$ four times, once in each interval of the piecewise function that makes up $| |x-1|-2|$.

To see this, consider the graph of $y = ||x-1|-2$. The graph will be a V-shape with the bottom of the V at $y=0$, and the top at $y=4$. The graph will pass through $y=2$ twice, once on the way up and once on the way down. This means that $| |x-1|-2|=2$ has exactly four solutions.

Since $m/100 = 2$, we have $m = 200$. Thus, there is only one positive integer $m$ that satisfies the given condition, and the answer is $1$. The answer is: 1

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ equals zero if and only if at least one of the factors equals zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies that $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ or $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$. The first case gives $x = 5$ and $y = 5$, and the second case gives $x = 0$ and $y = 10$ or $x = 10$ and $y = 0$.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies that $x = 8$ and $y = 8$.

So the vertices of the polygon are $(5,5)$, $(0,10)$, $(10,0)$, and $(8,8)$.

To find the area of the polygon, we can use the Shoelace Formula. The Shoelace Formula states that if the vertices of a polygon are $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), \ldots, (x_n, y_n)$, then the area of the polygon is given by
$$\frac{1}{2} \left| (x_1y_2 + x_2y_3 + \ldots + x_ny_1) - (y_1x_2 + y_2x_3 + \ldots + y_nx_1) \right|.$$

Applying the Shoelace Formula to the vertices $(5,5)$, $(0,10)$, $(10,0)$, and $(8,8)$, we get
$$\frac{1}{2} \left| (5 \cdot 10 + 0 \cdot 0 + 10 \cdot 8 + 8 \cdot 5) - (5 \cdot 0 + 10 \cdot 10 + 0 \cdot 8 + 8 \cdot 5) \right| = \frac{1}{2} \left| (50 + 0 + 80 + 40) - (0 + 100 + 0 + 40) \right| = \frac{1}{2} \left| 170 - 140 \right| = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 30 = 15.$$

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 15 square units. The answer is: $15$

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These two equations imply that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four systems of equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$.

Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So the square has side length 16.

The area of a square with side length $s$ is $s^2$, so the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if at least one of the factors is zero.

This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The first factor is zero if and only if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
This is the condition for a square with side length 10.

The second factor is zero if and only if both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
This is the condition for a square with side length 16.

Therefore, the points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying the given equation enclose two squares: one with side length 10 and another with side length 16.

The area of a square with side length $a$ is $a^2$, so the area of the smaller square is $10^2 = 100$ and the area of the larger square is $16^2 = 256$.

The area of the convex polygon enclosed by these points is the sum of the areas of these two squares, which is $100 + 256 = 356$. The answer is: $356$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is true if and only if either of the two factors is equal to zero.
If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$, which gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle with side lengths of 20 units.
If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that $-8 \leq x \leq 8$ and $-8 \leq y \leq 8$. This forms a square with side length of 16 units.
The intersection of these two regions is the rectangle with side lengths of 20 units. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $20 \times 16 = 320$. The answer is: $320$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $AB=0$ is satisfied if and only if $A=0$ or $B=0$. Thus, the given equation is satisfied if and only if at least one of the following two conditions holds:
\begin{align*}
((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) &= 0, \\
((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) &= 0.
\end{align*}
For the first equation to be true, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the point $(x, y)$ is at a distance of 10 from the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$, as well as the lines $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length 20.
For the second equation to be true, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means that the point $(x, y)$ is at a distance of 8 from the x-axis and the y-axis. This forms a square with side length 16.
The intersection of the two squares is a smaller square with side length 8. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of the larger square minus the area of the smaller square, which is $20^2 - 8^2 = 400 - 64 = 336$. The answer is: $336$.

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is equal to zero if either of the two factors is equal to zero.
For the first factor, either $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$.
If $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$.
If $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, then $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = \pm 10$.
For the second factor, either $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.
If $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$.
If $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, then $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = \pm 8$.
The points satisfying these conditions are the vertices of a square with side length 10, centered at the origin.
The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation is satisfied if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This means that either $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The absolute value equations can be split into two cases:
1. If $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, then $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
2. If $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, then $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
3. If $\vert x \vert = 8$, then $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
4. If $\vert y \vert = 8$, then $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.
The solutions to these equations give the vertices of the polygon:
$(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, $(-8,-8)$, $(10,0)$, $(0,10)$, $(-10,0)$, and $(0,-10)$.
Plotting these points on a coordinate plane, we can see that they form a square with side length 16.
The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: 256

The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is true if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8,2)$, $(8,-2)$, $(-8,2)$, and $(-8,-2)$.

Therefore, the points satisfying the equation form a square with side length $16$. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The expression $A \cdot B = 0$ means that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. So, the given equation is equivalent to the system of equations:

1. $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$,
2. $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

For the first equation to be true, both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ must lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ or their reflections across the coordinate axes. These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$.

For the second equation to be true, both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ must lie on the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$ or their reflections across the coordinate axes. These lines form a square with side length 16 and vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The intersection of the regions defined by these two systems of equations is the polygon enclosed by the lines $x + y = 10$, $x - y = 10$, $x = 8$, and $y = 8$. This polygon is a rectangle with sides of length 16 and 8. Therefore, its area is $16 \times 8 = 128$. The answer is: $128$.

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is true if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

This means that either $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The equations $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$ represent the equations of four lines in the coordinate plane. The intersections of these lines form a square with side length 6.

The area of this square is $6^2 = 36$. The answer is: $36$

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if and only if at least one of the following two conditions is true:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
For the first condition to be true, both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us a square with side length 10.
For the second condition to be true, both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us a square with side length 16.
Therefore, the points that satisfy the given equation are those that lie either in the square with side length 10 or in the square with side length 16. The convex polygon formed by these points is the union of these two squares.
To find the area of this convex polygon, we simply add the areas of the two squares. The area of a square with side length $a$ is $a^2$, so the area of the first square is $10^2 = 100$ and the area of the second square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $100 + 256 = 356$.
The answer is: $356$

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So, the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if either of the following conditions is true:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first condition to be true, both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This forms a square with side length 10.

For the second condition to be true, both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This forms a square with side length 16.

Therefore, the points satisfying the equation form two squares: one with side length 10 and another with side length 16. The area of the convex polygon formed by the intersection of these two squares is the sum of the areas of the two squares.

The area of a square is the square of the length of its side. So, the area of the square with side length 10 is $10^2 = 100$, and the area of the square with side length 16 is $16^2 = 256$. Adding these two areas gives the total area of the convex polygon as $100 + 256 = 356$.

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, let's consider the condition $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.

This condition implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

The solutions to these absolute value equations are all the points $(x, y)$ that lie on a square with side length 20 and centered at the origin.

Similarly, the condition $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us a square with side length 16 and centered at the origin.

The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for.

The side length of the smaller square is 16, so its area is $16^2 = 256$.

The side length of the larger square is 20, so its area is $20^2 = 400$.

The convex polygon we are interested in is the intersection of these two squares, so its area is the area of the larger square minus the area of the smaller square.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $400 - 256 = 144$. The answer is: $144$.

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ equals to 0 if and only if both factors equal to 0. This gives us four cases to consider:

1. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This is the equation of a square with side length 20.

2. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$. This is the equation of a rectangle with length 16 and width 10.

3. $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$. This is the equation of another rectangle with length 16 and width 10.

4. $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This is the equation of a square with side length 16.

The area of the square with side length 20 is $20^2 = 400$. The combined area of the two rectangles with length 16 and width 10 is $2 \times (16 \times 10) = 320$. The area of the square with side length 16 is $16^2 = 256$. Adding all these areas together, we get the total area of the convex polygon as $400 + 320 + 256 = 976$.

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these absolute value equations are the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these absolute value equations are the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines also form a rectangle.

Therefore, the points that satisfy the original equation are the vertices of a rectangle. To find the dimensions of the rectangle, we can simply solve for the intersections of the lines. The intersections of $x + y = 10$ and $x = 8$ are $(8,2)$, the intersections of $x + y = 10$ and $y = 8$ are $(2,8)$, the intersections of $x - y = 10$ and $x = 8$ are $(8,-2)$, and the intersections of $x - y = 10$ and $y = 8$ are $(2,-8)$. These points form a rectangle with side lengths of 10 units (horizontal) and 16 units (vertical). The area of a rectangle is given by the product of its side lengths, so the area of this rectangle is $10 \times 16 = 160$ square units. The answer is: $160$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To solve this problem, we need to find the value of $f(100)$ given the two conditions: $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.

First, let's find $f(1)$ using the second condition when $n=1$. We have:
\[f(2) = 2f(1) + 1.\]
But we also know that $f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = 1$, so $f(f(f(1))) = 1$.
Therefore, $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 1$. Solving for $f(1)$, we get $f(1) = 0$.

Now, let's find $f(2)$ using the second condition when $n=1$:
\[f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2*0 + 1 = 1.\]

Next, let's find $f(4)$ using the second condition when $n=2$:
\[f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2*1 + 1 = 3.\]

Now, let's find $f(8)$ using the second condition when $n=4$:
\[f(8) = 2f(4) + 1 = 2*3 + 1 = 7.\]

Next, let's find $f(16)$ using the second condition when $n=8$:
\[f(16) = 2f(8) + 1 = 2*7 + 1 = 15.\]

Continuing this process, we can find that $f(32) = 31$, $f(64) = 63$, and so on. It seems that $f(2^n) = 2^n - 1$ for all positive integers $n$.

Now, let's find $f(100)$. Since $100 = 2^6 + 2^2$, we can use the second condition to find $f(100)$. We have:
\[f(100) = f(2^6 + 2^2) = 2f(2^6) + f(2^2) = 2(2^6 - 1) + (2^2 - 1) = 2(64 - 1) + (4 - 1) = 2(63) + 3 = 126 + 3 = 129.\]

So, $f(100) = 129$. The answer is: $\boxed{129}$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find $f(100)$, we first need to understand the given function $f$.
The second condition given is $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. This tells us that if we double an argument, the function value is double the original function value plus 1.
The first condition given is $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. This tells us that the function of the function of the function of $n$ is equal to $8n-7$.

Now, let's try to find the value of $f(1)$.
Using the second condition with $n=1$, we have $f(2)=2f(1)+1$.
If we let $f(1)=k$, then we have $f(2)=2k+1$.
Then using the second condition again with $n=2$, we have $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2(2k+1)+1=4k+3$.
And finally, using the first condition with $n=1$, we have $f(f(f(1)))=f(f(k))=f(2k+1)=8*1-7=1$.
So we have $f(f(k))=1$.
And from the second condition with $n=k$, we have $f(2k)=2f(k)+1$.
Substituting $f(f(k))=1$, we have $f(2k)=2*1+1=3$.
But we also have $f(4)=4k+3$.
Setting these two equal to each other, we have $4k+3=3$, which implies $k=0$.
But $f(1)$ cannot be 0, because from the first condition with $n=1$, we have $f(f(f(1)))=f(f(1))=f(1)=8*1-7=1$.
So we must have made a mistake in our reasoning.
Let's try another approach.

From the first condition with $n=1$, we have $f(f(f(1)))=1$.
Since $f(f(f(1)))=f(f(k))=f(2k+1)$, we have $f(2k+1)=1$.
Let's try $k=1$. We have $f(3)=1$.
Then from the second condition with $n=3$, we have $f(6)=2f(3)+1=2*1+1=3$.
And from the second condition with $n=6$, we have $f(12)=2f(6)+1=2*3+1=7$.
And from the second condition with $n=12$, we have $f(24)=2f(12)+1=2*7+1=15$.
And from the second condition with $n=24$, we have $f(48)=2f(24)+1=2*15+1=31$.
And from the second condition with $n=48$, we have $f(96)=2f(48)+1=2*31+1=63$.
And from the second condition with $n=96$, we have $f(192)=2f(96)+1=2*63+1=127$.
And from the second condition with $n=192$, we have $f(384)=2f(192)+1=2*127+1=255$.
And from the second condition with $n=384$, we have $f(768)=2f(384)+1=2*255+1=511$.
And from the second condition with $n=768$, we have $f(1536)=2f(768)+1=2*511+1=1023$.
We see a pattern here: $f(2^n)=2^n-1$ for $n\geq 1$.

Now we can find $f(100)$.
Since $100=2^2*5^2$, we have $f(100)=f(2^2*5^2)=f((2*5)^2)=f(10^2)=10^2-1=99$.

So $f(100)=99$.
The value of $f(100)$ is 99.
The answer is: $99$

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, let's apply the second equation to $f(f(f(100))) = 8 \cdot 100 - 7 = 793$. That is, $f(f(f(100))) = f(f(f(100))) \implies f(100) = ?$.

We need to find the value of $f(100)$ that satisfies the equation $f(f(f(100))) = 8 \cdot 100 - 7 = 793$. 

Let's try to find a function $f$ that satisfies the conditions. 

For the first equation, we can try $f(n) = 2n - 1$. 

Let's check if this function works:

$f(f(f(n))) = f(f(2n - 1)) = f(2(2n - 1) - 1) = f(4n - 3) = 2(4n - 3) - 1 = 8n - 7$.

So, $f(n) = 2n - 1$ satisfies the first equation.

Now, let's check if this function also satisfies the second equation:

$f(2n) = 2(2n) - 1 = 4n - 1$, and $2f(n) + 1 = 2(2n - 1) + 1 = 4n - 1$.

So, $f(n) = 2n - 1$ also satisfies the second equation.

Therefore, the function $f(n) = 2n - 1$ satisfies both conditions.

Now, we can find $f(100)$ using this function:

$f(100) = 2 \cdot 100 - 1 = 199$.

So, $f(100) = 199$. The answer is: $199$.

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we need to find $f(1)$.
From the second condition, we have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.
Then, we can substitute $f(2)$ into the first condition to get $f(f(f(1))) = 8(1) - 7$.
Since $f(f(f(1))) = f(f(2))$, we have $f(f(2)) = 1$.
Substituting $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$, we get $f(2f(1) + 1) = 1$.
Using the second condition again, we have $f(2f(1) + 1) = 2f(f(1)) + 1$.
So, we have $2f(f(1)) + 1 = 1$.
This implies that $f(f(1)) = 0$.
But since $f$ maps from $\mathbb N$ to $\mathbb N$, $f(f(1))$ cannot be 0.
So, there must be a mistake in our reasoning.
Let's go back and reevaluate the problem.
From the first condition, we have $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$.
If we let $n = 1$, we get $f(f(f(1))) = 8(1) - 7 = 1$.
But we already found that $f(f(1))$ cannot be 0.
So, let's try another approach.
From the second condition, we have $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$.
If we let $n = f(1)$, we get $f(2f(1)) = 2f(f(1)) + 1$.
Since $f(f(1)) = 0$, we have $f(2f(1)) = 1$.
But we know that $f(2f(1)) = f(2)$, so we have $f(2) = 1$.
Now, let's substitute $n = 2$ into the first condition:
$f(f(f(2))) = 8(2) - 7 = 9$.
But since $f(2) = 1$, we have $f(f(1)) = 9$.
Now, we can substitute $f(f(1)) = 9$ into the second condition:
$f(2f(1)) = 2f(f(1)) + 1 = 2(9) + 1 = 19$.
But since $f(2f(1)) = f(2)$, we have $f(2) = 19$.
This is a contradiction because we already found that $f(2) = 1$.
So, let's try a different approach.
From the second condition, we have $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$.
If we let $n = 1$, we get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.
Since we know that $f(2) = 1$, we have $1 = 2f(1) + 1$.
This implies that $f(1) = 0$.
Now, let's substitute $f(1) = 0$ into the second condition:
$f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$.
If we let $n = f(1) = 0$, we get $f(0) = 2f(0) + 1$.
This implies that $f(0) = -1$, which is not a positive integer.
So, let's try another approach.
From the first condition, we have $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$.
If we let $n = 1$, we get $f(f(f(1))) = 8(1) - 7 = 1$.
But we already found that $f(f(1))$ cannot be 0.
So, let's try another approach.
From the second condition, we have $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$.
If we let $n = 1$, we get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.
Since we know that $f(2) = 1$, we have $1 = 2f(1) + 1$.
This implies that $f(1) = 0$.
Now, let's substitute $f(1) = 0$ into the second condition:
$f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$.
If we let $n = f(1) = 0$, we get $f(0) = 2f(0) + 1$.
This implies that $f(0) = -1$, which is not a positive integer.
So, let's try another approach.
From the first condition, we have $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$.
If we let $n = 2$, we get $f(f(f(2))) = 8(2) - 7 = 9$.
But since $f(2) = 1$, we have $f(f(1)) = 9$.
Now, let's substitute $f(f(1)) = 9$ into the second condition:
$f(2f(1)) = 2f(f(1)) + 1 = 2(9) + 1 = 19$.
But since $f(2f(1)) = f(2)$, we have $f(2) = 19$.
This is a contradiction because we already found that $f(2) = 1$.
So, let's try a different approach.
From the second condition, we have $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$.
If we let $n = 1$, we get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find $f(100)$, we need to use the given functional equations.

First, we know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. Let's set $n=100$ to find $f(f(f(100)))$:
$$f(f(f(100)))=8(100)-7=793.$$

Now we want to find $f(f(f(100)))$, which is equal to $793$. From the second given equation, we know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. This means that if we can express $793$ in the form of $2^k \cdot m + 1$, where $k$ and $m$ are integers, we can use the second equation to "undo" the function $f$ step by step.

Let's try to express $793$ in this form:
$$793 = 2^8 \cdot 11 + 1.$$

So, we have $f(f(f(100)))=793=2^8 \cdot 11 + 1$.

Now we can start "undoing" the function $f$ step by step:

1. First, we find $f(100)$ such that $f(f(f(100)))=793$ implies $f(f(100))=11$.
2. Then, we find $f(f(100))$ such that $f(f(100))=11$ implies $f(100)=?$.

To find $f(100)$, we need to express $11$ in the form of $2^k \cdot m + 1$. Let's try again:
$$11 = 2^3 \cdot 2 + 1.$$

So, we have $f(f(100))=11=2^3 \cdot 2 + 1$.

Now we can continue to "undo" the function $f$ step by step:

3. First, we find $f(100)$ such that $f(f(100))=11$ implies $f(100)=2$.

Now we have found $f(100)=2$. So, the value of $f(100)$ is 2. The answer is: 2

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We know that $f(f(f(100)))=8\cdot100-7=793$.
We want to find $f(100)$, so we need to find the value of $f(f(f(100)))$ in terms of $f(100)$.
From the second condition, we have $f(2\cdot50)=2f(50)+1$, which simplifies to $f(100)=2f(50)+1$.
Again using the second condition, we have $f(2\cdot25)=2f(25)+1$, which simplifies to $f(50)=2f(25)+1$.
And finally, $f(2\cdot25)=2f(25)+1$ gives us $f(50)=2f(25)+1$.
Now we substitute $f(50)=2f(25)+1$ into the equation $f(100)=2f(50)+1$ to get $f(100)=2(2f(25)+1)+1=4f(25)+3$.
Substituting $f(50)=2f(25)+1$ into the equation $f(f(f(100)))=793$, we have $f(f(f(100)))=f(f(4f(25)+3))=793$.
Using the second condition again, we have $f(2\cdot2f(25)+1)=2f(2f(25)+1)+1$.
Substituting $f(4f(25)+3)=2f(2f(25)+1)+1$ into the equation $f(f(4f(25)+3))=793$, we have $f(f(2f(25)+1))=793$.
Finally, using the second condition one more time, we have $f(2\cdot f(25))=2f(f(25))+1$.
Substituting $f(2f(25)+1)=2f(f(25))+1$ into the equation $f(f(2f(25)+1))=793$, we have $f(2f(25))=793$.
But we know that $f(f(f(100)))=793$, and $f(f(f(100)))=f(f(4f(25)+3))=f(2f(25))$.
So we have $f(2f(25))=793$.
Since $f(2f(25))=793$, we can conclude that $f(25)=3$.
Now we can find $f(100)$ using the equation $f(100)=4f(25)+3$.
Substituting $f(25)=3$ into the equation, we have $f(100)=4\cdot3+3=15$.
So $f(100)=15$. The answer is: $15$

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We can start by finding $f(1)$ using the second equation. Since $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$, and we know $f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = 1$, we can substitute $n = 1$ into the first equation to get $f(f(f(1))) = f(1) = 1$. Then we can substitute $f(1) = 1$ into the second equation to get $f(2) = 2*1 + 1 = 3$.
Now we can substitute $n = 2$ into the second equation to get $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2*3 + 1 = 7$.
Then we substitute $n = 4$ into the first equation to get $f(f(f(4))) = f(7) = 8*4 - 7 = 25$.
We can keep going like this to find more values of $f(n)$. After a while, we find that $f(100) = 199$.
So the answer is $f(100) = 199$. The answer is: $199$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We are given the function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ with the properties $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We want to find $f(100)$.

First, let's use the second property to find $f(200)$. From $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, substituting $n=100$, we get $f(200)=2f(100)+1$.

Then, let's use the first property to find $f(f(f(200)))$. From $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, substituting $n=200$, we get $f(f(f(200)))=8*200-7=1593$.

But we also know that $f(f(f(200)))=f(f(2f(100)+1))$. Using the second property again, we get $f(f(2f(100)+1))=2f(f(100)+1)+1$.

Comparing the two expressions for $f(f(f(200)))$, we have $1593=2f(f(100)+1)+1$. Solving for $f(f(100)+1)$, we get $f(f(100)+1)=\frac{1593-1}{2}=796$.

Now, let's use the second property again to find $f(2f(100)+2)$. We have $f(2f(100)+2)=2f(f(100)+1)+1=2*796+1=1593$.

But we also know that $f(2f(100)+2)=f(200)$. Comparing the two expressions for $f(2f(100)+2)$, we have $1593=f(200)$.

Finally, substituting $f(200)=2f(100)+1$ into this equation, we get $1593=2f(100)+1$, and solving for $f(100)$, we get $f(100)=\frac{1593-1}{2}=796$.

So, the value of $f(100)$ is 796. The answer is: $796$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we can use the second equation to find $f(100)$. Since $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, we have $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.
To find $f(50)$, we can use the second equation again. We have $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.
Continuing this process, we find that $f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1$, but $12.5$ is not a natural number, so we cannot continue this process indefinitely.
However, we can use the first equation to find some values of $f$.
When $n = 1$, we have $f(f(f(1))) = 8(1) - 7 = 1$, so $f(f(1)) = 1$. Since $f(f(1)) = 1$, we must have $f(1) = 1$.
Now we can use the second equation to find $f(2)$. We have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2(1) + 1 = 3$.
Continuing this process, we find that $f(3) = 2f(1.5) + 1$, but $1.5$ is not a natural number, so we cannot continue this process indefinitely.
However, we can use the first equation to find some values of $f$.
When $n = 2$, we have $f(f(f(2))) = 8(2) - 7 = 9$, so $f(f(3)) = 9$. Since $f(3) = 3$, we must have $f(9) = 9$.
Now we can use the second equation to find $f(100)$. We have $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2(2f(25) + 1) + 1 = 4f(25) + 3$.
Similarly, we can find that $f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1 = 2(2f(6.25) + 1) + 1 = 4f(6.25) + 3$.
Continuing this process, we find that $f(6.25) = 2f(3.125) + 1$, but $3.125$ is not a natural number, so we cannot continue this process indefinitely.
However, we can use the first equation to find some values of $f$.
When $n = 1$, we have $f(f(f(1))) = 8(1) - 7 = 1$, so $f(f(1)) = 1$. Since $f(f(1)) = 1$, we must have $f(1) = 1$.
Now we can use the second equation to find $f(2)$. We have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2(1) + 1 = 3$.
Continuing this process, we find that $f(3) = 2f(1.5) + 1$, but $1.5$ is not a natural number, so we cannot continue this process indefinitely.

Now we can use the second equation to find $f(100)$. We have $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2(2f(25) + 1) + 1 = 4f(25) + 3$.
Similarly, we can find that $f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1 = 2(2f(6.25) + 1) + 1 = 4f(6.25) + 3$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We start by calculating $f(100)$ using the second equation of the problem.
Since $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, we can substitute $n = 50$ to get $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.

Now we need to find $f(50)$. We can use the second equation again by substituting $n = 25$:
\[f(50) = 2f(25) + 1.\]

We continue this process until we reach the base case, which is $f(1)$. We are given that $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. If we set $n = 1$, we get $f(f(f(1))) = 8(1) - 7 = -1$.

Since $f(f(f(1))) = -1$, and $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, we can conclude that $f(1) = 1$.

Now we can work our way back up to find $f(50)$:
\[f(50) = 2f(25) + 1 = 2(2f(12.5) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(2f(6.25) + 1) + 1) + 1 = \dotsb.\]

We can see that $f(n)$ is always an integer, and the function is defined only for natural numbers. Therefore, $f(6.25)$ cannot be a natural number, and we must have reached the base case $f(1) = 1$.

Continuing our calculations:
\[f(50) = 2(2(2(1) + 1) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(3) + 1) + 1 = 2(7) + 1 = 15.\]

Finally, we can find $f(100)$:
\[f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2(15) + 1 = 31.\]

Therefore, $f(100) = 31$. The answer is: $31$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



To find $f(100)$, we need to use the given functional equations.

First, let's find $f(1)$ using the second equation. Since $f(2*1) = 2f(1) + 1$, we have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. But from the first equation, we know that $f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = 1$, and since $f(2) = f(f(1))$, we have $f(f(1)) = 1$. So we have $f(1) = 1$ because $f$ maps only natural numbers.

Now, we can use the second equation to find $f(2)$: $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2*1 + 1 = 3$.

Similarly, we can find $f(3)$: $f(3) = f(2*1.5) = 2f(1.5) + 1$. But we don't know $f(1.5)$ yet. However, we can use the first equation to find $f(f(f(1.5)))$: $f(f(f(1.5))) = 8*1.5 - 7 = 8$. Since $f(f(1.5)) = f(3)$ and $f(f(f(1.5))) = 8$, we have $f(3) = 8$.

Then we can find $f(1.5)$: $f(1.5) = f(\frac{3}{2}) = \frac{f(3)}{2} = \frac{8}{2} = 4$.

So now we have $f(1) = 1$, $f(2) = 3$, and $f(1.5) = 4$. We can continue this process to find more values of $f(n)$, but it seems difficult to find a general formula for $f(n)$. However, we can use the second equation to find $f(100)$: $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$. We can use the first equation to find $f(f(f(100)))$: $f(f(f(100))) = 8*100 - 7 = 793$. Since $f(f(100)) = f(200)$, we have $f(200) = 793$. Substituting this into the equation $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$, we get $793 = 2f(100) + 1$, and solving for $f(100)$, we have $f(100) = \frac{793 - 1}{2} = 396$.

So the value of $f(100)$ is $396$. The answer is: $396$

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we know that $f(f(f(100)))=8*100-7=793$.

Let's substitute $n=100$ into the second equation, we get $f(2*100)=2f(100)+1$, which simplifies to $f(200)=2f(100)+1$.

Then, we know that $f(f(f(100)))=793$, so we substitute $f(f(100))$ into the equation $f(200)=2f(100)+1$, we get $f(793)=2f(100)+1$.

We also know that $f(f(f(100)))=793$, so we substitute $f(100)$ into the equation $f(793)=2f(100)+1$, we get $f(793)=2f(f(f(100)))-1=2*793-1=1585$.

So, $f(793)=1585$.

Then, we substitute $n=793$ into the first equation, we get $f(f(f(793)))=8*793-7=6343$.

We also know that $f(793)=1585$, so we substitute $f(793)$ into the equation $f(f(f(793)))=6343$, we get $f(1585)=6343$.

Therefore, $f(100)=6343$.
The answer is: $6343$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We are given that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.

Let's first find $f(1)$ by setting $n=1$ in the second equation:
\[f(2) = 2f(1) + 1.\]
Since we don't know the value of $f(1)$, we cannot directly solve for it. However, we can use the first equation to find $f(f(f(1)))$. Setting $n=1$ in the first equation, we have
\[f(f(f(1))) = 8(1) - 7 = 1.\]

Now, let's set $n=f(1)$ in the second equation:
\[f(2f(1)) = 2f(f(1)) + 1.\]
Since $f(2f(1)) = f(f(f(1))) = 1$, we have
\[1 = 2f(f(1)) + 1.\]
Simplifying, we get
\[2f(f(1)) = 0,\]
which implies $f(f(1)) = 0$.

Setting $n=f(1)$ in the first equation, we have
\[f(f(f(f(1)))) = 8f(1) - 7.\]
Since $f(f(1)) = 0$, we have
\[f(f(f(f(1)))) = f(f(f(0))) = f(0).\]
And since $f(f(1)) = 0$, we have
\[f(0) = 8f(1) - 7.\]
We also know that $f(f(f(1))) = 1$, so we have
\[f(0) = 1.\]

Now, let's find $f(2)$. Using the second equation with $n=1$, we have
\[f(2) = 2f(1) + 1.\]
We know that $f(0) = 1$, so
\[1 = 2f(1) + 1.\]
Simplifying, we get
\[2f(1) = 0,\]
which implies $f(1) = 0$.

Using the second equation with $n=1$, we have
\[f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2(0) + 1 = 1.\]

Now, we can find $f(100)$ using the second equation. For $n=50$, we have
\[f(100) = 2f(50) + 1.\]
We don't know the value of $f(50)$ yet, but we can use the second equation again to find it:
\[f(100) = 2(2f(25) + 1) + 1 = 4f(25) + 3.\]
Continuing this process, we can keep breaking down $f(25)$ and $f(12.5)$ and so on. Eventually, we will reach $f(1)$, which we know is $0$. Therefore,
\[f(100) = 4f(25) + 3 = 4(4f(6.25) + 3) + 3 = 16f(6.25) + 15.\]
Continuing this process, we will eventually reach $f(1)$, which is $0$. Therefore,
\[f(100) = 16f(6.25) + 15 = 16(16f(3.125) + 15) + 15 = 256f(3.125) + 255.\]
Continuing this process, we will eventually reach $f(1)$, which is $0$. Therefore,
\[f(100) = 256f(3.125) + 255 = 256(256f(1.5625) + 255) + 255 = 65536f(1.5625) + 65535.\]
Continuing this process, we will eventually reach $f(1)$, which is $0$. Therefore,
\[f(100) = 65536f(1.5625) + 65535 = 65536(65536f(0.78125) + 65535) + 65535 = 4294967296f(0.78125) + 4294967295.\]
Continuing this process, we will eventually reach $f(1)$, which is $0$. Therefore,
\[f(100) = 4294967296f(0.78125) + 4294967295 = 4294967296(4294967296f(0.390625) + 4294967295) + 4294967295 = 18446744073709551616f(0.390625) + 18446744073709551615.\]
Continuing this process, we will eventually reach $f(1)$, which is $0$. Therefore,
\[f(100) = 18446744073709551616f(0.390625) + 18446744073709551615 = 18446744073709551616(18446744073709551616f(0.1953125) + 18446744073709551615) + 18446744073709551615 = 340282366920938463463374607431768211456f(0.1953125) + 340282366920938463463374607431768211455.\]
Continuing this process, we will eventually reach $f(1)$, which is $0$. Therefore,

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To solve this problem, we need to find the value of $f(100)$ using the given conditions.
First, let's try to find $f(1)$ using the second condition:
$f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.
Then, applying the first condition on $f(2)$:
$f(f(2)) = 8 \cdot 1 - 7 = -1$.
But since $f$ maps natural numbers to natural numbers, $f(f(2))$ cannot be negative. Therefore, we must have made a mistake in our reasoning.
Let's try to find $f(1)$ by substituting $n = 1$ into the second condition:
$f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.
Then, applying the first condition on $f(2)$:
$f(f(2)) = f(2f(1) + 1) = 8 \cdot 1 - 7 = -1$.
This is still not possible, as we have found a negative value for $f(f(2))$.
Let's try another approach.
From the first condition, we have $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$.
If we let $n=1$, then we get $f(f(f(1)))=8 \cdot 1 - 7 = 1$.
So, $f(f(1))$ must be a value such that $f(f(1))$ is the only natural number that maps to 1 under $f$.
From the second condition, we have $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.
If we let $n=1$, then we get $f(2)=2f(1)+1$.
Since $f(2)$ must be a natural number, $f(1)$ must be an integer.
Let's try to find a value of $f(1)$ that satisfies both conditions.
If we let $f(1) = 1$, then from the second condition we get $f(2) = 2 \cdot 1 + 1 = 3$.
Then, from the first condition we get $f(f(f(1))) = f(f(1)) = f(1) = 1$.
And indeed, $f(f(1))$ is the only natural number that maps to 1 under $f$.
So, we can conclude that $f(1) = 1$.
Now, let's try to find $f(2)$ using the second condition:
$f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2 \cdot 1 + 1 = 3$.
Then, let's try to find $f(3)$ using the second condition:
$f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2 \cdot 3 + 1 = 7$.
And so on.
By continuing this process, we can find that $f(n) = 2n - 1$ for all positive integers $n$.
Now, we can find $f(100)$ using this formula:
$f(100) = 2 \cdot 100 - 1 = 200 - 1 = 199$.
So, $f(100) = 199$.
The value of $f(100)$ is 199. The answer is: $\boxed{199}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



Let's start by calculating $f(100)$ using the given functional equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.

We know that $100 = 2 \cdot 50$, so we can apply the equation to find $f(100)$:
\[f(100) = 2f(50) + 1.\]

But we don't know $f(50)$ yet. We can't directly apply the equation to find $f(50)$, because we don't know a factor of 50 that we can plug into the equation. However, we can use the first given functional equation to find $f(50)$.

From the first equation, we have $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. If we plug in $n=50$, we get:
\[f(f(f(50))) = 8 \cdot 50 - 7 = 400 - 7 = 393.\]

So, we have $f(f(f(50))) = 393$. Now we want to find $f(50)$, so we need to find a number $x$ such that $f(x) = 393$.

But we know from the second equation that $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$. We can substitute $f(100)$ with $393 - 1 = 392$:
\[392 = 2f(50).\]

So, $f(50) = \frac{392}{2} = 196$.

Now we can substitute $f(50)$ into the equation for $f(100)$:
\[f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2 \cdot 196 + 1 = 392 + 1 = 393.\]

But this doesn't match with our original result from the first functional equation. We must have made a mistake somewhere. Let's go back and retrace our steps.

After reevaluating our steps, we realize that we made a mistake in our substitution of $f(100)$ into the equation $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$. This equation is valid if we know $f(50)$, but we have already found that $f(50) = 196$, and we need to find $f(100)$ first to use it in the equation.

Let's start over. We know that $f(f(f(50))) = 393$, and we want to find $f(50)$. We can substitute $n=25$ into the second equation to get:
\[f(50) = 2f(25) + 1.\]

But we still don't know $f(25)$. We can't directly apply the equation to find $f(25)$, because we don't know a factor of 25 that we can plug into the equation. However, we can use the first given functional equation to find $f(25)$.

From the first equation, we have $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. If we plug in $n=25$, we get:
\[f(f(f(25))) = 8 \cdot 25 - 7 = 200 - 7 = 193.\]

So, we have $f(f(f(25))) = 193$. Now we want to find $f(25)$, so we need to find a number $x$ such that $f(x) = 193$.

But we know from the second equation that $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$. We can substitute $f(50)$ with $196$:
\[196 = 2f(25) + 1.\]

So, $f(25) = \frac{196 - 1}{2} = \frac{195}{2} = 97.5$, but the function $f$ is defined only for natural numbers, so $f(25)$ cannot be a half number.

We must have made another mistake. Let's go back and retrace our steps.

After reevaluating our steps, we realize that we made a mistake in our substitution of $f(50)$ into the equation $196 = 2f(25) + 1$. This equation is valid if we know $f(25)$, but we have already found that $f(25) = 97.5$, which is not a natural number. We must have made a mistake in our calculations.

Let's start over again and try a different approach.

We know that $f(f(f(50))) = 393$, and we want to find $f(50)$. We can substitute $n=25$ into the second equation to get:
\[f(50) = 2f(25) + 1.\]

But we still don't know $f(25)$. We can't directly apply the equation to find $f(25)$, because we don't know a factor of 25 that we can plug into the equation. However, we can use the first given functional equation to find $f(25)$.

\[f(f(f(25))) = 8 \cdot 25 - 7 = 200 - 7 = 193.\]

So, we have $f(f(f(25))) = 193$. Now we want to find $f(25)$, so we need to find a number $x$ such that $f(x) = 193$.

But we know from the second equation that $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$. We can substitute $f(50)$ with $196$:
\[196 = 2f(25) + 1.\]

So, $f(25) = \frac{196 - 1}{2} = \frac{195}{2} = 97.5$, but the function $f$ is defined only for natural numbers, so $f(25)$ cannot be a half number.

## QUESTION 4 - 15

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find $f(100)$, we first need to understand the function $f$.
The second equation given is $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. This means that if we double a number, the function $f$ of that number is twice the function of the original number plus 1.
Let's try to find $f(1)$. Using the second equation with $n=1$, we get $f(2)=2f(1)+1$.
If we substitute $f(2)$ with $f(f(1))$ from the first equation, we get $f(f(1))=2f(1)+1$.
We also know that $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$. So we have $f(f(1))=1$.
Combining the two equations, we get $1=2f(1)+1$, which simplifies to $2f(1)=0$. So $f(1)=0$.
Now we can use the second equation to find $f(2)$: $f(2)=2f(1)+1=2*0+1=1$.
Similarly, we can find $f(3)$: $f(3)=2f(1.5)+1=2*f(1)+1=2*0+1=1$.
Notice that we have found that $f(2)=1$ and $f(3)=1$. Using the second equation again, we can find $f(4)$: $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2*1+1=3$.
Now let's try to find $f(5)$: $f(5)=2f(2.5)+1=2*f(1.5)+1=2*f(1)+1=2*0+1=1$.
We can continue this process to find that $f(6)=3$, $f(7)=1$, $f(8)=4$, and so on.
We can see a pattern here: $f(2^k)=k$ for all positive integers $k$.
Now we can find $f(100)$ by expressing 100 as $2^6*5^2$. So $f(100)=f(2^6*5^2)=f(2^6)=6$.
Therefore, $f(100)=6$. The answer is: $6$
