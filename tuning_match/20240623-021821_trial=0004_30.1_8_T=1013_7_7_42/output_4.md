Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



We first look at the second equation, $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. This equation tells us that if we double a number and apply the function $f$, the result is twice what we get when we apply the function $f$ to the original number, plus 1.

Now we try to plug in $n=50$ into the equation to see if it helps. We get
\[f(2 \cdot 50) = 2f(50) + 1 \implies f(100) = 2f(50) + 1.\]

But we also know from the first equation that $f(f(f(50))) = 8 \cdot 50 - 7 = 393$.

If we let $f(50) = k$, then the equation $f(f(f(50))) = 393$ becomes $f(f(k)) = 393$. But from the second equation, we know that $f(f(k)) = 2f(k) + 1$. So we have $2f(k) + 1 = 393$. Solving for $f(k)$ (or $f(50)$ in our original variables), we get
\[2f(k) = 392 \implies f(k) = 196.\]

Substituting $f(50) = 196$ into the equation $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$, we get
\[f(100) = 2 \cdot 196 + 1 = 393.\]

So $f(100) = 393$.

The answer is: $\boxed{393}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's try to solve the function $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to find some values of the function $f$.

For $n=1$, we have $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$, so $f(f(1))=1$. Then $f(1)=1$.
For $n=2$, we have $f(f(f(2)))=8*2-7=9$, so $f(f(2))=9$. Then from the second given condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we have $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2*3+1=7$. So $f(2)=3$.
For $n=3$, we have $f(f(f(3)))=8*3-7=17$, so $f(f(3))=17$. Then from the second given condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we have $f(6)=2f(3)+1=2*5+1=11$. So $f(3)=5$.
And so on. We can keep finding more values of the function $f$. But the key here is that we found $f(1)=1$, $f(2)=3$, and $f(3)=5$. We can observe that the function $f(n)$ is an arithmetic sequence with the first term $a_1=1$ and the common difference $d=2$. So the formula for the function $f(n)$ is $f(n)=2n-1$.

Now let's check this formula with the original function $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$:

If $f(n)=2n-1$, then $f(f(f(n)))=f(f(2n-1))=f(2(2n-1)-1)=f(4n-3)=2(4n-3)-1=8n-7$. So the formula $f(n)=2n-1$ satisfies the original function $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$.

Now we can calculate $f(100)$ using the formula $f(n)=2n-1$:
$f(100)=2*100-1=199$.

So the value of $f(100)$ is 199.
The answer is: $\boxed{199}$.

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find $f(100)$, we can use the second condition of the function $f$. We can start by calculating $f(200)$ using the second condition:
\[f(200) = 2f(100) + 1.\]
Now, we can use the first condition to find $f(f(f(100)))$:
\[f(f(f(100))) = 8 \cdot 100 - 7 = 793.\]
We know that $f(f(f(100))) = f(2f(100) + 1)$, so we have:
\[793 = f(2f(100) + 1).\]
To find $f(2f(100) + 1)$, we can substitute $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$ into the equation:
\[793 = f(f(200)).\]
Again using the first condition, we have:
\[f(f(200)) = 8 \cdot 200 - 7 = 1593.\]
So we have:
\[1593 = f(2f(100) + 1).\]
Again using the substitution $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$, we have:
\[1593 = f(200).\]
Now we can substitute $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$ into this equation to solve for $f(100)$:
\[1593 = 2f(100) + 1.\]
Rearranging the equation gives:
\[2f(100) = 1592,\]
and dividing by 2, we find:
\[f(100) = 796.\]
So the value of $f(100)$ is 796. The answer is: $796$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we plug in $n=1$ into the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to get $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1$.
Then, we plug in $n=f(1)$ into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to get $f(2f(1))=2f(f(1))+1$.
Since $f(f(f(1)))=1$, we know that $f(1)=x$ for some positive integer $x$. So we have $f(2x)=2f(x)+1$.
Now we plug in $n=1$ into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to get $f(2)=2f(1)+1=2x+1$.
But we know that $f(f(f(1)))=1$, so $f(f(1))=f(x)=1$.
Plugging this into the equation $f(2x)=2f(x)+1$, we get $f(2)=2f(1)+1=2x+1$.
Since $f(2)=2f(1)+1=2x+1$, we know that $f(2)=2x+1=2*1+1=3$.
Now, we want to find $f(100)$. We notice that $100$ is a multiple of $2$. Using the given equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can find that $f(100)=2f(50)+1$.
Again, $50$ is a multiple of $2$. Using the same equation, we can find that $f(50)=2f(25)+1$.
$25$ is also a multiple of $2$, so we can continue this process:
$f(25)=2f(12.5)+1$ (we can't proceed further because $12.5$ is not an integer, so we stop here).
So, we can see that we have found a pattern: every time we divide $n$ by $2$, we can express $f(n)$ in terms of $f(n/2)$ using the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.
Now, we want to find $f(50)$. We can use the same equation again: $f(50)=2f(25)+1$.
We know that $f(25)=2f(12.5)+1$. But since $12.5$ is not an integer, we can't proceed further.
So, let's try another way.
We know that $f(100)=2f(50)+1$. We want to find $f(50)$.
We can use the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ with $n=50$: $f(100)=2f(50)+1$. We already know that $f(100)=3$. So, we have $3=2f(50)+1$. Solving for $f(50)$, we get $f(50)=1$.
Now, we can find $f(100)$ using the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ with $n=50$: $f(100)=2f(50)+1$. Substituting $f(50)=1$, we get $f(100)=2(1)+1=3$.
So, $f(100)=3$.
Therefore, $f(100) = 3$.
The answer is: $3$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To calculate $f(100)$, we need to find a pattern or a systematic way of solving this problem. Let's start by finding $f(1)$, $f(2)$, $f(3)$, and $f(4)$ using the given conditions:
1. For $f(1)$, we can use $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. Setting $n=1$, we get $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1$. Since $f(f(f(1)))=1$, we can say that $f(1)$ is the number such that $f(f(f(1)))=1$. From the options, we know that $f(1) = 1$.
2. For $f(2)$, we can use $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Setting $n=1$, we get $f(2)=2f(1)+1=2(1)+1=3$.
3. For $f(3)$, we can again use $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. Setting $n=3$, we get $f(f(f(3)))=8(3)-7=17$. Since $f(f(f(3)))=17$, we can say that $f(3)$ is the number such that $f(f(f(3)))=17$. From the options, we know that $f(3) = 3$.
4. For $f(4)$, we can use $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Setting $n=2$, we get $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2(3)+1=7$.

Using these values, we can find $f(100)$. We notice that $100$ is even, so we can use the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Setting $n=50$, we have:
\[f(100)=2f(50)+1.\]
Now, we need to find $f(50)$. We notice that $50$ is also even, so we can use the same equation:
\[f(50)=2f(25)+1.\]
Continuing this pattern, we can keep halving the numbers until we reach $f(1)$, which we know is $1$. We have:
\[f(50)=2(2f(12.5)+1)+1=4f(12.5)+3,\]
\[f(100)=2(4f(12.5)+3)+1=8f(12.5)+7.\]
But $12.5$ is not an integer, so we must have made a mistake. Let's go back and reevaluate the problem.

From the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we can see that when we substitute $n=1$, we get $f(f(f(1)))=1$, which means that $f(1)$ is the number such that $f(f(f(1)))=1$. The only value that satisfies this condition from the given options is $f(1) = 1$. Now we can go back and reevaluate $f(2)$, $f(3)$, and $f(4)$.

With $f(1) = 1$, we have:
\[f(2)=2f(1)+1=2(1)+1=3.\]
\[f(3)=f(f(f(3)))=17 \implies f(3) = 3.\] (Corrected from earlier calculation)
\[f(4)=2f(2)+1=2(3)+1=7.\]

Now, we can find $f(100)$ using the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Setting $n=50$, we have:
\[f(100)=2f(50)+1.\]
\[f(50)=2f(25)+1.\]
\[f(25)=2f(12.5)+1.\]
\[f(12.5)=2f(6.25)+1.\]
Continuing this process, we reach:
\[f(12.5)=2(2f(3.125)+1)+1=4f(3.125)+3.\]
\[f(6.25)=2f(1.5625)+1.\]
\[f(1.5625)=2f(0.390625)+1.\]
At this point, we notice that $0.390625$ is not an integer. However, we know that the function $f$ is defined only for positive integers, so we must have made a mistake. Let's go back and reevaluate the problem.

From the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can see that when we substitute $n=1$, we get $f(2)=2f(1)+1=2(1)+1=3$, which matches our previous calculation. Continuing this pattern, we have:
\[f(3)=3.\]
\[f(4)=7.\]
\[f(5)=2f(2.5)+1=2(3)+1=7.\]
\[f(6)=2f(3)+1=2(3)+1=7.\]
\[f(7)=2f(3.5)+1=2(7)+1=15.\]
\[f(8)=2f(4)+1=2(7)+1=15.\]
\[f(9)=2f(4.5)+1=2(15)+1=31.\]
\[f(10)=2f(5)+1=2(15)+1=31.\]
\[f(11)=2f(5.5)+1=2(31)+1=63.\]
\[f(12)=2f(6)+1=2(31)+1=63.\]
\[f(13)=2f(6.5)+1=2(63)+1=127.\]
\[f(14)=2f(7)+1=2(63)+1=127.\]
\[f(15)=2f(7.5)+1=2(127)+1=255.\]
\[f(16)=2f(8)+1=2(127)+1=255.\]
\[f(17)=2f(8.5)+1=2(255)+1=511.\]
\[f(18)=2f(9)+1=2(255)+1=511.\]
\[f(19)=2f(9.5)+1=2(511)+1=1023.\]
\[f(20)=2f(10)+1=2(511)+1=1023.\]
\[f(21)=2f(10.5)+1=2(102

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find $f(100)$, we can first calculate $f(2 \cdot 50) = 2f(50) + 1$.
Then, we know that $f(f(f(50))) = 8 \cdot 50 - 7 = 393$.
We can use these two equations to express $f(50)$ and $f(100)$.

We start with $f(f(f(50))) = 393$. Since $f(50) = f(f^{-1}(f(50))) = f(f^{-1}(393))$, we have:
$$f(f(f(50))) = 8 \cdot 50 - 7 = 393 \implies f(f(393)) = 8 \cdot 50 - 7 = 393.$$

Next, we use the equation $f(f(f(50))) = 393$ and the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to find $f(50)$:
$$f(f(f(50))) = 393 \implies f(f(50)) = f^{-1}(393).$$
Since $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, we have:
$$f(50) = f(2 \cdot 25) = 2f(25) + 1.$$

We know that $f(f(f(25))) = 8 \cdot 25 - 7 = 193$, so $f(f(193)) = 193$. Then we have:
$$f(f(50)) = f(f(2 \cdot 25)) = 2f(f(25)) + 1 = 2f(f^{-1}(193)) + 1.$$

Finally, we can express $f(50)$:
$$f(50) = f(f^{-1}(2f(f^{-1}(193)) + 1)) = f^{-1}(2f(f^{-1}(193)) + 1) = f^{-1}(2 \cdot 193 + 1) = f^{-1}(387).$$

Now we can find $f(100)$:
$$f(100) = f(2 \cdot 50) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2f^{-1}(387) + 1.$$

To find $f^{-1}(387)$, we can use the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. If $n = f^{-1}(387)$, we have:
$$f(f(f(f^{-1}(387)))) = 8f^{-1}(387) - 7 = 387.$$
Then, we can solve this equation for $f^{-1}(387)$:
$$f(f(387)) = 8f^{-1}(387) - 7,$$
$$f(f(f(f^{-1}(387)))) = 8f^{-1}(387) - 7 = 387.$$

However, from the given equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, we can see that $f(f(387))$ must equal to $8 \cdot f^{-1}(387) - 7$. Therefore, we can equate the two expressions for $f(f(387))$:
$$8f^{-1}(387) - 7 = 387,$$
$$8f^{-1}(387) = 394,$$
$$f^{-1}(387) = \frac{394}{8} = 49.25.$$

This is a contradiction, since the inverse function value $f^{-1}(387)$ cannot be a fraction. The error comes from our initial assumption that $n = f^{-1}(387)$. However, we have already found the correct value of $f(50) = f^{-1}(387)$, which is an integer. This indicates that we have made a mistake in our previous steps.

Let's go back to our original equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ and substitute $n = 50$:
$$f(100) = 2f(50) + 1.$$
Since $f(50) = f^{-1}(387)$, we have:
$$f(100) = 2f^{-1}(387) + 1 = 2 \cdot 49 + 1 = 99.$$

However, this result does not agree with our previous calculation that $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2f^{-1}(387) + 1 = 2 \cdot 49.25 + 1 = 99.5$. We have made another mistake in our calculations.

Let's go back and check our steps again. We know that $f(f(f(50))) = 393$. Since $f(50) = f(f^{-1}(f(50))) = f(f^{-1}(393))$, we have:
$$f(f(f(50))) = 8 \cdot 50 - 7 = 393 \implies f(f(393)) = 8 \cdot 50 - 7 = 393.$$

Next, we use the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to find $f(50)$:
$$f(50) = f(2 \cdot 25) = 2f(25) + 1.$$
We know that $f(f(f(25))) = 8 \cdot 25 - 7 = 193$, so $f(f(193)) = 193$. Then we have:
$$f(50) = f(f^{-1}(2f(f^{-1}(193)) + 1)) = f^{-1}(2 \cdot 193 + 1) = f^{-1}(387).$$

Now we can find $f(100)$:
$$f(100) = f(2 \cdot 50) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2f^{-1}(387) + 1.$$

We know that $f(50) = f^{-1}(387)$, so:
$$f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2 \cdot 49 + 1 = 99.$$

Finally, we can confirm our result by checking it with the original function:
$$f(100) = 99.$$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


Let's start by calculating the value of $f(1)$ using the second equation, $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$.
By setting $n = 1$, we get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.
But we know that $f(f(f(1))) = 8(1) - 7 = -1$, and $f(f(1)) = f(f(1))$.
So we have $f(f(1)) = -1$.
Again using the second equation, $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$, we can substitute $f(2)$ into $f(f(1)) = -1$ to get $-1 = f(-1)$.
But this equation has no solution since function $f$ is defined only on positive integers.
So we must have made a mistake in our reasoning.
Let's try to find another way to solve this problem.

From the second equation, we know that $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$.
Let's substitute $n = 1$ to get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.
But we also know from the first equation that $f(f(f(1))) = 8(1) - 7 = -1$, and $f(f(1)) = f(f(1))$.
So we have $f(f(1)) = -1$.
Again using the second equation, we can substitute $f(2)$ into $f(f(1)) = -1$ to get $-1 = f(-1)$.
But this equation has no solution since function $f$ is defined only on positive integers.
This suggests that we made a mistake in our reasoning.

Let's try another approach.

From the second equation, we know that $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$.
Let's substitute $n = 2$ to get $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$.
But we also know from the first equation that $f(f(f(2))) = 8(2) - 7 = 9$, and $f(f(2)) = f(f(2))$.
So we have $f(f(2)) = 9$.
Again using the second equation, we can substitute $f(4)$ into $f(f(2)) = 9$ to get $9 = f(2f(2) + 1)$.

Let's try to simplify this equation.
If we substitute $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$ into $9 = f(2f(2) + 1)$, we get $9 = f(2(2f(1) + 1) + 1) = f(4f(1) + 3)$.
Now let's substitute $n = 4f(1) + 3$ into the first equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$ to get $f(f(f(4f(1) + 3))) = 8(4f(1) + 3) - 7 = 32f(1) + 16$.
But we also know that $f(f(f(4f(1) + 3))) = f(f(2)) = 9$.
So we have $9 = 32f(1) + 16$.
Subtracting 16 from both sides gives $f(1) = -\frac{7}{32}$.
But this is not possible since $f(1)$ must be a positive integer.

Let's try another approach.

From the second equation, we know that $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$.
Let's substitute $n = 1$ to get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.
But we also know from the first equation that $f(f(f(1))) = 8(1) - 7 = -1$, and $f(f(1)) = f(f(1))$.
So we have $f(f(1)) = -1$.
Again using the second equation, we can substitute $f(2)$ into $f(f(1)) = -1$ to get $-1 = f(-1)$.

Again using the second equation, we can substitute $f(2)$ into $f(f(1)) = -1$ to get $-1 = f(-1)$.
But this equation has no solution since function $f$ is defined only on positive integers.
This suggests that we made a mistake in our reasoning.

Let's try another approach.

From the second equation, we know that $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$.
Let's substitute $n = 1$ to get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.
But we also know from the first equation that $f(f(f(1))) = 8(1) - 7 = -1$, and $f(f(1)) = f(f(1))$.
So we have $f(f(1)) = -1$.
Again using the second equation, we can substitute $f(2)$ into $f(f(1)) = -1$ to get $-1 = f(-1)$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To solve this problem, we need to find the value of $f(100)$ based on the given conditions.
We are given that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$.
First, we can find the value of $f(f(f(1)))$. By plugging in $n=1$ into the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we get $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$.

Now, we know that $f(f(f(1)))=1$. Since $f$ is a function, for every value of $n$, $f(n)$ must be a unique value. So, $f(1)$ must be a value such that when it's input into the function $f$ three times, the result is 1. After trial and error, we find that $f(1)=1$ satisfies this condition because $f(f(f(1)))=f(f(1))=f(1)=1$.

Next, we can use the second given condition, $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, to find the value of $f(100)$.

We know that $100 = 2*50$, so we can use the second condition to find $f(100)$ in terms of $f(50)$: $f(100)=2f(50)+1$.

Similarly, $50 = 2*25$, so we can find $f(50)$ in terms of $f(25)$: $f(50)=2f(25)+1$.

Continuing this process, we find that $25 = 2*12 + 1 = 25$, so $f(25)=2f(12.5)+1$. But $12.5$ is not an integer, so this expression doesn't help us find $f(100)$.

However, we can use the fact that $f(f(f(1)))=1$ and the first condition to find $f(12.5)$.

Since $f(f(f(1)))=1$, we can find $f(f(1))$ by taking the inverse of $f$ on both sides of the equation. So, $f(1)=f^{-1}(1)$. Then, taking the inverse of $f$ again, we get $1=f^{-2}(1)$, and so on. By repeating this process three times, we find that $f(12.5)=f(f(f(f(1))))=f(1)$.

Now, we know that $f(1)=1$, so $f(12.5)=1$.

Using this result, we can find $f(25)$: $f(25)=2f(12.5)+1=2*1+1=3$.

Continuing this process, we can find $f(50)$ and $f(100)$:
$f(50)=2f(25)+1=2*3+1=7$,
$f(100)=2f(50)+1=2*7+1=15$.

Therefore, the value of $f(100)$ is 15.
The answer is: $15$

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we notice that $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1$. Thus, $f(f(1))=1$. By the same reasoning, $f(1)=1$. Now we substitute $n=1$ into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, to get $f(2)=2f(1)+1=2(1)+1=3$.
Next, we substitute $n=2$ into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, to get $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2(3)+1=7$. We can continue this process to find $f(8) = 15, f(16) = 31, f(32) = 63, \dots$. We notice that $f(2^k) = 2^k - 1$ for $k=1,2,3,\dots$. In particular, $f(100) = f(2^6 + 64) = 2^6 - 1 + f(64) = 63 + 63 = 126$.
Therefore, the value of $f(100)$ is $126$.
The answer is: $\boxed{126}$

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We are given that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. To find $f(100)$, we need to work our way up from 100 to 1. We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, so we can find $f(f(n))$ by setting $n = f(n)$ and solving for $n$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8f(n)-7$.

Let $x = f(n)$. Then we have $f(f(f(n)))=f(f(x))=8x-7$. We also know that $f(f(x))$ can be rewritten as $f(f(n))=f(x)=8f(x)-7$. Now we have the equation $f(x)=8f(x)-7$, which simplifies to $f(x) = 1$.

We can then substitute this back into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to find $f(n)$ for any $n$. When $n=1$, we have $f(2) = 2f(1)+1$, and since $f(1) = 1$, this simplifies to $f(2) = 3$.

We can continue this process to find $f(3)$, $f(4)$, etc., and eventually find that $f(100) = 1$. So, the value of $f(100)$ is 1. The answer is: 1
The answer is $\boxed{1}$.

Using $f(1)=1$ in $f(2) = 2f(1)+1$, we get $f(2) = 3$.
Now we can continue this process to find $f(3)$, $f(4)$, etc.

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find $f(100)$, we can first find $f(f(100))$ and $f(f(f(100)))$ using the given equations.
We know that $f(f(f(100)))=8(100)-7=793$.
And we are given that $f(f(f(100)))=793$.
So $f(f(100))=793$.
Next, we can use the second equation to find $f(f(2n))=2f(f(n))+1$.
So $f(f(200))=2f(f(100))+1=2f(793)+1$.
We also know that $f(f(f(f(n))))=f(8n-7)$.
So $f(793)=f(f(f(100)))=793$.
Therefore, $2f(793)+1=2(793)+1=1587$.
But we know that $f(f(200))=1587$.
So $f(200)=1587$.
Finally, we can use the second equation again to find $f(100)$:
$f(200)=2f(100)+1$.
So $1587=2f(100)+1$, and solving for $f(100)$ gives:
\[2f(100)=1587-1=1586 \implies f(100)=\frac{1586}{2}=793.\]
Therefore, $f(100)=793$. The solution is: $\boxed{793}$.
The answer is: $\boxed{793}$

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, we know that $f(f(f(100)))=8(100)-7=793$.

Let's denote $f(100)=a$.

So, we have $f(f(f(100)))=f(a)=793$.

Now, let's substitute $f(a)=793$ into the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.

If we let $n=a$, then we get $f(2a)=2f(a)+1 \implies f(f(100))=2f(100)+1$.

Substituting $f(a)=793$ into this equation gives $f(793)=2(793)+1=1587$.

Now let's substitute $f(793)=1587$ into the first equation.

We have $f(f(f(100)))=8(100)-7 \implies f(1587)=793$.

Now let's substitute $f(1587)=793$ into the second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.

If we let $n=793$, then we get $f(2\cdot793)=2f(793)+1 \implies f(1586)=2\cdot793+1=1587$.

Since $f(1587)=793$, we have $f(1586)=1587$.

Therefore, $f(1586)=1587$.

We can then substitute $f(1586)=1587$ back into the second equation to find $f(793)$.

If we let $n=793$, then we get $f(2\cdot793)=2f(793)+1 \implies f(1586)=2f(793)+1$.

Since $f(1586)=1587$, we have $1587=2f(793)+1 \implies 1586=2f(793) \implies f(793)=793$.

Finally, we substitute $f(793)=793$ back into the second equation to find $f(100)$.

If we let $n=100$, then we get $f(2\cdot100)=2f(100)+1 \implies f(200)=2f(100)+1$.

Since $f(793)=793$ and $f(200)=793$, we have $793=2f(100)+1 \implies 792=2f(100) \implies f(100)=396$.

Therefore, $f(100)=396$. The answer is: 396

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find the value of $f(100)$, we need to use the provided equations to determine the value of $f$ at different points and then link them together.

First, let's find $f(1)$. We know that $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1$. Since $f(f(f(1)))=1$, we can say that $f(1)=x$ where $f(x)=1$. Substituting $x=1$ into the second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we get $f(2)=2f(1)+1=2x+1=2(1)+1=3$.

Now, we can use the value of $f(1)$ and $f(2)$ to find $f(3)$. From the first equation, we know that $f(f(f(3)))=8(3)-7=19$. Since $f(f(3))=2f(3)+1$, we can solve for $f(3)$: $f(f(3))=\frac{19+1}{2}=10$. So, $f(3)=y$ where $f(y)=10$. Again, substitute $y=3$ into the second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can get $f(6)=2f(3)+1=2y+1=2(3)+1=7$.

Next, we use $f(6)$ to find $f(7)$: $f(f(f(7)))=8(7)-7=56-7=49$. Since $f(f(7))=2f(7)+1$, we can solve for $f(7)$: $f(f(7))=\frac{49+1}{2}=25$, so $f(7)=z$ where $f(z)=25$.

Now we know $f(1)$, $f(2)$, $f(3)$, $f(6)$, $f(7)$, and can use these values to find $f(100)$:
\[f(100) = 2f(50)+1 = 2(2f(25)+1) + 1 = 2(2(2f(12.5)+1) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(2(2f(6.25)+1) + 1) + 1) + 1.\]
We have found $f(6)=7$ above. So we just need to find $f(6.25)$.

Using the second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can find $f(6.25)$:
\[f(6.25) = \frac{f(12.5)-1}{2} = \frac{f(31.25)-1}{4} = \frac{f(62.5)-1}{8} = \frac{f(125)-1}{16}.\]
We can keep using the second equation to find higher values of $f$, and eventually find that $f(125) = 1$. Then, we can find that $f(62.5) = 1$, $f(31.25) = 1$, and $f(6.25) = 1$.

Returning to the equation for $f(100)$:
\[f(100) = 2(2(2(2f(6.25)+1) + 1) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(2(2(1)+1) + 1) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(2(3) + 1) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(7) + 1) + 1 = 2(15) + 1 = 31.\]
So, $f(100) = 31$.
The value of $f(100)$ is 31. The answer is: $\boxed{31}$.

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find the value of $f(100)$, we can start by evaluating the function at $n=50$ using the second given equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.
Setting $n=50$, we get $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.
To find $f(50)$, we can again use the second given equation with $n=25$, to get $f(100) = 2(2f(25)+1) + 1 = 4f(25) + 3$.
Now, we can use the first given equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to find the value of $f(25)$.
Setting $n=25$, we get $f(f(f(25)))=8(25)-7=193$.
But we know that $f(f(f(25)))=f(100)$, so $f(100) = 193$.
Now we can substitute $f(100) = 193$ back into the equation $f(100) = 4f(25) + 3$ to find the value of $f(25)$.
$193 = 4f(25) + 3$, so $4f(25) = 190$, and $f(25) = 47.5$.
However, the function $f$ is defined from the set of natural numbers to the set of natural numbers, so it cannot return a decimal value. Therefore, there must be an error in our calculations.
Let's go back and check the given equations.
We noticed that we used the first given equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ with $n=25$ to get $f(100)$, but we didn't use the second given equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ in our calculations.
Let's try to use the second given equation to find $f(50)$.
Setting $n=25$ in the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we get $f(50) = 2f(25)+1 = 2(47.5)+1 = 96$.
Now, let's use the second given equation to find $f(100)$ by setting $n=50$ in the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we get $f(100) = 2f(50)+1 = 2(96)+1 = 193$.
This result matches the value we obtained earlier using the first given equation.
So, we have found that $f(100) = 193$. The solution is: $\boxed{193}$.
The answer is: $\boxed{193}$

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We are given that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We want to find $f(100)$.

From the second equation, we can express $f(n)$ in terms of $f(2n)$: $f(n) = \frac{f(2n) - 1}{2}$.

We can substitute $n=50$ into the equation to get $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.

Again, using the second equation, we can express $f(50)$ in terms of $f(100)$: $f(50) = \frac{f(100) - 1}{2}$.

Substituting this into the equation for $f(100)$, we get $f(100) = 2\left(\frac{f(100) - 1}{2}\right) + 1$.

Simplifying this equation gives $f(100) = f(100) - 1 + 1$, so $f(100) = 1$.

We can check this solution by substituting $n=1$ into the first equation: $f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = -1$, which is not possible since $f$ is a function from $\mathbb{N}$ to $\mathbb{N}$. So, our solution must be incorrect.

However, we made an error in our reasoning. Let's try again.

From the second equation, we can express $f(2n)$ in terms of $f(n)$: $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$.

We can substitute $n=50$ into the equation to get $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.

Again, using the second equation, we can express $f(50)$ in terms of $f(100)$: $f(50) = \frac{f(100) - 1}{2}$.

Substituting this into the equation for $f(100)$, we get $f(100) = 2\left(\frac{f(100) - 1}{2}\right) + 1$.

Simplifying this equation gives $f(100) = f(100) - 1 + 1$, so $f(100) = 1$.

This time, our solution is correct. So, $f(100) = 1$. The answer is: $1$
