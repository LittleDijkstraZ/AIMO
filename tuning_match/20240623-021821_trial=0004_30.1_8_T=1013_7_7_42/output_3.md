Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $AB = 0$ is satisfied if and only if at least one of the factors is zero. Hence the given equation is equivalent to
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0 \ \text{ or } \ ((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]The first equation implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10.$ The only way both equations can hold is if $x = 0$ and $y = 0.$ The second equation implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8.$ So the given points are the vertices of a square with side length 16. Thus its area is $16^2 = 256.$ The answer is: $256$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



For the product of two factors to be zero, either one of the factors must be zero. So we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$
For this case to be true, both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these equations are $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These represent the lines $y = 10 - x$, $y = -10 - x$, $y = x - 10$, and $y = -x + 10$. These lines form a square with side length $20$. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.

Case 2: $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$
For this case to be true, both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These represent the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines also form a square with side length $16$. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

The area of the convex polygon formed by the points that satisfy the original equation is the sum of the areas of the two squares. So the area of the convex polygon is $400 + 256 = 656$.
The answer is: $656$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The given expression is equal to zero if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
These conditions are met if and only if $|x + y| = 10$, $|x - y| = 10$, $|x| = 8$, or $|y| = 8$.
The equations $|x + y| = 10$, $|x - y| = 10$, $|x| = 8$, and $|y| = 8$ represent four lines in the coordinate plane. The intersections of these lines form a rectangle with side lengths 16 and 20. The area of this rectangle is $16 \times 20 = 320$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 320 square units. The answer is: $320$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, let's break down the given equation:

$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$

This equation is equal to zero if and only if at least one of the factors is zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only way this can happen is if $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$. This gives us a total of 4 points: $(10, 10)$, $(10, -10)$, $(-10, 10)$, and $(-10, -10)$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The only way this can happen is if $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us a total of 4 points: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

Now, let's plot these points on a coordinate plane. Joining these points together, we get a square with side length 20. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 400.
The answer is: $400$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we recognize that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. 
If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$.
If $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = \pm 10$.
If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$.
If $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = \pm 8$.
Putting all these conditions together, we can draw the following conclusions:
- For $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$, we can solve the system of equations to get the points $(5, 5)$, $(5, -5)$, $(-5, 5)$, and $(-5, -5)$.
- For $x = \pm 8$, we can substitute into $x + y = \pm 10$ or $x - y = \pm 10$ to get the points $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$.
- For $y = \pm 8$, we can use the same process to get the points $(2, 8)$, $(-2, 8)$, $(2, -8)$, and $(-2, -8)$.

These eight points are the vertices of the convex polygon.

Now, we can calculate the area of this polygon. It is a square with side length 10, so its area is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These two equations imply that the points $(x, y)$ must lie on the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, or $x - y = -10$.

Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means the points $(x, y)$ must lie on the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, or $y = -8$.

The intersection of these lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(8,8)$, $(-8,8)$, $(-8,-8)$, and $(8,-8)$.

The area of this rectangle is given by the product of its length and width. The length is $16$ (obtained by subtracting $-8$ from $8$) and the width is $16$ (obtained by subtracting $-8$ from $8$), so the area is $16 \times 16 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is equal to zero when either of the two factors is zero.
For the first factor to be zero, we need $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
This means that $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the polygon:
$(10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, $(-10, 0)$, and $(0, -10)$.
For the second factor to be zero, we need $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
This means that $x = 8$ or $x = -8$ and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.
Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the polygon:
$(8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, $(-8, 0)$, and $(0, -8)$.
The points that satisfy either of these conditions form a square with side length 20.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $20^2 = 400$.
The value of the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{400}$.
The answer is: $400$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The given equation is: $ ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$
For the product of two numbers to be zero, either one of the numbers must be zero. So, we have two cases:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
This equation implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These equations represent two lines: $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$ (for $\vert x + y \vert = 10$), and $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$ (for $\vert x - y \vert = 10$). The intersections of these lines form a square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$. The area of this square is $(10\sqrt{2})^2 = 200$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
This equation implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which represent four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. The intersections of these lines form a square with side length $16$. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

However, the area of the polygon enclosed by the points satisfying the original equation should be a part of the area of the square formed by Case 2. The area of the square formed by Case 1 is entirely contained in the square formed by Case 2. So, the area of the polygon enclosed by the points satisfying the original equation is the difference of the areas of the two squares, which is $256 - 200 = 56$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $56$.
The answer is: $56$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ is zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
The expressions $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$ are zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
Thus, the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the given equation must lie on the intersection of the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, $x - y = -10$, $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.
Plotting these lines on a graph, we find that the intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 10.
Therefore, the area of this square is $10 \times 10 = 100$. The answer is: 100

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, we consider the case when the left hand side of the equation is zero. This occurs when at least one of the factors is zero.

For the first factor to be zero, we have either $|\pm x \pm y - 10| = 0$. This gives us four equations:

1. $|x + y - 10| = 0 \implies x + y = 10$.
2. $|x - y - 10| = 0 \implies x - y = 10$.
3. $|-x + y - 10| = 0 \implies -x + y = 10$.
4. $|-x - y - 10| = 0 \implies -x - y = 10$.

For the second factor to be zero, we have either $|\pm x - 8| = 0$ or $|\pm y - 8| = 0$. This gives us four more equations:

5. $|x - 8| = 0 \implies x = 8$.
6. $|y - 8| = 0 \implies y = 8$.
7. $|-x - 8| = 0 \implies -x = 8 \implies x = -8$.
8. $|-y - 8| = 0 \implies -y = 8 \implies y = -8$.

By plotting these lines on the xy-plane, we find that they enclose a square with side length 10. The area of the square is side length squared, which is $10^2 = 100$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100.
The answer is: $100$.

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, we need to understand that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So, the equation is satisfied when either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.

If $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.

If $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

These equations represent 8 lines on the coordinate plane: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, $x - y = -10$, $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, $y = -8$. Plotting these lines on the coordinate plane, we find that they form a square with side length 16.

The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we note that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$.
If $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = \pm 10$.
If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$.
If $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = \pm 8$.

Therefore, the points that satisfy the equation are the intersection points of the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, $x - y = -10$, $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

These lines form a square with side length 10, and the area of this square is $10 \times 10 = 100$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{100}$.
The answer is: $100$
