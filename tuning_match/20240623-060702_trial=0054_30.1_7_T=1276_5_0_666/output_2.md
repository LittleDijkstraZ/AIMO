Certainly! let's derive the algebraic expression step by step:



For the equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ to have 4 distinct solutions, the right-hand side $\frac{m}{100}$ must be positive. This means $m$ must be positive.

We start by considering the equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$. The equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = k$ (where $k$ is a positive constant) has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $0 < k < 3$. This is because the function $| |x - 1| - 2 |$ varies between 0 and 3.

So in our case, we require $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 3$. This gives us $0 < m < 300$. Therefore, the positive integers $m$ for which the given equation has 4 distinct solutions are the integers from 1 to 299.

Now, to find out for how many of these $m$ the equation has 4 distinct solutions, we can simply count the number of integers from 1 to 299. This is simply $299$.

Here is a Python program that calculates this:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def count_m():
    lower_bound = 1
    upper_bound = 299
    count = upper_bound - lower_bound + 1
    return count

result = count_m()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 299

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
299
```
The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is $299$. The answer is: $\boxed{299}$.

Certainly! let's derive the algebraic expression step by step:



First, let's analyze the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\]

For this equation to have four distinct solutions, we need to make the right-hand side positive and non-zero. Therefore, $m$ must be a positive integer and $\frac{m}{100} > 0$, which means $m > 0$.

Now, let's consider the absolute value equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}.\]

We can break this into two cases:

Case 1: $\vert x - 1 \vert - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$.
Solving this equation, we get $\vert x - 1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.
This gives us two sub-cases:
Sub-case 1.1: $x - 1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. Solving for $x$, we get $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.
Sub-case 1.2: $-(x - 1) = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. Solving for $x$, we get $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Case 2: $-\vert x - 1 \vert + 2 = \frac{m}{100}$.
Solving this equation, we get $\vert x - 1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
This gives us two sub-cases:
Sub-case 2.1: $x - 1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. Solving for $x$, we get $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
Sub-case 2.2: $-(x - 1) = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. Solving for $x$, we get $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

In order for these to be four distinct solutions, we need the following conditions to hold:

1. $2 + \frac{m}{100} > 2$, or $\frac{m}{100} > 0$. This is already true as $m > 0$.
2. $2 + \frac{m}{100} < 3$, or $\frac{m}{100} < 1$, which gives $m < 100$.
3. $2 - \frac{m}{100} > 0$, or $\frac{m}{100} < 2$, which gives $m < 200$.
4. $2 - \frac{m}{100} > -1$, or $\frac{m}{100} > -1$, which is always true.
5. $2 - \frac{m}{100} < 2$, or $\frac{m}{100} = 0$, which gives $m = 0$. But this would result in only three distinct solutions, not four. So, this condition is not valid.

From conditions 2 and 3, we have $0 < m < 100$. The only positive integer values of $m$ that satisfy this condition are the integers from 1 to 99. So, there are 99 possible values of $m$ that make the equation have four distinct solutions.

Here is the Python code to find the number of possible values of m:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def find_m():
    m_values = list(range(1, 100))
    return len(m_values)

result = find_m()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 99

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
99
```
The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is $99$. The answer is: $99$.

Assistant:

Certainly! let's derive the algebraic expression step by step:


\[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\]
The expression $|x - 1|$ is a distance between $x$ and $1$ on the number line. The expression $||x - 1| - 2|$ is the distance between the distance between $x$ and $1$ and the number $2$ on the number line. The equation states that this distance is equal to $\frac{m}{100}$ for some positive integer $m$.

The equation $||x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if the distance from $2$ to $1$ is greater than $\frac{m}{100}$, but less than the sum of the distances from $1$ to $0$ and from $0$ to $-1$. This is because the equation has 4 distinct solutions when the 'peak' of the 'V'-shape of the absolute value function is higher than $\frac{m}{100}$, but not so high as to eliminate one of the 'branches' of the 'V'.

The distance from $2$ to $1$ is $1$. The sum of the distances from $1$ to $0$ and from $0$ to $-1$ is $2$. So, we want $1 > \frac{m}{100} > 0$.

Multiplying through by $100$ gives $100 > m > 0$. The positive integers that satisfy this inequality are $1$ through $99$, inclusive. Therefore, there are $99$ values of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions. The answer is: $99$

Assistant:

Certainly! let's derive the algebraic expression step by step:



The absolute value equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] can be rewritten as a compound equation:

1. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 \geq 0$, the equation becomes: \[\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100} \implies \vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}.\]

This can be further broken down into two cases:

- If $x-1 \geq 0$, we have: \[x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100} \implies x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}.\]
- If $x-1 < 0$, we have: \[-x+1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100} \implies x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}.\]

2. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0$, the equation becomes: \[\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100} \implies \vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}.\]

This can be further broken down into two cases:

- If $x-1 \geq 0$, we have: \[x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100} \implies x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}.\]
- If $x-1 < 0$, we have: \[-x+1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100} \implies x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}.\]

Now, we need to find the values of $m$ for which the four solutions are distinct. By analyzing the solutions, we find that only the cases $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ can result in distinct solutions. This implies that $2 - \frac{m}{100} > 0$, which leads to $m < 200$. Therefore, the only values of $m$ that result in four distinct solutions are the positive integers less than 200.

The number of such integers is 199. Therefore, the value of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions is 199. The answer is: $199$

Certainly! let's derive the algebraic expression step by step:



The expression $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

If $|x-1| - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$, then $|x-1| = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. So, we have two cases:
1. $x - 1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x - 1 = -(2 + \frac{m}{100})$.
2. Solving the first equation in case 1, we get $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.
3. Solving the second equation in case 1, we get $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.
4. For case 2, we get $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ from the first equation and $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$ from the second equation.

The solutions are $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$, $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$, $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, and $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

The distance between each consecutive pair of solutions is 2, so we require that $2*\frac{m}{100} = 2$, which gives $m = 100$. Therefore, the only value of $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is $m=100$. Hence, the answer is $1$. The output should be $1$.
The value of $m$ that satisfies the condition is $100$. So the solution is $1$.
The answer is: $1$

Certainly! let's derive the algebraic expression step by step:



The equation is $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, and we want to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation has $4$ distinct solutions.

Firstly, let's consider the absolute value equation inside the outer absolute value: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = y$, where $y$ can be either $\frac{m}{100}$ or $-\frac{m}{100}$. So we have two cases:

Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$.
This can be rewritten as $\vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100} + 2$.
This implies two sub-cases:
Case 1.1: $x - 1 = \frac{m}{100} + 2$, which gives $x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$.
Case 1.2: $-(x - 1) = \frac{m}{100} + 2$, which gives $x = 1 - \frac{m}{100} - 2 = - \frac{m}{100} - 1$.

Case 2: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$, which can be rewritten as $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
This gives two sub-cases:
Case 2.1: $x - 1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which gives $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
Case 2.2: $-(x - 1) = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which gives $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Now, for the equation to have $4$ distinct solutions, the solutions from the four sub-cases should be different. This gives us the following system of inequalities:
\[\frac{m}{100} + 3 \neq - \frac{m}{100} - 1,\]
\[\frac{m}{100} + 3 \neq 3 - \frac{m}{100},\]
\[- \frac{m}{100} - 1 \neq 3 - \frac{m}{100},\]
\[- \frac{m}{100} - 1 \neq -1 + \frac{m}{100}.\]
Solving this system of inequalities, we find that $100 < m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from $101$ to $199$, inclusive. Therefore, there are $100$ such positive integers $m$.

To verify the solution's correctness, we can simply check the number of positive integers $m$ in the range $101$ to $199$. There indeed are $100$ such integers. Therefore, the solution is correct.

The final numerical answer is $100$. The answer is: $100$.

Certainly! let's derive the algebraic expression step by step:


The equation is $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|=\frac{m}{100}$, and we want to find the number of values of $m$ such that the equation has 4 distinct solutions.
First, we can consider the absolute value expression $\vert x-1 \vert -2$.
We can split this into two cases:
Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$
In this case, $\vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100} + 2$.
This gives us two sub-cases:
Sub-case 1a: $x-1 = \frac{m}{100} + 2$, which simplifies to $x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$.
Sub-case 1b: $-(x-1) = \frac{m}{100} + 2$, which simplifies to $x = 1 - \frac{m}{100} - 2 = - \frac{m}{100} - 1$.
Case 2: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$
In this case, $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
This gives us two sub-cases:
Sub-case 2a: $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
Sub-case 2b: $-(x-1) = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.
So, the four distinct solutions are given by:
\[x = \frac{m}{100} + 3, - \frac{m}{100} - 1, 3 - \frac{m}{100}, -1 + \frac{m}{100}\]
We want these solutions to be distinct, so we need the four expressions to be different.
This gives us the following inequalities:
\[\frac{m}{100} + 3 \neq - \frac{m}{100} - 1, \frac{m}{100} + 3 \neq 3 - \frac{m}{100}, \frac{m}{100} + 3 \neq -1 + \frac{m}{100},\] \[- \frac{m}{100} - 1 \neq 3 - \frac{m}{100}, - \frac{m}{100} - 1 \neq -1 + \frac{m}{100}, 3 - \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 + \frac{m}{100}.\]
Simplifying these inequalities, we get:
\[m \neq -500, m \neq 100, m \neq 200, m \neq 500.\]
So, the only value of $m$ that satisfies all these inequalities is $m = 100$.
Therefore, the only value of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is $m = 100$.
Thus, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 1. The answer is: 1

Assistant:

Certainly! let's derive the algebraic expression step by step:



The equation is $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ and it has 4 distinct solutions.

First, consider the case where $\vert x-1 \vert -2 > 0$. The equation becomes $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.
This gives us two possibilities:
1) $x - 1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.
2) $-(x - 1) = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Next, consider the case where $\vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0$. The equation becomes $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
This gives us two more possibilities:
3) $x - 1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
4) $-(x - 1) = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Notice that the last two possibilities (3 and 4) are exactly the same as the first two (1 and 2). Therefore, we only need to consider the first two possibilities.

For the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, we need the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ to be such that $x$ in each of the equations (1 and 2) is distinct.
This implies that $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Solving these inequalities gives $m > 100$. Since $m$ is a positive integer, the smallest possible value of $m$ is 101.

So, the value of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 101. The answer is: $\boxed{101}$

Assistant:

Certainly! let's derive the algebraic expression step by step:



Given the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$

First, let's analyze the right side of the equation. Since $m$ is a positive integer, $\frac{m}{100}$ is a positive number. Therefore, we are looking for the number of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions.

Let's analyze the left side of the equation:

$\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$

This equation is a double absolute value equation. We can solve it in several steps:

1. Solve $\vert x-1 \vert -2=\frac{m}{100}$
2. Solve $\vert x-1 \vert =2+\frac{m}{100}$
3. Solve $x-1=2+\frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1=-2-\frac{m}{100}$
4. Solve $x=3+\frac{m}{100}$ or $x=-1-\frac{m}{100}$

Now, we want the equation to have 4 distinct solutions. This means that the distances between the solutions are different. The distances are:

$3+\frac{m}{100}-(-1-\frac{m}{100})=4+\frac{2m}{100}$

and

$-1-\frac{m}{100}-(3+\frac{m}{100})=-4-\frac{2m}{100}$

Since we want these distances to be different, we have:

$4+\frac{2m}{100} \neq -4-\frac{2m}{100}$

Simplifying this equation, we get:

$4+\frac{2m}{100} > 0$ and $-4-\frac{2m}{100} < 0$

This simplifies to:

$2m > -400$ and $2m < 400$

Simplifying further, we get:

$-200 < m < 200$

Since $m$ is a positive integer, the possible values of $m$ are:

$1 \leq m \leq 199$

So, there are 199 possible values of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions.

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{199}$.

Now, let's implement this expression in a program:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def number_of_solutions():
    return 199

result = number_of_solutions()
print(result)
```

So, there are 199 positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions. The answer is: $\boxed{199}$.

Certainly! let's derive the algebraic expression step by step:



1) The absolute value equation $|x-1|-2 = \frac{m}{100}$ can have either of two forms, depending on whether $|x-1|-2$ is nonnegative or negative.
2) If $|x-1|-2 \ge 0$, then $|x-1|-2 = \frac{m}{100}$ implies $|x-1| = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which further implies $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 = -2 - \frac{m}{100}$. The solutions to these are $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$ respectively.
3) If $|x-1|-2 < 0$, then $|x-1|-2 = -\frac{m}{100}$ implies $|x-1| = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which further implies $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 = -2 + \frac{m}{100}$. The solutions to these are $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$ respectively.
4) To have 4 distinct solutions, one of the "or" cases in each of the two above cases must give distinct solutions from the other "or" cases. It turns out that the case $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ is never distinct from the case $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, and the same is true of the cases $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$. Therefore, the only possible combinations to provide 4 distinct solutions are:
   a) $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$, or
   b) $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.
5) Requiring these two pairs of solutions to be distinct implies that $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $3 - \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 + \frac{m}{100}$, which gives $m \neq -500$ and $m \neq 100$. Thus $0 < m < 100$, so $m$ can be any of the first 99 positive integers. Therefore, there are 99 values of $m$ for which the equation $||x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions. The answer is: $99$.
