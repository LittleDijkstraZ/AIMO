Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. This means that the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, should be a number such that it creates $4$ distinct solutions for the absolute value equation.

The inner absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, can take on either of two values, $y$ or $-y$, where $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. So we can rewrite the equation as two separate cases:

1. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$,
2. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.

For each of these cases, we can solve the absolute value equations separately.

For case 1, $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. The expression inside the absolute value, $x-1$, can be either positive or negative. So we have two sub-cases:

1.1. $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which gives $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.
1.2. $-(x-1) = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which gives $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

For case 2, $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. Similarly, we have two sub-cases:

2.1. $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which gives $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
2.2. $-(x-1) = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which gives $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

The four solutions for $x$ are then: $3 + \frac{m}{100}$, $-1 + \frac{m}{100}$, $3 - \frac{m}{100}$, and $-1 - \frac{m}{100}$. For these to be distinct, $\frac{m}{100}$ cannot be equal to $2$. Thus, we require $\frac{m}{100} < 2$. This gives $m < 200$. The only positive integer solutions for $m$ in this range are the first 199 positive integers, except for $m=200$. Therefore, there are 198 positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions.
The answer is: $198$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


For a given value of $m$, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$
has four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $0$ and $2$.
This is because $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is $0$ at $x=3$, $x=1$, and $x=-1$,
and increases as $x$ moves to the left of $-1$ or right of $3$.
Thus, we are looking for the number of positive integers $m$ such that $0<\frac{m}{100}<2$.
This translates to $0<m<200$.
The number of positive integers from $1$ to $199$ inclusive is $199$.
Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is $199$.
The answer is: $199$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To count the number of solutions of the equation $ \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$,
we need to understand the graph of the function $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$.
The function $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a two-piece piecewise function:
If $x \le 1$, then $\vert x - 1 \vert = 1 - x$, so $y = \vert (1 - x) - 2 \vert = \vert -x - 1 \vert = x + 1 - 2 = x - 1$.
If $x > 1$, then $\vert x - 1 \vert = x - 1$, so $y = \vert (x - 1) - 2 \vert = \vert x - 3 \vert = 3 - x$.
The graph of $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ consists of two line segments: $y = x - 1$ for $x \le 1$ and $y = 3 - x$ for $x > 1$.
The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to the distance between the two line segments.
This distance is 2, so we must have $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, which implies $m = 200$.
Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions. The answer is: $1$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions, so we need to find the values of $m$ for which the right-hand side can be written as two separate cases: $\frac{m}{100}$ and $2-\frac{m}{100}$. The sum of these two quantities should be 2 (since the two absolute value expressions inside the larger absolute value combine to give 2). 

Thus we have the equation $\frac{m}{100} + 2 - \frac{m}{100} = 2$, which is true for all values of $m$. 

However, we are looking for the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions. 

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be rewritten as two separate cases: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 2-\frac{m}{100}$. 

The first equation simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, and the second equation simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = 4 - \frac{m}{100}$. 

For the first equation to have two distinct solutions, $2 + \frac{m}{100}$ must be positive, so $\frac{m}{100} > -2$, and thus $m > -200$, but since $m$ is a positive integer, the smallest possible value for $m$ is 1. 

Similarly, for the second equation to have two distinct solutions, $4 - \frac{m}{100}$ must be positive, so $\frac{m}{100} < 4$, and thus $m < 400$. The largest possible value for $m$ is 399.

So the possible values for $m$ are the positive integers from 1 to 399, inclusive. 

The number of positive integers from 1 to 399 is simply 399.

The answer is: 399. However, it seems you have missed a step in your calculations. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when the two quantities $\frac{m}{100}$ and $2-\frac{m}{100}$ are both positive, which happens when $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. This gives us the range $0 < m < 200$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is the number of positive integers from 1 to 199, inclusive. The answer is: 199. The value of $m$ should be a positive integer between 1 and 199, inclusive. The number of positive integers in this range is 199. The answer is: 199.
The answer is: 199. The value of $m$ should be a positive integer between 1 and 199, inclusive. The number of positive integers in this range is 199. The answer is: 199.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}=1$ or $2$. This is because the function $f(x)=\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a maximum value of 2 and a minimum value of 0. The equation has 4 distinct solutions if and only if we set $\frac{m}{100}$ to be either 1 or 2.
If $\frac{m}{100}=1$, then $m=100$. If $\frac{m}{100}=2$, then $m=200$. So, the possible values of $m$ are 100 and 200. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition is 2. The answer is: $\boxed{2}$

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions means the right side $\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal to $2$.
So we have $\frac{m}{100}=2$, which gives $m=200$.
Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ which makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions, and that is $m=200$. The answer is: $\boxed{1}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To have four distinct solutions, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ must be in the form $\vert y \vert = k$, where $k$ is a positive constant and $y$ is a function that changes its sign twice within the interval $y \in [-k, k]$.
The function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a triangular wave that changes its sign twice within the interval $0 \le x \le 3$.
Therefore, the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be within the interval $[0, 2]$.
So we must have $0 \le \frac{m}{100} \le 2$, which implies $0 \le m \le 200$.
The number of positive integers $m$ in this interval is $200$.
However, we must also ensure that the equation has four distinct solutions.
We can check that for $m = 100$, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{100}{100} = 1$ has four distinct solutions $x = 0, 1, 2, 3$.
Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is $1$.
The answer is: $1$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


For the equation to have four distinct solutions, the right hand side $\frac{m}{100}$ must equal to $2$, because $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a number between $0$ and $2$, and only when it equals $2$, can the equation have $4$ solutions.
So we have $\frac{m}{100}=2$, which gives $m=200$.
So the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the equation is $1$.
Therefore, the answer is $1$. The answer is: $1$
