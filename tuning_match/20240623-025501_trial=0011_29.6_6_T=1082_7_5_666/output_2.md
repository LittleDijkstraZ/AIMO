Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is in the interval $(0, 2)$. This is because the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a graph that is a two-hump camel with each hump of height $1$. Therefore, for $f(x) = \frac{m}{100}$ to intersect the graph in $4$ places, $\frac{m}{100}$ must lie strictly between $0$ and $2$. Multiplying through by $100$, we get $0 < m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from $1$ to $199$. However, we know that the value of $m$ cannot be zero because it appears in the denominator of the fraction in the problem statement. Therefore, $m$ must be one of the integers from $1$ to $199$ inclusive. The number of such integers is $199$.
The answer is: $199$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to the value of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ which results in $4$ distinct solutions.

Recall the definition of absolute value function, $\vert y \vert =
\begin{cases} 
y & y \geq 0 \\
-y & y < 0 
\end{cases}$. The function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ splits into $3$ parts:

When $\vert x-1 \vert -2 \geq 0$, the function simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert -2$.

When $-\left(\vert x-1 \vert -2 \right) \geq 0$ or equivalently $\vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0$, the function simplifies to $2 - \vert x-1 \vert$.

To figure out how many of these cases give us $4$ distinct solutions, we draw the graphs of these three parts and find when these graphs intersect the line $y = \frac{m}{100}$.

1. The graph of $\vert x-1 \vert -2$ is a "V" shape shifted one unit to the right of the y-axis and down two units from the x-axis.
2. The graph of $2 - \vert x-1 \vert$ is also a "V" shape shifted one unit to the right of the y-axis and up two units from the x-axis.
3. The graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a combination of the above two "V" shapes.

Looking at the graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, we can see that the graph intersects the line $y = \frac{m}{100}$ at $y=0$, $y=1$, $y=2$, and $y=3$ for a total of $4$ intersections, which means the equation has $4$ distinct solutions. So, the possible values of $\frac{m}{100}$ are $0$, $1$, $2$, and $3$. Solving for $m$ in each case:

For $y=0$: $\frac{m}{100}=0 \Rightarrow m=0$, but $m$ has to be a positive integer, so we discard this case.

For $y=1$: $\frac{m}{100}=1 \Rightarrow m=100$.

For $y=2$: $\frac{m}{100}=2 \Rightarrow m=200$.

For $y=3$: $\frac{m}{100}=3 \Rightarrow m=300$.

Thus, there are three possible positive integer values of $m$, namely $100$, $200$, and $300$. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{3}$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has 4 distinct solutions means that the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, will be equal to $\frac{m}{100}$ for 4 times when considering all possible positive values of $m$.
We can consider the equation inside the absolute value separately.
1. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, then $\vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100} + 2$.
For this equation to have 2 solutions, the right side, $\frac{m}{100} + 2$, must be positive, i.e., $\frac{m}{100} + 2 > 0$, or $\frac{m}{100} > -2$, which is true for all $m > -200$, but we only care about positive integers, so we have $m > 0$.
Also, $\vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100} + 2$ has 2 solutions when $\frac{m}{100} + 2 > 2$, or $\frac{m}{100} > 0$, which is true for all $m > 0$.

2. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$, then $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
For this equation to have 2 solutions, the right side, $2 - \frac{m}{100}$, must be non-negative, i.e., $2 - \frac{m}{100} \geq 0$, or $\frac{m}{100} \leq 2$, which is true for $m \leq 200$.
Since we only care about positive integers, $1 \leq m \leq 200$.
Also, $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ has 2 solutions when $0 \leq 2 - \frac{m}{100} < 2$, or $0 \leq \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which is true for $0 \leq m < 200$.
Again, since we only care about positive integers, $1 \leq m < 200$.

Combining the two conditions, we find that $1 \leq m \leq 200$.
However, we need to count the integers that make the original equation have exactly 4 solutions, not any 4 solutions.
For example, if $m = 1$, we have the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert - 2 \vert = \frac{1}{100}$, which simplifies to $\vert \vert x-1 \vert - 2 \vert = 0.01$.
Let $k = \vert x-1 \vert - 2$, we have $\vert k \vert = 0.01$, and this gives $k = 0.01$ or $k = -0.01$, or $\vert x-1 \vert - 2 = 0.01$ or $\vert x-1 \vert - 2 = -0.01$,
which simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = 2.01$ or $\vert x-1 \vert = 1.99$.
For $\vert x-1 \vert = 2.01$, we have two solutions $x = 1 \pm 2.01$, but for $\vert x-1 \vert = 1.99$, we have no solution because $1.99 > 1$.
Similarly, we can check that when $m = 2$, we still only have 2 solutions.
But when $m = 3$, we have $\vert \vert x-1 \vert - 2 \vert = 0.03$, and we find that we have exactly 4 solutions.
Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition is 1, but $m$ must be an integer, so $m=3$ is the only such integer.
Thus, the number of positive integers $m$ is 1. The answer is: 1

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $||\vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert =\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions for $x$ if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is between $1$ and $2$.
This is because the function $||\vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert $ is increasing and goes from $0$ to $3$ as $x$ goes from $-\infty$ to $\infty$.
So we want $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$.
Multiplying through by $100$ gives $100 < m < 200$.
The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from $101$ to $199$, inclusive.
There are $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$ such integers.
Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is $99$.
The answer is: 99

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.
We know that the graph of $| |x - 1| - 2|$ consists of a "V" shape with the peak at $x = 1$.
The right part of the "V" starts at $x = 1 + 2 = 3$ and the left part starts at $x = 1 - 2 = -1$.
So we want to find for how many positive integers $m$ the line $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ intersections with the graph of $| |x - 1| - 2|$.
The line $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has a "dip" that goes downwards from $y = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ to $y = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.
To have $4$ intersections, we need the peak of the "V" shape to be within the dip.
So we want $1 - \frac{m}{100} < 2 < 1 + \frac{m}{100}$.
Simplifying this inequality, we get $- \frac{m}{100} < 1$ and $\frac{m}{100} > -1$.
Multiplying both sides of the first inequality by $-100$, we get $m > -100$.
Multiplying both sides of the second inequality by $100$, we get $m > -100$.
Both conditions are satisfied by all positive integers $m$, so the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is the number of positive integers, which is $\infty$.
However, the question asks for a positive numerical answer, so we must have made an error somewhere.
Let's re-examine the inequality $\frac{m}{100} > -1$.
Multiplying both sides by $100$, we get $m > -100$.
However, a positive $m$ cannot be less than $-100$.
It seems we made an error in our reasoning or calculation.
Let's go back to the original equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$.
We want the "V" shape to dip below the peak but not go below $y = 0$.
Thus, we need the height of the dip to be between $0$ and $2$, so $0 < \frac{m}{100} \leq 2$.
Multiplying both sides of this inequality by $100$, we get $0 < m \leq 200$.
Since $m$ must be a positive integer, the possible values of $m$ are $1, 2, 3, \ldots, 200$.
Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is the number of integers from $1$ to $200$, which is $200$.
So the positive numerical answer is $\boxed{200}$.
The answer is: $\boxed{200}$.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}=2$.
To solve this equation for $m$, multiply both sides by 100, so $m = 2 \cdot 100 = 200$.
Therefore, there is only 1 value of $m$ that satisfies the condition.
Thus, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition is 1. The answer is: 1

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To start with, let's look at the graph of the left-hand side (LHS) of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. This is a piecewise function with three pieces, and it's like a V-shape wave that oscillates up and down. The number of the distinct solutions of the equation is equal to the number of times the graph of $\frac{m}{100}$ intersects with the graph of LHS.

In our case, it's easier to see that the LHS takes value of $0$ when $x$ is in the set $\{1-2+\frac{m}{100},1+2+\frac{m}{100}\}=\{ -1+\frac{m}{100}, 3+\frac{m}{100}\}$.
In order for the LHS to equal 0 twice, $$-1+\frac{m}{100}+3+\frac{m}{100}=4,$$ meaning that we need $m=100$.
Then we see that the maximum of the LHS function equals 2, when the graph of $\frac{m}{100}=2$ is the highest level line that intersects the LHS function exactly four times. This will occur when $m=200$.
Therefore the values of $m$ are from $100$ to $200$, inclusive. There are $101$.

The value of the unknown $m$ that would satisfy the four solutions are from 100 to 200. This is a range of 101 numbers. Therefore, there are 101 positive integers m that satisfy the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ having 4 distinct solutions.
The value of unknown $m$ are from 100 to 200. There are 101 integers. The problem asks for how many integers satisfy this equation. Therefore, the correct number is 101. The answer is: $\boxed{101}$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}=2$. This is because $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ will only equals to a positive number if and only if the number inside the absolute value equals to $2$.

To make it happen, we set $\frac{m}{100}=2$, then we get $m = 2 \times 100 = 200$.

However, we must check if $m=200$ satisfy the original conditions in the problem. The value of the given equation can range from 0 to 4 when $m=200$, thus the number of distinct solutions is $4$.

So the positive integer that make the equation have 4 distinct solutions is 200. The final answer is: $1$. The answer is: $1$
