Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Approach:



We are given the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ with four distinct solutions. We know that the function $| |x - 1| - 2|$ is a "V" shaped graph with "humps" at $x = 1 \pm 2$. This means that $\frac{m}{100}$ must be between $1$ and $2$, so $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$.

Multiplying through by $100$ gives $100 < m < 200$. The positive integers in this range are exactly the integers from $101$ to $199$, inclusive. So there are $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$ such integers. The answer is $\boxed{99}$.

We start by noting that the equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is the distance between two of the "breakpoints" of the equation $| |x - 1| - 2 |$. The "breakpoints" are the values of $x$ where the expression inside the absolute value changes its sign. For the equation $| |x - 1| - 2 |$, the breakpoints are $x = 1 \pm 2 = -1, 3$. So the distance between these breakpoints is $3 - (-1) = 4$. Therefore, if $\frac{m}{100} = 4$, the equation has $4$ distinct solutions. Thus, $m = 400$.

The number of values of $m$ that satisfy the condition is $1$, namely $m = 400$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ is $1$. The answer is: $1$

Approach:

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2 - \frac{k}{100}$, where $k$ is an integer in the range of $1 \leq k \leq 99$. The equation simplifies to $m = 200 - k$. The number of possible values of $m$ is equal to the number of values of $k$ in the specified range, which is $99$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ is $99$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def count_m():
    return 99

m = count_m()
print(m)
```

The number of positive integers $m$ that make the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have $4$ distinct solutions is $99$. The answer is: $\boxed{99}$.

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"

Approach:


The absolute value equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $2$. In other words, $1<\frac{m}{100}<2$, which implies $100<m<200$. Thus, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy this condition is $200-100-1=99$. So, the answer is $\boxed{99}$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def number_of_m():
    lower_bound = 100
    upper_bound = 200
    m_values = list(range(lower_bound+1, upper_bound))
    return len(m_values)

number_of_solutions = number_of_m()
print(number_of_solutions)
```

CODE RESULTS 99

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
99
```
The number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition is $99$, so the answer is $\boxed{99}$.
