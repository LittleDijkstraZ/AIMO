The equation given is of the form $AB=0$, which means that either $A=0$ or $B=0$. Let's break down the two factors:

For the first factor, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, this implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points lie on a square with side length 20.

For the second factor, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, this implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that the points lie on a square with side length 16.

Since the points are the same, we are looking for the area of the smaller square. The area of a square is given by the square of the side length, so the area of the smaller square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256.
The answer is: $256$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:

 The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these systems of equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0)$.

The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So these equations give us the coordinates of the vertices of the square that forms the boundary of the polygon.

To find the area of the convex polygon, we need to find the area of the square and subtract the area of the four right triangles formed at the corners of the square. The side length of the square is 16 (twice the distance from the origin to a vertex), so the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

Each right triangle has base and height of 8 (the distance from the origin to a vertex of the square divided by 2), so the area of each triangle is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot 8 \cdot 8 = 32$. Since there are 4 such triangles, the total area of the triangles is $4 \cdot 32 = 128$.

The area of the convex polygon is the area of the square minus the area of the triangles, which is $256 - 128 = 128$. So the area of the convex polygon is 128.
The answer is: $128$

Approach:


The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. For the product of two numbers to be zero, either one of them has to be zero. This gives us two cases:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This is possible only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This is the equation of a square with side length 10 units. So, the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$ square units.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This is possible only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This forms a square with side length 16 units (since the absolute value of x and y are both 8). So, the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$ square units.

However, the intersection of the two cases is the required convex polygon. The intersection of the two squares is also a square. The side length of this square is the minimum of the side lengths of the two squares, which is 10 units. So, the area of the convex polygon is $10^2 = 100$ square units.

The answer is: $100$.

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:

 The equation is equal to zero when either of the terms in the product is zero. So we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From case 1, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations gives us the vertices of the polygon.

From case 2, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these four equations gives us the vertices of the polygon.

The polygon is a square with side length 16 (since the distance between the points (8,8) and (-8,8) is 16). The area of a square is the square of the length of its side, so the area of the polygon is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:


The equation $AB = 0$ is satisfied if and only if either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to either $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$ or $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$ implies that both $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This is only possible when $x = y = \pm 10$ or $x = -y = \pm 10$. Similarly, the equation $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ implies that both $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This is only possible when $x = y = \pm 8$.

Therefore, the points that satisfy the given equation are $(\pm 10, \pm 10)$ and $(\pm 8, \pm 8)$. These points form a square with side length $20$ and a square with side length $16$.

The area of a square is given by the square of its side length. Therefore, the area of the square with side length $20$ is $20^2 = 400$, and the area of the square with side length $16$ is $16^2 = 256$.

Adding these two areas gives the total area of the convex polygon, which is $400 + 256 = 656$.

So the area of the convex polygon is $656$. The answer is: $656$.

Approach:


The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied only if both factors are zero. 
This implies that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
For the first factor to be zero, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.
Solving these equations, we find that the points satisfying this condition are $(5, 5)$, $(5, -5)$, $(-5, 5)$, and $(-5, -5)$.
For the second factor to be zero, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
Solving these equations, we find that the points satisfying this condition are $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.
Thus, the points that satisfy the given equation are the vertices of a square with side length 10.
The area of a square with side length $s$ is $s^2$, so the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is $\boxed{100}$.

Approach:



We can first understand the given equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These two equations represent two squares each of side 10 units. Their intersection forms a square with side length 10 units.

Similarly, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which forms a square of side length 16 units.

Now, we need to find the area of the intersection of these two squares. Since the squares formed by the first equation have side length 10 and those formed by the second equation have side length 16, their intersection forms a square with side length equal to the difference of their side lengths, which is $16 - 10 = 6$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon (intersection of the two squares) is $6^2 = 36$ square units.

So the area of the convex polygon is 36 square units.

The answer is $\boxed{36}$.

Assistant:

Approach:


The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, which means either of the terms has to be zero for the entire equation to be zero. This gives us two systems of equations to solve:

1) $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10$

2) $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x - y \vert = 10$

3) $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8$

4) $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert y \vert = 8$

Solving these equations, we find that the four lines that enclose the polygon are:

1) $x + y = 10$

2) $x + y = -10$

3) $x - y = 10$

4) $x - y = -10$

5) $x = 8$

6) $x = -8$

7) $y = 8$

8) $y = -8$

These lines form a square with side length 16 (the distance between the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$, or $y = 8$ and $y = -8$). The area of a square is the side length squared, so the area of the polygon is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$

Assistant:

Approach:

 The given equation is a product of two expressions, equal to zero. This means that at least one of the expressions must be zero. So, we can consider the two cases separately:

1) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
This implies that both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. Solving these equations, we get $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these equations are all the points $(x, y)$ that are at a distance of 10 units from the origin in the $x-y$ plane. These solutions form a square with side length 20 units.

2) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This implies that both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. Solving these equations, we get $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are all the points $(x, y)$ that are at a distance of 8 units from the origin in the $x-y$ plane. These solutions form a square with side length 16 units.

Therefore, the convex polygon formed by the points that satisfy the given equation is the intersection of the two squares formed above. This intersection is a smaller square with side length 8 units.

The area of a square is given by the square of its side length. So, the area of the convex polygon is $8^2 = 64$ square units.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 64 square units. The answer is: 64

Approach:

 The equation $AB = 0$ is true if and only if $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. So the given equation is satisfied if and only if $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The first equation is satisfied if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies that $x = 0$ and $y = 0$. So the only solution to the first equation is $(0, 0)$.

The second equation is satisfied if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that the points are in the rectangle formed by the points $(-8, -8), (-8, 8), (8, 8)$ and $(8, -8)$.

So the region enclosed by the convex polygon is a square with side length $16$, and its area is $16^2 = 256$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length**2

The area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is $\boxed{256}$.
