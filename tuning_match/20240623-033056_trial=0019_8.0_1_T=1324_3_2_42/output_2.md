Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The given equation is $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ and we want to find how many positive integer values of $m$ make the equation have 4 distinct solutions.

This is a challenging problem that requires understanding of absolute value functions and their properties. Let's first analyze the equation without the right side, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=0$.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=0$ implies that $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 0$, so $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$. This breaks down to two separate cases:
1. $x-1 = 2$ which gives $x = 3$, and
2. $x-1 = -2$ which gives $x = -1$.

So the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=0$ has two solutions: $x = 3$ and $x = -1$.

Now let's consider the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$. For the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ to have 4 distinct solutions, the right side must create two "islands" of solutions within the original two solutions ($x = 3$ and $x = -1$).

Each time we increase $m$ by 1, the right side increases by $\frac{1}{100}$, so the "islands" of solutions will become narrower. Therefore, the number of islands (and hence the number of solutions) will increase until the islands just touch, at which point the number of solutions will stop increasing.

When the islands just touch, the right side will be equal to the distance between the original two solutions, which is $3 - (-1) = 4$. So the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ at this point is $4$, which gives $m = 400$.

Therefore, the only positive integer value of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is $m = 400$.
The answer is: $1$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. This implies that $\frac{m}{100}$ is a positive number, because the absolute value function is nonnegative and the sum of two nonnegative numbers is equal to $4$, the only way to achieve this is if each term is $1$. Thus, $m = 100$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $1$.
The answer is: $1$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, we need to know that the number of solutions of the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ is 4, which means the right part of the equation $\frac{m}{100}$ should be equal to 2. So we have $m = 200$.

Then, we substitute $m = 200$ into the equation and solve it:
\[| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{200}{100} = 2.\]
So we have $| |x - 1| - 2| = 2$.

This equation has four solutions. Let's solve it step by step.

1. First, we solve the equation $|x - 1| - 2 = 2$, we get $|x - 1| = 4$. Then we solve it into two cases:

   a) $x - 1 = 4$, we get $x = 5$.
   
   b) $x - 1 = -4$, we get $x = -3$.

2. Then, we solve the equation $|x - 1| - 2 = -2$, we get $|x - 1| = 0$. So we have $x - 1 = 0$, we get $x = 1$.

So the four solutions are $x = -3, 1, 5$.

Therefore, the positive integer $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 200.
The answer is: $200$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, let's denote $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. We need to find out how many $m$'s such that the equation $f(x) = \frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

To solve this problem, we can first sketch the graph of $f(x)$, and then find out how many $m$'s would make the equation $f(x) = \frac{m}{100}$ have $4$ distinct solutions.

The graph of $f(x)$ is a V-shape with the vertex at $x = 1$. The left arm of the V goes downward from $(0, 3)$ to $(1, 1)$, and the right arm of the V goes upward from $(1, 1)$ to $(2, 3)$. The equation $f(x) = \frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ falls in the range from $1$ to $3$. So, $1 \leq \frac{m}{100} < 3$, which implies $100 \leq m < 300$. Therefore, the possible values of $m$ are the integers from $100$ to $299$, inclusive. The number of such integers is $200$. However, we need to check if $200$ is a positive integer. It is, so we have found the correct number of $m$'s that make the equation have $4$ distinct solutions.

The answer is: $200$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.
We want to find the number of values of $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions.

Step 1: Graphically, the LHS of the equation represents a "hump" function with four "humps" on the interval $[0, 4]$. The right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, is a horizontal line. To have four distinct solutions, the height of the horizontal line should be one of the humps' heights.

Step 2: The humps' heights are $0$, $1$, $2$, and $3$. Therefore, we have $\frac{m}{100}$ equals to $1$ or $2$.

Step 3: If $\frac{m}{100}=1$, then $m=100$. If $\frac{m}{100}=2$, then $m=200$. So the possible values of $m$ are $100$ and $200$.

Step 4: To verify that the values of $m$ are positive integers, we can see that both $100$ and $200$ are positive integers.

So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $2$. The answer is: $2$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, we notice that the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be positive, so $m$ must be a positive integer. Also, we need the equation to have 4 distinct solutions.

2. Second, we know that $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is always non-negative and less than or equal to 2. Therefore, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be in the interval (0, 2]. Thus, $0 < m \leq 200$.

3. Third, we need to find for how many values of $m$ in the interval (0, 200] the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

4. To do this, we can use Python and sympy to help us solve the equation. Here is a Python script to solve the problem:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solveset, S, Abs

def count_positive_integers():
    x, m = symbols('x m')
    counter = 0
    for m_value in range(1, 201):
        equation = Abs(Abs(x - 1) - 2) - m_value / 100
        solution = solveset(equation, x, domain=S.Reals)
        if len(solution) == 4:
            counter += 1
    return counter

result = count_positive_integers()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 199

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
199
```
The value of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 199. This is a positive integer, as required. The answer is: $1$
