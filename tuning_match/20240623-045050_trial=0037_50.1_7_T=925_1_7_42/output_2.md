 This problem is a challenge in the art of problem solving rather than a programming problem, but as you asked for programs, here's a Python code to solve it:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def number_of_m():
    """For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"""
    count = 0
    for m in range(1, 101):  # m can be any value from 1 to 100
        if abs(abs(m / 100 - 2) - 1) == 1:  # the condition for the equation to have 4 distinct solutions
            count += 1
    return count

result = number_of_m()
print(result)
```

```
Since the Python code is not finding any solution, there might be an error in the logic used. Let's analyze the equation again:
\[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\]
For the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, the value of m/100 (let's call it k) must be such that:
1. $0 < k < 1$ or $1 < k < 2$, to give 4 solutions (one for each combination of + and - in each absolute value).

Let's adjust the Python code and try again:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def number_of_m():
    """For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"""
    count = 0
    for m in range(1, 101):  # m can be any value from 1 to 100
        k = m / 100
        if 0 < k < 1 or 1 < k < 2:
            count += 1
    return count

result = number_of_m()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 99

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
99
```
The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has 4 distinct solutions is 99. Therefore, the answer is $99$. The correct code is now:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def number_of_m():
    """For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"""
    count = 0
    for m in range(1, 101):  # m can be any value from 1 to 100
        k = m / 100
        if 0 < k < 1 or 1 < k < 2:
            count += 1
    return count

result = number_of_m()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 99

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
99

The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has 4 distinct solutions is 99.
The answer is: $99$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The problem involves finding the value of $m$ for which the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has exactly 4 distinct solutions.
The right-hand side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, is always nonnegative, so the left-hand side, $| |x - 1| - 2|$, must also be nonnegative. This means that $|x - 1| - 2$ must be either 0 or its negation. Thus, we have the two cases:
Case 1: $|x - 1| - 2 = 0$, which implies $|x - 1| = 2$. This gives us two subcases: $x - 1 = 2$ or $x - 1 = -2$. The solutions to these are $x = 3$ and $x = -1$, respectively.
Case 2: $-(|x - 1| - 2) = 0$, which implies $|x - 1| = 2$. Again, this gives us two subcases: $x - 1 = 2$ or $x - 1 = -2$. The solutions to these are $x = 3$ and $x = -1$, respectively.

So, the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions $x = -1, 1, 3$. We need to find the value of $m$ such that $\frac{m}{100} = |3 - 1 - 2| = 0$. But this is not possible as the right-hand side of the equation is positive.

Hence, the only possible value of $m$ is obtained from the Case 1, when we have $|x - 1| - 2 = 0$. This gives us $\frac{m}{100} = |1 - 1 - 2| = 2$, which implies $m = 200$.

Therefore, the only value of $m$ for which the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions is $m = 200$. The answer is: $200$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 We know that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.
The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be rewritten as a system of four inequalities:
\[\begin{cases}
\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100} \\
-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = \frac{m}{100} \\
\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100} \\
-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = -\frac{m}{100}
\end{cases}\]
The first and third inequalities give us two equations:
\[\begin{cases}
\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100} \\
\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}
\end{cases}\]
The second and fourth inequalities give us two more equations:
\[\begin{cases}
\vert x-1 \vert = -2 + \frac{m}{100} \\
\vert x-1 \vert = -2 - \frac{m}{100}
\end{cases}\]
Each of these equations has two solutions, one for the positive case and one for the negative case. Therefore, the original equation has a total of $2 \times 4 = 8$ solutions.
The condition that the equation has $4$ distinct solutions implies that the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must make the two equations in each system have no solutions in common.
We know that the absolute value function $\vert x \vert$ is always nonnegative, and it is equal to $x$ if $x \geq 0$ and $-x$ if $x < 0$. Therefore, the equation $\vert x-1 \vert = a$ has solutions if $a \geq 0$, and the solutions are $x = 1 \pm a$.
So, for the equation $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ to have no solutions in common with the equation $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, we must have $2 + \frac{m}{100} \neq 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which implies $\frac{m}{100} \neq 0$. Therefore, $m \neq 0$.
Similarly, for the equation $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ to have no solutions in common with the equation $\vert x-1 \vert = -2 + \frac{m}{100}$, we must have $2 - \frac{m}{100} > -2$, which implies $\frac{m}{100} < 4$. Therefore, $m < 400$.
Combining these conditions, we find that the only positive integer $m$ that satisfies all the conditions is $m=1$.
Therefore, the value of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $m=1$.
The answer is: $\boxed{1}$

Assistant:


The number of distinct solutions of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ equals to $4$ if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $2$. Therefore, we solve the equation $\frac{m}{100}=2$, which gives us $m=200$. Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ that makes the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have $4$ distinct solutions, and this integer is $m=200$. The answer is: $$200$$

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"

Assistant:

 The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $| |x-1| -2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions. This equation represents a piecewise function with different forms depending on the value of $|x-1|$. The function will have four distinct solutions when it equals a value that splits the function into four different segments.

From the equation, we know that the absolute value of the left side of the equation must be $\frac{m}{100}$, so the left side can be either $\frac{m}{100}$ or $-\frac{m}{100}$. We set up two equations based on these possibilities:

1. $| |x-1| -2| = \frac{m}{100}$.
2. $| |x-1| -2| = -\frac{m}{100}$.

Now, let's analyze each equation separately:

For the first equation, we have two cases:
Case 1: $|x-1| -2 = \frac{m}{100}$.
Case 2: $-(|x-1| -2) = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $|x-1| -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.

Similarly, for the second equation, we also have two cases:
Case 3: $|x-1| -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.
Case 4: $-(|x-1| -2) = -\frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $|x-1| -2 = \frac{m}{100}$.

However, Case 4 is equivalent to Case 1, so we only need to consider Case 1 to Case 3.

Case 1 and Case 3 both give $|x-1| = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $|x-1| = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ respectively. To have four distinct solutions, the value inside the absolute value in each equation must be negative for one of the cases, meaning $2 - \frac{m}{100} < 0$, or $m > 200$.

Case 2 and Case 4 both give $|x-1| = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $|x-1| = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ respectively. To have four distinct solutions, the value inside the absolute value in each equation must be positive for one of the cases, meaning $2 + \frac{m}{100} > 0$, or $m > -200$. But $m$ is a positive integer, so $m > -200$ is always true.

So, combining all these conditions, we find that $m$ must be an integer in the range $(200, +\infty)$. The number of positive integers in this range is $200$. However, we also need to check if the solutions for these values of $m$ are indeed four distinct solutions. 

To do this, we can plug in some specific values of $m$ into the equations and solve for $x$. We find that for $m = 201$, all four cases have four distinct solutions, satisfying the conditions. 

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $| |x-1| -2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions is 1. The numerical answer is $\boxed{1}$. However, this is not correct as we have found that the value of $m$ that satisfies the condition is $201$. So, the correct answer is 1 value of $m$, which is $201$. Therefore, the numerical answer is 1 and the value of $m$ is 201.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $| |x-1| -2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions is 1. The numerical answer is 1, but the corresponding value of $m$ is $201$. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{201}$.

However, we made a mistake in the earlier part of the solution where we stated that the value of $m$ must be an integer in the range $(200, +\infty)$. This is incorrect. The value of $m$ must be an integer in the range $(0, 200)$, because $|x-1| -2 = \pm \frac{m}{100}$ implies that $-1 \leq \pm \frac{m}{100} \leq 1$, leading to $0 \leq m \leq 200$. Therefore, the correct range is $(0, 200)$, and the number of positive integers in this range is indeed 200.

Therefore, the correct number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $| |x-1| -2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions is 200. The numerical answer is 200.

So, the correct numerical answer is 200, but the value of $m$ is 201. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{201}$. The value of $m$ that satisfies the condition is 201. But it was a mistake in our earlier solution to state that the value of $m$ must be an integer in the range $(200, +\infty)$.

It seems that there might be a misunderstanding in the problem statement. The question seems to assume that the number of distinct solutions to the equation should be exactly 4, but it is possible to have more than 4 distinct solutions as well. For example, for the value of $m = 100$, the equation has 8 distinct solutions. For $m = 200$, it has 6 distinct solutions. Therefore, it seems the problem might be asking for the value of $m$ such that the equation has exactly 4 distinct solutions. However, this is not the case based on the provided solution, and further clarification is needed.

In any case, the value of $m$ such that the equation has exactly 4 distinct solutions is 201. The numerical answer is 201. The value of $m$ that satisfies the condition is 201. The mistake in our earlier solution was in not considering the correct range of $m$, which is $(0, 200)$. Therefore, the correct numerical answer is 200, but the value of $m$ is 201. The answer is $\boxed{201}$.

Based on the clarification provided in the problem statement, it seems the actual question is asking for the value of $m$ such that the equation has exactly 4 distinct solutions. Based on the provided solution, the value of $m$ that satisfies this condition is 201. Therefore, the value of $m$ that satisfies the condition is indeed 201. The answer is $\boxed{201}$. The value of $m$ that satisfies the condition is 201. So, the final answer is $\boxed{201}$.

Assistant:

 We are asked to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. 

We can start by analyzing the equation. The function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a piecewise function with four cases depending on the value of $x$:
1. If $x < -1$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \vert -x-1 - 2 \vert = \vert -x-3 \vert = x+3$.
2. If $-1 \leq x < 1$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \vert x-1 - 2 \vert = \vert x-3 \vert = 3 - x$.
3. If $1 \leq x < 3$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \vert x-1 - 2 \vert = \vert x-3 \vert = x - 3$.
4. If $x \geq 3$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \vert x-1 - 2 \vert = \vert x-3 \vert = x - 3$.

So, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if $\frac{m}{100}$ falls into the interval $(0,3)$. Therefore, $m$ must be in the interval $(0,300)$. The positive integers in this interval are $1,2,3,...,299,300$.

Now, we need to find how many of these integers give us $4$ distinct solutions. By analyzing the piecewise function, we can see that only the integer values of $m$ in the interval $(0,300)$ that are multiples of $100$ give us $4$ distinct solutions. The only such integer is $m = 200$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the conditions is $1$. 
The answer is: $1$
