Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


Let's start by setting $n=1$ in the first equation:
\[f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1.\]
Since the function $f$ maps from the natural numbers to the natural numbers, it must be the case that $f(f(f(1)))=1$, and so $f(1)=1$.
Then, we can substitute $f(1)=1$ into the second equation:
\[f(2(1))=2f(1)+1\implies f(2)=2(1)+1=3.\]
Similarly, we can substitute $f(2)=3$ into the second equation:
\[f(2(2))=2f(2)+1\implies f(4)=2(3)+1=7.\]
Continuing this process, we find that $f(8)=15$, $f(16)=31$, and so on. By examining this pattern, we can see that $f(n) = 2n-1$ for all positive integers $n$.
To confirm this, we can substitute $f(n)=2n-1$ into the first equation:
\[f(f(f(n)))=f(f(2n-1))=f(2(2n-1)-1)=f(4n-3)=8n-7.\]
And indeed, this satisfies the first equation.
Therefore, we have found that $f(n) = 2n-1$ for all positive integers $n$.
Finally, we can calculate $f(100)$ by substituting $n=100$:
\[f(100) = 2(100) - 1 = 199.\]
Thus, $f(100) = 199$.
The answer is: 199

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We want to find $f(100)$.
From the second condition, we know that $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. 
So we can calculate $f(100)$ by using the second condition repeatedly:
$$f(100) = f(2 \cdot 50) = 2f(50) + 1.$$
Then we need to find $f(50)$:
$$f(50) = f(2 \cdot 25) = 2f(25) + 1.$$
Next, we find $f(25)$:
$$f(25) = f(2 \cdot 12 + 1) = 2f(12 + 1) + 1 = 2f(13) + 1.$$
Now we need to find $f(13)$:
$$f(13) = f(8 \cdot 1 + 5) = f(f(f(5))) = 8 \cdot 5 - 7 = 33.$$
Plugging this value back into the equation for $f(25)$:
$$f(25) = 2 \cdot 33 + 1 = 67.$$
Plugging this value back into the equation for $f(50)$:
$$f(50) = 2 \cdot 67 + 1 = 135.$$
Finally, plugging this value back into the equation for $f(100)$:
$$f(100) = 2 \cdot 135 + 1 = 271.$$
So $f(100) = 271$. The answer is: 271

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We will start by finding $f(1)$ using the second equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$.
By setting $n = 1$, we get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.
We can also use the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$.
By setting $n = 1$, we get $f(f(f(1))) = 8(1) - 7 = 1$.
This implies that $f(f(1)) = 1$, because a function value is unique for each input.
Then using the second equation again, we can find $f(1)$:
$f(f(1)) = 2f(1) + 1 = 1$.
Solving for $f(1)$, we get $f(1) = 0$.
Now we can find $f(100)$ using the second equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$.
By setting $n = 50$, we get $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.
We still don't know $f(50)$, but we can find it using the second equation again.
By setting $n = 25$, we get $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.
Similarly, by setting $n = 12.5$, we find that $f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1$, but $12.5$ is not a positive integer, so we stop here.
However, we can use the first equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$.
By setting $n = 12.5$, we get $f(f(f(12.5))) = 8(12.5) - 7 = 80 - 7 = 73$.
This implies that $f(f(12.5)) = 73$, because a function value is unique for each input.
Then using the second equation, we can find $f(12.5)$:
$f(f(12.5)) = 2f(12.5) + 1 = 73$.
Solving for $f(12.5)$, we get $f(12.5) = \frac{73 - 1}{2} = 36$.
Now we can find $f(25)$:
$f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1 = 2(36) + 1 = 72 + 1 = 73$.
And finally, we can find $f(50)$:
$f(50) = 2f(25) + 1 = 2(73) + 1 = 146 + 1 = 147$.
Now we can find $f(100)$:
$f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2(147) + 1 = 294 + 1 = 295$.
So, $f(100) = 295$. The answer is: $\boxed{295}$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To calculate $f(100)$, we need to use the given functional equations.

First, let's plug in $n=50$ into the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. We get
\[f(100) = 2f(50) + 1. \tag{1}\]

Next, we need to find $f(50)$. We can do this by plugging in $n=25$ into the same equation, giving
\[f(100) = 2f(50) + 1.\]
We get
\[f(50) = 2f(25) + 1. \tag{2}\]

Continuing this process, we can find $f(25)$ by plugging in $n=12.5$ (which is not an integer, so we made a mistake somewhere), but we notice that we are stuck at this point because the value of $n$ is not an integer for the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. 

However, we can use the first equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ instead. If we let $n=100$, then we get
\[f(f(f(100)))=8(100)-7 = 793.\]
Now, we know that $f(f(f(100))) = f(f(50)) = f(25)$. So we have
\[f(f(50)) = 793.\]
Now let's go back to equation (2), substitute $f(50)$ with $2f(25)+1$, we get
\[793 = f(f(25)).\]
But from the first equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, letting $n=25$ we have
\[f(f(f(25)))=8(25)-7 = 193.\]
And as $f(f(f(25))) = 793$, we get
\[f(f(25)) = 193.\]
Now let's go back to equation (1), substitute $f(50)$ with $2f(25)+1$, we get
\[f(100) = 2(2f(25)+1) + 1 = 4f(25) + 3.\]
Finally, substitute $f(25)$ with 193, we have
\[f(100) = 4(193) + 3 = 772 + 3 = 775.\]
So, $f(100) = 775$. The answer is: $775$.

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, we want to find the value of $f(100)$. However, to directly find the value of $f(100)$ is difficult. So, we can try to find the value of $f(f(f(100)))$ first and set it equal to $8(100)-7=793$.
From the given condition, $f(f(f(100)))=793$.

Substitute $n=100$ into the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$,
we have $f(200)=2f(100)+1$.

Substitute $n=f(100)$ into the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$,
we have $f(f(f(f(100))))=8f(100)-7$.

Substitute $f(f(f(100)))=793$ into the equation above,
we have $793=8f(100)-7$.

Rearrange the equation to solve for $f(100)$: $8f(100)=793+7=800$,
and hence $f(100)=\frac{800}{8}=100$.
So the value of $f(100)$ is 100.
The answer is: $100$

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We start by applying the second equation of the problem statement to find $f(100)$:
\[f(100) = 2f(50) + 1.\]
We need to find $f(50)$, so we apply the second equation again:
\[f(50) = 2f(25) + 1.\]
We need to find $f(25)$, so we apply the second equation again:
\[f(25) = 2f(12.5).\]
However, we only have a definition for $f(n)$ where $n$ is a positive integer, so we cannot proceed with the second equation. Let's try the first equation instead. We have
\[f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7.\]
Setting $n=25$, we get
\[f(f(f(25))) = 8 \cdot 25 - 7 = 193.\]
Now, let's find $f(f(25))$. Using the second equation, we have
\[f(f(25)) = f(2 \cdot f(12.5)) = 2 \cdot f(f(12.5)) + 1.\]
Again, we cannot proceed further with the second equation, so let's use the first equation. We have
\[f(f(f(12.5))) = 8 \cdot 12.5 - 7 = 97.\]
Now, we have
\[f(f(25)) = 2 \cdot f(97) + 1.\]
Let's find $f(97)$. Using the first equation, we have
\[f(f(f(97))) = 8 \cdot 97 - 7 = 769.\]
Now, we have
\[f(f(25)) = 2 \cdot f(97) + 1 = 2 \cdot 769 + 1 = 1539.\]
Finally, we can find $f(50)$:
\[f(50) = 2 \cdot f(25) + 1 = 2 \cdot 1539 + 1 = 3079.\]
And now we can find $f(100)$:
\[f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2 \cdot 3079 + 1 = 6159.\]
So $f(100) = 6159$.
The answer is: $6159$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To solve for $f(100)$, we need to first understand the given functional equations.

The first equation, $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, tells us that applying the function three times to any number $n$ will result in $8n-7$.

The second equation, $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, tells us that the function of twice any number $n$ is twice the function of $n$ plus 1.

To find $f(100)$, we can start by calculating $f(f(100))$ using the second equation.

If we let $n=50$, then $2n=100$. Thus, $f(2n)=f(100)$ and $2f(n)+1 = 2f(50)+1$.

But we don't know what $f(50)$ is yet. So, we need to find that first.

We can do this by letting $n=25$ in the second equation. Then $2n=50$, and $2f(n)+1 = 2f(25)+1$.

Again, we don't know what $f(25)$ is. But we can keep going.

If we let $n=12.5$, then $2n=25$. But $25$ isn't an integer, so we can't use the second equation directly.

However, we know from the first equation that $f(f(f(12.5)))=8(12.5)-7 = 100 - 7 = 93$.

And we also know that $f(f(f(12.5))) = f(f(25))$ (because $25 = 2 \times 12.5$).

So, $f(f(25)) = 93$.

Then using the second equation again, we can find $f(25)$. We have $f(2 \times 12.5) = 2f(12.5)+1 \implies f(25) = 2f(12.5)+1$.

We know that $f(f(25)) = f(93)$. But from the first equation, we also know that $f(f(25)) = 8 \times 12.5 - 7 = 100 - 7 = 93$.

So, we have $f(93) = 93$.

Now we can go back and solve for $f(25)$ using $f(25) = 2f(12.5)+1$.

Since $f(93) = 93$, then $f(f(f(12.5))) = f(f(25)) = 93$ tells us that $f(f(12.5)) = 93$.

Using the first equation again, we have $f(f(12.5)) = 8 \times 12.5 - 7 = 100 - 7 = 93$.

So, $f(12.5) = 12.5$.

And finally, we can find $f(25) = 2f(12.5)+1 = 2 \times 12.5 + 1 = 25+1 = 26$.

And then we can find $f(50) = 2f(25)+1 = 2 \times 26 + 1 = 52+1 = 53$.

And finally, we can find $f(100) = 2f(50)+1 = 2 \times 53 + 1 = 106+1 = 107$.

So $f(100) = 107$. The answer is: $107$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, we need to find $f(1)$.
By setting $n=1$ in the second equation, we have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.
And by setting $n=2$ in the second equation, we have $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$.
And by setting $n=f(1)$ in the first equation, we have $f(f(f(1))) = 8f(1) - 7$.
But we know that $f(f(f(1))) = f(f(2)) = f(2f(1) + 1)$, and we also know that $f(f(f(1))) = f(4)$, so we have $f(2f(1) + 1) = f(4)$.
Comparing these two expressions for $f(f(f(1)))$, we get $8f(1) - 7 = f(4)$.
But by the second equation, we have $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2(2f(1) + 1) + 1 = 4f(1) + 3$.
Setting these two expressions for $f(f(f(1)))$ equal to each other, we have $8f(1) - 7 = 4f(1) + 3$.
Solving for $f(1)$, we get $f(1) = 5$.
Now we can find $f(100)$.
By the second equation, we have $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$.
And by the first equation, we have $f(f(f(100))) = 8(100) - 7 = 793$.
But we know that $f(f(f(100))) = f(f(200)) = f(2f(100) + 1)$, so we have $f(2f(100) + 1) = 793$.
And by the second equation, $f(2f(100) + 1) = 2f(100) + 1$.
Setting these two expressions equal to each other, we have $2f(100) + 1 = 793$.
Solving for $f(100)$, we get $f(100) = \frac{793 - 1}{2} = 396$.
Therefore, $f(100) = \boxed{396}$.
The answer is: $\boxed{396}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We are given the two conditions:
1. $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$
2. $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$
We want to find $f(100)$.

First, we can plug in $n=50$ into the second condition, we get
\[f(100) = 2f(50) + 1.\]
Next, we need to find $f(50)$. To do this, we can plug in $n=25$ into the second condition, we get
\[f(50) = 2f(25) + 1.\]
Now we need to find $f(25)$. We can use the first condition. If we set $f(n) = 25$, then $f(f(f(n))) = f(f(25)) = f(50)$. According to the first condition, we have
\[f(f(f(25))) = 8 \cdot 25 - 7 = 193 \Rightarrow f(50) = 193.\]
Now we can substitute $f(50) = 193$ into $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$ to find $f(25)$:
\[193 = 2f(25) + 1 \Rightarrow 2f(25) = 192 \Rightarrow f(25) = 96.\]
Finally, we can substitute $f(25) = 96$ into $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$ to find $f(50)$:
\[f(50) = 2 \cdot 96 + 1 = 193.\]
Now we can substitute $f(50) = 193$ into $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$ to find $f(100)$:
\[f(100) = 2 \cdot 193 + 1 = 387.\]
Therefore, $f(100) = 387$. The answer is: $387$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We start by evaluating $f(100)$ using the second condition of the function.
Using $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we have $f(200)=2f(100)+1$.
Next, we use the first condition of the function $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$.
Substituting $n=100$, we have $f(f(f(100)))=8(100)-7=793$.
Now, substituting $n=100$ into the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we get
\[f(f(f(100)))=8(100)-7=793.\]
Therefore, $f(f(f(100)))=793$.
Now, substituting $f(f(f(100)))=793$ into the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we get
\[793=8(100)-7=793.\]
This means that $f(100)$ must be the value that when substituted into $f(f(f(n)))$ gives us $793$.
To find $f(100)$, we can substitute $n=100$ into the equation $f(f(f(n)))=793$:
\[f(f(f(100)))=793.\]
Substituting $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ with $n=100$, we have
\[f(f(f(100)))=8(100)-7=793.\]
Therefore, we must have $f(f(f(100)))=793$, so $f(f(100))$ is the value that when substituted into $f(f(n))$ gives us $793$.
Substituting $n=100$ into the equation $f(f(n))=x$ (where $x$ is the value we are trying to find), we get
\[f(f(100))=x.\]
Substituting $f(f(n))=x$ into $f(f(n))=8n-7$ with $n=100$, we have
\[f(f(100))=8(100)-7=793.\]
Therefore, $x=793$.
We know that $f(100)$ is the value that when substituted into $f(n)$ gives us $793$.
Substituting $n=793$ into the equation $f(n)=x$ (where $x$ is the value we are trying to find), we get
\[f(793)=x.\]
However, we do not have a direct equation to solve for $f(793)$.
Instead, we can use the second condition of the function $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to help us.
We want to find a value $k$ such that $f(k)=793$.
From the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, if we let $n=k/2$, we have
\[f(k)=2f(k/2)+1.\]
Substituting $f(k)=793$, we have
\[793=2f(k/2)+1.\]
Solving for $f(k/2)$, we get
\[f(k/2)=\frac{793-1}{2}=396.\]
Again, we need to find a value $m$ such that $f(m)=396$.
Using the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, if we let $n=m/2$, we have
\[f(m)=2f(m/2)+1.\]
Substituting $f(m)=396$, we have
\[396=2f(m/2)+1.\]
Solving for $f(m/2)$, we get
\[f(m/2)=\frac{396-1}{2}=198.\]
Continuing this process, we find that $f(99)=198$, $f(49)=98$, and $f(24)=48$.
Finally, we find that $f(12)=24$ and $f(6)=12$.
Now, we can find the value of $f(100)$ by repeatedly applying the second condition of the function:
\[f(100)=2f(50)+1=2(2f(25)+1)+1=2(2(2f(12.5)+1)+1)+1=2(2(2(2f(6.25)+1)+1)+1)+1.\]
Evaluating this expression step by step, we get
\[f(100)=2(2(2(2(2f(3.125)+1)+1)+1)+1)+1=2(2(2(2(2(2f(1.5625)+1)+1)+1)+1)+1).\]
Continuing the process, we find
\[f(100)=2(2(2(2(2(2(2f(0.78125)+1)+1)+1)+1)+1)+1)=2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2f(0.390625)+1)+1)+1)+1)+1)+1).\]
Finally, we find
\[f(100)=2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2f(0.1953125)+1)+1)+1)+1)+1)+1)=2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2f(0.09765625)+1)+1)+1)+1)+1)+1).\]
Evaluating this expression, we find that $f(100)=98$.
Therefore, $f(100)=98$.
The value of $f(100)$ is 98.
The answer is: $98$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


Let's first try to find $f(1)$ using the second given equation. We have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. Now, applying the first given equation $f(f(2)) = 8 - 7$, so $f(2f(1) + 1) = 1$. But we know $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$, so we substitute to get $f(2f(1) + 1) = 1$ becomes $f(2f(1) + 1) = f(2) = 1$. This seems to imply that $f(1) = 1$. Now we will use this value to find $f(100)$.
Using the second given equation, we can write $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$. Now apply the first given equation to get $f(f(200)) = 8*100 - 7 = 793$. But $f(f(200)) = f(2f(100) + 1) = 1$, so we have $1 = 793$, which is a contradiction. Our initial assumption that $f(1) = 1$ was incorrect. 

But we can try another route. From $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we can say that for $n=1$, $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7 = 1$. Since $f(f(f(1)))=1$, this implies that $f(1)$ must be a value such that $f(f(1))=1$, i.e., $f(f(1)) = 1$ from the first given equation. 

If we assume $f(1) = 2$, we get $f(f(1)) = f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2*2 + 1 = 5$ from the second given equation. But this does not equate to 1, so our assumption was wrong, and $f(1) \neq 2$.

Now let's try a different value. If we assume $f(1) = 3$, we get $f(f(1)) = f(3) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2*3 + 1 = 7$ from the second given equation. But this also does not equate to 1, so $f(1) \neq 3$.

Let's keep trying. If we assume $f(1) = 4$, we get $f(f(1)) = f(4) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2*4 + 1 = 9$ from the second given equation. But this also does not equate to 1, so $f(1) \neq 4$.

If we continue this process, we will find that when $f(1) = 1$, $f(f(1)) = f(1) = 1$. This works, because $f(f(1)) = f(1) = 1$ from the first given equation. So our assumption $f(1) = 1$ holds true.

Now that we know $f(1) = 1$, we can use the second given equation repeatedly to find $f(100)$.

We have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2*1 + 1 = 3$.

Then $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2*3 + 1 = 7$.

We can see that $f(2^n) = 2^n + 1$. So $f(100) = 2^{3} + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9$.
The value of $f(100)$ is 9. The answer is: 9

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


Let's start by applying the second condition $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to $n=50$. We get $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$. Now we need to find the value of $f(50)$.

We can substitute $n = 25$ into the second condition to get $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$. We still need to find $f(25)$, but we can use the first equation to help us.

Setting $n = 12$ in the first equation, we get $f(f(f(12))) = 8*12 - 7 = 88$. Now, we know that $f(f(12)) = f(24)$, because from the second equation we have $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, which implies $f(2*12) = f(24) = 2f(12) + 1$. 

Also, $f(12) = 2f(6) + 1$, because from the second equation with $n = 6$. 

Similarly, $f(6) = 2f(3) + 1$, because from the second equation with $n = 3$.

And finally, $f(3) = f(6) - 1$, because from the first equation with $n = 3/2$, we get $f(3) = f(3) - 1$.

Substituting $f(3) = f(6) - 1$ into $f(6) = 2f(3) + 1$, we get $f(6) = 2(f(6) - 1) + 1$, which simplifies to $f(6) = 2f(6) - 1$, and further simplifies to $f(6) = 1$.

Therefore, $f(3) = f(6) - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0$. 

Then, $f(6) = 2f(3) + 1 = 2*0 + 1 = 1$.

Then, $f(12) = 2f(6) + 1 = 2*1 + 1 = 3$.

And so, $f(24) = f(f(12)) = 3$.

Now we know from $f(f(f(12))) = 8*12 - 7 = 88$ that $f(f(12)) = f(24) = 3$. Therefore, by the second equation $f(12) = f(24)/2 - 1/2 = 3/2 - 1/2 = 1$. But we've already found that $f(12) = 3$ from the first equation, contradiction!

This contradiction shows that our initial assumption of setting $n=50$ in the second condition was incorrect, and we should instead start from the first equation with $n=100$ directly: $f(f(f(100))) = 8*100 - 7 = 793$. Now, we know that $f(f(100)) = f(200)$, and $f(100) = f(200)/2 - 1/2$.

Let's substitute $n = 50$ into the second condition to get $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$. Now we substitute $n = 25$ into the second condition to get $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$, and $f(25) = f(50)/2 - 1/2$. 

Substitute $n = 12$ into the first equation to get $f(f(f(12))) = 8*12 - 7 = 88$, and $f(f(12)) = f(24) = 3$. Then $f(12) = f(24)/2 - 1/2 = 3/2 - 1/2 = 1$, so $f(12) = 1$.

Therefore, $f(25) = f(50)/2 - 1/2 = f(50)/2 - 0.5$, and $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$. We can substitute $f(25) = f(50)/2 - 0.5$ into the equation above to get $f(50) = 2(f(50)/2 - 0.5) + 1$, which simplifies to $f(50) = f(50) - 1 + 1 = f(50)$. This doesn't help us.

We have got a loop in our calculation. Let's go back and reevaluate the conditions. The first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ is quite complex and difficult to work with directly. However, the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ is simple and manageable. Let's start by analyzing this equation.

Notice that if $n$ is a power of 2, i.e., $n=2^k$, the second equation will give us $f(2^{k+1}) = 2f(2^k) + 1$. 

So if we let $k=0$, we have $f(1) = 2f(1) + 1$, which implies $f(1) = -1$.

If we let $k=1$, we have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2*(-1) + 1 = -1$.

If we let $k=2$, we have $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2*(-1) + 1 = -1$.

Similarly, we can show that for any $k$, $f(2^k) = -1$. So we know that $f(1) = f(2) = f(4) = f(8) = f(16) = f(32) = f(64) = -1$.

Now let's go back to the first equation. Since we know that $f(1) = -1$, we can calculate $f(f(f(1))) = f(f(-1)) = f(7)$ (because $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$). So we have $f(7) = 1$. Then we can continue to calculate $f(f(f(2))) = f(f(1)) = f(1)$, so $f(1) = 1$ as well. 

But this is a contradiction because we previously found that $f(1) = -1$.

However, we may

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we plug in $n=1$ into the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to get $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7$, which simplifies to $f(f(f(1)))=-1$. Since $f(f(f(1)))=-1$ and the function outputs are natural numbers, we can infer that $f(1)=1$.

Now we can use the second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to find $f(2)$ and $f(4)$.

Setting $n=1$ in $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we get $f(2)=2f(1)+1=2(1)+1=3$.

Setting $n=2$ in $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we get $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2(3)+1=7$.

Setting $n=4$ in $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we get $f(8)=2f(4)+1=2(7)+1=15$.

Setting $n=8$ in $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we get $f(16)=2f(8)+1=2(15)+1=31$.

Setting $n=16$ in $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we get $f(32)=2f(16)+1=2(31)+1=63$.

Setting $n=32$ in $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we get $f(64)=2f(32)+1=2(63)+1=127$.

Now, we observe that $f(64)=127$ and $8*100-7=793$, so the function $f(n)$ seems to be mapping $n$ to $2n-1$. We can check this by setting $n=100$ in $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. If $f(n)=2n-1$, then $f(2n)=2(2n-1)+1=4n-1$. Indeed, $f(2*100)=4*100-1=399$, which is consistent with $8*100-7=793$.

Therefore, the function $f(n)$ maps $n$ to $2n-1$. Thus $f(100)=2*100-1=199$. The answer is: $\boxed{199}$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We can start by using the second condition $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to find $f(100)$.
If we set $n = 50$, then $2n = 100$, so we can substitute $2n$ with $100$ and $n$ with $50$ in the second condition:
$$f(100) = 2f(50) + 1.$$
Now, we need to find $f(50)$.
If we set $n = 25$, then $2n = 50$, so we can substitute $2n$ with $50$ and $n$ with $25$ in the second condition:
$$f(50) = 2f(25) + 1.$$
Next, we need to find $f(25)$.
If we set $n = 12.5$, then $2n = 25$, but $n$ must be a positive integer, so we can't use this method anymore.
However, we can use the first condition $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$ to find $f(25)$.
If we set $n = 1$, then $f(f(f(1))) = 8(1) - 7 = 1$.
Since $f(f(f(1))) = 1$, and $f(1)$ is a positive integer, we know that $f(1) = 1$.
Then, we can substitute $n = 1$ into the first condition to find $f(2)$:
$$f(f(f(1))) = f(f(2)) = 8(1) - 7 = 1,$$
$$f(f(2)) = 1,$$
$$f(2) = 1.$$
Again, we know that $f(2) = 1$.
Similarly, we can find $f(3)$:
$$f(f(f(2))) = f(f(3)) = 8(2) - 7 = 9,$$
$$f(f(3)) = 9,$$
$$f(3) = 3.$$
We know that $f(3) = 3$.
Now, we can substitute $n = 12.5$ into the second condition to find $f(25)$:
$$f(50) = 2f(25) + 1,$$
$$f(25) = f(2 \cdot 12.5) = 2f(12.5) + 1 = 2 \cdot f(3) + 1 = 2 \cdot 3 + 1 = 7.$$
Finally, we can substitute $f(25) = 7$ into the equation for $f(50)$:
$$f(50) = 2f(25) + 1 = 2 \cdot 7 + 1 = 15.$$
Now, we can substitute $f(50) = 15$ into the equation for $f(100)$:
$$f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2 \cdot 15 + 1 = 31.$$
So, $f(100) = 31$.
The answer is: $31$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find the value of $f(100)$, we need to first understand the given function $f(n)$.
The first equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ suggests a recursive nature of the function.
The second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ implies that the function scales the argument by a factor of 2 and adds 1 to the result.

Let's start by evaluating the function for a few small values to get a sense of its behavior.
For $n=1$, from the second equation we have $f(2)=2f(1)+1$.
For $n=2$, from the second equation we have $f(4)=2f(2)+1$.
And so on...

Continuing this process, we can express $f(100)$ in terms of $f(50)$, $f(25)$, $f(12)$, $f(6)$, $f(3)$, and $f(1)$.
Now let's use the first equation to find the values of these expressions:
$f(1)$ can be found by substituting $n=1$ into the first equation, which gives $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7 \Rightarrow f(f(f(1)))=1 \Rightarrow f(f(1))=1 \Rightarrow f(1)=1$ since the function's domain and codomain are both natural numbers.

Using $f(1)=1$, we can now find the values of $f(3)$, $f(6)$, $f(12)$, $f(25)$, and $f(50)$:
$f(3)=2f(1)+1=2(1)+1=3$,
$f(6)=2f(3)+1=2(3)+1=7$,
$f(12)=2f(6)+1=2(7)+1=15$,
$f(25)=2f(12)+1=2(15)+1=31$,
$f(50)=2f(25)+1=2(31)+1=63$.

Finally, using these values in the equation for $f(100)$, we get:
$f(100)=2f(50)+1=2(63)+1=127$.

So, $f(100)=127$.
The answer is: $\boxed{127}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We are given that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We want to find $f(100)$.

Let's try to find the value of $f(1)$ first. By setting $n=1$ in the second equation, we get $f(2)=2f(1)+1$.

Then by setting $n=f(1)$ in the first equation, we get $f(f(f(f(1))))=8f(1)-7$. But since $f(f(f(1)))=f(2)$, we have $f(f(2))=8f(1)-7$. But we already know that $f(f(2))=2f(f(1))+1$, so we have the equation $2f(f(1))+1=8f(1)-7$.

This simplifies to $2f(f(1))=8f(1)-8$, so $f(f(1))=4f(1)-4$. Now we substitute $n=1$ into the equation $f(f(1))=4f(1)-4$, to get $f(f(1))=4f(1)-4$.

This simplifies to $f(2)=4f(1)-4$. We already knew that $f(2)=2f(1)+1$, so we have the equation $2f(1)+1=4f(1)-4$.

This simplifies to $2f(1)=5$, so $f(1)=\frac{5}{2}$. But since $f(1)$ is supposed to be a natural number, this is a contradiction. So our assumption that $f(1)$ is a natural number must have been incorrect.

This suggests that we might be missing some important insight about the function $f$. Let's try to use the second equation in a different way.

If we set $n=\frac{1}{2}$ in the second equation, we get $f(1)=2f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)+1$. But since $f(1)$ is a natural number, $f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)$ must also be a natural number.

The only possible value of $f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)$ that makes $f(1)$ a natural number is $f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)=0$, so $f(1)=1$.

Now we can use the first equation. If we set $n=1$, we get $f(f(f(1)))=7$, so $f(f(1))=7$.

If we substitute $f(1)=1$ into the equation $f(f(1))=2f(1)+1$, we get $f(f(1))=3$. So we have a contradiction, because $f(f(1))$ cannot be both 3 and 7.

However, let's try a different approach. If we set $n=2$ in the second equation, we get $f(4)=2f(2)+1$. But from the first equation, we know that $f(f(f(2)))=15$. So if we set $n=f(2)$ in the first equation, we get $f(f(f(f(2))))=8f(2)-7$, which simplifies to $f(15)=8f(2)-7$.

But from $f(f(f(2)))=15$, we can also say that $f(15)=f(f(f(2)))$, so $f(15)=15$. Setting $f(15)=8f(2)-7$, we get $15=8f(2)-7$, so $8f(2)=22$, and $f(2)=\frac{22}{8}=\frac{11}{4}$. But $f(2)$ should be a natural number, so this is a contradiction.

However, let's go back to the second equation and try $n=3$. If we set $n=3$ in the second equation, we get $f(6)=2f(3)+1$.

If we set $n=f(3)$ in the first equation, we get $f(f(f(f(3))))=8f(3)-7$. But we know that $f(f(f(3)))=f(6)$, so $f(f(6))=8f(3)-7$.

But from $f(f(f(3)))=f(6)$, we can also say that $f(f(6))=f(f(f(3)))$, so $f(f(6))=f(6)$. Setting $f(f(6))=8f(3)-7$, we get $f(6)=8f(3)-7$.

But we already know that $f(6)=2f(3)+1$, so we have the equation $2f(3)+1=8f(3)-7$. This simplifies to $6f(3)=8$, so $f(3)=\frac{4}{3}$. But $f(3)$ should be a natural number, so this is a contradiction.

However, let's go back to the second equation and try $n=4$. If we set $n=4$ in the second equation, we get $f(8)=2f(4)+1$.

If we set $n=f(4)$ in the first equation, we get $f(f(f(f(4))))=8f(4)-7$. But we know that $f(f(f(4)))=f(8)$, so $f(f(8))=8f(4)-7$.

But from $f(f(f(4)))=f(8)$, we can also say that $f(f(8))=f(f(f(4)))$, so $f(f(8))=f(8)$. Setting $f(f(8))=8f(4)-7$, we get $f(8)=8f(4)-7$.

But we already know that $f(8)=2f(4)+1$, so we have the equation $2f(4)+1=8f(4)-7$. This simplifies to $6f(4)=8$, so $f(4)=\frac{4}{3}$. But $f(4)$ should be a natural number, so this is a contradiction.

However, let's go back to the first equation and try $n=5$. If we set $n=5$ in the first equation, we get $f(f(f(5)))=8*5-7=33$.

If we set $n=f(5)$ in the first equation, we get $f(f(f(f(5))))=8f(5)-7$. But we know that $f(f(f(5)))=33$, so $f(f(33))=8f(5)-7$.

But from $f(f(f(5)))=33$, we can also say that $f(
