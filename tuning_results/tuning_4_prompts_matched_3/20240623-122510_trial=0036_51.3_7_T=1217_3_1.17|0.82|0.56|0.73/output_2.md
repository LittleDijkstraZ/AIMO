Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Approach:



To solve the problem, we need to find the values of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly four distinct solutions. The right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, is a positive constant. The number of distinct solutions of the equation depends on the value of the constant.

By observation, we can see that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=k$ (where $k$ is a positive constant) has exactly four distinct solutions when $k=1$. This is because the expression on the left side, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, represents a "wavy" function with a maximum value of $2$ and minimum value of $0$, and setting it equal to $1$ gives exactly four distinct solutions.

So, we need to find the value of $m$ such that $\frac{m}{100}=1$, which gives $m=100$.

Therefore, the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions is $100$.
The answer is: 100

We first consider the possible values of $m$ that make $\frac{m}{100}$ equal to $0, 1, 2, 3$. We then substitute these values into the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ and solve it. The number of distinct solutions for each value of $m$ gives us the count of $m$.

```python

        solutions = solve(equation, x)
        count += len(set(solutions))  # count the number of distinct solutions

The variable `x` is not defined in the Python script. This is likely due to a mistake in the script or a problem with the interpreter. Let's rewrite the code using sympy instead of `sympy.symbols` to define the variable `x`.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

def count_m():
    x = symbols('x')
    count = 0
    for m in [0, 1, 2, 3]:

        solutions = solve(equation, x)
        count += len(set(solutions))  # count the number of distinct solutions
    return count

Approach:



First, we need to understand that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 1 and 2. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ oscillates between 1 and 2, and the equation has 4 solutions when the right hand side of the equation is strictly between these values.

So, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Multiplying all sides of the inequalities by 100 gives $100 < m < 200$.

Now, we just need to count the number of positive integers $m$ in this range. The smallest integer $m$ is 101 and the largest is 199. So, the number of such integers is $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 99.
The answer is: $99$.

Approach:

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 1 and 2. This is because the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has 4 distinct roots when its value is between 1 and 2. Thus, we need to find how many values of $m$ make $\frac{m}{100}$ strictly between 1 and 2. This is equivalent to finding how many integers $m$ satisfy $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Multiplying all sides of the inequalities by 100 gives $100 < m < 200$. The number of integers in this range is $200 - 100 - 1 = 99$. Thus, there are 99 positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. The answer is: 99

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):

Assistant:

Approach:


We know that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions, which means that the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, takes the values $\pm \frac{m}{100}$ twice. This is because the absolute value function $|f(x)|$ takes the value $a$ twice for each solution of the equation $f(x)=a$ or $f(x)=-a$.

So, we have the following two cases:
1. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.
2. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$ (with swapped signs).

For each of these cases, we can split the absolute value equation into two separate equations and solve for $x$. The number of solutions to each equation will be the number of distinct solutions to the original equation. We then count the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition.

```python

        eq2 = abs(x - 1) - 2 + (-m/100)

Approach:


To find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions, we need to consider the values of $m$ for which the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, can be expressed as a value between $0$ and $2$.

Since $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is always between $0$ and $2$, the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be in the same range to allow for $4$ distinct solutions. This means $0 \leq \frac{m}{100} \leq 2$.

Solving these inequalities, we get $0 \leq m \leq 200$. Now we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ in this range.

The positive integers $m$ in this range are $1, 2, 3, ..., 200$. To find the total number of these integers, we simply subtract the smallest value from the largest value and add $1$:

$200 - 1 + 1 = 200$.

So, there are $200$ positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. The answer is: $200$

Approach:

 To solve this problem, we first need to understand the properties of the absolute value function and how it affects the number of solutions of an equation.

The equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] can be rewritten as two separate equations: \[\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}\] or \[\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}\]

For each of these equations, we can further split them into two more equations:

1. \[\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100} \Rightarrow \vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100} + 2\]
   This gives us two separate equations:
   a) \[x-1 = \frac{m}{100} + 2 \Rightarrow x = \frac{m}{100} + 3\]
   b) \[-(x-1) = \frac{m}{100} + 2 \Rightarrow x = 1 - \frac{m}{100} - 2 = - \frac{m}{100} - 1\]

2. \[\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100} \Rightarrow \vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}\]
   This gives us two separate equations:
   a) \[x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100} \Rightarrow x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}\]
   b) \[-(x-1) = 2 - \frac{m}{100} \Rightarrow x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}\]

So, we have 4 possible solutions for $x$:

1. $x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$
2. $x = - \frac{m}{100} - 1$
3. $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$
4. $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$

For these four solutions to be distinct, the four values of $x$ must be different. This means that the expressions on the right hand side must be different for each equation.

By comparing the four expressions, we can see that the second and third expressions cannot be equal to each other because their sum is not equal to zero. Similarly, the first and fourth expressions cannot be equal to each other for the same reason. Therefore, we only need to ensure that the expressions in the first pair ($\frac{m}{100} + 3$ and $- \frac{m}{100} - 1$) are different from the expressions in the second pair ($3 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $-1 + \frac{m}{100}$).

The difference between the first pair of expressions is:
\[\left(\frac{m}{100} + 3\right) - \left(- \frac{m}{100} - 1\right) = \frac{m}{100} + 3 + \frac{m}{100} + 1 = \frac{2m}{100} + 4 = \frac{m}{50} + 4.\]
The difference between the second pair of expressions is:
\[\left(3 - \frac{m}{100}\right) - \left(-1 + \frac{m}{100}\right) = 3 - \frac{m}{100} + 1 - \frac{m}{100} = 4 - \frac{2m}{100} = 4 - \frac{m}{50}.\]

For the four solutions to be distinct, we need both of these differences to be non-zero. This means that:
\[\frac{m}{50} + 4 \neq 0 \quad \text{and} \quad 4 - \frac{m}{50} \neq 0.\]
The first inequality is always true because $\frac{m}{50}$ is always non-negative and we are adding 4 to it. The second inequality is also always true because $\frac{m}{50}$ is always non-negative and we are subtracting it from 4.

So, the four solutions will be distinct for all positive integer values of $m$.

Now we need to find the number of such values of $m$ for which the equation has exactly 4 distinct solutions. The value of $\frac{m}{100}$ varies from 0 to 1 as $m$ varies from 0 to 100. So, the value of $\frac{m}{50} + 4$ varies from 4 to 5, and the value of $4 - \frac{m}{50}$ varies from 3 to 4.

Therefore, the equation has 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{50} + 4$ is in the range (4, 5) and $4 - \frac{m}{50}$ is in the range (3, 4). This happens when $m$ is in the range (0, 100). So, there are exactly 100 positive integer values of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions.

The answer is: $100$.

Assistant:

Approach:



We can start by analyzing the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}.\]

The expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, can take on any value between $-2$ and $2$, because the absolute value of a number is always nonnegative. So, the right-hand side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must also lie in the interval $[-2,2]$. This gives us $$-2 \leq \frac{m}{100} \leq 2,$$ which simplifies to $$-200 \leq m \leq 200.$$

However, $m$ must be a positive integer. So, the possible values of $m$ are the integers from $1$ to $200$.

For each value of $m$, we can count the number of distinct solutions to the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}.\] This can be done by graphing or by considering the cases separately.

For $m=1$, there are $4$ distinct solutions. For $m=2$, there are also $4$ distinct solutions. As $m$ increases, the number of distinct solutions decreases, until it becomes $0$ when $m$ is greater than $200$.

Therefore, the only values of $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions are $1$ and $2$. So, there are $2$ possible values of $m$.
The answer is: 2

Assistant:

Approach:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. This is because the expression on the left side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, oscillates between 0 and 4 as $x$ varies over the real numbers. It equals 0 when $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$, which has two solutions, $x=3$ and $x=-1$. It equals 2 when $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = 2$, which has four solutions.

Therefore, we need to find the value of $m$ such that $\frac{m}{100} = 2$.

Solution:
To find $m$, we simply multiply both sides of the equation $\frac{m}{100} = 2$ by 100 to get $m = 200$. So the only value of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is $m = 200$.

The answer is: $\boxed{1}$

Assistant:

Approach:

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is a number strictly between 1 and 2. This is because the expression on the left hand side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, takes on the values of 1, 3, 2, 1 in decreasing order as its argument $\vert x-1 \vert$ increases from 0 to infinity. So $\frac{m}{100}$ must be strictly between 1 and 2 for the equation to have 4 distinct solutions.

This means $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which simplifies to $100 < m < 200$.

The number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality is $200 - 100 - 1 = 99$. So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 99.

The answer is: $99$

Assistant:

Approach:

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions means that the right side of the equation is a positive number between $0$ and $3$. This is because the absolute value of the left side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, can take on any value from $0$ to $3$. So we have $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 3$. 

To find the possible values of $m$, we solve the inequalities $0 < \frac{m}{100}$ and $\frac{m}{100} < 3$. 

For $0 < \frac{m}{100}$, we multiply both sides of the inequality by $100$ to get $0 < m$. This means $m$ must be a positive integer.

For $\frac{m}{100} < 3$, we multiply both sides of the inequality by $100$ to get $m < 300$. So $m$ must be less than $300$.

Combining these two conditions, we find that $0 < m < 300$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this condition are the integers from $1$ to $299$. 

However, we need to count the number of these integers that make the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have $4$ distinct solutions. We can do this by trial and error. 

For $m=1$, we have $4$ distinct solutions: $x= -1, 3, 5, 7$. 

For $m=2$, we have $4$ distinct solutions: $x= 0, 2, 4, 6$. 

For $m=3$, we have $4$ distinct solutions: $x= 1, 3, 5, 7$. 

We continue this process and find that for $m=1, 2, 3$, we have $4$ distinct solutions. For $m=4$ and above, we do not have $4$ distinct solutions. 

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition is $3$.

The answer is: $3$

To find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions, we need to understand the properties of the absolute value function and the number of solutions it can produce.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is equivalent to a pair of equations: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.

For each of these equations, the absolute value $\vert x-1 \vert$ will be equal to $2 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $2 - \frac{m}{100}$. This means that $x-1$ will be equal to $2 + \frac{m}{100}$, $-(2 + \frac{m}{100})$, $2 - \frac{m}{100}$, or $-(2 - \frac{m}{100})$.

Solving these equations gives us the four distinct solutions:

1. $x = 1 + 2 + \frac{m}{100} = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$,
2. $x = 1 - 2 - \frac{m}{100} = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$,
3. $x = 1 + 2 - \frac{m}{100} = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$,
4. $x = 1 - 2 + \frac{m}{100} = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

For these equations to have 4 distinct solutions, none of the solutions can be equal. This implies that none of the expressions $3 + \frac{m}{100}$, $-1 - \frac{m}{100}$, $3 - \frac{m}{100}$, and $-1 + \frac{m}{100}$ can be equal.

This gives us the conditions:

1. $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $m \neq -75$,
2. $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $m = 0$, but we discard this as $m$ must be positive,
3. $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 + \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $m \neq 150$,
4. $-1 - \frac{m}{100} \neq 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $m \neq 100$.

Therefore, the only positive integer values of $m$ that satisfy these conditions are $m = 1, 2, ..., 74, 76, ..., 149, 151, ..., 199, 200, ..., 299, 300, ..., 399, ...$.

The positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions are all the integers from 1 to 399, inclusive.

The number of positive integers in this range is 399.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 399. However, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation has exactly 4 distinct solutions. This means we need to exclude the cases where the number of solutions is less than 4 or more than 4.

For $m = 0$, the equation has only 2 distinct solutions, so we discard this case.

For $m = 100$, the equation has only 3 distinct solutions, so we discard this case.

For $m = 150$, the equation has only 3 distinct solutions, so we discard this case.

For $m = -75$, the equation has only 3 distinct solutions, so we discard this case.

Therefore, all the positive integer values of $m$ that we considered are valid.

So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has exactly 4 distinct solutions is 399. The answer is: $\boxed{399}$.

To find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions, we need to understand the behavior of the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$.

The function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a graph that looks like a "hump" with 3 pieces. It equals $0$ when $x$ is in the interval $(1-2, 1+2) = (-1, 3)$, it equals $3-x$ for $x$ in the interval $(1-2, 1)$ or $(1, 1+2) = (-1, 1)$ or $(3, 5)$, and it equals $x-3$ for $x$ in the interval $(1+\infty)$.

Therefore, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 3$. Solving this inequality gives $0 < m < 300$. The number of positive integers $m$ in this range is $299$.
The answer is: $299$.

First, we rewrite the equation as \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}.\] We know that $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ can only be positive, so $\frac{m}{100}$ must be positive. This means $m$ must be positive. 

Now, we know that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is between $1$ and $3$ (inclusive). This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ takes on the values $0, 1, 2, 3$ exactly once in the interval $1 \leq x \leq 4$. 

To find the value of $m$ that satisfies this condition, we can multiply both sides of the inequality $1 \leq \frac{m}{100} \leq 3$ by $100$ to get $100 \leq m \leq 300$. 

The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are $100, 101, \ldots, 300$. There are $201$ such integers. 

So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 201.

The answer is: $201$

We are given the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, and we want to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions.

First, let's consider the right-hand side of the equation. Since $\frac{m}{100}$ is a positive fraction, the value of $m$ must be a positive integer. The possible values of $\frac{m}{100}$ are all the positive fractions between $0$ and $2$, i.e., $\frac{m}{100} \in (0, 2)$. Thus, the possible values of $m$ are the positive integers from $1$ to $200$.

Next, let's consider the number of solutions of the equation. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be thought of as the distance between two vertical lines being $\frac{m}{100}$. The graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ consists of three line segments, forming a "V" shape. The equation has $4$ distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is in the range where the "V" shape is split into two parts by two of the line segments.

By observation, $\frac{m}{100}$ should be equal to the distance between the two vertical lines in the "V" shape. The distance between the vertical lines is $2$ when $\frac{m}{100} = 1$, and it decreases to $0$ when $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. Thus, the equation has $4$ distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is in the range $(1, 2)$. This means the possible values of $m$ are the positive integers from $100$ to $200$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is the number of positive integers from $100$ to $200$, which is $100$.

So the answer is $\boxed{100}$.

In this problem, we first identified the possible values of $m$ based on the right-hand side of the equation. Then, we analyzed the number of solutions based on the shape of the graph of the left-hand side of the equation. This allowed us to identify the range of $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions. Finally, we counted the number of positive integers in this range to find the desired answer. The steps involved in solving this problem are typical for problems involving equations with absolute values.

To solve this problem, we need to find the value of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.
The right-hand side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, represents the distance from the two "inner" lines (where $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 \pm \frac{m}{100}$) to the two "outer" lines (where $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$).
For the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, this distance must be less than 2 (otherwise, the two "inner" lines would coincide with the two "outer" lines, resulting in only 2 distinct solutions).
Therefore, $\frac{m}{100} < 2$, which implies $m < 200$.
Also, the distance must be positive (otherwise, the two "inner" lines would coincide with each other, resulting in only 2 distinct solutions again). Therefore, $m > 0$.
So, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $0 < m < 200$. This is simply $1, 2, 3, ..., 199$, so there are 199 positive integers $m$ in this range.
Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 199. The answer is: 199
