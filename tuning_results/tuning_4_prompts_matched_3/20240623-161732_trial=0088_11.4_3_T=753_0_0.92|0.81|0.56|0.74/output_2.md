Assistant:


The number of distinct solutions to the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to 4 if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 1 and 2. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a "hump" of height 1 between x=1 and x=3, and a "hump" of height 1 between x=3 and x=5. So for the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, the right side, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be strictly greater than 1 and strictly less than 2. This means $1<\frac{m}{100}<2$, or equivalently, $100<m<200$. The positive integers m that satisfy this inequality are the integers from 101 to 199, inclusive. To find the number of these integers, we subtract the smallest integer in the range from the largest integer in the range and then add 1 (since both endpoints are included). So the number of positive integers m is $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 99. The answer is: $99$

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is less than $2$ but greater than $0$. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a "V" shape with the "valley" between $1-2= -1$ and $1+2=3$, and the "height" of the "V" is $2$. So for the equation to have $4$ distinct solutions, the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be strictly between $0$ and $2$.

So we have $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Multiplying all sides by $100$ gives $0 < m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from $1$ to $199$. Therefore, there are $199$ positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions. The answer is: $199$

The problem asks for how many positive integers $m$ the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be solved graphically or by considering different cases.

The graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ consists of a series of "V"s, each with a slope of $\pm 1$. The number of these "V"s is determined by the number of times the expression inside the absolute value changes its sign.

In this case, the expression inside the absolute value changes its sign twice when $x$ varies from $-\infty$ to $\infty$. This means the graph consists of three "V"s.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions when the height of each "V" is equal to $\frac{m}{100}$.

This means that $\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal to $2$, so $m = 200$.

Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions, and that is $m = 200$.
The answer is: $1$

 To solve this problem, we need to analyze the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ and find the values of $m$ for which it has $4$ distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is equivalent to a piecewise function with four cases:
1. $x-1 \ge 2$, then the equation becomes $\vert x-1-2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert x-3 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. This gives two equations: $x-3=\frac{m}{100}$ and $x-3=-\frac{m}{100}$, or $x=3+\frac{m}{100}$ and $x=3-\frac{m}{100}$.
2. $1 \le x-1 < 2$, then the equation becomes $\vert x-1-2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert x-3 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. This gives two equations: $x-3=\frac{m}{100}$ and $x-3=-\frac{m}{100}$, or $x=3+\frac{m}{100}$ and $x=3-\frac{m}{100}$.
3. $x-1 < 1$, then the equation becomes $\vert 1-x-2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert -x-1 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert x+1 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. This gives two equations: $x+1=\frac{m}{100}$ and $x+1=-\frac{m}{100}$, or $x=-1+\frac{m}{100}$ and $x=-1-\frac{m}{100}$.
4. $x-1 \le 0$, then the equation becomes $\vert 1-x-2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert -x-1 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert x+1 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. This gives two equations: $x+1=\frac{m}{100}$ and $x+1=-\frac{m}{100}$, or $x=-1+\frac{m}{100}$ and $x=-1-\frac{m}{100}$.

For each case, we need to find the values of $m$ for which the two resulting equations have distinct solutions. After solving these equations and finding the distinct solutions, we can count the number of distinct solutions for each value of $m$.

After analyzing the problem and solving the equations, we find that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions when $m=50$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $1$. The answer is: $1$

Assistant:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 1$. This is because the expression on the left side of the equation can only be equal to 1 in four distinct ways:

1. When $x$ is less than 1, we have $\vert -(x-1) - 2 \vert = \vert -x + 1 - 2 \vert = \vert -x - 1 \vert = x + 1 + 2 = x + 3$. Setting this equal to 1 gives $x + 3 = 1$, so $x = -2$. But this is not a positive integer, so we discard this solution.

2. When $1 \leq x \leq 3$, we have $\vert x - 1 - 2 \vert = \vert x - 3 \vert = 3 - x$. Setting this equal to 1 gives $3 - x = 1$, so $x = 2$. This is a positive integer.

3. When $x$ is greater than 3, we have $\vert x - 1 - 2 \vert = \vert x - 3 \vert = x - 3$. Setting this equal to 1 gives $x - 3 = 1$, so $x = 4$. This is a positive integer.

4. When $x$ is between 3 and 5 (exclusive), we have $\vert x - 1 + 2 \vert = \vert x + 1 \vert = x + 1$. Setting this equal to 1 gives $x + 1 = 1$, so $x = 0$. But this is not a positive integer, so we discard this solution.

Therefore, the only way for the equation to have 4 distinct solutions is when $\frac{m}{100} = 1$. This implies that $m = 100$. So the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition is 1. The answer is: $1$

Assistant:

 To solve this problem, we need to analyze the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ and find out for how many positive integers $m$ it has $4$ distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be solved by considering the cases for the absolute value inside the outer absolute value. This results in the following four equations:

1. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$,
2. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$,
3. $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = \frac{m}{100}$, and
4. $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.

For each of these equations, we can solve them and find the number of distinct solutions. The number of solutions will be the number of $m$ for which these equations have $4$ distinct solutions.

After analyzing these equations, we find that only the first equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. The other three equations do not have $4$ distinct solutions for any positive integer $m$.

Therefore, we only need to consider the first equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$.

Solving this equation, we find that it has $4$ distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100} = 1$. This gives $m = 100$.

So, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions, and that is $m = 100$. The answer is: $1$
