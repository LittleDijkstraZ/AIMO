Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To have 4 distinct solutions, the right-hand side $\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal to either 2 or 0.
If $\frac{m}{100}=2$, then $m=200$.
If $\frac{m}{100}=0$, then $m=0$, but we discard this case since we are asked for positive integers $m$.
Therefore, the only positive integer $m$ that satisfies the given condition is $m=200$. The answer is: $1$
The answer is $\boxed{1}$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is less than 2 but greater than or equal to 0, i.e., $0 \le \frac{m}{100} < 2$.
Multiplying through by 100 gives $0 \le m < 200$.
The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from 1 to 199.
Therefore, there are 199 positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions. The answer is: $199$.

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions, so we must have $\frac{m}{100}=1$. Thus, $m=100$.
So, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy this condition is 1. The value of $m$ is 100. The answer is: $1$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. This means that the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, needs to change its sign twice when $x$ varies from $-\infty$ to $+\infty$.

The absolute value function $\vert x-1 \vert$ is a piecewise function that equals $x-1$ when $x \geq 1$, and $1-x$ when $x < 1$. Therefore, the expression $\vert x-1 \vert -2$ changes its sign at $x=1$ and $x=3$. This is because when $x<1$, $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 1-x-2 = -x-1$, which is negative, and when $x>3$, $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = x-1-2 = x-3$, which is positive.

For the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ to have 4 distinct solutions, the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal to the difference in the values of the expression $\vert x-1 \vert -2$ at $x=1$ and $x=3$, which is $2-(-2) = 4$. Therefore, $m = 4 \cdot 100 = 400$.
So, the only positive integer value of $m$ that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions is $m = 400$. The answer is: $1$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To begin with, we note that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. This is because the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a "V" shaped function that intersects the $x$-axis at $x = 1 \pm 2$, which means it intersects the line $y = 2$ at exactly four points. 

To find the value of $m$ that makes $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, we can simply multiply both sides of the equation by $100$, which gives us $m = 200$.

Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ that makes the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have four distinct solutions, and that is $m = 200$. The answer is: $\boxed{1}$
