Approach:

 The absolute value equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions, it means that $\frac{m}{100}$ must be less than $2$ but greater than or equal to $0$. Thus $0 \leq \frac{m}{100} < 2$, we can solve this inequality to find the values of $m$.

Multiplying all sides of the inequality by $100$ gives $0 \leq m < 200$.

Since $m$ is a positive integer, the possible values of $m$ are $1, 2, \ldots, 199$.

Now we need to count how many of these values of $m$ satisfy the condition that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

By the properties of absolute value, we know that $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have $4$ distinct solutions if and only if the right side $\frac{m}{100}$ is less than $2$. So we need to count how many integers $m$ in the range $0 \leq m < 200$ satisfy this condition.

The number of such integers is $200$. So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $200$. However, we have one restriction: $m$ must be an integer, and $\frac{m}{100}$ must be less than $2$. So we need to find how many of these $200$ values of $m$ actually satisfy this condition.

Since $0 \leq \frac{m}{100} < 2$, we have $0 \leq m < 200$. This means all $200$ values of $m$ in the range $0 \leq m < 200$ are valid.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $200$.

However, this number includes the value $m = 200$. But when $m = 200$, we have $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, which does not satisfy the condition for the equation to have $4$ distinct solutions.

So we need to exclude the value $m = 200$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $200 - 1 = 199$.
The answer is: 199

Approach:


We start by analyzing the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.

For the equation to have $4$ distinct solutions, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be less than $2$ but greater than $0$. This is because the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, can change its sign twice for the equation to have $4$ distinct solutions.

So, we have $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which implies $0 < m < 200$.

Now, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ in the range $(0, 200)$.

To do this, we simply subtract the smallest integer greater than $0$ from the largest integer less than $200$. That is, $200 - 1 = 199$.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $199$.
The answer is: $199$

Approach:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions, which means that the expression inside the absolute value, i.e., $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, will have two values that are $\pm\frac{m}{100}$ away from $0$.

Let's consider the case where $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$. This implies that $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. The absolute value equation splits into two cases:

1. $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.
2. $x-1 = -2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

So the values of $x$ that satisfy this case are $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Now let's consider the case where $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$. This implies that $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. The absolute value equation splits into two cases:

3. $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
4. $x-1 = -2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

So the values of $x$ that satisfy this case are $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

For the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, we need the ranges of $x$ from the two cases (1 and 2) and the ranges of $x$ from the two cases (3 and 4) to be non-overlapping. This happens when the values of $m$ are such that:

$3 + \frac{m}{100} > -1 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $3 + \frac{m}{100} > -1 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $3 - \frac{m}{100} < -1 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $3 - \frac{m}{100} < -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Solving these inequalities gives $0 < m < 400$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the conditions is $399$.
The answer is: $\boxed{399}$

Approach:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is a positive number between 1 and 2. This is because the expression inside the absolute value on the left hand side of the equation, i.e., $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, can have 4 distinct values: $-2-\frac{m}{100}$, $-2+\frac{m}{100}$, $2-\frac{m}{100}$, and $2+\frac{m}{100}$. 

The value of $\frac{m}{100}$ should be chosen such that $-2+\frac{m}{100}$ is greater than 0 and $2-\frac{m}{100}$ is less than 0, which implies that $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. 

Therefore, we can write $100 < m < 200$. 

The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from 101 to 199, inclusive. To find the number of such integers, we subtract the smallest possible value of $m$ from the largest possible value of $m$ and then add 1 (because both the smallest and largest values are included). 

Solution:
So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$.

The answer is: $\boxed{99}$.

Approach:

 The given equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. This equation is in the form of a piecewise function with $4$ parts. We know that for each part of the function, there will be $2$ solutions if the right side of the equation is greater than $0$. So, the number of solutions depends on the value of $m$. If we find the range of $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions, then we can determine the number of possible values of $m$.

Solution:

First, we need to make sure that $\frac{m}{100}$ is greater than $0$. So, $m$ must be greater than $0$.

Next, we need to find the number of values of $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. This happens when $\frac{m}{100}$ is between $2$ and $3$. That is, $2 < \frac{m}{100} < 3$, which implies $200 < m < 300$. The positive integers in this range are $201, 202, \ldots, 299$. The number of such integers is $99$. So, there are $99$ positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{99}$.
The answer is: $99$

We need to find the value of $m$ such that the equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. 

Let's consider the function $f(x)=| |x-1|-2|$. 

The function $f(x)$ is equal to a constant plus or minus another constant depending on the value of $x$. 

The function $f(x)$ has three different forms depending on the value of $x$:

1. For $x < 1$, $f(x) = -(x-1) - 2 = -x + 3$.
2. For $1 \leq x \leq 3$, $f(x) = (x-1) - 2 = x - 3$.
3. For $x > 3$, $f(x) = (x-1) - 2 = x - 3$.

The graph of $f(x)$ is a V-shape with vertices at $x=1$ and $x=3$. 

Now, we need to find the value of $m$ such that the equation $f(x) = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. 

This means that the horizontal line $y = \frac{m}{100}$ intersects the graph of $f(x)$ at 4 different points. 

From the graph, we can see that this happens when $\frac{m}{100} = 1$. 

So, $m = 100$. 

Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ such that the equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions, and that is $m=100$. The answer is: 1

Approach:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $2$. This means $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, or equivalently, $100 < m < 200$. So the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality is $200 - 100 - 1 = 99$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $99$. The answer is: $99$

Approach:


We need to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.
The right-hand side of the equation is a positive number, and the number of solutions of the equation depends on the value of the right-hand side.
If $\frac{m}{100}$ is small (less than $2$), the equation has two solutions.
If $\frac{m}{100}$ equals $2$, the equation has three solutions.
If $\frac{m}{100}$ is large (greater than $2$), the equation has four solutions.
Therefore, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $\frac{m}{100} = 2$.
Solving for $m$, we get $m = 200$.
So, the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $200$.
The number of such positive integers $m$ is $1$.
The answer is: $1$

To find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions, we need to consider the properties of the absolute value function and the equation.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is less than $2$ but greater than or equal to $0$. This is because the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, can take on values in the range of $[-2, 2]$. Therefore, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be in the range of $[0, 2)$ for the equation to have $4$ distinct solutions.

To find the value of $m$, we can multiply both sides of the inequality $0 \leq \frac{m}{100} < 2$ by $100$:
\[0 \leq m < 200.\]
The positive integers in this range are $1, 2, 3, ..., 199$. So there are $199$ positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.
The answer is: $199$

We want to find how many positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. The right hand side of this equation is a constant, and the left hand side is a piecewise function that has four pieces, each of which corresponds to a solution to the equation. 

For the left hand side to have four distinct solutions, the right hand side must be a number that falls into the range where the left hand side has four pieces. The left hand side of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can take on values in the interval $[0,3]$ and only has four pieces if $\frac{m}{100}$ falls into the interval $(0,3)$. Therefore, we have $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 3$, which simplifies to $0 < m < 300$.

The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from $1$ to $299$, inclusive. The number of these integers is $299$.
The answer is: 299
