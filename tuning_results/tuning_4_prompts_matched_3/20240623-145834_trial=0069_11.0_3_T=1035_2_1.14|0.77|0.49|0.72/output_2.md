Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $2$ or $3$.
If $\frac{m}{100}=2$, then $m=200$.
If $\frac{m}{100}=3$, then $m=300$.
Therefore, there are only $2$ positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition. The answer is: $2$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.
The graph of $y=\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ consists of three line segments with slopes of $1$, $-1$, and $1$ respectively.
For the equation to have $4$ distinct solutions, the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be between $1$ and $2$ (exclusive), because the graph of $y=\frac{m}{100}$ will intersect the graph of $y=\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ at exactly $4$ points in this range.
So we have $1<\frac{m}{100}<2$, which implies $100<m<200$.
The positive integers $m$ in this range are $101, 102, \dots, 199$, and there are $99$ such integers.
Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ is $99$. The answer is: $99$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.
We know that the absolute value function $\vert x \vert$ is a piecewise function defined as $x$ if $x \geq 0$ and $-x$ if $x < 0$. Therefore, we can rewrite the given equation as two cases:
Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$.
Case 2: $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = \frac{m}{100}$.
For each case, we can further break down the absolute value into two sub-cases:
Case 1.1: $x-1 -2 = \frac{m}{100}$.
Case 1.2: $-(x-1) -2 = \frac{m}{100}$.
Case 2.1: $x-1 +2 = \frac{m}{100}$.
Case 2.2: $-(x-1) +2 = \frac{m}{100}$.
Now we can solve each sub-case to find the value of $x$:
For Case 1.1, $x-3 = \frac{m}{100}$, so $x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$.
For Case 1.2, $-x+1 -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, so $-x = \frac{m}{100} - 1$, and $x = 1 - \frac{m}{100}$.
For Case 2.1, $x+1 = \frac{m}{100}$, so $x = \frac{m}{100} - 1$.
For Case 2.2, $-x+1 +2 = \frac{m}{100}$, so $-x = \frac{m}{100} - 3$, and $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
For the equation to have $4$ distinct solutions, the four expressions for $x$ must be distinct. This means that the four values of $x$ must be different. Comparing the four expressions, we can see that the values of $x$ in the first and last expressions, and the values of $x$ in the second and third expressions, are not distinct. Therefore, we must have $1 - \frac{m}{100} \neq 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, which implies $1 \neq 3$, which is true. Also, we must have $\frac{m}{100} + 3 \neq \frac{m}{100} - 1$, which implies $3 \neq -1$, which is also true. Therefore, the four expressions for $x$ are indeed distinct.
To count the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions, we need to count the number of positive integers $m$ such that $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, or equivalently, $0 < m < 200$. Therefore, there are $199$ positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions. The answer is: $199$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$.
This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ reaches its maximum value of 2, and only when $\frac{m}{100} = 2$ does it have 4 distinct solutions.
So, we solve the equation $\frac{m}{100} = 2$ for $m$:
$m = 2 \cdot 100 = 200$.
Therefore, the value of $m$ that makes the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have 4 distinct solutions is 200.
The answer is: $1$

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ takes the value $2$ exactly $4$ times.

So, we have $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. Solving this equation for $m$ gives us $m = 200$.

Therefore, the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $200$. The answer is: $1$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

We know that $\frac{m}{100}$ must be a positive number because the absolute value of a number cannot be negative. So $m$ must be a positive integer.

The right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, represents the "distance" from the vertical bars to the number line. The number of distinct solutions tells us how many times the "distance" fits into the "width" of the "V" shape of the absolute value function.

For the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ to have 4 distinct solutions, the "distance" $\frac{m}{100}$ must be less than 2 but greater than or equal to 0.5, because the "V" shape of the absolute value function has a width of 4 units.

So we have the inequality $0.5 \leq \frac{m}{100} < 2$.

Multiplying all parts of the inequality by 100 gives $50 \leq m < 200$.

The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from 50 to 199, inclusive.

To find the number of these integers, we subtract the smallest integer from the largest and add 1: $199 - 50 + 1 = 150$.

So there are 150 positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.
The answer is: $150$

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.
We know that $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is an integer (since the right side is a fraction with a denominator of 100, and the absolute value of an integer is an integer).
Therefore, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be an integer. This implies that $m$ must be a multiple of 100.
Let $k$ be a positive integer such that $m=100k$.
Then the equation becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=k$.
The number of distinct solutions of this equation depends on the value of $k$.
For example, if $k=1$, the equation becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=1$, which has 4 distinct solutions.
Similarly, if $k=2$, the equation becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=2$, which also has 4 distinct solutions.
However, if $k=3$, the equation becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=3$, which has only 2 distinct solutions.
Therefore, the only values of $k$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions are $k=1$ and $k=2$.
So the possible values of $m$ are $m=100(1)=100$ and $m=100(2)=200$.
There are 2 possible values of $m$. The answer is: $2$

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}=1$. This is because the expression on the left side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, can only be equal to 1 in exactly 4 distinct values of $x$.

So, we have $\frac{m}{100}=1$. Solving for $m$ gives $m = 100$. Therefore, there is only 1 positive integer $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions, and that is $m = 100$. The answer is: $1$

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}=2$. This is because the expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ can only be equal to 2 for 4 distinct values of $x$.

Solving the equation $\frac{m}{100}=2$, we get $m = 200$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition is 1, namely 200. The answer is: $\boxed{1}$
