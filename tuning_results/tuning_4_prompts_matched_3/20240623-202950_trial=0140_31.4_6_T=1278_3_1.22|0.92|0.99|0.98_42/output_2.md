Approach:


We will consider the number of values for m for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions. 
The equation $ \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can have 4 distinct solutions depending on the value of $\frac{m}{100}$.
When $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, the equation becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert= 2$.
We can solve this equation by considering two cases:
Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 2 \Rightarrow \vert x-1 \vert = 4 \Rightarrow x-1 = 4 \text{ or } x-1 = -4 \Rightarrow x = 5 \text{ or } x = -3$.
Case 2: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -2 \Rightarrow \vert x-1 \vert = 0 \Rightarrow x-1 = 0 \Rightarrow x = 1$.
So, when $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, the equation has 3 distinct solutions, namely $x = -3$, $x = 1$, and $x = 5$.
When $\frac{m}{100} = 1$, the equation becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert= 1$.
We can solve this equation by considering two cases:
Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 1 \Rightarrow \vert x-1 \vert = 3 \Rightarrow x-1 = 3 \text{ or } x-1 = -3 \Rightarrow x = 4 \text{ or } x = -2$.
Case 2: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -1 \Rightarrow \vert x-1 \vert = 1 \Rightarrow x-1 = 1 \text{ or } x-1 = -1 \Rightarrow x = 2 \text{ or } x = 0$.
So, when $\frac{m}{100} = 1$, the equation has 4 distinct solutions, namely $x = -2$, $x = 0$, $x = 2$, and $x = 4$.
Therefore, the number of positive integers m for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 1.
The answer is: $1$

To find the value of m for which the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has 4 distinct solutions, we need to consider the different cases for the absolute value function.

1. When $\vert x-1 \vert -2 > 0$, we have $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\vert x-1 \vert -2$. Thus, the equation becomes \[\vert x-1 \vert -2=\frac{m}{100} \Rightarrow \vert x-1 \vert = 2+\frac{m}{100}.\]
This has 2 cases again:
   a. $x-1 > 0 \Rightarrow x > 1$, so the equation becomes $x-1 = 2+\frac{m}{100} \Rightarrow x = 3+\frac{m}{100}$.
   b. $x-1 < 0 \Rightarrow x < 1$, so the equation becomes $1-x = 2+\frac{m}{100} \Rightarrow x = -1-\frac{m}{100}$.

2. When $\vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0$, we have $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=-\vert x-1 \vert +2$. Thus, the equation becomes \[-\vert x-1 \vert +2=\frac{m}{100} \Rightarrow \vert x-1 \vert = 2-\frac{m}{100}.\]
This has 2 cases again:
   a. $x-1 > 0 \Rightarrow x > 1$, so the equation becomes $x-1 = 2-\frac{m}{100} \Rightarrow x = 3-\frac{m}{100}$.
   b. $x-1 < 0 \Rightarrow x < 1$, so the equation becomes $1-x = 2-\frac{m}{100} \Rightarrow x = -1+\frac{m}{100}$.

Now we need to find the values of $m$ for which these equations have 4 distinct solutions. This happens when the four lines $x = 3+\frac{m}{100}$, $x = -1-\frac{m}{100}$, $x = 3-\frac{m}{100}$, and $x = -1+\frac{m}{100}$ intersect at different points.

The slopes of these lines are all $\pm \frac{1}{100}$, which are all different. Therefore, the lines intersect at 4 distinct points for any value of $m$. Therefore, any positive integer $m$ will satisfy the equation.

However, we are asked for the number of positive integers $m$ that give 4 distinct solutions. Since there is an infinite number of positive integers $m$, the problem is incorrect or incomplete. If the problem meant to ask for the smallest and largest positive integers $m$, we can continue solving as follows:

For the lines to intersect at 4 distinct points, we require that none of the lines coincide or be parallel. This means that the four values of $\frac{m}{100}$ should be distinct and non-zero. The smallest positive integer value for $m$ is thus $1$ and the largest positive integer value for $m$ is $100$.
So, there are $99$ positive integers that satisfy the given conditions. The answer is: $99$

Approach:


We start by analyzing the given equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}.\]

The value inside the absolute value, i.e., $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, is equal to either $\frac{m}{100}$, or $-\frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two equations:

1. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, and
2. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.

For each of these equations, we add $2$ to both sides to isolate $\vert x-1 \vert$:

1. $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, and
2. $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.

These absolute value equations split into two cases each:

1. For the equation $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, we get two sub-equations:
   a. $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, and
   b. $-(x-1) = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.

2. For the equation $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, we get two sub-equations:
   a. $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, and
   b. $-(x-1) = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Solving each of these sub-equations gives us the four distinct solutions. The number of distinct solutions is $4$ if and only if $2 - \frac{m}{100} > 0$, or $m < 200$.

Therefore, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy $0 < m < 200$ and the equation $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ has two solutions, and the equation $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ has two solutions.

This occurs if and only if $0 < 2 + \frac{m}{100} < 4$, or $-2 < 2 - \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Simplifying these inequalities gives $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, or $-2 < -\frac{m}{100} < 2$. The first inequality implies $0 < m < 200$, and the second inequality implies $-200 < m < 0$. However, the latter is not possible since we are looking for positive integers $m$.

Therefore, we only need to consider the first inequality $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which implies $0 < m < 200$. The number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality is the number of positive integers in the open interval $(0, 200)$. This is the same as the number of positive integers in the closed interval $[1, 199]$, because we are only interested in positive integers. The number of positive integers in a closed interval of integers is just the difference of the endpoints of the interval. So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ has two solutions, and the equation $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ has two solutions is $199 - 1 = 198$.
The answer is: $198$

Approach:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is between $1$ and $2$. This is because the graph of the function $y=\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a sawtooth shape with a period of $1$. Therefore, the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be within one period to have $4$ distinct solutions. Since it must be between $1$ and $2$, we have $1 \leq \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Multiplying all sides by $100$, we get $100 \leq m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from $100$ to $199$. To find the number of these integers, we subtract the smallest one from the largest one and add $1$. So the number of integers is $200 - 100 + 1 = 101$.

The answer is $\boxed{101}$.

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:


We first solve the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}.\] For each value of $m$, we need to determine how many distinct solutions $x$ it has. If the number of solutions is $4$, we add the corresponding value of $m$ to a set. At the end, we will count the number of elements in the set to get our final answer.

Solution:
To begin with, we can consider the cases when $\vert x-1 \vert -2$ is positive or negative separately.

Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 > 0$.
In this case, the equation becomes \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100} \implies \vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100},\] or \[\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}.\]

The first equation can be further simplified as \[\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100},\] which gives two sub-cases:
- If $x-1 \geq 0$, then $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.
- If $x-1 < 0$, then $-(x-1) = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

The second equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$ can be further simplified as \[\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100},\] which gives two sub-cases:
- If $x-1 \geq 0$, then $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
- If $x-1 < 0$, then $-(x-1) = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Therefore, we have the following solutions in this case: \[x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}, -1 + \frac{m}{100}, 3 - \frac{m}{100}, -1 - \frac{m}{100}.\]

Case 2: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0$.
In this case, the equation becomes \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100} \implies -\vert x-1 \vert +2 = \frac{m}{100}.\]
This can be further simplified as \[\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100},\] which gives two sub-cases:
- If $x-1 \geq 0$, then $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
- If $x-1 < 0$, then $-(x-1) = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

However, in this case, since $\vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0$, we cannot have $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$ as solutions.

Now we have all the possible solutions for the equation. We can see that in Case 1, there are 4 distinct solutions, while in Case 2, there are only 2 distinct solutions. 

We need to find out for how many values of $m$ the number of distinct solutions is 4. We can try some values of $m$:
- If $m = 100$, then the solutions are $x = 3, -1, 2, -2$, but $x=2$ and $x=-2$ are not distinct, so only 2 distinct solutions.
- If $m = 200$, then the solutions are $x = 4, 0, 3, -1$, but $x=0$ is not distinct either, so only 3 distinct solutions.
- If $m = 300$, then the solutions are $x = 5, 1, 4, 0$, but $x=1$ and $x=0$ are not distinct, so only 3 distinct solutions.
- If $m = 400$, then the solutions are $x = 6, 2, 5, 1$, and all 4 of them are distinct.

We can see that for $m = 400$, the equation has 4 distinct solutions. Therefore, the value of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is $m = 400$.

So the number of positive integer values of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 1. The answer is: $1$

Approach:



Let's first understand the problem. We are given a equation with absolute values and we are asked to find the values of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions. This problem involves the understanding of the number of solutions of absolute value equations.

For $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ to have 4 distinct solutions, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be less than 2 but greater than 0. This is because an absolute value equation with absolute values of absolute values has 4 distinct solutions if and only if the right side of the equation (in this case $\frac{m}{100}$) is less than the inner absolute value (in this case 2) but greater than 0. 

So we have $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which gives $0 < m < 200$. 

Now we need to find how many positive integers $m$ satisfy this inequality. 

These are the positive integers from 1 to 199, so there are 199 positive integers that are solutions. 

However, as per the question, we need the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions. 

If we think about it, for any value of $m$ from 1 to 199, the equation will have exactly 4 distinct solutions, so all these values of $m$ are solutions.

So the total number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 199.
The answer is: $\boxed{199}$.

Approach:


The number of distinct solutions of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to the number of times the graph of $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ intersects the horizontal line $y = \frac{m}{100}$. 

The graph of $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a V-shape with a minimum value of 0 at $x = 1$ and maximum value of 2 at $x = \pm 3$. 

So, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is in the interval $(0, 2]$. This is equivalent to $0 < m \leq 200$. The number of positive integers $m$ in this interval is $200$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 200. The answer is: $200$

Approach:

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is less than $2$ but greater than or equal to $0$. This gives us the inequality $0 \leq \frac{m}{100} < 2$. We can multiply all sides by $100$ to get $0 \leq m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from $1$ to $199$. We need to count how many of these integers are of the form $\frac{k}{100}$, where $k$ is an integer from $1$ to $199$. This can be done by finding how many multiples of $100$ are less than or equal to $199$. That number is $1$. So, there is only one positive integer $m$ that gives four distinct solutions to the equation, namely $m = 100$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $1$.
The answer is: 1

Approach:


The given equation has 4 distinct solutions implies that the equation $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. We can start by considering the number of times the absolute value of a quantity can be equal to a positive number. 

Let's consider the inner absolute value first, $|x - 1 - 2| = |x - 3|$, then we have $|x - 3| = \frac{m}{100}$. 
This absolute value equation will have two cases:
1) $x - 3 = \frac{m}{100}$, or 
2) $-(x - 3) = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $-x + 3 = \frac{m}{100}$.

The first equation can be rewritten as $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$, and the second equation as $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
These are the two solutions for $x$ from the innermost absolute value equation.

The outermost absolute value equation is then $|3 + \frac{m}{100} - 1 - 2| = |\frac{m}{100} - 2| = \frac{m}{100} - 2$. So we have $\frac{m}{100} - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$.

This simplifies to $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, so $m = 200$. 

Thus, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions. Therefore, the answer is $0$. 

However, this reasoning seems to have missed some cases. 

Let's reconsider the original equation $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$. The innermost absolute value $|x-3|$ can take a value between $0$ and $2$ (inclusive). When $|x - 3| = 0$, we get $x = 3$, when $|x - 3| = 2$, we get $x = 1,5$.

If we set $|x - 3| = \frac{m}{100}$ (let's call this equation 1), then for this equation to have 4 distinct solutions, it must be that $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, or equivalently, $0 < m < 200$. The integer solutions in this range are the integers from 1 to 199, which gives us 199 possible values for $m$.

Similarly, if we set $-(x - 3) = \frac{m}{100}$ (let's call this equation 2), we get $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$. For this equation to have 4 distinct solutions, it must be that $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, or equivalently, $0 < m < 200$. Again, the integer solutions in this range are the integers from 1 to 199, which gives us 199 possible values for $m$.

However, we have counted the values of $m$ twice, so to get the actual number of distinct values of $m$, we simply add the number of values from both equations and subtract the overlap. 

The overlap occurs when both equations 1 and 2 give the same value of $m$, which happens when $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, or $m = 200$. But this value is outside the range $0 < m < 200$, so it is not a valid solution.

So the number of distinct positive integer values of $m$ for which the equation $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is the sum of the number of solutions from both equations, minus the overlap, which is 199 + 199 - 0 = 398.

But this is not an option, something seems to have gone wrong in our calculations.

Let's revisit the original equation $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$. Notice that when $\frac{m}{100} < 2$, the right side is smaller than the absolute value on the left, which is always at least $2$. Therefore, $\frac{m}{100} \geq 2$, or $m \geq 200$. This means that there should be no valid values for $m$ that are less than 200. Our calculations above suggest that we have missed some cases, but this seems contradictory. 

We made an error in our reasoning. In the original equation $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$, the innermost absolute value $|x - 3|$ can take a value between $0$ and $2$ (inclusive) as we've established before. However, we cannot simply set $|x - 3| = \frac{m}{100}$ without considering the other case $-(x - 3) = \frac{m}{100}$. The equation $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ is actually equivalent to a system of four separate absolute value equations, which should give us a total of eight distinct solutions, not four. 

Let's correct our reasoning and solve it again.

When $|x - 3| = \frac{m}{100}$, we have two solutions $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
When $-(x - 3) = \frac{m}{100}$, we also have two solutions $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$. 
So the four distinct solutions of the equation $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ can be obtained from both cases.

Now we only need to find the values of $m$ for which the innermost absolute value equation $|x - 3| = \frac{m}{100}$ has two distinct solutions. This occurs when $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, or equivalently, $0 < m < 200$. The integer solutions in this range are the integers from 1 to 199, which gives us 199 possible values for $m$.

Since there is no overlap between the solutions from both cases, the number of distinct positive integer values of $m$ for which the equation $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is simply 199.

Therefore, the value of the unknown is 199.
The answer is: $199$

In this problem, we are looking for the number of positive integer values of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly four distinct solutions.

We can start by examining the case where $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. The equation becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = 2$.
Simplifying this further gives us two cases:
Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 2 \Rightarrow \vert x-1 \vert = 4$. This leads to two more cases:
Case 1.1: $x-1 = 4 \Rightarrow x = 5$, and
Case 1.2: $-(x-1) = 4 \Rightarrow x = -3$.
Case 2: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -2 \Rightarrow \vert x-1 \vert = 0$. This leads to only one case:
Case 2.1: $x-1 = 0 \Rightarrow x = 1$.

From these cases, we can see that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = 2$ has three distinct solutions: $x = -3, 1, 5$.

Now, we need to check if any other values of $m$ will result in the equation having four distinct solutions. As $m$ increases, the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, will also increase, which will result in the absolute value expression being less restrictive. This means that there will be more solutions to the equation. Conversely, as $m$ decreases, the right side of the equation will decrease, which will result in the absolute value expression being more restrictive, potentially removing solutions.

From the example of $m = 200$, the equation becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = 2$, which has the same three solutions as the case $m = 200$. On the other hand, for $m = 100$, the equation becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = 1$, which has only two distinct solutions.

Therefore, to get four distinct solutions, we must increase the value of $m$ from $200$.

As $m$ continues to increase, the right side of the equation will continue to increase, and the absolute value expression will become less restrictive, resulting in more solutions. However, there is a limit to how large $m$ can be. For example, when $m = 1000$, the right side of the equation becomes $\frac{1000}{100} = 10$, and the equation becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = 10$. This equation has only two distinct solutions: $x = -9, 11$. Therefore, the value of $m$ cannot be increased indefinitely.

From our analysis, we can conclude that the only value of $m$ that results in the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$ having four distinct solutions is $m = 200$. So there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions.
The value of this integer $m$ is $\boxed{200}$. The answer is: 200

This is a problem in the branch of mathematics called "equation solving" or "equational reasoning." Here, we are given an equation with an absolute value in it, and we want to find the values of $m$ for which the equation has exactly 4 distinct solutions.

Step 1: Draw the Graph

First, we draw the graph of the function $y = ||x - 1| - 2|$ to get an idea of what we are working with. The graph will show us that the function is a series of V-shaped steps, with the base of each step being $2$ units away from the previous step.

Step 2: Understand the Equation

Next, we consider the equation $||x - 1| - 2| = m/100$. This equation is saying that the distance between the graph and the x-axis at any point $x$ is $m/100$. We want this equation to have exactly 4 distinct solutions, meaning the graph of $y = ||x - 1| - 2|$ intersects the line $y = m/100$ exactly 4 times.

From the graph of $y = ||x - 1| - 2|$, we know that the function takes on values between $0$ and $2$ exactly $2$ times, and takes on values between $2$ and $4$ exactly $2$ times. This means for the equation to have exactly $4$ distinct solutions, the line $y = m/100$ must fall within the range $2 < y < 4$. This means $2 < m/100 < 4$, or equivalently $200 < m < 400$.

Step 3: Count the Integers

Now we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $200 < m < 400$. To do this, we simply subtract the smallest integer that is greater than $200$ from the largest integer less than $400$. The smallest integer greater than $200$ is $201$ and the largest integer less than $400$ is $399$, so the number of positive integers $m$ is $399 - 201 + 1 = 199$.

Therefore, there are 199 positive integers $m$ for which the equation $| | x - 1 | - 2 | = m/100$ has exactly four distinct solutions. The value of $m$ is 199. The answer is: $199$

1. In order for the equation $| |x-1|-2| = \frac{m}{100}$ to have 4 distinct solutions, the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must equal either 2 or 1.
2. If $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, then $m=200$. If $\frac{m}{100} = 1$, then $m=100$.
3. We need to find out how many positive integers $m$ are between 100 and 200 (inclusive) because these are the only values of $m$ that will produce 4 distinct solutions for the given equation.
4. To find the number of integers from 100 to 200, we can subtract the smallest value from the largest value and then add 1. So, the number of integers is $200 - 100 + 1 = 101$.

So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $| |x-1|-2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 101. The answer is: $101$

Approach:

 The problem is to find out how many positive integers $m$ the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. The right hand side of the equation is $\frac{m}{100}$, which is a positive fraction. The number of solutions of the equation depends on the value of $\frac{m}{100}$.

To have $4$ distinct solutions, the fraction $\frac{m}{100}$ must be such that it splits the number line into $4$ intervals in the following way:

1. When $\vert x - 1 \vert - 2 < \frac{m}{100}$, the equation becomes $\vert x - 1 \vert - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$. This means $\vert x - 1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.

2. When $\vert x - 1 \vert - 2 > -\frac{m}{100}$, the equation becomes $\vert x - 1 \vert - 2 = -\frac{m}{100}$. This means $\vert x - 1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.

For the first equation, $\vert x - 1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, we get two solutions: $x = 1 + 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = 1 - 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, or $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

For the second equation, $\vert x - 1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, we get two solutions: $x = 1 + 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = 1 - 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, or $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

To have $4$ distinct solutions, we need the two solutions of the first equation and the two solutions of the second equation to be distinct. This implies that:

- $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, which means $\frac{m}{100} \neq 0$, so $m \neq 0$.
- $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 + \frac{m}{100}$, which means $4 \neq -\frac{m}{100}$, or $400 \neq -m$. So, $m < 400$.
- $-1 - \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 + \frac{m}{100}$, which means $-\frac{m}{100} \neq \frac{m}{100}$, or $0 \neq 2m$. So, $m \neq 0$.
- $-1 - \frac{m}{100} \neq 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, which means $-1 - 3 = -4 \neq -\frac{m}{100}$, or $400 \neq -m$. So, $m < 400$.

Thus, $m$ must be a positive integer less than $400$ and $m \neq 0$. The number of such positive integers is $399$. Therefore, there are $399$ positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

The answer is: $399$.

Approach:


For a equation with the form $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$, it has 4 distinct solutions if $\frac{m}{100}=1$ or $\frac{m}{100}=3$. The reason for this is that when the right-hand side equals 1 or 3, the graph of $| |x-1|-2|$ intersect the x-axis exactly at 4 different points. If the value is less than 1 or greater than 3, the intersection would be less than 4.

Now let's solve the equation:
\[\frac{m}{100}=1 \Rightarrow m=100\]
\[\frac{m}{100}=3 \Rightarrow m=300\]

Now we check the solutions $m=100$ and $m=300$. If $m=100$, then the equation becomes $| |x-1|-2|=0.1$. This equation has only 2 solutions, not 4. If $m=300$, then the equation becomes $| |x-1|-2|=0.3$. This equation has 4 solutions.

Therefore, the only value of $m$ for which the equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions is $m=300$.

So the number of positive integers $m$ is 1. Therefore the final answer is $1$.
The answer is $\boxed{1}$
