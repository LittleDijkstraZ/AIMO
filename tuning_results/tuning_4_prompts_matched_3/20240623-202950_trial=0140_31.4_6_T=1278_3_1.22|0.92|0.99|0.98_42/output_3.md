Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

This problem involves understanding the properties of absolute value functions and how they can be used to find the area of a polygon. The equation given: $ ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$

One of the key observations from the equation is that the product of two terms is zero if and only if both terms are zero. This means that either both terms on the left or both terms on the right of the equation must be zero.

For the left term, $ ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$, this is only possible when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$.

For the right term, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, this is only possible when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$.

The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length of 10 units (from the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, which intersect at $(5,5)$), and the vertices of the square are $(8, 2), (2, 8), (-2, -8),$ and $(-8, -2)$.

The area of the square is side length squared, which in this case is $10^2 = 100$.
So, the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points $\left(x, y\right)$ is $100$. The answer is: $100$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

The expression given in the problem is equal to zero if and only if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, or both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
For the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x = 0$ and $y = 0$, so the only point that satisfies this case is the origin $(0,0)$.
For the second case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = 8$ or $x = -8$, and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. This gives us four points: $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.
Plotting these four points, we find that they form a square with side length $16$. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
So the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points is 256. The answer is: $\boxed{256}$

Approach:



The equation $AB=0$ implies that either $A=0$ or $B=0$. So, we either have $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

In the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us four lines in the coordinate plane: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. The intersection of these lines form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

In the second case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us four lines in the coordinate plane: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. The intersection of these lines form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

However, the square formed by the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$ is completely contained inside the square formed by the lines $x + y = 10$, $x - y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, and $x - y = -10$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of the square formed by the lines $x + y = 10$, $x - y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, and $x - y = -10$, which is 100 square units.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units. The answer is: $100$

Approach:

 The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero, which means either one of the expressions should be zero. Let's consider these two cases separately.

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
For the sum of two squares to be zero, both squares should be zero. So we have:
$\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$
This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$
Solving these we get the lines $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. These lines form a square with side length 10 units.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
Similarly, this implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives the lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. These lines form a square with side length 16 units.

The area of the polygon formed by the intersection of the points satisfying these conditions is the area of the square formed by the intersection of the two squares. This intersection forms a smaller square with side length 10 units (because the lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$ intersect the lines $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$ at the points where the lines are at a distance of 10 units from the origin).

The area of a square is given by side length squared, so the area of this smaller square is $10^2 = 100$ square units.
The answer is: $100$

Approach:


This equation is satisfied if any of the factors on the left-hand side is zero. Thus, we have four cases to consider:
1. $|x + y| - 10 = 0 \Rightarrow |x + y| = 10$.
2. $|x - y| - 10 = 0 \Rightarrow |x - y| = 10$.
3. $|x| - 8 = 0 \Rightarrow |x| = 8$.
4. $|y| - 8 = 0 \Rightarrow |y| = 8$.
The solutions for each case are:
1. $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
2. $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
3. $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
4. $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.
The points satisfying these conditions form a square with side length $16$. Thus, the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

The answer is: $\boxed{256}$

Given the equation: $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$

This equation equals to zero when either of the two expressions inside the product equals zero. This gives us two separate cases:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For Case 1, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$. The lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$ form a rectangle.

For Case 2, either $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. The lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$ and $y = -8$ form a square.

The intersection of the rectangle and the square forms a smaller square whose side length is 6 (the difference between the lengths of the rectangle and the square). Therefore, the area of this convex polygon is $6^2 = 36$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 36 square units. The answer is: $36$

Approach:

 The equation of the problem can be interpreted as the product of two terms being zero, meaning that one of them must be zero. Therefore, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. The first term being zero means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The second term being zero means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. 

For $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, we get four lines in the coordinate plane which form a square with side length 10. The area of the square is $10^2 = 100$.

For $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, we get four lines in the coordinate plane which form a square with side length 8. The area of the square is $8^2 = 64$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon formed by the intersection of these two squares is the sum of their areas, which is $100 + 64 = 164$. So the area of the convex polygon is 164.

The answer is: $164$.

Approach:


The equation given in the problem is a product of two equations equal to zero. So either the first equation is zero or the second equation is zero.
Let's consider the first equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This equation is equal to zero if and only if both terms inside the square are zero. This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

Similarly, for the second equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, it is equal to zero if and only if both terms inside the square are zero. This implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

Solving the above equations, we get:
For $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, the possible solutions are $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines are the sides of the square formed by the vertices $(10,0)$, $(-10,0)$, $(0,10)$, and $(0,-10)$.

For $\vert x \vert = 8$, the possible solutions are $x = 8$ and $x = -8$. Similarly, for $\vert y \vert = 8$, the possible solutions are $y = 8$ and $y = -8$. This forms a square with side length 16, centered at the origin $(0,0)$.

The intersection of the two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for. To find the area of this polygon, we just need to find the area of the smaller square.

The side length of the smaller square is the minimum of the distances from the origin to the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, which can be found using the distance formula.

The distance from the origin to the line $x + y = 10$ is $\frac{|0+0-10|}{\sqrt{1^2+1^2}} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{2}} = 5\sqrt{2}$. Similarly, the distance from the origin to the line $x - y = 10$ is also $5\sqrt{2}$.

So the side length of the smaller square is $5\sqrt{2}$.

The area of the smaller square is $(5\sqrt{2})^2 = 50$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 50 square units.
The answer is: $50$

Approach:


The equation given is a product of two terms, so either of them must be zero for the entire product to be zero. This means we can solve two separate equations:
1. $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$
2. $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$

From the first equation: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. 
Solving these absolute value equations gives us the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length 10. The area of the square is $10^2 = 100$.

From the second equation: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. 
Solving these absolute value equations gives us the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

However, the only points that satisfy both equations are the vertices of the smaller square, which are also vertices of the larger square. Therefore, the area of the polygon formed by these points is the area of the smaller square, which is 100. 

So the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$
