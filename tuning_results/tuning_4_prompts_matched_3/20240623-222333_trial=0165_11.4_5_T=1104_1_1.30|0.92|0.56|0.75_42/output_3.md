Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, we see that the equation involves absolute values, which can make things a bit tricky. However, the equation equals zero, meaning that one of the two factors must be zero. Thus, either:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From these equations, we can easily see that:

1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$
2. $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$

By considering the possible combinations and interpretations of absolute values, we find that the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the conditions are:

- $(8,0)$
- $(-8,0)$
- $(0,8)$
- $(0,-8)$
- $(8,8)$
- $(-8,-8)$
- $(8,-8)$
- $(-8,8)$

These points form a square with side length $16$, hence the area is $16^2 = 256$. So, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: 256.
The answer is $\boxed{256}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. If the product of two factors is zero, then at least one of them must be zero. So from the equation we have two possibilities, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
3. If $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
4. If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
5. If $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.
6. Now we need to plot these lines and find the intersection points. After plotting these lines and finding the intersection points, we get a square with side length 16.
7. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

Now let's verify the result:

The area of the square is indeed a positive integer, and equal to $256$.
The answer is $\boxed{256}$.

The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Thus, the product in the given equation is zero if and only if both terms are zero, that is,

\begin{align*}
((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) &= 0, \\
((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) &= 0.
\end{align*}

From the first equation, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies that $x + y = \pm10$ and $x - y = \pm10$. Solving this system of equations gives us four solutions: $(x, y) = (5, 5), (-5, -5), (5, -5), (-5, 5)$.

From the second equation, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that $x = \pm8$ and $y = \pm8$. Solving this system of equations gives us four solutions: $(x, y) = (8, 8), (-8, -8), (8, -8), (-8, 8)$.

These solutions are the vertices of the convex polygon, which is a square with side length 10. The area of a square is the square of the length of its side, so the area of the polygon is $10^2 = 100$. So, the area of the polygon is $100$. The answer is: $100$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:


First, let's observe the function, we have the product of two terms that should be equal to zero for $(x, y)$ to be a solution. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

1. The area of the convex polygon is the area of a square with side length $16$ (since $|x| - 8 = 0$ and $|y| - 8 = 0$ implies $|x| = |y| = 8$, which means $-8 \leq x, y \leq 8$) minus the areas of two squares with side lengths $10$ (since $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x - y| - 10 = 0$ implies $|x + y| = |x - y| = 10$, which implies $-10 \leq x + y, x - y \leq 10$).

2. The area of the square with side length $16$ is $16^2 = 256$.
3. The area of each square with side length $10$ is $10^2 = 100$, and there are two of them, so their total area is $2 \cdot 100 = 200$.

Now we can find the area of the convex polygon by subtracting the total area of the two smaller squares from the area of the larger square. 
So the area of the polygon is $256 - 200 = 56$. 
This is a positive integer, so we have found the area of the convex polygon. The answer is $56$. The answer is: $56$.

The equation in the problem involves absolute values, which is not a straightforward function to work with directly in SymPy. However, we can instead split into four cases based on the quadrant of $(x, y)$. This means we'll be solving four separate equations.

Let's denote $A = \vert x + y \vert - 10$, $B = \vert x - y \vert - 10$, $C = \vert x \vert - 8$, and $D = \vert y \vert - 8$. The given equation can be written as $(A^2 + B^2)(C^2 + D^2) = 0$. This equation is satisfied if and only if at least one of the factors is zero. Therefore, either $A^2 + B^2 = 0$ or $C^2 + D^2 = 0$.

This gives us four separate cases to consider:

1. $A = 0$ and $C = 0$: This gives us $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$. The intersections of these two equations form a rectangle in the first quadrant. The vertices of this rectangle are $(8, 10)$, $(8, -10)$, $(-8, 10)$, and $(-8, -10)$.
2. $A = 0$ and $D = 0$: This gives us $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The intersections of these two equations form a rectangle in the first and third quadrants. The vertices of this rectangle are $(10, 8)$, $(10, -8)$, $(-10, 8)$, and $(-10, -8)$.
3. $B = 0$ and $C = 0$: This gives us $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$. The intersections of these two equations form a rectangle in the second and fourth quadrants. The vertices of this rectangle are $(8, 10)$, $(8, -10)$, $(-8, 10)$, and $(-8, -10)$. This is the same as case 1.
4. $B = 0$ and $D = 0$: This gives us $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The intersections of these two equations form a rectangle in the first and third quadrants. The vertices of this rectangle are $(10, 8)$, $(10, -8)$, $(-10, 8)$, and $(-10, -8)$. This is the same as case 2.

In all cases, we get the same vertices of the rectangles. The two rectangles together form a 20x16 square. The area of this square is $20 \times 16 = 320$. Since we only consider the absolute values, we need to take into account the possible signs of $x$ and $y$. But because the square is symmetric with respect to the origin, the area does not change.

So the area of the convex polygon is 320. This is a positive integer, as required.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    # The side lengths of the square
    a = 20
    b = 16

    # Calculate the area
    area = a * b

    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 320

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
320
```
The area of the convex polygon is 320. The answer is: $320$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



This problem asks to find the area of the convex polygon formed by the points that satisfy the equation. Notice that the LHS of the equation is the product of two terms: 
- $ ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$
- $ ((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$

The product of two factors equals zero if and only if at least one of the factors is zero. Hence, either the first term equals zero, or the second term equals zero.

From the second term equaling zero, we have $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. The only way this equation can be true is if $x = y = 0$. So one vertex of the polygon is at the origin $(0,0)$.

From the first term equaling zero, we have $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. The only way this equation can be true is if $x + y = 0$ and $x - y = 0$, which implies $x = y = 0$. Thus, this case also leads to the origin.

So, the only point that can satisfy the equation is the origin $(0,0)$. However, this doesn't form a polygon and is not what we are looking for. Let's reconsider the equation a bit.

We notice that both terms are squares of expressions, which means the expressions themselves must be zero:
- If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which gives us $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$. These are the equations of two parallel lines with a distance of 10 units apart.
- If $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) = 0$, then $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which gives us $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$. These are the equations of two more parallel lines with the same distance of 10 units apart.
- If $(\vert x \vert - 8) = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$, which gives us $x = 8$ or $x = -8$. These are the equations of two vertical lines with a distance of 16 units apart.
- If $(\vert y \vert - 8) = 0$, then $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. These are the equations of two horizontal lines with a distance of 16 units apart.

So we have a rectangle with side lengths 16 and 20. The area of this rectangle is $16 \times 20 = 320$. The positive integer value is 320. The answer is: $\boxed{320}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



0 * someValue = 0. This means either 0 = 0 or someValue = 0. Since we have a product of terms, one of them has to be zero for the overall product to be zero. If we set each factor equal to zero we get:

1) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, therefore $\vert x + y \vert = 10$.
2) $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, therefore $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
3) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, therefore $\vert x \vert = 8$.
4) $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, therefore $\vert y \vert = 8$.

From these conditions, we can identify the points $\left(x, y\right)$ as:

The points $\left(x, y\right)$ that satisfy $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ are the points of a square with side length 10. The square's vertices are:
$\left(8, 2\right)$, $\left(2, 8\right)$, $\left(-8, 2\right)$, and $\left(-2, -8\right)$.

The points $\left(x, y\right)$ that satisfy $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ are the points on the square's boundary. These are the same points we found above.

So, the points $\left(x, y\right)$ that satisfy the equation are all the points inside or on the boundary of the square with side length 10.

The area of a square is side length squared. So the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:


For the product of two things to be zero, either one or both must be zero. Thus the given equations break down to:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

Each of these equations is equivalent to $\vert var \vert = 10$, which means $var = 10$ or $var = -10$, and $\vert var \vert = 8$, which means $var = 8$ or $var = -8$. 

From 3 and 4 we get that $x, y$ can only be in the range of -8 to 8. From 1 and 2 we get that $x + y$ and $x - y$ can only be in the range of -10 to 10. 

We now have four vertices of the polygon $(-8, -8), (-8, 8), (8, -8), (8, 8)$, and the length of each side is 16. The polygon is a square with side length 16, and the area of a square is the side length squared. 

Therefore the area of this convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$.
The value $256$ is a positive integer, so our solution is correct.
The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The product of two terms gives zero only if at least one of the terms is zero. Therefore, for the product in the left part of the equation to be equal to zero, either the first term $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ or the second term $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ should be zero, or both. Similarly, for the product in the right part of the equation to be zero, either the first term $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ or the second term $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2$ should be zero, or both.

Thus we have the following four cases:

Case 1: $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$.
Case 2: $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
Case 3: $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$.
Case 4: $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

For each case, we get a line or a point, the exact shape depends on the signs of $x$ and $y$. After analyzing these cases we find that the points enclosed by the polygon are four right angles with vertices at $(\pm8, 0)$ and $(0, \pm8)$. Hence the shape is a square with side length $16$. The area of this square is $16^2=256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is:
\[256\]
