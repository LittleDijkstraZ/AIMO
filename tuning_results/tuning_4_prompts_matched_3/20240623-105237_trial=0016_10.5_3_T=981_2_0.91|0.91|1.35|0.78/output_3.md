Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression equals zero if either of the two factors equals zero.
The first factor equals zero if $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$,
which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
These equations represent the equations of two lines in the $xy$-plane.
Similarly, the second factor equals zero if $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$,
which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
These equations represent the equations of two lines in the $xy$-plane.
The intersection of these lines form a square with side length 16.
The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The expression equals zero if either of the two factors equals zero.

The first factor equals zero when $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$.
This means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
These are the equations of two squares in the coordinate plane.

The second factor equals zero when $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.
This means $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
These are the equations of two squares in the coordinate plane.

The intersection of these squares is a square with side length 8.
The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$.
So the area of the convex polygon is 64 square units.
The answer is: $64$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ equals to zero if and only if at least one of the factors equals to zero.
The first factor equals to zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
The second factor equals to zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The equations $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$ describe the boundaries of the square with side length 16 centered at the origin.
Therefore, the points satisfying the given equation are the points inside this square.
Hence, the area of the convex polygon is equal to the area of this square, which is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So, the given equation is zero if and only if either
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$$
or
$$((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$
The first equation is zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8,2)$, $(8,-2)$, $(-8,2)$, and $(-8,-2)$.

The second equation is zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

The intersection of these two squares is the required polygon. The polygon is a square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$, because the distance between $(8,2)$ and $(8,-2)$ is $4$ (in the $y$-direction) plus $6$ (in the $x$-direction) using the Pythagorean theorem. Therefore, the area of the polygon is $(10\sqrt{2})^2 = 200$. The answer is: $200$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is true if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The first two equations are satisfied if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The third and fourth equations are satisfied if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The equations $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ define a square with side length 10. The equations $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ define a square with side length 16.

Therefore, the points $\left(x, y\right)$ that satisfy the given equation are those that lie on the square with side length 10 or the square with side length 16. The convex polygon formed by these points is the intersection of these two squares, which is another square with side length 10.

The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $A \cdot B = 0$ implies that at least one of the factors is zero. So, we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these equations are all the points in a square with side length 20 centered at the origin.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are all the points in a square with side length 16 centered at the origin.

The intersection of these two cases is the square with side length 16. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two lines in the plane, forming a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two lines in the plane, forming a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

However, the two squares intersect in a larger square with side length 8, which has an area of $8^2 = 64$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points satisfying the given equation is the sum of the areas of the two squares minus the area of the smaller square: $100 + 256 - 64 = 292$.
The answer is: $292$.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to 0 if and only if at least one of the factors is equal to 0.
This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
For the first factor to be equal to 0, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
These equations imply that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.
Solving these equations, we find that the points that satisfy these conditions are $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, and $(-5,-5)$.
For the second factor to be equal to 0, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
Solving these equations, we find that the points that satisfy these conditions are $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.
Plotting these points, we see that they form a square with side length 10.
The area of this square is $10 \times 10 = 100$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: 100

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if and only if at least one of the factors is zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which means that $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ or $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$. Solving these equations, we get that the points that satisfy this condition are $(10, 0)$ and $(0, 10)$.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So the points that satisfy this condition are $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

These points form a square with side length $10$. Therefore, the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$
