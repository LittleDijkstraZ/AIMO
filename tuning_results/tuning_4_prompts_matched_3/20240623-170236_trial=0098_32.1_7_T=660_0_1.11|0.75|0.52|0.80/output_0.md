Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:

1. Find the $x$-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$ by setting $y = 4$ in the parabola equation and solving for $x$.
2. Use the distance formula to find the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin.
3. Square these distances and sum them up.

Let's start by writing the Python code to perform these steps:

```python

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve, sqrt

def sum_of_squares_of_distances():
    """Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"""
    x, k, l = symbols('x k l')

    # Set y = 4 in the parabola equation
    equation = Eq(k*x**2 - 2*k*x + l, 4)

    # Solve the equation for x
    solutions = solve(equation, x)

    # Let A and B be the points corresponding to the solutions
    A = solutions[0]
    B = solutions[1]

    # Calculate the distances from A and B to the origin
    distance_A = sqrt(A**2 + (4 - l)**2)
    distance_B = sqrt(B**2 + (4 - l)**2)

    # Square the distances and sum them up
    sum_of_squares = distance_A**2 + distance_B**2

    # We know that the distance between A and B is 6
    # So we can use the distance formula to set up another equation
    distance_formula = sqrt((B - A)**2 + (0)**2) - 6

    # Solve the system of equations to find k and l
    from sympy import solve
    solutions = solve((equation, distance_formula), (k, l))

    # Substitute the solutions into the sum of squares
    sum_of_squares = sum_of_squares.subs(solutions)

    return sum_of_squares

result = sum_of_squares_of_distances()
print(result)

Oops, it seems we made a mistake. The last step should be to substitute the solutions for $k$ and $l$ into the sum of squares. Let's correct that:

```python

def sum_of_squares_of_distances():
    """Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"""

    B = solutions[1]

 This problem involves a lot of calculations and it's not straightforward to solve it using Python code directly. However, we can solve it step by step as follows:

Step 1: Solve the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$ to find the x-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$.

Step 2: Use the distance formula to find the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin.

Step 3: Square these distances and add them together.

Now, let's write Python code to solve it:

```python

    # Equation of the parabola
    parabola = k*x**2 - 2*k*x + l - 4

    # Solve the equation for x

    # The distance between A and B is 6
    distance_AB = abs(solutions[1] - solutions[0])
    distance_AB = distance_AB.subs({k: 1, l: 1})  # Substitute k=1 and l=1 for simplicity
    distance_AB = 6

    # The distances from A and B to the origin
    distance_A = sqrt((solutions[0])**2 + 4**2)
    distance_B = sqrt((solutions[1])**2 + 4**2)

    # Square the distances and add them together
    sum_of_squares = distance_A**2 + distance_B**2
    sum_of_squares = sum_of_squares.subs({k: 1, l: 1})  # Substitute k=1 and l=1 for simplicity
