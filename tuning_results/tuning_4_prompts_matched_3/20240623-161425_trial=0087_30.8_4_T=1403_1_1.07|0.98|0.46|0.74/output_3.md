Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation given is a product of two equations equal to zero. Hence, either of the two equations must be zero for the entire expression to become zero. This gives us two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

In both cases, the equations of the form $(\vert a \vert - b)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert a \vert = b$ or $a = b$ or $a = -b$. Hence, we have:

Case 1: $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$
Case 2: $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$

Solving each of these cases for absolute values, we get various lines and squares which enclose a convex polygon when intersected.

The lines in case 1 are: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length 10 units. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$ square units.

The lines in case 2 are: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length 16 units. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$ square units.

However, the two squares intersect in a smaller square formed by the lines $x = \pm8$ and $y = \pm8$. The side length of this square is 8 units, and its area is $8^2 = 64$ square units.

To find the total area of the convex polygon, we need to find the sum of the areas of the two squares and subtract the area of the smaller square that they share. So the total area is $100 + 256 - 64 = 292$ square units.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $292$ square units.

So the answer is: $292$.

1. The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, which means either of the expressions must be zero.

2. Let's set each expression to zero and solve the equations:

   - For $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, this implies $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
   
   - For $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, this implies $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
   
   - For $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$, this implies $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
   
   - For $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert y \vert = 8$, this implies $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

3. By solving these equations, we find the vertices of the polygon:
   - For $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, we get $x = 10$ and $y = 0$.
   - For $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$, we get $x = -10$ and $y = 0$.
   - For $x = 8$ and $x - y = 10$, we get $x = 8$ and $y = -2$.
   - For $x = 8$ and $x - y = -10$, we get $x = 8$ and $y = 18$.
   - For $x = -8$ and $x + y = 10$, we get $x = -8$ and $y = 18$.
   - For $x = -8$ and $x + y = -10$, we get $x = -8$ and $y = -2$.

4. The vertices of the polygon are $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(8, -2)$, $(8, 18)$, $(-8, 18)$, and $(-8, -2)$.

5. Plot the points on a graph and observe that the vertices form a square with side length 20.

6. The area of the square is the side length squared, which is $20^2 = 400$.

The area of the convex polygon is 400. The answer is: $400$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The function equals $0$ when either of the factors equals $0$.

1. The first factor equals $0$ when $|x + y| = 10$ or $|x - y| = 10$. These are the equations of two circles in the plane.

2. The second factor equals $0$ when $|x| = 8$ or $|y| = 8$. These are the equations of four more circles in the plane.

These eight circles enclose the polygon. The intersections of the circles are the vertices of the polygon. To find the area of the polygon, we first need to find the coordinates of these vertices.

```python

def find_vertices():
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    eq2 = Eq(Abs(x - y), 10)
    eq3 = Eq(Abs(x), 8)
    eq4 = Eq(Abs(y), 8)

    # Solve the system of equations
    solutions = solve((eq1, eq3), (x, y)) + solve((eq1, eq4), (x, y)) + solve((eq2, eq3), (x, y)) + solve((eq2, eq4), (x, y))

The vertices of the polygon are:
$(-8, -2)$, $(-8, 18)$, $(8, -18)$, $(8, 2)$, $(-18, 8)$, $(-2, -8)$, $(2, 8)$, $(18, -8)$, $(-8, -18)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(8, 18)$, $(-18, -8)$, $(-2, 8)$, $(2, -8)$, $(18, 8)$.

We can see that there are 16 vertices, forming a $8 \times 8$ square. The area of the polygon is the area of the square, which is $8^2 = 64$.

The area of the polygon is 64 square units.
The answer is: $64$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The product of two numbers is zero if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

Let's analyze the first case for both:

For $\vert x + y \vert = 10$:
If $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, then $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. The four points are $(\pm 8, 8)$, $(\pm 8, -8)$, $(8, \pm 8)$, and $(-8, \pm 8)$. These points form a square with side length $16$.

For $\vert x - y \vert = 10$:
If $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, then $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. The four points are $(\pm 8, 8)$, $(\pm 8, -8)$, $(8, \pm 8)$, and $(-8, \pm 8)$. These points form a square with side length $16$.

Now let's analyze the second case for both:

For $\vert x + y \vert = 10$:
If $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, then the maximum value of $\vert x \vert$ and $\vert y \vert$ is $10$, which is not possible because $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

For $\vert x - y \vert = 10$:
If $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, then the maximum value of $\vert x \vert$ and $\vert y \vert$ is $10$, which is not possible because $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

Therefore, the points that satisfy the equation are the same for both cases, and they form a square with side length $16$. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is $256$. Since we obtained a positive integer, the answer is valid. The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We have the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. According to the rule of multiplication, this equation will be zero if and only if either of the two multiplicands is zero. So, we have two cases:

Case 1: $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$.
This implies that both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which further simplifies to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

Case 2: $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
This implies that both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which further simplifies to $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

2. Solving these cases, we get:
For case 1:
$\vert x + y \vert = 10$ gives $x + y = \pm 10$.
$\vert x - y \vert = 10$ gives $x - y = \pm 10$.
The solutions of these two equations are four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

For case 2:
$\vert x \vert = 8$ gives $x = \pm 8$.
$\vert y \vert = 8$ gives $y = \pm 8$.
The solutions of these two equations are four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

3. The intersection of these eight lines forms a square with side length 16.

4. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

The answer is: $256$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation contains absolute values, which makes it difficult to solve it directly. However, the product of two terms equals zero if and only if at least one of them is zero. That means we can solve two separate systems of equations:
1) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
2) $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For each of these systems, from the equations $(\vert u \vert - a)^2 = 0$, we can deduce that $|u| = a$ and thus $u = a$ or $u = -a$. Applying this to each equation in the system, we can narrow it down to four separate systems:
1) $x + y = 10$ and $x = 8$
2) $x + y = -10$ and $x = 8$
3) $x - y = 10$ and $y = 8$
4) $x - y = -10$ and $y = 8$

Solving these systems, we find the vertices of the polygon:
1) $(8, 2)$
2) $(8, -22)$
3) $(18, 8)$
4) $(-2, 8)$

The vertices of the polygon are $(8, 2)$, $(8, -22)$, $(18, 8)$, and $(-2, 8)$. This polygon is a rectangle, with side lengths $20$ and $16$, so its area is $20 \times 16 = 320$. Therefore, the area of the polygon is $320$.
The answer is: $320$

Assistant:

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:


The equation is $0 \times ((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ or $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$.

If $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
If $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.

Now let's solve these four systems of equations:

1. $x = 8, y = 8$
2. $x = 8, y = -8$
3. $x = -8, y = 8$
4. $x = -8, y = -8$

1. From $x + y = 10$, we get $16 = 10$, a contradiction. So this system has no solution.
2. From $x - y = 10$, we get $0 = 0$, which is true. So this system has the solution $x = 8, y = -8$.
3. From $x + y = -10$, we get $0 = 0$, which is true. So this system has the solution $x = -8, y = 8$.
4. From $x - y = -10$, we get $0 = 0$, which is true. So this system has the solution $x = -8, y = -8$.

Thus, the four vertices of the polygon are $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

This forms a square with side length 16, and its area is $16^2 = 256$.
Since the area is a positive integer, the final answer is 256. The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation provided is a product of two terms equal to zero, which means either term has to equal zero. Now, let's look at each term separately.

For the first term: $|x + y| - 10 = 0 \Rightarrow |x + y| = 10$
$|x - y| - 10 = 0 \Rightarrow |x - y| = 10$

For the second term: $|x| - 8 = 0 \Rightarrow |x| = 8 \Rightarrow x = 8 \text{ or } x = -8$
$|y| - 8 = 0 \Rightarrow |y| = 8 \Rightarrow y = 8 \text{ or } y = -8$

The system of equations involving absolute value can be solved graphically as four equations where $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$ and $y = -8$. The graph shows four right triangles with sides equal to 16. The area of each triangle is 1/2 * base * height = 1/2 * 16 * 16 = 128.

So the total area of the polygon is $4 * 128 = 512$. The answer is: $512$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation provided is a product of two terms equals zero: $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. This product equals zero when either term equals zero. 

Let's consider the cases separately.

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
This equation is fulfilled only when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm10$ and $x - y = \pm10$. Solving these equations gives us four lines in the $xy$-plane: $y = -x \pm 10$, $y = x \pm 10$. These lines form a square with side length $20$ and area $400$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This equation is fulfilled only when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm8$ and $y = \pm8$. So we have four more lines $x = \pm8$ and $y = \pm8$ in the $xy$-plane. These lines also form a square with side length $16$ and area $256$.

Now we have two squares with areas $400$ and $256$. The area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of these two squares, which is $400 + 256 = 656$. 
The answer is: 656

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



We have a system of equations from the given equation:
\[(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0\]
\[(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0\]

From these equations, we can deduce that:

\[\vert x + y \vert = 10, \vert x - y \vert = 10, \vert x \vert = 8, \vert y \vert = 8\]

So we have 4 cases to consider:

1. $x + y = 10, x - y = 10, x = 8, y = 8$. Solving this system gives $x = 10, y = 0$.
2. $x + y = 10, x - y = 10, x = -8, y = -8$. Solving this system gives $x = 0, y = 10$.
3. $x + y = -10, x - y = -10, x = 8, y = 8$. Solving this system gives $x = -10, y = 0$.
4. $x + y = -10, x - y = -10, x = -8, y = -8$. Solving this system gives $x = 0, y = -10$.

These solutions represent the vertices of the square with side length 10 units. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.
So the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{100}$.
The answer is: $100$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

To accomplish this:
- List the variables and known values from the problem.
- Outline the steps using sympy to solve the problem:
  * Identify the sympy functions required for each step.
  * Implement these functions step-by-step, commenting each line for clarity.
- Calculate the final answer and verify it's a positive integer.
- Output the result within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation in the problem is a product of two terms equal to zero, which means either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. We can write this as two separate cases:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.

This means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
The solutions to these equations are the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

This means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The solutions to these equations are the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 10 (the distance between the parallel lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$, or $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$).

The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 100.

This is a positive integer, as required.
The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:


The polygon is determined by the solutions of the equation:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$
In this product, if any term equals zero, the whole product equals zero.
This gives us the following four cases:
1) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$,
2) $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$,
3) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or
4) $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
These cases give the following solution sets:
1) $\vert x + y \vert = 10$,
2) $\vert x - y \vert = 10$,
3) $\vert x \vert = 8$, or
4) $\vert y \vert = 8$.
These equations describe a square with side length $16$,
so the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units.
The answer is: $256$
