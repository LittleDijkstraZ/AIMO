 To solve this problem, we first need to understand the graph of the equation $| |x-1|-2|$ and how many times it intersects the horizontal line $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$. 

Let's start by drawing the graph of $| |x-1|-2|$. We can see that the graph is a series of V-shapes with the vertices at $x=1-2= -1, x=1, x=1+2=3$. The height of the V-shapes is $2$ units.

Next, we need to find for how many values of $m$ the graph intersects the horizontal line $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ at $4$ distinct points. The line $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ is just a horizontal line at a distance of $\frac{m}{100}$ from the x-axis.

We can see that the graph of $| |x-1|-2|$ intersects the horizontal line at $4$ distinct points when the line is at a distance of $2-0=2$ units above or below the x-axis. This happens when $\frac{m}{100}=2$, or $m=200$.

So, there is only one value of $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions. Therefore, the number of such positive integers $m$ is $1$.
The answer is: $1$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"

Assistant:

 We can solve this problem by analyzing the number of solutions of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.
The left-hand side of the equation is the distance between $x$ and $1$, and the distance between $x$ and $1$ is always non-negative. Therefore, the right-hand side must also be non-negative, which implies that $m$ must be an integer in the range $0 \leq m \leq 200$.
Now we need to find for how many values of $m$ in this range the equation has $4$ distinct solutions. 
For each value of $m$, we can analyze the number of solutions by considering the cases for the absolute values in the equation. There are four cases to consider:
1. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2=\frac{m}{100}$, then $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. This gives two more cases:
   a. If $x-1=2 + \frac{m}{100}$, then $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.
   b. If $-(x-1)=2 + \frac{m}{100}$, then $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.
2. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2=-\frac{m}{100}$, then $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. This gives two more cases:
   a. If $x-1=2 - \frac{m}{100}$, then $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
   b. If $-(x-1)=2 - \frac{m}{100}$, then $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.
For the equation to have four distinct solutions, we need exactly two of these four solutions to be real. We can analyze this by checking the values of $m$ in the range $0 \leq m \leq 200$.
We find that $m = 100$ is the only value of $m$ for which the equation has exactly four distinct solutions. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the given condition is 1. The answer is: $1$

 The given equation is $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. The right-hand side, $\frac{m}{100}$, is a positive number because $m$ is a positive integer. The number of distinct solutions of the equation depends on the value of $\frac{m}{100}$, because the absolute value function splits into different cases depending on the value of its argument.

The equation has four distinct solutions when the expression on the left has a double-well potential shape, which means $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly less than 2 but strictly greater than 0. This corresponds to $0<m<200$. 

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy this condition is $199$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def number_of_m():
    """For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"""
    m_values = range(1, 200)  # The range of m values from 1 to 199
    return len(m_values)

result = number_of_m()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 199

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
199
```
The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is $\boxed{199}$. The answer is: $199$

Assistant:

 To solve this problem, let's first understand what the equation is asking for. The equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has 4 distinct solutions. This means that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ can take on the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ exactly 4 times.

The expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a piecewise function of $x$. It takes on the value of $2-x$ when $x\leq 1$, $-(x-1)-2=-x-1$ when $1<x\leq 3$, $2-(x-1)=3-x$ when $3<x$.

By graphing these functions and noticing that they are mirror images of each other, we see that $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ falls between the "valleys" of the function (the "mountains" are not counted because $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert\geq 0$).

From the graph, we can see that $\frac{m}{100}$ must fall between 1 and 2, inclusive. Therefore, $1 \leq \frac{m}{100} \leq 2$, which implies that $100 \leq m \leq 200$. 

However, $m$ must be a positive integer. So, the positive integers $m$ that satisfy the given condition are those in the set $\{100, 101, \ldots, 200\}$. 

Therefore, the number of such positive integers $m$ is $101$.

In the python language, the solution can be implemented as following:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def count_positive_integers():
    return len(range(100, 201))

result = count_positive_integers()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 101

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
101
```
The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is $\boxed{101}$. The answer is $\boxed{101}$.

Assistant:


To solve this problem, let's first understand that the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ will have 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100} = 2$ since $| |x - 1| - 2|$ will be greater than $2$ for values of $x$ that make $|x - 1|$ greater than $4$ and hence make $| |x - 1| - 2|$ less than $2$. Similarly, $| |x - 1| - 2|$ will be less than $2$ for values of $x$ that make $|x - 1|$ less than $0$ and hence make $| |x - 1| - 2|$ greater than $2$.

Therefore, if we set $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, we find that $m = 200$.

So, there is $1$ positive integer $m$ that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions. Our answer is $1$. 

Here is a Python solution:
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def number_of_m():
    """For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"""
    m = 200
    return 1

result = number_of_m()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 1

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
1
```
The number of positive integers $m$ is $1$. The answer is: $1$
