Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two terms, and it equals zero, which implies that at least one of the terms must be zero. This further implies that each term must be zero separately. So we have:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which gives $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, or $x + y = \pm 10$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which gives $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, or $x - y = \pm 10$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which gives $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $x = \pm 8$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which gives $\vert y \vert = 8$, or $y = \pm 8$.

These equations describe a square with vertices at $\left(8, 8\right)$, $\left(8, -8\right)$, $\left(-8, -8\right)$, and $\left(-8, 8\right)$. The side length of the square is $16$ units. The area of a square is given by the square of its side length, so the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $\boxed{256}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 This problem can be solved step by step as follows:

A product equals zero if and only if at least one of the factors equals zero. Therefore, the equation 
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0\]is satisfied if either of the following two conditions hold:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first condition to hold, we need $|x+y|=10$ and $|x-y|=10$. The solution set to these two equations forms a square with side length 10 and vertices $(\pm 10,0)$ and $(0,\pm 10)$.
For the second condition to hold, we need $|x|=8$ and $|y|=8$. The solution set to these two equations forms a square with side length 16 and vertices $(\pm 8,0)$ and $(0,\pm 8)$.

The two squares intersect at the origin $(0,0)$. The union of these two squares forms a larger square with side length 16 and thus area $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points that satisfy the given equation is 256.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The problem states that the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ enclose a convex polygon, and we are asked to find the area of this polygon. 

Since the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero, the equation is satisfied if either of the following conditions holds:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. At least one of the terms $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2$ is zero.

From condition 1, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $-8 \leq x, y \leq 8$.

From condition 2, if any of the terms is zero, then we will have the same conditions as in condition 1.

So the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the given equation are those in the square with vertices at $(\pm 8, \pm 8)$. The side length of this square is $16$, so its area is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is $\boxed{256}$.
