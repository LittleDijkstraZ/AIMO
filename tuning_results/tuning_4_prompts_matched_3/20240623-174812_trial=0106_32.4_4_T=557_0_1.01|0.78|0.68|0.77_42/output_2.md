 The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

Let's consider the equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$. This equation has four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 1$. This is because the expression $| |x - 1| - 2 |$ is equal to 1 in four intervals of $x$.

So we have $\frac{m}{100} = 1$, which implies $m = 100$. Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions, and that is $m = 100$.
The answer is: $100$

 To solve this problem, we need to understand the behavior of the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$.
The function $f(x)$ has a V-shape with the vertex at $x=1$.
The value of $f(x)$ is 2 when $x<1$, 1 when $1 \le x <3$, and 2 when $x \ge 3$.
The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is in the interval $(0, 1]$.
This means $0 < \frac{m}{100} \le 1$, so $0 < m \le 100$.
Therefore, there are 100 positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions. The answer is: $100$

 The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

First, let's consider the equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$.
This equation has 4 distinct solutions if and only if the right-hand side $\frac{m}{100}$ is between 1 and 2.
This is because $| |x - 1| - 2 |$ can take on any value between 0 and 2, and we want it to be exactly equal to $\frac{m}{100}$.
So, we have $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$.

Multiplying all parts of the inequality by 100, we get $100 < m < 200$.

The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from 101 to 199, inclusive.

To find the number of these integers, we can subtract the smallest value from the largest value and add 1 (because both ends are inclusive).

So, the number of positive integers $m$ is $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 99.
The answer is: $99$

Assistant:

 This problem is a challenging one and requires a deep understanding of absolute value equations and their solutions. However, it is not a problem that can be solved by simply writing a program to compute an answer. Instead, it requires analytical thinking and mathematical insights.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to the positive difference between two successive partition points of the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. The partition points of $f(x)$ are $0$, $2$, and $3$, which are obtained by setting the expressions inside the absolute values to $0$ and solving for $x$. The positive difference between successive partition points are $2-0=2$ and $3-2=1$. Thus, for the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal to $1$ or $2$. Therefore, the possible values of $m$ are $100$ and $200$.
The answer is: $2$

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"

 The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is a piecewise function, and its solutions will depend on the value of $\frac{m}{100}$. The piecewise function can be broken down into cases:

1. If $\frac{m}{100} < 2$, then the equation becomes $\vert x - 1 \vert - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\vert x - 1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. This gives two solutions: $x = 1 + 2 + \frac{m}{100} = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = 1 - 2 - \frac{m}{100} = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

2. If $\frac{m}{100} \geq 2$, then the equation becomes $\vert \vert x - 1 \vert - 2 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\vert x - 1 \vert - 2 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, and then to $\vert x - 1 \vert = 4 - \frac{m}{100}$. This gives two solutions: $x = 1 + 4 - \frac{m}{100} = 5 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = 1 - 4 + \frac{m}{100} = -3 + \frac{m}{100}$.

For the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, we need the two cases to intersect. This means that $2 \leq \frac{m}{100} < 3$, or equivalently, $200 \leq m < 300$. The number of positive integers in this range is $100$.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $100$.

```python

def count_m():
