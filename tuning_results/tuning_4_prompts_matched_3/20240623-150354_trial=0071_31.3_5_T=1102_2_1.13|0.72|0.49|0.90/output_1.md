Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ subject to the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. 

First, let's simplify the constraint equation. We have $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. By the property of absolute value, we know that $|a| = |-a|$, so we can rewrite the constraint as $|x-2y| + |2x-y| = 40$.

Now, let's consider the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite it as $5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy$. We know that $(x-y)^2 = x^2 - 2xy + y^2$, so $x^2+y^2 = (x-y)^2 + 2xy$. Substituting this into our expression, we get $5((x-y)^2 + 2xy) - 8xy = 5(x-y)^2 + 5(2xy) - 8xy = 5(x-y)^2 + 2xy$.

To minimize this expression, we need to minimize $2xy$ while keeping $(x-y)^2$ constant. By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we know that $(a^2 + b^2)(c^2 + d^2) \geq (ac + bd)^2$ for all real numbers $a, b, c, d$. Setting $a = x-y$, $b = \sqrt{2}y$, $c = \sqrt{2}x$, and $d = -y$, we get $((x-y)^2 + 2y^2)((2x^2 + y^2) \geq ((x-y)\sqrt{2}x + y\sqrt{2}y)^2$, which simplifies to $(x-y)^2 + 2y^2 \geq 2(x^2 - 2xy + y^2)$, or $(x-y)^2 + 2y^2 \geq 2x^2 - 4xy + 2y^2$, or $2xy \leq (x-y)^2$.

So, we have $2xy \leq (x-y)^2$. Therefore, $5(x-y)^2 + 2xy \geq 5(x-y)^2$, and the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is achieved when $2xy = (x-y)^2$.

Now, let's solve the constraint equation $|x-2y| + |2x-y| = 40$. Since $2xy = (x-y)^2$, we have $|x-2y| + |2x-y| = 40$ and $2xy = (x-y)^2$. By trial and error or by graphing, we find that the solution to these equations is $x = 10$ and $y = 5$. Substituting these values into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get $5(10^2) + 5(5^2) - 8(10)(5) = 500 + 125 - 400 = 325$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 325. The answer is: $325$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we observe that the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is equivalent to $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$. This is because $|a| = |-a|$ for any real number $a$.

Now, we use the property of absolute value $|a-b| = |b-a|$ to simplify the equation further:
$$|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40 \implies |x-2y| + |x-2y| = 40.$$

This simplifies to $2|x-2y| = 40$, so $|x-2y| = 20$.

The absolute value equation $|x-2y| = 20$ can be split into two separate equations: $x-2y = 20$ and $x-2y = -20$.

If $x-2y = 20$, then $y = \frac{x}{2} - 10$.
If $x-2y = -20$, then $y = \frac{x}{2} + 10$.

We substitute these two equations into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:

If $y = \frac{x}{2} - 10$, then
$$5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5x^2 + 5\left(\frac{x}{2} - 10\right)^2 - 8x\left(\frac{x}{2} - 10\right)$$
$$= 5x^2 + 5\left(\frac{x^2}{4} - 10x + 100\right) - 4x^2 + 80x$$
$$= \frac{5x^2}{4} - 50x + 500.$$

If $y = \frac{x}{2} + 10$, then
$$5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5x^2 + 5\left(\frac{x}{2} + 10\right)^2 - 8x\left(\frac{x}{2} + 10\right)$$
$$= 5x^2 + 5\left(\frac{x^2}{4} + 10x + 100\right) - 4x^2 - 80x$$
$$= \frac{5x^2}{4} + 50x + 500.$$

We can see that both expressions have the same form: $\frac{5x^2}{4} \pm 50x + 500$.

To find the minimum value of this expression, we can complete the square:
$$\frac{5x^2}{4} \pm 50x + 500 = \frac{5}{4}(x^2 \pm 40x) + 500$$
$$= \frac{5}{4}\left((x \pm 20)^2 - 400\right) + 500$$
$$= \frac{5}{4}(x \pm 20)^2 - 500 + 500$$
$$= \frac{5}{4}(x \pm 20)^2.$$

Since $(x \pm 20)^2$ is always nonnegative, $\frac{5}{4}(x \pm 20)^2$ is always nonnegative. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $0$.

However, this minimum value is achieved when $x = \pm 20$ and $y = \pm 10$. But these values do not satisfy the condition $|x-2y| = 20$. So we need to check the other cases.

We can see that the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is the sum of two squares, so it is always nonnegative. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $0$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $(5x^2-8xy+5y^2)$. This can be factored as $(5x^2-8xy+5y^2) = (x-y)^2 + 4xy$.
Now, let's consider the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. We can rewrite this as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$, which simplifies to $2|x-2y| = 40$. Therefore, $|x-2y| = 20$.
Since $|x-2y|$ is the absolute value of a real number, it must be nonnegative. Thus, $|x-2y| = 20$ implies that $x-2y = \pm 20$.
Without loss of generality, let's assume that $x-2y = 20$. Then, we can solve for $y$ in terms of $x$: $y = \frac{x-20}{2}$.
Substituting this into the expression $(x-y)^2 + 4xy$, we get:
\[
\left(x - \frac{x-20}{2}\right)^2 + 4x\left(\frac{x-20}{2}\right) = \left(\frac{x+20}{2}\right)^2 + 2x(x-20) = \frac{x^2+40x+400}{4} + 2x^2 - 40x = \frac{5x^2 - 400}{4}.
\]
To find the minimum value of this expression, we need to minimize $5x^2 - 400$. Since $x^2$ is always nonnegative, the minimum value of $5x^2 - 400$ is achieved when $x^2 = 0$, which implies $x = 0$.
Substituting $x = 0$ into $y = \frac{x-20}{2}$, we get $y = -10$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is achieved when $x = 0$ and $y = -10$, and the minimum value is $5(0)^2 + 5(-10)^2 - 8(0)(-10) = 500$.
The answer is: $500$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We first note that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, we know that $|a| + |b| \ge |a+b|$, so $|2y-x| + |2x-y| \ge |(2y-x) + (2x-y)| = |y| = 40$.
This implies that $|y| = 20$, so $y = 20$ or $y = -20$.
We can substitute $y = 20$ into the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ to get $|x-40| + |20-x| = 40$.
This simplifies to $|x-40| + |20-x| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality again, we know that $|a| + |b| \ge |a-b|$, so $|x-40| + |20-x| \ge |(x-40) - (20-x)| = |x-60|$.
This implies that $|x-60| \le 40$, so $-40 \le x-60 \le 40$.
This further simplifies to $20 \le x \le 100$.
Similarly, we can substitute $y = -20$ into the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ to get $|x+40| + |-20-x| = 40$.
This simplifies to $|x+40| + |-20-x| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, we know that $|a| + |b| \ge |a+b|$, so $|x+40| + |-20-x| \ge |(x+40) + (-20-x)| = |20|$.
This implies that $|20| \le 40$, which is true.
So, $y = -20$ also gives a valid range for $x$, which is $-100 \le x \le -20$.
Now, we want to find the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers satisfying the given equation.
We can substitute $y = 20$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to get $5x^2+5(20)^2-8x(20) = 5x^2+2000-160x$.
This expression is minimized when the derivative with respect to $x$ is zero, so we take the derivative and set it equal to zero:
$\frac{d}{dx}(5x^2+2000-160x) = 10x-160 = 0$.
Solving for $x$, we find $x = 16$.
Substituting $x = 16$ and $y = 20$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get $5(16)^2+5(20)^2-8(16)(20) = 1280+2000-2560 = 720$.
Similarly, we can substitute $y = -20$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to get $5x^2+5(-20)^2-8x(-20) = 5x^2+2000+160x$.
This expression is minimized when the derivative with respect to $x$ is zero, so we take the derivative and set it equal to zero:
$\frac{d}{dx}(5x^2+2000+160x) = 10x+160 = 0$.
Solving for $x$, we find $x = -16$.
Substituting $x = -16$ and $y = -20$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get $5(-16)^2+5(-20)^2-8(-16)(-20) = 1280+2000-2560 = 720$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers satisfying the given equation is 720. The answer is: $720$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We can rewrite the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$.
Using the property $|a| + |b| = |a+b| + |a-b|$, we have $|2y-x + 2x-y| + |2y-x - (2x-y)| = 40$,
which simplifies to $|y+x| + |-x-3y| = 40$.
Since $|a+b| = |a| + |b|$ if and only if $a$ and $b$ have the same sign, we have two cases to consider:
Case 1: $y+x > 0$ and $-x-3y > 0$. This implies $y > -x/3$ and $y < -x/3$. The intersection of these two inequalities is the empty set, so this case is not possible.
Case 2: $y+x < 0$ and $-x-3y < 0$. This implies $y < -x/3$ and $y > -x/3$. The only solution to these inequalities is $y = -x/3$. Substituting this into the equation $|y+x| + |-x-3y| = 40$, we get $|2x/3| + |4x/3| = 40$, which simplifies to $2|x| = 40$, so $|x| = 20$. Since $y = -x/3$, we have $|y| = |x|/3 = 20/3$.
Now, let's substitute $y = -x/3$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We get $5x^2+5(-x/3)^2-8x(-x/3) = 5x^2+5x^2/9+8x^2/3 = (45x^2+5x^2+24x^2)/9 = 74x^2/9$.
Since $|x| = 20$, the minimum value of $74x^2/9$ is achieved when $x = -20$ or $x = 20$. We find that the minimum value is $74(20)^2/9 = 30160/9$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $30160/9$.
The answer is: $30160/9$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we need to find a relationship between $x$ and $y$ from the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
Without loss of generality, we can assume that $x \geq 2y$ and $y \geq 2x$.
Then, we have $x - 2y + y - 2x = 40$, which simplifies to $-x - y = 40$.
So, $x + y = -40$.

Now, we want to find the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.
We can rewrite this expression as $5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy$.
By the square of a binomial, we have $(x+y)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + 2xy$.
Substituting $x+y=-40$, we get $x^2 + y^2 = (-40 - 2xy)^2$.

Now, substitute this into the expression we want to minimize:
$5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy = 5(-40 - 2xy)^2 - 8xy$.

Expanding and simplifying, we get:
$5(-40^2 - 80xy - 4xy^2) - 8xy = -8000 - 1600xy - 20xy^2 - 8xy$.

Combining like terms, we have:
$-8000 - 1608xy - 20xy^2$.

Now, we want to find the minimum value of this expression.
To do this, we can take the derivative with respect to $xy$ and set it equal to zero:
$-1608 - 40xy = 0$.

Solving for $xy$, we get $xy = -\frac{1608}{40} = -40.2$.

Now, substitute this value back into the expression:
$-8000 - 1608(-40.2) - 20(-40.2)^2 = -8000 + 64601.6 - 32416 = -4004.4$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $-4004.4$. However, this result doesn't make sense as the expression is supposed to be minimized, but we got a negative value.

After rechecking our calculations, we realize that we made a mistake in the calculation of the derivative.
The correct derivative is $-1608 - 40xy = 0$, so $xy = -\frac{1608}{40} = -40.2$.

However, this value doesn't satisfy the condition $x+y=-40$.

Let's try another approach.

We know that $x + y = -40$.

We can square both sides of this equation to get $(x + y)^2 = (-40)^2$, which simplifies to $x^2 + 2xy + y^2 = 1600$.

We also know that $x^2 + y^2 = (-40 - 2xy)^2$.

Substituting this into the equation above, we get $(-40 - 2xy)^2 + 2xy = 1600$.

Expanding and simplifying, we have:
$1600 + 1600xy + 4xy^2 + 2xy = 1600$.

Combining like terms, we get:
$4xy^2 + 1602xy = 0$.

Factoring out $2xy$, we have:
$2xy(2y + 801) = 0$.

This gives us two possibilities: $2xy = 0$ or $2y + 801 = 0$.

If $2xy = 0$, then $xy = 0$. But this doesn't satisfy the condition $x+y=-40$.

If $2y + 801 = 0$, then $y = -\frac{801}{2}$.

Substituting this into $x + y = -40$, we get $x - \frac{801}{2} = -40$, so $x = -40 + \frac{801}{2} = \frac{721}{2}$.

Now, substitute these values into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
$5\left(\frac{721}{2}\right)^2 + 5\left(-\frac{801}{2}\right)^2 - 8\left(\frac{721}{2}\right)\left(-\frac{801}{2}\right)$.

Expanding and simplifying, we get:
$5\left(\frac{519041}{4}\right) + 5\left(\frac{641601}{4}\right) - 8\left(\frac{721 \cdot 801}{4}\right)$.

Simplifying further, we have:
$\frac{2595205}{4} + \frac{3208005}{4} - \frac{5776808}{4}$.

Combining like terms, we get:
$\frac{2595205 + 3208005 - 5776808}{4} = \frac{1595602}{4} = 398900.5$.

However, this value doesn't make sense as the expression is supposed to be minimized.

After rechecking our calculations, we realize that we made a mistake in the calculation of the values of $x$ and $y$.

Let's go back to the equation $x^2 + y^2 = (-40 - 2xy)^2$.

We know that $x + y = -40$, so $x = -40 - y$.

Substituting this into the equation above, we get $(-40 - y)^2 + y^2 = (-40 - 2xy)^2$.

Expanding and simplifying, we have:
$1600 + 80y + y^2 + y^2 = 1600 + 1600xy + 4xy^2$.

Combining like terms, we get:
$2y^2 + 80y = 4xy^2 + 1600xy$.

Rearranging terms, we have:
$2y^2 + 80y - 4xy^2 - 1600xy = 0$.

Factoring out $2y$, we have:
$2y(y + 40 - 2xy - 800x) = 0$.

This gives us two possibilities: $2y

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, let's rewrite the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, $|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |x-2y + y-2x| = |x-2y - (y-2x)| = |x-2y - y+2x| = |3x-3y| = 3|x-y|$.
So we have $3|x-y| = 40$, which implies $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$.

Now, let's consider the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite it as $5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x-y)^2 + 2xy] - 8xy = 5(x-y)^2 + 3xy$.

We know that $(x-y)^2 \geq 0$, so $5(x-y)^2 \geq 0$. Also, by the triangle inequality, $|3x-3y| = 3|x-y| = 40$, so $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$.

Substituting this into the expression $5(x-y)^2 + 3xy$, we get $5\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 + 3xy = \frac{8000}{9} + 3xy$.

To minimize this expression, we need to minimize $3xy$. Since $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$, we can square both sides to get $(x-y)^2 = \left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2$, which simplifies to $x^2 - 2xy + y^2 = \frac{1600}{9}$.

Rearranging this equation, we get $2xy = x^2 + y^2 - \frac{1600}{9}$.

Substituting this into the expression $5(x-y)^2 + 3xy$, we get $5\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 + \frac{3}{2}(x^2 + y^2 - \frac{1600}{9})$.

Simplifying this expression, we get $\frac{8000}{9} + \frac{3}{2}(x^2 + y^2 - \frac{1600}{9}) = \frac{8000}{9} + \frac{3}{2}x^2 + \frac{3}{2}y^2 - \frac{2400}{9}$.

Combining like terms, we get $\frac{3}{2}x^2 + \frac{3}{2}y^2 + \frac{5600}{9}$.

Since $\frac{3}{2}x^2 + \frac{3}{2}y^2$ is always nonnegative, the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is achieved when $\frac{3}{2}x^2 + \frac{3}{2}y^2 = 0$. This occurs when $x=y=0$.

Substituting these values into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get $5(0)^2 + 5(0)^2 - 8(0)(0) = 0$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0. The answer is: $0$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we need to find a relationship between $x$ and $y$ from the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
We can rewrite the equation as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, we know that $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$, so we have $|2y-x| + |2x-y| \geq |(2y-x) + (2x-y)| = |y| = 40$.
This gives us $y = \pm 20$.

Now, let's substitute $y = 20$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.
We have $5x^2+5(20)^2-8x(20) = 5x^2+2000-160x$.
To find the minimum value of this expression, we can find its derivative and set it equal to zero.
The derivative of $5x^2+2000-160x$ with respect to $x$ is $10x-160$.
Setting this equal to zero, we have $10x-160 = 0$, which gives $x = 16$.

Similarly, when $y = -20$, we have $5x^2+5(-20)^2-8x(-20) = 5x^2+2000+160x$.
Setting the derivative equal to zero, we have $10x+160 = 0$, which gives $x = -16$.

Now, we substitute $x = 16$ and $y = 20$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to find the minimum value.
We have $5(16)^2+5(20)^2-8(16)(20) = 1280$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $1280$. The answer is: $1280$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we need to find the relationship between $x$ and $y$ from the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
We can rewrite this equation as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, we know that $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$, so we have $|2y-x| + |2x-y| \geq |(2y-x) + (2x-y)| = |y| = |2y-2x| = |2(y-x)| = 2|y-x|$.
Thus, we have $2|y-x| \geq 40$, so $|y-x| \geq 20$.
Now, let's consider the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite it as $(5x^2-8xy+5y^2) = (5x^2-10xy+5y^2) + (0-2xy) = (5(x-y)^2) - (2xy)$.
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we know that $(a^2+b^2)(c^2+d^2) \geq (ac+bd)^2$, so we have $(x^2+y^2)(1^2+(-1)^2) \geq (x-y)^2$, which gives $2(x^2+y^2) \geq (x-y)^2$.
Thus, we have $5(x^2+y^2) \geq 5(x-y)^2/2 = (5/2)(x-y)^2$.
Since $|y-x| \geq 20$, we have $(5/2)(x-y)^2 \geq (5/2)(20^2) = 500$.
Therefore, we have $5x^2+5y^2-8xy \geq 500 - 2xy$.
To minimize this expression, we need to maximize $2xy$. Since $|y-x| \geq 20$, we can let $x=10+n$ and $y=10-n$ for some real number $n$. Then, we have $2xy = 2(10+n)(10-n) = 2(100 - n^2) = 200 - 2n^2$.
Since $n^2$ is always non-negative, we have $200 - 2n^2 \leq 200$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $500 - 200 = 300$. The answer is: $300$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $(5x^2-8xy+5y^2)$.
We can rewrite this as $(5x^2-8xy+4y^2)+y^2$, which is $(5x^2-8xy+4y^2)+y^2$.
This can be further rewritten as $(x-2y)^2 + y^2$.

Now, let's consider the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
We can rewrite this as $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, which simplifies to $|x-2y| + |-(x-2y)| = 40$.
This simplifies to $2|x-2y| = 40$, so $|x-2y| = 20$.

From this, we know that $(x-2y)^2 = 400$.
Now, substitute this into our expression $(x-2y)^2 + y^2$, we get $400 + y^2$.

To minimize this expression, we need to minimize $y^2$. The minimum value of $y^2$ is $0$, which occurs when $y=0$.

So, the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $400 + 0 = 400$. The answer is: $400$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$,
we can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.
The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states that for any real numbers $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$ and $b_1, b_2, ..., b_n$,
$(a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 + ... + a_nb_n)^2 \leq (a_1^2 + a_2^2 + ... + a_n^2)(b_1^2 + b_2^2 + ... + b_n^2)$.

In this case, we can set $a_1 = x - 2y$, $a_2 = y - 2x$, $b_1 = 1$, and $b_2 = 1$.
Then, we have
\[(a_1b_1 + a_2b_2)^2 = (x - 2y + y - 2x)^2 = (-x - y)^2 = (x + y)^2.\]
Also, we have
\[(a_1^2 + a_2^2)(b_1^2 + b_2^2) = ( (x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2 )(1^2 + 1^2) = (5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy).\]
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have
\[(x + y)^2 \leq (5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy).\]
Since $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$, we know that $x + y = \pm 20$.
When $x + y = 20$, we have
\[(x + y)^2 = 400 \leq (5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy).\]
When $x + y = -20$, we have
\[(x + y)^2 = 400 \leq (5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy).\]
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is $400$.
The answer is: $400$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, we rewrite the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$.
Then, by the triangle inequality, we know that $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$ for all real numbers $a$ and $b$.
So, we have $|2y-x| + |2x-y| \geq |(2y-x) + (2x-y)| = |y| = y$.
Hence, $y = 40$.
Substituting this into the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we get $|x-80| + |80-2x| = 40$.
Again by the triangle inequality, we have $|x-80| + |80-2x| \geq |(x-80) + (80-2x)| = |x-80| = 40$.
Hence, $|x-80| = 40$, which implies $x-80 = 40$ or $x-80 = -40$.
Solving these equations, we find $x = 120$ or $x = 40$.
Now, we substitute these values of $x$ and $y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
If $x = 120$ and $y = 40$, we get $5(120)^2 + 5(40)^2 - 8(120)(40) = 72000$.
If $x = 40$ and $y = 40$, we get $5(40)^2 + 5(40)^2 - 8(40)(40) = 0$.
Hence, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0. The answer is: $0$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To solve this problem, we first note that the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$.
Then, we recognize that $|a-b| + |b-a| = 2|a-b|$ for all real numbers $a$ and $b$. So the equation becomes $2|2y-x| = 40$, or $|2y-x| = 20$.
This means that the distance between the points $(x, y)$ and $(2y, y)$ is 20.
Now, let's consider the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite it as $5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy$.
We recognize that $x^2+y^2$ is the square of the distance between the origin and the point $(x, y)$, and $xy$ is half of the product of the coordinates of the point $(x, y)$.
By the triangle inequality, the square of the distance between the origin and the point $(x, y)$ is at least the square of the distance between the origin and the point $(2y, y)$, which is $(2y)^2 + y^2 = 5y^2$.
And the product of the coordinates of the point $(x, y)$ is equal to the product of the coordinates of the point $(2y, y)$, which is $2y^2$.
So we have $x^2+y^2 \geq 5y^2$ and $xy = 2y^2$.
Substituting these into the expression $5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy$, we get $5(5y^2) - 8(2y^2) = 25y^2 - 16y^2 = 9y^2$.
Now, we know that the point $(x, y)$ lies on a circle with center $(2y, y)$ and radius 20. The minimum value of $9y^2$ occurs when $y$ is at its minimum value.
Since the circle has radius 20, the minimum value of $|y|$ is 10. Then the minimum value of $y^2$ is $10^2 = 100$, so the minimum value of $9y^2$ is $9 \cdot 100 = 900$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 900.
The answer is: $900$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, let's simplify the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
Using the property $|a| = |-a|$, we can rewrite the equation as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$.
Now, let's consider the two cases:
Case 1: If $x-2y \geq 0$ and $2y-x \geq 0$, then the equation becomes $x-2y + 2y-x = 40$, which simplifies to $0=40$, a contradiction. So, this case is not possible.
Case 2: If $x-2y < 0$ and $2y-x < 0$, then the equation becomes $-(x-2y) - (2y-x) = 40$, which simplifies to $-2(x-2y) = 40$, or $x-2y = -20$.
So, we have the system of equations:
\begin{align*}
x-2y &= -20 \\
|x-2y| + |2y-x| &= 40
\end{align*}
From the first equation, we can solve for $x$ in terms of $y$: $x = 2y - 20$. Substituting this into the second equation, we get $|2y-20-2y| + |2y-(2y-20)| = 40$, which simplifies to $|-20| + |20| = 40$, which is true. So, the system of equations is consistent.
Now, let's substitute $x = 2y - 20$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
\begin{align*}
5(2y-20)^2 + 5y^2 - 8(2y-20)y &= 5(4y^2 - 80y + 400) + 5y^2 - 16y^2 + 160y \\
&= 20y^2 - 400y + 2000 + 5y^2 - 16y^2 + 160y \\
&= -y^2 - 240y + 2000
\end{align*}
This is a quadratic function with a negative leading coefficient, so its graph is a downward-opening parabola. The minimum value occurs at the vertex of the parabola.
The $y$-coordinate of the vertex of a parabola given by $f(y) = ay^2 + by + c$ is given by $-\frac{b}{2a}$. In this case, $a = -1$ and $b = -240$, so the $y$-coordinate of the vertex is $-\frac{-240}{2(-1)} = 120$.
Substituting $y = 120$ into the equation $x = 2y - 20$, we get $x = 2(120) - 20 = 220$.
So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ occurs when $x = 220$ and $y = 120$.
Substituting these values into the expression, we get:
\begin{align*}
5(220)^2 + 5(120)^2 - 8(220)(120) &= 242000 + 72000 - 201600 \\
&= 356400
\end{align*}
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 356400. The answer is: $356400$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, let's rewrite the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$.
Now, let's consider the function $f(x, y) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$.
We want to find the minimum value of $f(x, y)$ subject to the constraint $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$.

By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have
\[(1^2 + 2^2)(x^2 + y^2) \ge (x + 2y)^2.\]
Simplifying, we get
\[5(x^2 + y^2) \ge (x + 2y)^2.\]
Similarly,
\[5(x^2 + y^2) \ge (2x + y)^2.\]
Adding these two inequalities, we get
\[10(x^2 + y^2) \ge (x + 2y)^2 + (2x + y)^2.\]
Expanding and simplifying, we get
\[10(x^2 + y^2) \ge 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy.\]
So, $f(x, y) \ge 0$.

Now, we want to find the values of $x$ and $y$ that satisfy the constraint and make $f(x, y)$ equal to 0.
If $x = 2y$, then $|x-2y| = 0$ and $|y-2x| = |y-4y| = |-3y| = 3|y|$.
Since $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we have $0 + 3|y| = 40$, so $|y| = \frac{40}{3}$.
Similarly, if $y = 2x$, then $|y-2x| = 0$ and $|x-2y| = |x-4x| = |-3x| = 3|x|$.
Again, since $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we have $3|x| + 0 = 40$, so $|x| = \frac{40}{3}$.

For $x = 2y$, we have $f(x, y) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = 5(2y)^2 + 5y^2 - 8(2y)y = 20y^2 + 5y^2 - 16y^2 = 9y^2$.
For $y = 2x$, we have $f(x, y) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = 5x^2 + 5(2x)^2 - 8x(2x) = 5x^2 + 20x^2 - 16x^2 = 9x^2$.

Since $|x| = \frac{40}{3}$ and $|y| = \frac{40}{3}$, we have $x^2 = \frac{1600}{9}$ and $y^2 = \frac{1600}{9}$.
So, $f(x, y) = 9x^2 = 9 \cdot \frac{1600}{9} = 1600$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $f(x, y)$ is 0, and the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 0. However, this value is not achievable because the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is not satisfied when $f(x, y) = 0$.

The minimum value of $f(x, y)$ that satisfies the constraint is achieved when $x = 4$ and $y = 2$, and the minimum value is $-40$.
To see this, substitute $x = 4$ and $y = 2$ into the equation $f(x, y) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$, we get $f(4, 2) = 5(4)^2 + 5(2)^2 - 8(4)(2) = 80 + 20 - 64 = 36$.
Now, substitute $x = 4$ and $y = 2$ into the constraint equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |4-4| + |2-8| = 0 + 6 = 6$, which is not equal to 40.
However, if we substitute $x = -4$ and $y = -2$, we get $f(-4, -2) = 5(-4)^2 + 5(-2)^2 - 8(-4)(-2) = 80 + 20 - 64 = 36$, and the constraint equation becomes $|(-4)-(-4)| + |(-2)-(-8)| = 0 + 6 = 6$, which is still not equal to 40.
But if we substitute $x = 4$ and $y = -2$, we get $f(4, -2) = 5(4)^2 + 5(-2)^2 - 8(4)(-2) = 80 + 20 + 64 = 164$, and the constraint equation becomes $|4-(-4)| + |-2-(-8)| = 8 + 6 = 14$, which is not equal to 40.
Similarly, if we substitute $x = -4$ and $y = 2$, we get $f(-4, 2) = 5(-4)^2 + 5(2)^2 - 8(-4)(2) = 80 + 20 + 64 = 164$, and the constraint equation becomes $|-4-4| + |2-(-8)| = 8 + 10 = 18$, which is also not equal to 40.
However, if we substitute $x = 2$ and $y = 4$, we get $f(2, 4) = 5(2)^2 + 5(4)^2 - 8(2)(4) = 20 + 80 - 64 = 36$, and the constraint equation becomes $|2-8| + |4-8| = 6 + 4 = 10$, which is not equal to 40.
But if we substitute $x = -2$ and $y = -4$, we get $f(-2, -4) = 5(-2)^2 + 5(-4)^2 - 8(-2)(-4)

We are given that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, so $|x+y| = 40$.
Now, let's consider the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite this as $5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x+y)^2 - 2xy] - 8xy = 5(40^2 - 2xy) - 8xy$.
Let $z = xy$. Then the expression becomes $5(40^2 - 2z) - 8z = 5(1600 - 2z) - 8z = 8000 - 10z - 8z = 8000 - 18z$.
To minimize this expression, we need to maximize $z$. From $|x+y| = 40$, we know that $x+y = \pm 40$.
By AM-GM inequality, we have $(x+y)^2 \geq 4xy$, so $1600 \geq 4z$, which implies $z \leq 400$.
Therefore, the maximum value of $z$ is 400.
Substituting this into the expression $8000 - 18z$, we get $8000 - 18(400) = 8000 - 7200 = 800$.
So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 800. The answer is: $800$
