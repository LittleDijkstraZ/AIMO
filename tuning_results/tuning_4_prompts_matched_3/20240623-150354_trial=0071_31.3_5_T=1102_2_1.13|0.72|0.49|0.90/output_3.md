Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation given is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. For the product of two numbers to be zero, either one of the numbers must be zero. Therefore, we have two cases:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This means that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two squares, each with side length 20. The vertices of the squares are $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, and $(-10, 0)$ for the first square, and $(10, 10)$, $(10, -10)$, $(-10, 10)$, and $(-10, -10)$ for the second square. The intersection of these two squares forms a square with side length 10.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This means that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two squares, each with side length 16. The vertices of the squares are $(8, 0)$, $(-8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, and $(0, -8)$ for the first square, and $(0, 8)$, $(0, -8)$, $(8, 0)$, and $(-8, 0)$ for the second square. The intersection of these two squares forms a square with side length 8.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon formed by the intersection of the two squares is the area of the square with side length 8, which is $8^2 = 64$. The answer is: $64$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is equal to zero if and only if at least one of the factors is equal to zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
For the first factor to be equal to zero, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we find that the points that satisfy these conditions are $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, and $(-5,-5)$.
For the second factor to be equal to zero, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations, we find that the points that satisfy these conditions are $(8,0)$, $(0,8)$, $(-8,0)$, and $(0,-8)$.
Plotting these points, we see that they form a square with side length 10. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
The absolute value equation $\vert u \vert = a$ has two solutions: $u = a$ and $u = -a$. So we have four equations:
1. $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
2. $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
These four equations represent the lines $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The absolute value equation $\vert u \vert = a$ has two solutions: $u = a$ and $u = -a$. So we have four equations:
1. $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
2. $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.
These four equations represent the lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

The intersection of these lines form a square with side length 10 (the distance between the lines $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$), and the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. So the area of the convex polygon is 100.
The answer is: $100$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $AB = 0$ is satisfied if and only if $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. So the given equation is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8,2)$, $(8,-2)$, $(-8,2)$, and $(-8,-2)$.
The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, so $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us the vertices of the square: $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.
The convex polygon formed by the union of these two squares is a 4x4 square, so its area is $4 \times 4 = 16$. The answer is: $16$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if and only if at least one of the following two conditions holds:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
For the first condition to hold, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$.
For the second condition to hold, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these four equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.
The union of these two squares forms a larger square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$, so its area is $(10\sqrt{2})^2 = 200$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 200. The answer is: 200

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The first two equations imply that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which are the equations of two lines passing through the origin making an angle of $45^\circ$ with the x and y axes respectively. The last two equations imply that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which are the equations of two lines parallel to the y and x axes respectively at a distance of 8 units from the origin.
The intersection points of these lines are the vertices of the polygon.
The vertices of the polygon are $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.
The polygon is a square with side length 16.
The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So, the equation
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0\]
implies that either
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0\]
or
\[((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]
The first equation is satisfied if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means that $x$ and $y$ are both $5$ or both $-5$. The second equation is satisfied if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means that $x$ is in the set $\{-8, 8\}$ and $y$ is in the set $\{-8, 8\}$. Therefore, the points that satisfy the equation are the vertices of a square with side length $10$, centered at the origin. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is true if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This happens if and only if either $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
These equations describe the boundaries of the square with side length 16 centered at the origin, and the square with side length 20 centered at the origin.
The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon enclosed by the points satisfying the original equation.
The area of this convex polygon is the area of the square with side length 16, which is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $AB = 0$ is satisfied if and only if $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. So the given equation is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The first two equations are satisfied if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
The last two equations are satisfied if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The solutions to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ are given by the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.

The solutions to $\vert y \vert = 8$ are given by the lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.
The intersections of these lines form a rectangle with side lengths 16 and 20, so the area of the rectangle is $16 \times 20 = 320$. The answer is: $320$

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. These lines form a square with side length 20.
If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. These lines form a square with side length 16.
The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon whose area we want to find. This intersection is another square, with side length 8 (the smaller of the two squares' side lengths). The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 64. The answer is: $64$

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This means that either $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The solutions to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ are the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.
The solutions to $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ are the lines $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.
The solutions to $\vert x \vert = 8$ are the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.
The solutions to $\vert y \vert = 8$ are the lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.
Plotting these lines on the coordinate plane, we find that they enclose a square with side length 16.
Therefore, the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: 256

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two lines parallel to the x-axis and y-axis, respectively, and at a distance of 10 units from the origin.

The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two circles centered at the origin with a radius of 8 units.

The intersection of these lines and circles forms a square with side length 16 units. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$ square units. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$
