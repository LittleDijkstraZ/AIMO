 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, which means that either of the expressions must be zero for the equation to hold. This gives us two separate conditions to consider:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
For the first condition, both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ must be zero, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, and $(0, -10)$.
For the second condition, both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2$ must be zero, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. These lines form a square with vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.
The intersection of the two sets of lines is the convex polygon enclosed by the points that satisfy the given equation. This polygon is a square with side length 10 (the maximum of the absolute values of $x$ and $y$). To find the area of this square, we simply square the length of one of its sides: $10^2 = 100$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units. The answer is: $100$

The equation given is a product of two terms equal to zero, which means either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.

The first term is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. This term is zero if and only if both $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$. These lines intersect at $(5,5)$, forming a cross shape.

The second term is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. This term is zero if and only if both $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = 8$ or $x = -8$, and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. This forms a square with side length 16.

The convex polygon formed by the intersection of these two shapes is a square with side length 10 (the smaller of the two possible side lengths). To find the area of this square, we simply square the side length: $10^2 = 100$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units. The answer is: $100$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

The expression $AB = 0$ is true if and only if $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the given equation is satisfied if and only if either of the following two conditions is true:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
For the first condition to be true, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$. These lines intersect at the point $(5,5)$.
For the second condition to be true, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$. These lines intersect at the points $(8,0)$ and $(0,8)$.
Therefore, the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the given equation are the vertices of a square with side length $10$. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. So the area of the convex polygon is $100$. The answer is: $100$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. For the product of two numbers to be zero, either one of the numbers must be zero. Therefore, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. 

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0)$.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Adding these vertices to the previous ones gives us the complete set of vertices: $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0), (8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$.

The polygon formed by these vertices is a square with side length 10. The area of a square is given by the square of its side length, so the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$
