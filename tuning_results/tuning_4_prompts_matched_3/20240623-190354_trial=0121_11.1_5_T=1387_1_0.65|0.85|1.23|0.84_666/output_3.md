Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation given is:

$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$

This equation equals zero if either of the two factors equals zero. Therefore, we have two sets of equations:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For each set of equations, we have:

1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
2. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The solutions to these equations are:

1. $x + y = \pm 10$, $x = \pm 8$, and $y = \pm 8$.
2. $x - y = \pm 10$, $x = \pm 8$, and $y = \pm 8$.

The solutions to these equations form a square with side length 10, centered at the origin, and another square with side length 16, centered at the origin. The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for.

The area of a square is given by the square of the side length, so the area of the smaller square is $10^2 = 100$ and the area of the larger square is $16^2 = 256$. The area of the convex polygon is the difference of these two areas: $256 - 100 = 156$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 156.
The answer is: $156$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only way this is possible is if $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$. So, these four points form the top and bottom of the rectangle.

Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. So, $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. These four points form the left and right sides of the rectangle.

So, the rectangle is formed by the points $(-10, -10), (-10, 10), (10, 10), (10, -10)$ with side lengths $20$ and $16$. The area of the rectangle is $20 \times 16 = 320$. The answer is: $320$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is given as:
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0\]

This equation is equal to zero if either of the two factors is zero. Therefore, we have two sets of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From the first set of equations, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $-8 \leq x, y \leq 8$.

From the second set of equations, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $-8 \leq x, y \leq 8$.

So the points that satisfy the equation are all the points in the square with side length 16 centered at the origin. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The equation given is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.

2. The first term is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. This term equals zero if and only if both $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the four lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

3. The second term is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. This term equals zero if and only if both $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So we get the four lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

4. The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

If a product equals zero, then at least one of the factors must be zero. Therefore, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The solutions are:
- $x + y = \pm 10$,
- $x - y = \pm 10$,
- $x = \pm 8$,
- $y = \pm 8$.

These equations represent a square with side length 16. To find the area, we simply square the side length: $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256.
The answer is: $256$

Assistant:

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. This gives us two systems of equations to solve:

1. $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x - y| - 10 = 0$.
2. $|x| - 8 = 0$ and $|y| - 8 = 0$.

For the first system, we have $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the polygon: $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0)$.

For the second system, we have $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the polygon: $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$.

Now we can plot these points on a coordinate plane and connect them to form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100.
The answer is: $100$

The equation given is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

This equation is equal to zero if either of the two factors is zero. Therefore, we have two sets of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From the first set of equations, we get $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
From the second set of equations, we get $x = y = \pm 10$.

So the vertices of the polygon are $(\pm 8, \pm 8)$ and $(\pm 10, \pm 10)$.

This forms a square with side length $16$, so the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is: $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$

This equation equals to zero if either of the two terms equals to zero. Therefore, we have two sets of equations:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first set of equations:
- $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
- $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = 8$ or $x = -8$, and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

So, we have four points from the first set of equations: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -10)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -10)$.

For the second set of equations:
- $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
- $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = 8$ or $x = -8$, and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

So, we have four more points from the second set of equations: $(8, -2)$, $(8, 10)$, $(-8, -2)$, and $(-8, 10)$.

These eight points form a square with side length $20$. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $400$. The answer is: $400$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is equal to zero if either of the two factors is zero. This gives us two sets of equations:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first set of equations, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$. This gives us the following four equations:

- $x + y = 10$ and $x = 8$.
- $x + y = -10$ and $x = -8$.
- $x + y = 10$ and $x = -8$.
- $x + y = -10$ and $x = 8$.

For the second set of equations, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us the following four equations:

- $x - y = 10$ and $y = 8$.
- $x - y = -10$ and $y = -8$.
- $x - y = 10$ and $y = -8$.
- $x - y = -10$ and $y = 8$.

Solving these equations, we find the vertices of the polygon to be:

- $(8, 2)$,
- $(-8, 2)$,
- $(-8, -2)$, and
- $(8, -2)$.

This is a square with side length $10$. The area of a square is the side length squared, so the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units. The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is $ ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

This equation is equal to zero if and only if at least one of the two factors is equal to zero. This gives us two systems of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From the first system, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$, $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us the rectangle with vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

From the second system, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$, $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us the rectangle with vertices at $(8, -8)$, $(8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$.

So, the two rectangles overlap, and the area of the convex polygon is the area of one of the rectangles. The area of a rectangle is given by the product of its length and width. The length and width of both rectangles are 16, so the area of the convex polygon is $16 \times 16 = 256$.

The answer is: $256$
