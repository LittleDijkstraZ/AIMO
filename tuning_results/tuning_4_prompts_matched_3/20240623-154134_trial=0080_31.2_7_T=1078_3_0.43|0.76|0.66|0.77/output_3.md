The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. Let's consider each case separately.

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
For the sum of two squares to be zero, both squares must be zero. This gives us:
$\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$
Solving these equations, we get:
$\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$
This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.
Solving these equations, we get the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
For the sum of two squares to be zero, both squares must be zero. This gives us:
$\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$
Solving these equations, we get:
$\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$
This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
This forms a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

However, the points that satisfy both cases simultaneously form a smaller square, which is the intersection of the two squares. The side length of this smaller square is 10 (the side length of the square formed by the first case), so the area of this smaller square is $10^2 = 100$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon formed by the points that satisfy the given equation is 100. The answer is: $100$

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, -2)$, and $(-8, 2)$.

Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$.

The intersection of these two squares is a smaller square with side length 4 and vertices at $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, -2)$, and $(-8, 2)$.

The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side. Therefore, the area of the smaller square is $4^2 = 16$.
The answer is: $16$

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$. These lines intersect at the point $(5,5)$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$. These lines intersect at the point $(8,8)$.

The points that satisfy the given equation are the points that lie on the lines $x + y = 10$, $x - y = 10$, $x = 8$, and $y = 8$. These lines enclose a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):

Approach:


The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero, which means either of the expressions must be zero. So we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
The solutions to these equations are the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length 10.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The solutions to these equations are the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length 16.

The intersection of the two cases is the square formed by the lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This square is contained within the larger square formed by the lines $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.

The area of the smaller square is $16^2 = 256$, and the area of the larger square is $10^2 = 100$. The area of the convex polygon formed by the intersection of the two cases is the difference between the areas of the two squares, which is $256 - 100 = 156$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 156. The answer is: $156$

The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. We will solve each case separately.

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$. These lines intersect at $(5,5)$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$. These lines intersect at $(8,8)$.

The four lines $x + y = 10$, $x - y = 10$, $x = 8$, and $y = 8$ enclose a square with side length 6 (since the distance between the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ is 6). The area of this square is $6^2 = 36$.
The answer is: $36$

Approach:


The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. We can analyze each case separately.

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
For the sum of two squares to be zero, both squares must be zero. This gives us:
$\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$
Solving these equations, we get:
$\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$
This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$
Solving these equations, we get the lines $y = -x \pm 10$ and $y = x \pm 10$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
For the sum of two squares to be zero, both squares must be zero. This gives us:
$\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$
Solving these equations, we get:
$\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$
This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$
So we get the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The four lines form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
This equation is satisfied only when both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$. These lines intersect at $(5,5)$ and form a square with side length $10$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
This equation is satisfied only when both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$. These lines also intersect at $(8,8)$ and form a square with side length $16$.

The area of the convex polygon formed by the intersection of these two squares is the area of the smaller square, which is $(10)^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $100$. The answer is: $100$
