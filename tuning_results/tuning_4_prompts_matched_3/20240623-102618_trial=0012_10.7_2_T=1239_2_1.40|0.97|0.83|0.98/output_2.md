Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To have 4 distinct solutions to the given equation, we need to choose a value of $m$ so that the right-hand side of the equation (which is $\frac{m}{100}$) satisfies a specific condition regarding the absolute value on the left-hand side.

For the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ to have 4 distinct solutions, the value $\frac{m}{100}$ must lie strictly between 2 and 1. This is because, on the left-hand side, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ can take values ranging from 1 to 3, and if we let the right-hand side range from 1 to 3 as well, we would only have 3 (and not 4) distinct solutions. The value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be strictly between 1 and 2 so as to give us 4 different solutions. This means $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, or $100 < m < 200$. Now we just need to find how many positive integers fall within this range, which can be found by subtracting the lower limit (100) from the upper limit (200) and adding 1 (for inclusive counting). Thus, the number of such positive integers $m$ is $200-100+1 = 101$. But this does not make sense as there is no $m$ giving 4 distinct solutions!
This was a mistake, let's reexamine our reasoning.

When we have $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, we know that for $|x - 1| - 2 = z$, there will be 4 distinct solutions when $z = \frac{m}{100}$ lies within $(0, 2)$. For $|x - 1| - 2 = z$, when $z < 0$, there are no solutions. When $z = 0$, there is one solution $x = 1$. When $0 < z < 2$, there are two solutions. When $z = 2$, there are two solutions if they're different from the case of $z < 2$. When $z > 2$, there are no solutions. Combining all the cases, we need $|x - 1| - 2 = z$ to have two solutions for $z = \frac{m}{100}$ in $(0, 2)$, so $\frac{m}{100}$ must be in $(1, 2)$.

This is exactly where $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$ comes from. So, with a proper understanding of the solutions to the absolute value equation, the correct range of $m$ is actually $100 < m < 200$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that make the original equation have four distinct solutions are the integers in the interval $(100, 200)$ and that is $200 - 100 -1 = 99$.
So the only step in the reasoning that was mistaken was finding the range of $m$ to be $100 < m < 200$. The correct inequality is actually $100 < m < 200$. Therefore, the number of positive integer solutions for $m$ is the number of elements in the set $\{m \in \mathbb Z | 100 < m < 200 \}$, or $(200 - 100) - 1 = 99$. Therefore, the total number of positive integer solutions for m is 99. The answer is: $99$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is a piecewise function, so it can be solved in steps.

First, let's set $\frac{m}{100}$ to $k$. Then we have $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = k$.
We consider two cases for the inner absolute value expression:

Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert - 2 = k$, so $\vert x - 1 \vert = k + 2$. Then two subcases:
- If $x - 1 \geq 0$, we have $x - 1 = k + 2 \Rightarrow x = k + 3$.
- If $x - 1 < 0$, we have $-(x - 1) = k + 2 \Rightarrow x = 1 - k - 2 \Rightarrow x = -k - 1$.

Case 2: $\vert x - 1 \vert - 2 = -k$, so $\vert x - 1 \vert = 2 - k$. Then the only subcase:
- If $x - 1 \geq 0$, we have $x - 1 = 2 - k \Rightarrow x = 3 - k$.
- If $x - 1 < 0$, we have $-(x - 1) = 2 - k \Rightarrow x = -1 + k + 2 \Rightarrow x = k + 1$.

So we have four solutions in terms of $k$: $x = k + 3$, $x = -k - 1$, $x = 3 - k$, and $x = k + 1$. 
For this system of equations to have four distinct solutions, the solution values for $x$ from the two cases must be different. By inspection we observe that the case 1 solutions will always be the same as the case 2 solutions for certain values of $k$. 

The case 1 solution $x = k + 3$ will equal the case 2 solution $x = k + 1$ when $k + 3 = k + 1$, which yields the contradiction $3 = 1$. This tells us that some of the solutions must be eliminated because they are the same. 
The case 1 solution $x = -k - 1$ will equal the case 2 solution $x = 3 - k$ when $-k - 1 = 3 - k$ which also yields the contradiction $1 = 3$. This also tells us that some of the solutions must be eliminated because they are the same.

Let's check the remaining solutions pairwise for $k \ge 0$:
- $k + 3 \neq 3 - k$, because the left hand side is $k + 3$ and the right hand side is $3 - k$. There is no equality.
- $k + 3 \neq k + 1$, because the left hand side is $k + 3$ and the right hand side is $k + 1$. There is no equality.
- $k + 1 \neq -k - 1$, because the left hand side is $k + 1$ and the right hand side is $-k - 1$. There is equality only when $k = 0$. So this is an extraneous case.
- $k + 1 \neq 3 - k$, because the left hand side is $k + 1$ and the right hand side is $3 - k$. There is no equality.
- $-k - 1 \neq -k - 1$, because both sides of the equation are $-k - 1$. There is an equality. This is an extraneous case.
- $-k - 1 \neq 3 - k$, because the left hand side is $-k - 1$ and the right hand side is $3 - k$. There is an equality only when $k = 2$. So this is an extraneous case.

Thus, the only cases that result in distinct solutions for $k \ge 0$ are $k + 3$ and $3 - k$ and $k + 1$ and $-k - 1$, because of some of the pairwise non-equalities.

For $k < 0$, we swap the absolute values in each of the two cases. In case 1, we then have $|x - 1| = -k + 2 \Rightarrow x = 1 \pm (-k + 2)$ which is equal to $1 - k + 2 = 3 - k$ and $1 + k - 2 = k - 1$. In case 2, we then have $|x - 1| = 2 - (-k) \Rightarrow x = 1 \pm (2 + k)$ which is equal to $1 + 2 + k = k + 3$ and $1 - 2 - k = -k - 1$. Thus, the solutions obtained this way are just the same as those we obtained for $k \ge 0$.

Considering all these, the only solutions that we are left with are $(k + 3)$ and $(3 - k)$ from case 1 and case 2 respectively. Let's combine these two: $k + 3 = 3 - k \implies k = 0$. Thus, there is only 1 value for $m = 100k = 100 \cdot 0 = 0$, which doesn't work.

Considering the case where $k > 2$, We will always have two positive integer solutions with distinct absolute values, because both $k + 3$ and $3 - k$ are positive integers and $k + 3 > 3 - k \implies k > 0$. For each $k$, the number of distinct solutions for the equation in this case is 4. If we require $k$ to be an integer in the range $(0,2)$ (so that $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$), there is no $k$ value that would satisfy this, hence there are 0 such $k$. We find that only $k=2$ will satisfy $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Hence for $m = 100 \cdot 2 = 200$, the number of distinct solutions would be 4.
Therefore, only one value for $m$ (namely 200) would satisfy the given condition. Hence $\boxed{1}$.
The answer is: $${\boxed{1}}$$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To the left of the equation we have an absolute value of an absolute value. This means that the graph of the function $y=\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is V-shaped with a base on the interval $[1-2, 1+2] = [ -1, 3]$. The function on this interval is equal to:
- $y = -(x-1) + 2 = -x + 3$ if $ x \leq 1$,
- $y = (x-1) - 2 = x - 3$ if $1 \le x \le 3$,
- and 0 elsewhere (since absolute values of negative numbers are negative, and absolute values of numbers larger than 3 are positive).

The graph thus has a "hump" centered at $x=1$ with a height of $2$ units. And to the right there's a $\tfrac{m}{100}$ which makes the graph shift upwards by a factor of $\tfrac{m}{100}$.

The right side of the equation equals to four distinct solutions exactly when graph of $\tfrac{m}{100}$ intersects the graph of $y=\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ at 4 points. This occurs exactly when $\tfrac{m}{100}$ is in the interval $(0,2)$. Thus the number of such $m$ is just 200. 

The answer is: $200$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The given equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.
The absolute value function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ reaches its minimum value of 0 at $x=3$ and maximum value of 4 at $x=-1$.
So for the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, we need $\frac{m}{100}$ to be in the interval $(0,4)$.
Multiplying by $100$, we get $0 < m < 400$.
The number of positive integer values of $m$ in this interval is $399$.
So the value of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 399.
The answer is: $\boxed{399}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To solve this problem, let's understand the graph of $y=\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ first. 

If we consider the expression inside the absolute value, that is $|x - 1| - 2$. This is a type of "V" shape graph (reminiscent of the letter "V"), with a vertex at $x = 1$. The "V" opens upwards, as when $x < 1$, $|x - 1| - 2$ becomes $-(x - 1) - 2 = -x + 3$. The graph changes slope at $x = 1$, where it goes from being a downward sloping line to an upward sloping line, with $|x - 1| - 2$ becoming $x - 1 - 2 = x - 3$. So the graph of $y = | | x - 1 | - 2 |$ is the graph of a "|" shape, where the left "arm" of the "|" moves along the $y$-axis as $x$ varies from $-\infty$ to $1$, while the right "arm" moves along the $y$-axis as $x$ varies from $1$ to $\infty$. The "|" is $2$ units wide, and $2$ units high.

Now, the equation is asking about how many times this "|" shaped graph intersects the line $y = m/100$, where $m$ is a positive integer from $1$ to $100$ (because $m/100$ is a positive number less than 1 when $m<100$). 

Looking at the graph, we notice that the "|" shaped graph is equal to $2$ for exactly two values of $x$. Therefore, for this equation to have 4 distinct solutions, we need two values of $m$ such that $0<m/100<2$ or $2<m/100<4$. That means $0<m<200$ and $200<m<400$. The possible values of $m$ are thus any integers in the range $(0,200) \cup (200, 400)$, or, equivalently, the union of the sets of integers in the ranges $(0, 200)$ and $(200, 400)$. 

The number of integers in a set from $a$ to $b$ is $(b-a)+1$, so: 
- The number of positive integers in the interval (0, 200) is (200 - 0) + 1 = 200 + 1 = 201.
- The number of positive integers in the interval (200, 400) is (400 - 200) + 1 = 200 + 1 = 201.

So, to get the total number of integers $m$, we add these two results together. This gives us 201 + 201 = 402. However, m is only from 1 to 100, so we have to get back the overlap in the range for m. When we add these two sets together (0,200) and (200,400), the overlap is (200, 400). Since there is 1 positive integer $m$ in the range (200,400), which is equivalent to the number of integers in the intersection of the two sets, we need to subtract this integer from our total result. So we subtract 1 from 402 to get 402 - 1 = 401. 

And now, to return to our original problem: we were looking for the number of positive integers $m$, and according to our analysis, there are 401 such integers $m$ for which the given equation has four distinct solutions. The solution is therefore 1.

But let's revisit that step from before. Shouldn't we add the possible values of $m$ from both sets? Why did we need to subtract one? The answer lies in the question itself: "how many positive integers $m$". Looking back at the original problem again, it only asked for positive integer $m$ values ranging from $1$ to $100$. This restriction eliminates the number 401 as a possible value for $m$, but if you didn't pay attention to the problem's conditions, your answer might include a possible value greater than $100$ (which isn't valid either) or less than $1$ (which is excluded by definition). The requirement that $m$ be a positive integer less than or equal to $100$ eliminates the integers that are not in our desired range $(1, 100).$

If you were asked how many possible values of $m$ fit in the entire integer set for example in the open interval $(-100, 100)$, your answer would include 201 numbers, including positive and negative integers. The situation is the same here but with much stricter conditions that we didn't need to consider when just asking for "any" positive integers.

So, indeed, from the problem's conditions that m is only from 1 to 100, we need to subtract the overlap and come up with the right answer: 402 - 1 = 401.

Therefore, the positive integer $m$ for the original problem that allows the equation to have $4$ distinct solutions is $1$. The answer is $1$. The equation has $4$ distinct solutions only for $1$ value of $m$. In other words, only $1$ equation in the set of equations $ \vert \vert x - 1 \vert - 2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$ with $m$ a positive integer from $1$ to $100$ has four solutions. And the value of $m$ for this specific equation is $100$. This value is the unique solution to the original problem. So, the number of positive integers $m$ that allows the equation to have $4$ distinct solutions in the set of equations with $m$ a positive integer from $1$ to $100$ is $1$. The value of $m$ for the unique equation that has $4$ distinct solutions is also $1$. Answer: 1.
The answer is $\boxed{1}$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions means that the right side, $\frac{m}{100}$, is equal to 2. So we have $| |x-1|-2|=2$.
This equation splits into two cases:
Case 1: $|x-1|-2=2$, so $|x-1|=4$. This gives us two equations: $x-1=4$ and $x-1=-4$. So $x=5$ and $x=-3$.
Case 2: $|x-1|-2=-2$, so $|x-1|=0$. This gives us one equation: $x-1=0$, so $x=1$.
So the only solution from Case 1 is $x=5$ or $x=-3$, and the solution from Case 2 is $x=1$. Therefore, the 4 distinct solutions are $x=5$, $x=-3$, and $x=1$.
The value of m can be found by setting $\frac{m}{100}$ equal to 2, so we have $m=200$.
Therefore, the number of positive integer m for which the equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 1.
The answer is: $\boxed{1}$

Step-by-step Solution:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. Thus, $m = 200$. Therefore, the value of $m$ that satisfies the equation is $200$. Hence, there is only one such positive integer $m$.
