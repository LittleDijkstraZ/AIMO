Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to 2. 

To see why, let's first analyze the graph of the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. 

The function $f(x)$ is a "hump" function that reaches a maximum at $x=1$, and its value decreases as $x$ moves away from 1 in either direction. Specifically, the function is equal to 2 when $x$ is less than 1 and greater than 3, it is equal to 1 when $x$ is equal to 1 or 3, and it is equal to 0 when $x$ is equal to 1 and 3.

Therefore, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}=2$, which implies $m=200$.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 1, the value of 200.

The answer is: $1$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To solve this problem, we first need to understand the graph of $y = ||x-1| - 2|$.
The graph of $y = ||x-1| - 2|$ has a shape of a "V" with two "hills" and two "valleys".
The heights of the "hills" and "valleys" are both 2.
The "hills" are at $x = 1 \pm 2$, which are $x = -1$ and $x = 3$.
The "valleys" are at $x = 1 \pm 2$, which are $x = -3$ and $x = 5$.
The equation $||\vert x-1 \vert - 2\vert = \frac{m}{100}$ will have 4 distinct solutions if $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to the difference in height between two consecutive "valleys" or "hills".
The difference in height between two consecutive "valleys" is $2 - (-2) = 4$.
The difference in height between two consecutive "hills" is also $4$.
So, $\frac{m}{100} = 4$ and $m = 400$.
Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions, which is $m = 400$. The answer is: 1

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.
Let's consider the graph of $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. This graph is a "V" shape with the vertex at $(1,2)$. The slope of the two sides of the "V" are $-1$ and $1$.
For the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, the horizontal line $y = \frac{m}{100}$ must intersect the graph at 4 distinct points.
This means that $\frac{m}{100}$ must be between 0 and 2, but not equal to 0 or 2.
So, $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$.
Multiplying all sides by 100, we get $0 < m < 200$.
And since $m$ must be a positive integer, the possible values for $m$ are the integers from 1 to 199.
But we need to exclude the cases when $m$ equals 0 or 200.
So the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition is $199 - 2 = 197$.
The answer is: 197

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.
For the absolute value equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=k$, where $k$ is a positive number, it has 4 distinct solutions when $k=\frac{1}{2}$.
So, we need to find the value of $m$ such that $\frac{m}{100}=\frac{1}{2}$.
Solving for $m$, we get $m=50$.
Therefore, the value of $m$ is 50. The answer is: $1$

Step-by-step Solution:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}=2$.

If $\frac{m}{100}=2$, then $m=200$.

Therefore, the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is $200$.
The answer is: $1$
