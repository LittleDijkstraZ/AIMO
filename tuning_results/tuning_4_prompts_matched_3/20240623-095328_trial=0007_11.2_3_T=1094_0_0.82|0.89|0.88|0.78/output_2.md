 The problem is asking for how many positive integers $m$ the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

The number of solutions of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ depends on the value of $\frac{m}{100}$. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is $2$. Therefore, $m$ must be $200$.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ is $1$. The answer is: $1$

 The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be solved by considering the cases for the inner absolute value.

For $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, we have two subcases:
1. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.
2. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.

For each of these subcases, we have two more absolute value equations to consider:

For $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, we get two more subcases:
a. $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.
b. $x-1 = -(2 + \frac{m}{100})$, which simplifies to $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Similarly, for $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, we get two more subcases:
c. $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
d. $x-1 = -(2 - \frac{m}{100})$, which simplifies to $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

So, we have a total of 4 possible solutions for $x$: $3 + \frac{m}{100}$, $-1 - \frac{m}{100}$, $3 - \frac{m}{100}$, and $-1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

For these 4 solutions to be distinct, we need the denominators of the fractions to be different. This implies that $m$ cannot be a multiple of $100$.

Therefore, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $1 \le m \le 100$ and $m$ is not a multiple of $100$. The multiples of $100$ in this range are $100$, so the number of such positive integers $m$ is $100 - \left\lfloor \frac{100}{100} \right\rfloor = 100 - 1 = 99$.

However, we are asked for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation has 4 distinct solutions, not the number of positive integers $m$ that are not multiples of $100$. It turns out that for $m$ not a multiple of $100$, the equation always has 4 distinct solutions. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation has 4 distinct solutions is the same as the number of positive integers $m$ that are not multiples of $100$, which is $99$.
The answer is: $99$

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to 2. Therefore, we have $m = 200$. So the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition is 1.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that make the equation have 4 distinct solutions is 1. The answer is: $1$

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"

Assistant:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions, it must be in the form of $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
For the first case, $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, we have two subcases: $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 = -(2 + \frac{m}{100})$.
The first subcase gives $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$, and the second subcase gives $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.
For the second case, $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, we also have two subcases: $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 = -(2 - \frac{m}{100})$.
The first subcase gives $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, and the second subcase gives $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.
For these four solutions to be distinct, we need $-1 - \frac{m}{100} < -1 + \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $m > 0$.
And we also need $3 + \frac{m}{100} > 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $m > 0$.
So $m$ must be a positive integer.
Also, we need $0 < 2 + \frac{m}{100} < 4$, which simplifies to $0 < m < 200$.
And we need $0 < 2 - \frac{m}{100} < 4$, which simplifies to $0 < m < 200$.
Therefore, the only positive integer $m$ that satisfies all the conditions is $m = 100$.
The answer is: $1$

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"

Assistant:

 To solve this problem, we need to analyze the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ and find out for how many positive integers $m$ it has $4$ distinct solutions.

First, let's consider the right-hand side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$. Since $m$ is a positive integer, $\frac{m}{100}$ is a positive fraction. The left-hand side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, is a piecewise function with $4$ cases to consider:

1. When $\vert x-1 \vert -2 > 0$, we have $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \vert x-1 \vert -2$.
2. When $0 \geq \vert x-1 \vert -2 \geq -2$, we have $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = 2 - \vert x-1 \vert$.
3. When $\vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0$, we have $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = -( \vert x-1 \vert -2) = 2 - \vert x-1 \vert$.
4. When $\vert x-1 \vert -2 \leq -2$, we have $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \vert x-1 \vert -2$.

For the equation to have $4$ distinct solutions, the right-hand side $\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal to one of the cases (1) or (3). This is because cases (2) and (4) only have $2$ distinct solutions, while case (1) and case (3) each have $4$ distinct solutions.

So, we need to find the values of $m$ for which $\frac{m}{100} = 2 - \vert x-1 \vert$.

We can see that the right-hand side of this equation, $2 - \vert x-1 \vert$, is always less than or equal to $2$. So, for the equation to have $4$ distinct solutions, $\frac{m}{100}$ must also be less than or equal to $2$. This means $m \leq 200$.

On the other hand, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be greater than $0$, so $m > 0$.

Therefore, the possible values of $m$ are the positive integers from $1$ to $200$.

Now we need to find how many of these values of $m$ make the equation have $4$ distinct solutions. This can be done by analyzing the piecewise function or by graphing it.

By analyzing or graphing the piecewise function, we find that the equation has $4$ distinct solutions when $m = 100$. So, there is only one value of $m$ that makes the equation have $4$ distinct solutions.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $1$.
The answer is: $1$
