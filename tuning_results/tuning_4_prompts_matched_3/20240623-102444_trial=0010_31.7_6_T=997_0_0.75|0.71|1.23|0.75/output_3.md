The equation $AB=0$ is equivalent to $A=0$ or $B=0$. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$. Similarly, the equations $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ imply $x - y = \pm 10$, $x = \pm 8$, and $y = \pm 8$, respectively.

These equations represent the sides of a square with side length 16 (since the distance between the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$ is 10, and the distance between the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$ is 16). Therefore, the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The equation $AB=0$ is satisfied if and only if $A=0$ or $B=0$. Therefore, the given equation is satisfied if and only if either
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$$
or
$$((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$
The first equation is satisfied if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies that $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$. The second equation is satisfied if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Therefore, the points that satisfy the given equation are the vertices of a square with side length 20. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$. The answer is: $400$

The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. This expression is zero if and only if both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$. These lines intersect at the point $(5, 5)$.

The second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. This expression is zero if and only if both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$. These lines intersect at the point $(8, 8)$.

Therefore, the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the given equation are the points on the lines $x + y = 10$, $x - y = 10$, $x = 8$, and $y = 8$. These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(5, 5)$, $(8, 8)$, $(8, 5)$, and $(5, 8)$. The length of the rectangle is $8 - 5 = 3$ and the width is $8 - 5 = 3$. Therefore, the area of the rectangle is $3 \times 3 = 9$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 9.

```python

def polygon_area():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    # The sides of the rectangle are 3 units long
    length = 3
    width = 3

    # Calculate the area of the rectangle
    area = length * width

    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

The area of the convex polygon is 9 square units. The answer is $\boxed{9}$.

This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersection of these lines form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units.

Here is a Python code to calculate the area:

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. 

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$ and the second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$.

If the first expression is zero, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon.

If the second expression is zero, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon.

The vertices of the polygon are the points where the absolute value expressions are equal to zero. These are the points $(-8, -8), (-8, 8), (8, -8),$ and $(8, 8)$.

To find the area of the polygon, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle, which is length times width. The length of the rectangle is 16 (from $-8$ to $8$ on the x-axis) and the width is also 16 (from $-8$ to $8$ on the y-axis). So the area of the rectangle is $16 \times 16 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units.

```python

    length = 16
    width = 16
    area = length * width
    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)

The area of the convex polygon is $256$ square units. The answer is $\boxed{256}$.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

The equation $A \cdot B = 0$ implies that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the given equation is satisfied if either of the following two conditions is true:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first condition to be true, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us four lines in the coordinate plane: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle with side lengths of 20 units.

For the second condition to be true, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us four lines in the coordinate plane: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length of 16 units.

The intersection of the two sets of lines is a smaller square with side length of 8 units, which is inside the rectangle. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of the rectangle minus the area of the smaller square.

The area of the rectangle is $20 \times 20 = 400$ square units, and the area of the smaller square is $8 \times 8 = 64$ square units. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $400 - 64 = 336$ square units. The answer is: $336$

 The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. 

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, and this equals zero if and only if both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these equations are all points of the form $(x, y)$ where the distance between $(x, y)$ and the origin is 10. This is a circle centered at the origin with radius 10.

The second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$, and this equals zero if and only if both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are all points of the form $(x, y)$ where the distance between $(x, y)$ and the origin is 8. This is a circle centered at the origin with radius 8.

The intersection of these two circles is a square with side length 16 (since the difference in the radii of the two circles is 2, and the side length of the square is twice this difference). The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points satisfying the given equation is 256.

Here is a Python code to calculate the area of the square:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def square_area():
    side_length = 2 * (10 - 8)
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

The area of the convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$
