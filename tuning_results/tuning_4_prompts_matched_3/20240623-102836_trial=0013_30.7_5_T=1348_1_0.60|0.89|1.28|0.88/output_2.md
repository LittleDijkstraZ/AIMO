Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. This means that the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be equal to $2$. Therefore, we have $m=200$.

Now, let's verify that $m=200$ is a positive integer:

$200$ is a positive integer, so our answer is valid.

Therefore, the value of $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $200$. The answer is: $200$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. This implies that the right hand side $\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal to $1$, because only when $\frac{m}{100}=1$, the absolute value equation has $4$ solutions. So we have $m=100$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the equation is $1$.
The answer is: $1$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The given equation is $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ and it has 4 distinct solutions. We know that $\frac{m}{100}$ is a positive number, so $m$ must be a positive integer.

The number of solutions of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is determined by the value of $\frac{m}{100}$. Specifically, the equation has 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ falls into the interval $(0, 1]$.

This means that $0 < \frac{m}{100} \leq 1$, so $0 < m \leq 100$. Therefore, the positive integer $m$ that satisfies the condition is $m = 100$.

So the number of positive integers $m$ that make the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have 4 distinct solutions is 1. The answer is: $1$

Assistant:

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation has four distinct solutions, and we know that the absolute value function creates a V-shape on a graph. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have four distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is the height of the V's such that the V's intersect at exactly four points.

Now, let's solve the problem using sympy:

1. Identify the sympy functions required for each step.

We need to find the value of $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions. This is equivalent to finding the value of $m$ such that $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$.

2. Implement these functions step-by-step, commenting each line for clarity.

To find the value of $m$, we can set up the inequality $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$ and solve for $m$. Multiplying all sides of the inequality by $100$ gives $0 < m < 200$.

So, $m$ must be an integer in the range $(0, 200)$.

3. Calculate the final answer and verify it's a positive integer.

The number of positive integers in the range $(0, 200)$ is $199$.

4. Output the result.

The value of $m$ is $199$. This is a positive integer. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions is $1$. The answer is: $\boxed{1}$

Assistant:

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. The right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be positive, so $m$ must be positive. The left side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, is a piecewise function that has four linear pieces. The equation has 4 distinct solutions when the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ falls into a certain range.

To find this range, we can graph the left side of the equation and look for the interval where it intersects with the horizontal line $y = \frac{m}{100}$ exactly 4 times. The graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a V-shape with vertices at $x = -1, 1, 3, 5$. The equation has 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is in the interval $(0, 1]$. Therefore, $0 < \frac{m}{100} \leq 1$, which implies $0 < m \leq 100$. The number of positive integers $m$ in this interval is 100. So, the value of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 100.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 1. The answer is: $1$
