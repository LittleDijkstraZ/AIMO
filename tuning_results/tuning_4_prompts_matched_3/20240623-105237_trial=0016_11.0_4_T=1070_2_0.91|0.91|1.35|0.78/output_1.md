Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The first step is to rewrite the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ in a more convenient form. 

By the property of absolute value, we know that $|a| + |b| = |a+b|$ if and only if $a$ and $b$ have the same sign. Therefore, we can rewrite the equation as:
$$|x-2y - (y-2x)| = 40.$$
Simplifying the expression inside the absolute value gives:
$$|(x-2y) - (y-2x)| = 40.$$
Further simplifying gives:
$$|x - 2y - y + 2x| = 40.$$
Combining like terms gives:
$$|3x - 3y| = 40.$$
Dividing both sides by 3 gives:
$$|x - y| = \frac{40}{3}.$$
Now, let's consider the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite it as:
$$5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x-y)^2 + 2xy] - 8xy.$$
Let $z = x - y$, then $x = y + z$. Substituting this into the above equation gives:
$$5[(z)^2 + 2(y+z)y] - 8(y+z)y.$$
Simplifying gives:
$$5[z^2 + 2y^2 + 2zy] - 8y^2 - 8zy.$$
Expanding and rearranging terms gives:
$$5z^2 + 10y^2 + 10zy - 8y^2 - 8zy = 5z^2 + 2y^2 + 2zy.$$
Now, we know that $|z| = \frac{40}{3}$, so $z^2 = \left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{1600}{9}$.
Substituting this into the equation gives:
$$5\left(\frac{1600}{9}\right) + 2y^2 + 2y\left(\frac{40}{3}\right) = \frac{8000}{9} + 2y^2 + \frac{80y}{3}.$$
Now, we want to minimize the expression $\frac{8000}{9} + 2y^2 + \frac{80y}{3}$.
By the Trivial Inequality, we know that $(y+\frac{40}{6})^2 = y^2 + \frac{80y}{6} + \frac{1600}{36}$ is always greater than or equal to 0. So, we have:
$$y^2 + \frac{80y}{6} + \frac{1600}{36} \geq 0.$$
Multiplying through by 36 to clear the fraction gives:
$$36y^2 + 480y + 1600 \geq 0.$$
Subtracting $\frac{8000}{9}$ from both sides gives:
$$\frac{8000}{9} + 2y^2 + \frac{80y}{3} \geq \frac{8000}{9}.$$
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\frac{8000}{9}$.
The answer is: $8000/9$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we observe that the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$.
Then, we recognize that the expression inside each absolute value is the difference between two terms, so we can use the property $|a-b| = |b-a|$ to rewrite the equation as $|2y-x| + |x-2y| = 40$.
This simplifies to $2|2y-x| = 40$, or $|2y-x| = 20$.
Next, we square both sides of the equation to get rid of the absolute value, resulting in $(2y-x)^2 = 400$.
Expanding and simplifying, we have $4y^2 - 4xy + x^2 = 400$.
Rearranging terms, we obtain $x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2 = 400$.
Now, let's consider the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$. We can rewrite this as $5(x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2) = 5(400) = 2000$.
So, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is 2000. The answer is: $2000$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To solve this problem, we need to use the given condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
First, we can rewrite the absolute value expressions as follows:
$|x-2y| + |y-2x| = (2x-y) + (2y-x) = x + y = 40$.
Now we have the equation $x + y = 40$.
We can solve this equation for $y$ to get $y = 40 - x$.
Next, we substitute $y = 40 - x$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to get:
$5x^2 + 5(40 - x)^2 - 8x(40 - x)$.
Expanding this expression, we get:
$5x^2 + 5(1600 - 80x + x^2) - 320x + 8x^2$
$= 5x^2 + 8000 - 400x + 5x^2 - 320x + 8x^2$
$= 18x^2 - 720x + 8000$.
This is a quadratic function in $x$.
The minimum value of a quadratic function $ax^2 + bx + c$ is achieved at $x = -\frac{b}{2a}$.
In this case, $a = 18$ and $b = -720$, so the minimum value is achieved at $x = -\frac{-720}{2*18} = 20$.
Substituting $x = 20$ into the equation $x + y = 40$, we get $y = 20$.
Finally, we substitute $x = 20$ and $y = 20$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to get:
$5(20)^2 + 5(20)^2 - 8(20)(20) = 2000 + 2000 - 3200 = 800$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 800. The answer is: $800$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we can rewrite the given equation as $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, we have $|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |(x-2y) - (y-2x)| = |x-2y-y+2x| = |x-3y+2x-y| = |3x-4y| = 40$.
Therefore, we have $|3x-4y| = 40$.
Now, we can express the given expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $(3x-4y)^2 - 39xy$.
By the above equation, we know that $(3x-4y)^2 = 40^2 = 1600$.
So, $(3x-4y)^2 - 39xy = 1600 - 39xy$.
To minimize this expression, we need to maximize $xy$.
By the AM-GM inequality, we have $xy \leq \left(\frac{x+y}{2}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{3x-4y}{6}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{40}{6}\right)^2 = \frac{400}{9}$.
Equality occurs when $x=y$, so the maximum value of $xy$ is $\frac{400}{9}$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $1600 - 39 \cdot \frac{400}{9} = 1600 - \frac{15600}{9} = \frac{14400 - 15600}{9} = \frac{-1200}{9} = -\frac{400}{3}$.
However, this is not possible since the expression is a sum of squares and cannot be negative.
The mistake we made is that we assumed $x=y$ when applying the AM-GM inequality.
In fact, the maximum value of $xy$ is not achieved when $x=y$.
To find the maximum value of $xy$ under the condition $|3x-4y| = 40$, we can consider the case when $3x-4y$ and $y-2x$ have opposite signs.
Without loss of generality, let $3x-4y > 0$ and $y-2x < 0$.
Then we have $3x-4y = 40$ and $y-2x > 0$.
From the first equation, we have $y = \frac{3x-40}{4}$.
Substituting this into the second equation, we get $\frac{3x-40}{4} - 2x > 0$.
Simplifying, we have $3x-40-8x > 0$, which gives $x < \frac{40}{5} = 8$.
Since $x$ and $y$ are real numbers, the maximum value of $xy$ occurs when $x=8$ and $y=\frac{3(8)-40}{4} = -2$.
So, the maximum value of $xy$ is $8 \cdot (-2) = -16$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $1600 - 39 \cdot (-16) = 1600 + 624 = 2224$.
The answer is: $-400/3$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $1600 - 39 \cdot (-16) = 1600 + 624 = 2224$.
The answer is: $2224$.
The answer is: $\boxed{2224}$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, we can rewrite the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, we know that $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$.
So, we have $|x-2y| + |2y-x| \geq |(x-2y) + (2y-x)| = |0| = 0$.
But $|x-2y| + |2y-x|$ is equal to 40. So, the equality must hold.
This means that $(x-2y)$ and $(2y-x)$ must have the same sign.
If $(x-2y)$ and $(2y-x)$ are both positive, then we have $x-2y = 2y-x$, which simplifies to $x = 2y$.
If $(x-2y)$ and $(2y-x)$ are both negative, then we have $-(x-2y) = -(2y-x)$, which also simplifies to $x = 2y$.
So, we must have $x = 2y$.
Now, substitute $x = 2y$ into the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we get $|2y-2y| + |y-4y| = 40$, which simplifies to $|0| + |-3y| = 40$.
This gives us $|-3y| = 40$, so $|y| = \frac{40}{3}$.
Since $x = 2y$, we have $x = 2 \cdot \frac{40}{3} = \frac{80}{3}$.
Now, substitute $x = \frac{80}{3}$ and $y = \frac{40}{3}$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get
\begin{align*}
5 \left(\frac{80}{3}\right)^2 + 5 \left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 - 8 \cdot \frac{80}{3} \cdot \frac{40}{3} &= \frac{32000}{9} + \frac{6400}{9} - \frac{25600}{9} \\
&= \frac{12800}{9}.
\end{align*}
So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\frac{12800}{9}$.
The answer is: $\boxed{\frac{12800}{9}}$

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's rewrite the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$.
Now, let's consider the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite it as $(5x^2-8xy+4y^2) + (y^2-8xy+4x^2) = (5x^2-8xy+4y^2) + ((y-2x)^2)$.
Using the identity $|a| = \sqrt{a^2}$, we can rewrite the equation $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$ as $\sqrt{(2y-x)^2} + \sqrt{(2x-y)^2} = 40$, which simplifies to $\sqrt{(x-2y)^2} + \sqrt{(y-2x)^2} = 40$.
Since the square root of a square is the absolute value, we have $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
Now, we know that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, and we want to find the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.
By the Triangle Inequality, we know that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |(x-2y) + (y-2x)| = |x-2y + y-2x| = |-x+y| = |y-x|$.
So, $|y-x| = 40$.
Now, let's find the value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.
We know that $|y-x| = 40$, so $(y-x)^2 = 1600$.
Expanding, we get $y^2 - 2xy + x^2 = 1600$.
Multiplying by 5, we get $5y^2 - 10xy + 5x^2 = 8000$.
Now, let's subtract $8xy$ from both sides: $5y^2 - 18xy + 5x^2 = 8000 - 8xy$.
Rearranging terms, we get $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 8000 - 8xy$.
Since we want to find the minimum value of this expression, we want to minimize $8xy$.
By the AM-GM inequality, we know that $8xy \geq -2\sqrt{(8xy)(8xy)} = -1600$.
So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $8000 - 1600 = 6400$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 6400. The answer is: $6400$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's simplify the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
Using the property $|a| = |-a|$, we can rewrite this as $|x-2y| + |2x-y| = 40$.
Now, let's consider the two cases for each absolute value:
Case 1: $x-2y \ge 0$ and $2x-y \ge 0$. In this case, we have $x-2y + 2x-y = 40$, which simplifies to $3x-3y = 40$, or $x-y = \frac{40}{3}$.
Case 2: $x-2y < 0$ and $2x-y < 0$. In this case, we have $-x+2y -2x+y = 40$, which simplifies to $-3x+3y = 40$, or $x-y = -\frac{40}{3}$.
Now, we can see that in both cases, $x-y$ is a constant, either $\frac{40}{3}$ or $-\frac{40}{3}$.
This means that for any values of $x$ and $y$ that satisfy the given equation, $x-y$ must be equal to either $\frac{40}{3}$ or $-\frac{40}{3}$.
Now, let's substitute $x-y = \frac{40}{3}$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
$5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(x-y)^2 + 3xy = 5\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 + 3xy$.
Now, let's substitute $x-y = -\frac{40}{3}$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
$5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(x-y)^2 - 3xy = 5\left(-\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 - 3xy$.
Since we want to find the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we can see that the second case gives a negative value for $3xy$, while the first case gives a positive value for $3xy$.
Therefore, we should choose the first case, $x-y = \frac{40}{3}$, to minimize $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.
Now, let's substitute $x-y = \frac{40}{3}$ into the equation $x-y = \frac{40}{3}$ to solve for $x$ in terms of $y$:
$x = y + \frac{40}{3}$.
Now, substitute this into the equation $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
$5\left(y + \frac{40}{3}\right)^2 + 5y^2 - 8y\left(y + \frac{40}{3}\right)$.
Expanding and simplifying, we get:
$5\left(y^2 + \frac{80y}{3} + \frac{1600}{9}\right) + 5y^2 - 8y^2 - \frac{320y}{3}$.
Simplifying further:
$5y^2 + \frac{400y}{3} + \frac{8000}{9} + 5y^2 - 8y^2 - \frac{320y}{3}$.
Combining like terms:
$2y^2 - \frac{80y}{3} + \frac{8000}{9}$.
Now, we can complete the square:
$2\left(y^2 - \frac{40y}{3}\right) + \frac{8000}{9}$.
$2\left(y^2 - \frac{40y}{3} + \frac{400}{9}\right) + \frac{8000}{9} - 2\cdot\frac{400}{9}$.
$2\left(y - \frac{20}{3}\right)^2 + \frac{8000}{9} - \frac{800}{9}$.
$2\left(y - \frac{20}{3}\right)^2 + \frac{7200}{9}$.
$2\left(y - \frac{20}{3}\right)^2 + \frac{800}{3}$.
The minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\frac{800}{3}$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\frac{800}{3}$. The answer is: $\boxed{\frac{800}{3}}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we notice that the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ can be rewritten as $5(x^2+y^2)-8xy$. This expression is a quadratic in disguise. We can complete the square to make it more obvious.

The square completion of $5(x^2+y^2)-8xy$ is $5[(x-y)^2+3xy]$.

Now, let's substitute $u = x - y$ and $v = y - 2x$, then we have $x = \frac{v}{1-2}$ and $y = \frac{u+v}{1-2}$, and we can substitute these into the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$:

$$|u| + |v| = 40.$$

By the triangle inequality, we have $|u| + |v| \geq |u+v|$, so $|u+v| \leq 40$. On the other hand, by the reverse triangle inequality, we have $|u+v| \geq ||u|-|v||$, so $|u-v| \leq 40$.

Now we need to minimize the expression $5[(x-y)^2+3xy] = 5[u^2+3(\frac{u+v}{1-2})(\frac{v}{1-2})] = 5[u^2+\frac{3uv}{1-2}+\frac{3v^2}{(1-2)^2}]$.

By AM-GM, we have $u^2+\frac{3uv}{1-2}+\frac{3v^2}{(1-2)^2} \geq 3\sqrt[3]{u^2 \cdot \frac{3uv}{1-2} \cdot \frac{3v^2}{(1-2)^2}} = 3\sqrt[3]{u^2 \cdot 3uv \cdot v^2} = 3\sqrt[3]{(uv)^3} = 3|uv|$.

So we need to minimize $3|uv|$. But we know that $|u+v| \leq 40$ and $|u-v| \leq 40$, so by the reverse triangle inequality again, we have $|u| \leq 40$ and $|v| \leq 40$, which implies $|uv| \leq 40^2 = 1600$.

So the minimum value of $3|uv|$ is $3 \cdot 0 = 0$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5[(x-y)^2+3xy]$ is $0$, and the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\boxed{0}$. The answer is: $0$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To solve this problem, we first need to find the relationship between $x$ and $y$ from the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
Without loss of generality, let's assume $x \geq 2y$. Then, the equation becomes:
\[x - 2y + y - 2x = 40 \implies -x - y = 40 \implies x + y = -40.\]
Now, let's substitute $y = -x - 40$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
\[5x^2+5(-x - 40)^2 - 8x(-x - 40) = 5x^2 + 5(x^2 + 80x + 1600) + 8x^2 + 320x = 13x^2 + 400x + 8000.\]
To find the minimum value of this expression, we can take the derivative with respect to $x$ and set it equal to zero:
\[26x + 400 = 0 \implies x = -\frac{400}{26} = -\frac{200}{13}.\]
Substituting this value of $x$ back into $y = -x - 40$ gives:
\[y = -\left(-\frac{200}{13}\right) - 40 = \frac{200}{13} - 40 = \frac{200 - 520}{13} = -\frac{320}{13}.\]
Now, we can substitute these values of $x$ and $y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
\[5\left(-\frac{200}{13}\right)^2 + 5\left(-\frac{320}{13}\right)^2 - 8\left(-\frac{200}{13}\right)\left(-\frac{320}{13}\right) = \frac{20000}{169} + \frac{320000}{169} + \frac{512000}{169} = \frac{853200}{169} = 5013.\]
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $5013$. The answer is: $5013$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's rewrite the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ in a more convenient form.

By the absolute value definition, we have $|a| = a$ or $|a| = -a$. Therefore, we can split the equation into two cases:

Case 1: $x - 2y + y - 2x = 40$, which simplifies to $-x - y = 40$, or $x + y = -40$.

Case 2: $x - 2y - (y - 2x) = 40$, which simplifies to $x - 2y - y + 2x = 40$, or $3x - 3y = 40$, or $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$.

Now, let's substitute $x = -40 - y$ from Case 1 into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
\[5(-40 - y)^2 + 5y^2 - 8(-40 - y)y = 5(1600 + 80y + y^2) + 5y^2 + 320y = 8000 + 400y + 5y^2 + 5y^2 + 320y = 8000 + 720y + 10y^2.\]
This expression is minimized when $720y$ is minimized. Since the expression is linear in $y$, the minimum is achieved when $y$ is the smallest possible value. However, we must also satisfy the constraint from Case 2, $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$, or $x = y + \frac{40}{3}$.

Substituting this into the equation from Case 1, we get $y + \frac{40}{3} + y = -40$, or $2y = -40 - \frac{40}{3} = -\frac{160}{3}$. Therefore, $y = -\frac{80}{3}$.

Substituting this back into the equation $x = y + \frac{40}{3}$, we get $x = -\frac{80}{3} + \frac{40}{3} = -\frac{40}{3}$.

Now we can substitute $x = -\frac{40}{3}$ and $y = -\frac{80}{3}$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
\[5\left(-\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 + 5\left(-\frac{80}{3}\right)^2 - 8\left(-\frac{40}{3}\right)\left(-\frac{80}{3}\right) = 5\cdot\frac{1600}{9} + 5\cdot\frac{6400}{9} + \frac{25600}{9} = \frac{8000}{9} + \frac{32000}{9} + \frac{25600}{9} = \frac{65600}{9}.\]
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $\frac{65600}{9}$. However, this does not match with any of the answer choices provided. 

Let's check our work.

It seems we made a mistake in our work. Let's try a different approach.

By the Titu's Lemma, we have
\[(5x^2+5y^2-8xy)\left(\frac{1}{5}+\frac{1}{5}-\frac{8}{5}\right) \geq (x+y)^2.\]
Then
\[(5x^2+5y^2-8xy)\left(\frac{-2}{5}\right) \geq (x+y)^2.\]
Since $x + y = -40$, we have
\[(5x^2+5y^2-8xy)\left(\frac{-2}{5}\right) \geq (-40)^2.\]
This gives us
\[5x^2+5y^2-8xy \geq \frac{8000}{2} = 4000.\]
So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 4000.

Comparing this with the answer choices, we see that the minimum value is indeed 4000. The answer is:
\[\boxed{4000}.\]

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



We first notice that the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is a quadratic form, which can be rewritten as:
\[5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy = \frac{1}{2} [(5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy) + (5x^2 + 5y^2 + 8xy)] = \frac{1}{2} [(5x^2 + 5y^2) + (5x^2 + 5y^2)] = 5(x^2 + y^2).\]

We want to find the minimum value of this expression given the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.

First, we simplify the constraint:
\[|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |x-2y| + |-(x-2y)| = 2|x-2y| = 40 \implies |x-2y| = 20.\]

From this, we know that $x-2y = \pm 20$. We can consider two cases:

Case 1: $x-2y = 20$. Then $x = 2y + 20$. Substituting this into the quadratic form, we get:
\[5(x^2 + y^2) = 5[(2y + 20)^2 + y^2] = 5[4y^2 + 80y + 400 + y^2] = 5[5y^2 + 80y + 400] = 25y^2 + 400y + 2000.\]

Now, we want to minimize this expression. To do this, we can use the fact that for a quadratic function $f(y) = ay^2 + by + c$, its minimum value occurs at $y = -\frac{b}{2a}$. In this case, $a = 25$ and $b = 400$, so the minimum occurs at $y = -\frac{400}{2*25} = -8$. Then, we can find the corresponding value of $x$: $x = 2(-8) + 20 = 4$.

Substituting these values into the quadratic form, we get:
\[5(x^2 + y^2) = 5(4^2 + (-8)^2) = 5(16 + 64) = 5*80 = 400.\]

Case 2: $x-2y = -20$. Then $x = 2y - 20$. Substituting this into the quadratic form, we get:
\[5(x^2 + y^2) = 5[(2y - 20)^2 + y^2] = 5[4y^2 - 80y + 400 + y^2] = 5[5y^2 - 80y + 400] = 25y^2 - 400y + 2000.\]

Again, we want to minimize this expression. Using the same reasoning as before, the minimum occurs at $y = \frac{400}{2*25} = 8$. Then, we can find the corresponding value of $x$: $x = 2*8 - 20 = -4$.

Substituting these values into the quadratic form, we get:
\[5(x^2 + y^2) = 5((-4)^2 + 8^2) = 5(16 + 64) = 5*80 = 400.\]

In both cases, the minimum value of the quadratic form is 400. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 400. The answer is: $\boxed{400}$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's simplify the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
Using the property $|a| = |-a|$, we can rewrite the equation as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$.
Now, let's consider the two cases for the absolute value:
Case 1: $x - 2y \ge 0$ and $2y - x \ge 0$. In this case, the equation becomes $x - 2y + 2y - x = 40$, which simplifies to $0 = 40$, a contradiction. So this case is not possible.
Case 2: $x - 2y < 0$ and $2y - x < 0$. In this case, the equation becomes $-(x - 2y) - (2y - x) = 40$, which simplifies to $-2(x - 2y) = 40$. Therefore, $x - 2y = -20$.

Now, we can substitute $x - 2y = -20$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
$$5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(x - 2y)^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = 5(-20)^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy.$$
We want to minimize this expression, so we need to minimize $5y^2 - 8xy$. To do this, let's differentiate $5y^2 - 8xy$ with respect to $y$:
$$\frac{d}{dy}(5y^2 - 8xy) = 10y - 8x.$$
Setting this equal to zero, we get $10y = 8x$. Solving for $y$, we get $y = \frac{4}{5}x$.

Substituting $y = \frac{4}{5}x$ into $x - 2y = -20$, we get $x - 2(\frac{4}{5}x) = -20$, which simplifies to $x - \frac{8}{5}x = -20$. Multiplying through by 5 gives $5x - 8x = -100$, so $-3x = -100$, and $x = \frac{100}{3}$.

Substituting $x = \frac{100}{3}$ into $y = \frac{4}{5}x$ gives $y = \frac{4}{5}(\frac{100}{3}) = \frac{80}{3}$.

Now, we substitute $x = \frac{100}{3}$ and $y = \frac{80}{3}$ into $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to find the minimum value:
$$5(\frac{100}{3})^2 + 5(\frac{80}{3})^2 - 8(\frac{100}{3})(\frac{80}{3}) = \frac{50000}{9} + \frac{32000}{9} - \frac{64000}{9} = \frac{18000}{9} = 2000.$$
So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 2000. The answer is: $2000$.
