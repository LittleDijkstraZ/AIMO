The equation is given as $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. This equation will be equal to zero if either of the two terms is zero. Therefore, we have two sets of conditions:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From the first set of conditions, we get:
- $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
From this we can infer that the values of $x$ and $y$ are $-8$ and $8$ or $8$ and $8$. This gives us two lines: $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$, and $x = 8$, $y = 8$.

Similarly from the second set of conditions, we get:
- $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
This gives us two more lines: $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.

These lines enclose a square with side length $10$ and a vertex at $(8, 8)$. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $100$ square units.
The answer is: $100$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:


The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ implies that either one of the factors must be zero. For the product to be zero, at least one of the factors must be zero. This translates to two sets of absolute value equations:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ which simplifies to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ which simplifies to $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$

Solving these absolute value equations gives us the points that form the vertices of the polygon. The absolute value equations can be rewritten as:
1. $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$ or $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$
2. $x = 8$ or $x = -8$ or $y = 8$ or $y = -8$

By graphing these equations, we find that they form a square with side length 16. The area of a square is given by $side^2$, so the area of the polygon is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$

Approach:


The given equation is equal to zero, which means that either the product of two functions is zero or that both of them are zero. In the first case, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. 
For the first function to be zero, $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. 
This gives us four equations: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. 
These lines form a square with side length 10 units.
For the second function to be zero, $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. 
This gives us four more lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. 
These lines form another square with side length 16 units.
To find the area of the convex polygon, we need to find the intersection of the two squares.
The intersection of the two squares is a smaller square with side length 8 units.
The area of the smaller square is $8^2 = 64$.
So the area of the convex polygon is 64 square units.

Solution:
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 64 square units. The answer is: $64$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:


The equation in the problem is in the form of product of two expressions equaling zero. This means that either of the two expressions has to be zero for the product to be zero. So we have two cases to consider:
Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

In case 1, both squares are non-negative, so for their sum to be zero, each of them has to be zero separately. This implies that:
$\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$
This means that the distance between the points $(x, y)$ and $(-x, -y)$ is always 10. This forms a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

In case 2, both squares are also non-negative, and for their sum to be zero, each of them has to be zero separately. This implies that:
$\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$
This means that the points $(x, y)$ are always at a distance of 8 from the origin in both the x and y directions. This forms a square with side length 16 (since the distance from the origin to any corner of the square is $\sqrt{8^2+8^2}=8\sqrt{2}$, and the side length is $8\sqrt{2}/\sqrt{2}=16$). The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

However, the first case represents the points that satisfy the original equation, so we only consider the area of the square formed by the first case, which is 100. The answer is: $100$

Approach:

 The given equation is a product of two expressions being equal to zero. Therefore, either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. Let's analyze these two cases separately.

1. Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
For the sum of two squares to be zero, each square term must be zero. Therefore, we have $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these absolute value equations are all the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. These four lines are the sides of the square.

2. Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
Similarly, the sum of two squares being zero implies that $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these absolute value equations are all the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. These four lines are the sides of the square.

Therefore, the convex polygon is a square with side length 10 (from case 1) or 8 (from case 2). However, the side length of the square can't be both 10 and 8 at the same time. To find the correct side length, we should compare it with the given conditions. In this case, the side length of 10 from case 1 satisfies the conditions of the absolute value equations, so it is the correct side length of the square.

To find the area of the square, we simply square the side length: $Area = side^2 = 10^2 = 100$.

The area of the convex polygon is 100 square units.
The answer is: $100$
