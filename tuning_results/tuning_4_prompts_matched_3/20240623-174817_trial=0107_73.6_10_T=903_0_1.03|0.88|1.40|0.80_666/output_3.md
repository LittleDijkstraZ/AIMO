Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is equivalent to the product of two equations being zero:
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0\]
\[((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0\]

The first equation implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means that $x = \pm y$. The second equation implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

Therefore, the points that satisfy the equation are $(\pm 8, \pm 8)$ and $(\pm y, \pm y)$ where $y = \pm 8$.

These points form a square with side length $16$, so the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero, or the second expression is zero, or both are zero.

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. This expression is zero if and only if both $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the conditions for a square with side length 10 centered at the origin.

The second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. This expression is zero if and only if both $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the conditions for a square with side length 16 centered at the origin.

The intersection of these two squares is a square with side length 8 centered at the origin. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $8^2 = 64$.
The answer is: $64$

Assistant:

 To solve this problem, we first need to analyze the given equation. The equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so it equals zero when either of the expressions equals zero.

The expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
The expression $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
The expression $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
The expression $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

By solving these equations, we find the vertices of the polygon: $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

The polygon is a square with side length $16$. The area of a square is the square of the length of its side, so the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $\boxed{256}$

 The equation $AB=0$ is equivalent to $A=0$ or $B=0$. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
Solving these equations, we find that the points satisfying the given equation are the points on the lines $x+y=10$, $x-y=10$, $x=-8$, $x=8$, $y=-8$, and $y=8$. These lines enclose a rectangle with side lengths 16 and 20. The area of this rectangle is $16 \times 20 = 320$.
The answer is: 320.

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero, or the second term is zero, or both are zero.

The first term is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, and it equals to zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These two equations represent two lines in the plane, and the intersection points of these two lines are the vertices of the polygon.

The second term is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$, and it equals to zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which represents a square with side length 16.

Therefore, the polygon is a square with side length 16, and its area is $16^2 = 256$. So the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

 The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. In order for the product of two numbers to be zero, either one of them must be zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This equation implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(0, 10)$, $(10, 0)$, $(0, -10)$, and $(-10, 0)$.

2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This equation implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(8, -8)$.

The convex polygon enclosed by the points satisfying the given equation is the intersection of the rectangle and the square, which is also a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100.

The expression equals zero if either of the two factors equals zero. 

The first factor equals zero when $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which simplifies to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these equations are all the points in the plane that are at a distance of 10 units from the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length 20 units.

The second factor equals zero when $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which simplifies to $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are all the points in the plane that are at a distance of 8 units from the x-axis and y-axis. These lines form a square with side length 16 units.

The convex polygon enclosed by the points that satisfy the equation is the intersection of these two squares, which is a smaller square with side length 8 units. The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$ square units. The answer is: $\boxed{64}$.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. So we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first case, both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ must be zero. This means that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only way this can happen is if $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$. So we have a square with side length 20.

For the second case, both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2$ must be zero. This means that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. So we have a square with side length 16.

The area of the first square is $20^2 = 400$, and the area of the second square is $16^2 = 256$.

The region enclosed by the points that satisfy the equation is the intersection of these two squares, which is a smaller square with side length 16. So the area of the convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$
