"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"

This problem is a difficult one to solve directly using calculus or algebra, so instead we can use a clever trick involving completing the square. First, we rewrite the function $f(x, y) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ as follows:

\[f(x, y) = (5x^2 - 8xy + 5y^2) = (x^2 - 2xy + y^2) + 4(x^2 - 2xy + y^2) = (x - y)^2 + 4(x - y)^2 = 5(x - y)^2.\]

Now, let $u = x - y$ and $v = y - 2x$, then we have $|u| + |v| = 40$. Substituting $u$ and $v$ back into the equation gives $|x - y| + |y - 2x| = 40$. So, we are actually looking for the minimum value of $5u^2$ under the constraint $|u| + |v| = 40$. 

The function $5u^2$ is minimized when $u = 0$, so we need to find the values of $x$ and $y$ that make $u = 0$. From $u = x - y = 0$, we get $x = y$. Substituting this into the constraint $|u| + |v| = 40$ gives $|x - x| + |y - 2x| = 40$, which simplifies to $|0| + |y - 2x| = 40$ or $|y - 2x| = 40$. Since $x = y$, we have $|x - 2x| = 40$, or $| -x | = 40$, or $x = \pm 20$. 

So the minimum value of $5u^2 = 5(x - y)^2$ is achieved when $x = y = 20$ or $x = y = -20$. Substituting $x = y = 20$ into $5u^2 = 5(x - y)^2$ gives $5(0)^2 = 0$. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $0$ under the given constraint. The answer is: $0$

This problem requires knowledge of analytical geometry and optimization. The main idea is to use the given equation to relate $x$ and $y$, then substitute it into the function to be minimized, and finally find the minimum value by taking derivative or completing the square method.

However, directly solving this problem step by step is quite complex and requires a deep understanding of mathematical methods. Instead, we can use the property of absolute value function to simplify the problem. By setting $x = 2y$ or $y = 2x$, we can rewrite the absolute value equation as $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40 \Rightarrow |x-2y| + |x-2y| = 40 \Rightarrow 2|x-2y| = 40 \Rightarrow |x-2y| = 20$. Now we have two cases to consider:

1. If $x = 2y$, we can substitute it into the function to be minimized, which gives $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = 5x^2 + 5(x/2)^2 - 8x(x/2) = 5x^2 + 5x^2/4 - 4x^2 = 15x^2/4$.
2. If $y = 2x$, the substitution gives $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = 5x^2 + 5(2x)^2 - 8x(2x) = 5x^2 + 20x^2 - 16x^2 = 19x^2$.

We can see that the function to be minimized is always a multiple of $x^2$. Since $x^2$ is always non-negative, the minimum value of the function occurs when $x^2 = 0$, which means $x = 0$. Therefore, we need to find the minimum value of the two functions $15x^2/4$ and $19x^2$ when $x = 0$.

For $15x^2/4$, when $x = 0$, we have $15*0^2/4 = 0$.
For $19x^2$, when $x = 0$, we have $19*0^2 = 0$.

In both cases, the minimum value of the function is $0$. Therefore, the minimum value of the function $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ when $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $0$.

This problem involves the use of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and the rearrangement inequality. First, we apply the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to the sequences $\sqrt{5}x$ and $\sqrt{5}y$, which gives us
\[(\sqrt{5}x \cdot \sqrt{5}y)^2 \leq (5x^2 + 5y^2)(5y^2 + 5x^2).\]
Simplifying this inequality gives us
\[25x^2y^2 \leq (5x^2 + 5y^2)^2.\]
Rearranging this inequality gives us
\[25x^2y^2 - 8x^2y^2 \leq (5x^2 + 5y^2)^2 - 8(5x^2y^2).\]
Simplifying the left side of the inequality gives us
\[17x^2y^2 \leq (5x^2 + 5y^2)^2 - 8(5x^2y^2).\]
Rearranging this inequality gives us
\[25x^2y^2 + 8(5x^2y^2) \leq (5x^2 + 5y^2)^2.\]
Simplifying the left side of the inequality gives us
\[40x^2y^2 \leq (5x^2 + 5y^2)^2.\]
Taking the square root of both sides of the inequality gives us
\[2\sqrt{10}xy \leq 5x^2 + 5y^2.\]
Rearranging this inequality gives us
\[5x^2 + 5y^2 \geq 2\sqrt{10}xy.\]
Expanding the left side of the inequality gives us
\[5x^2 + 5y^2 - 2\sqrt{10}xy \geq 0.\]
Now, we know that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. By the rearrangement inequality, we have
\[|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |x-2y + y-2x| = |0| = 0.\]
But this is a contradiction, so we must have equality in the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and the rearrangement inequality. Therefore, we must have $x = 2y$ and $y = 2x$. Substituting $x = 2y$ into the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ gives us
\[|x-x| + |y-y| = 40,\]
which simplifies to $0 = 40$, a contradiction. Therefore, our assumption that $x = 2y$ and $y = 2x$ must be incorrect. However, if we consider the case where $x = -2y$ and $y = -2x$, we get the same contradiction. Therefore, we must have $|x-2y| = |y-2x| = 20$. Without loss of generality, let's assume $x - 2y = 20$. Then, we have $x = 2y + 20$. Substituting this into the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ gives us
\[|2y + 20 - 2y| + |y - 2(2y + 20)| = 40.\]
Simplifying this gives us
\[|20| + |-3y - 40| = 40.\]
Since $|20| = 20$, we have
\[20 + |-3y - 40| = 40.\]
Simplifying this gives us
\[|-3y - 40| = 20.\]
This means either $3y + 40 = 20$ or $3y + 40 = -20$. Solving these equations gives us $y = -20/3$ and $y = -20$. If $y = -20/3$, then $x = 2(-20/3) + 20 = 20/3$. If $y = -20$, then $x = 2(-20) + 20 = -20$. Substituting these values into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ gives us
\[5\left(\frac{20}{3}\right)^2 + 5(-20/3)^2 - 8\left(\frac{20}{3}\right)(-20/3) = 0,\]
and
\[5(-20)^2 + 5(-20)^2 - 8(-20)(-20) = 0.\]
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is 0. The answer is: $0$
