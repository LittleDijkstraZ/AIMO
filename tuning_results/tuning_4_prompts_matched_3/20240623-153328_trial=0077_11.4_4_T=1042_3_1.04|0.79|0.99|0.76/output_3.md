Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:



The equation given in the problem is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. 

Let's consider each case:

1. If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

2. If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This forms a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

However, the first case is the only one that satisfies both expressions being zero simultaneously. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon formed by the points satisfying the equation is the area of the square formed by the first case, which is 100.

So the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

Approach:


The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.

1. For the first expression to be zero, either $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x-y| - 10 = 0$. This implies $|x+y| = 10$ or $|x-y| = 10$. The solutions to these equations form a square with side length 20, so its area is $20^2 = 400$.

2. For the second expression to be zero, either $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$. This implies $|x| = 8$ or $|y| = 8$. The solutions to these equations form a square with side length 16, so its area is $16^2 = 256$.

Since the area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares, the area of the convex polygon is $400 + 256 = 656$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 656.
The answer is: $656$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:

 The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied only when either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The first equation implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the square as $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0)$.
The second equation implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the square as $(8, 0), (-8, 0), (0, 8), (0, -8)$.
Combining both sets of vertices, we see that the points satisfying the equation enclose a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:



The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ can be true only when each of the terms is zero.

This gives us the following system of equations:

1) $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ which implies $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 2), (8, -2), (-8, -2), (-8, 2)$.

2) $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ which implies $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, -8), (-8, 8)$.

Combining these two sets of vertices, we see that the points enclose a square with side length $16$. The area of a square is given by side length squared, so the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$.

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Approach:


The equation $A \cdot B = 0$ implies that $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first equation to be zero, both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These conditions define a square with side length 10.

For the second equation to be zero, both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$, defining a square with side length 16.

The area of the convex polygon formed by the union of these two squares is the sum of their areas:

The area of the smaller square is $10 \times 10 = 100$.
The area of the larger square is $16 \times 16 = 256$.

So the total area is $100 + 256 = 356$.

The answer is: $356$

Approach:


The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied only when at least one of the two factors is zero. This gives us two sets of equations to solve:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
Solving these equations, we find the vertices of the polygon to be:
For the first set: $(8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, $(8, -8)$.
For the second set: $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, $(8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$.
This forms a square with side length $16$. The area of the square is therefore $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Approach:


The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if either of the two factors is zero. This gives us two sets of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first set of equations, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$, $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us a square with side length 16.

For the second set of equations, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$, $\vert y \vert = 8$. This also gives us a square with side length 16.

Therefore, the convex polygon is a square with side length 16. The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side, so the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$.

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:


The given equation is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
For the product of two numbers to be zero, either one of them must be zero. Therefore, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives the vertices of the square as $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0)$.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives the vertices of the square as $(8, 0), (-8, 0), (0, 8), (0, -8)$.

The vertices of the convex polygon are the intersection points of these two squares. The intersection points are $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$.

The side length of the squares is 20 units (since the distance between the points $(0, 10)$ and $(0, -10)$ is 20 units). Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of a square with side length 20 units, which is $20^2 = 400$ square units.
The answer is: $400$

Assistant:

Approach:


The equation given is a product of two terms equal to zero. Therefore, either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. We will solve for the points that satisfy each term separately.

For the first term:
$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$

This implies that both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$. The intersection points of these lines with the coordinate axes are (0,10), (10,0), (0,-10), and (-10,0). These points form a square with side length 10.

For the second term:
$(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

This implies that both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$. The intersection points of these lines with the coordinate axes are (8,0) and (0,8). These points form a square with side length 8.

Therefore, the points that satisfy the given equation are the points that lie either inside the square formed by the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ or inside the square formed by the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$. The area of the convex polygon formed by these points is the sum of the areas of these two squares.

The area of a square with side length $a$ is $a^2$. So, the area of the square formed by the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ is $10^2 = 100$, and the area of the square formed by the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$ is $8^2 = 64$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $100 + 64 = 164$. The answer is: $164$

Approach:



The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

Similarly, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

From $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, we have $x + y = \pm 10$ or $x + y = 0$.
From $\vert x \vert = 8$, we have $x = \pm 8$.
From $\vert y \vert = 8$, we have $y = \pm 8$.

Combining these equations, we can plot the points $(x, y)$ on a coordinate plane.

The points $(x, y)$ satisfying the given equation are the vertices of a square with side length $16$ (since $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ implies that the square is centered at the origin and has side length $16$).

To find the area of this square, we simply square the side length: $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$
