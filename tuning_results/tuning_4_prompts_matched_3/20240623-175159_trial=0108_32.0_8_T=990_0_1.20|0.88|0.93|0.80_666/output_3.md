Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is equivalent to the product of two equations being equal to zero, i.e., $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$ or $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. 
The first equation implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which form a rectangle with vertices at $(10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, $(-10, 0)$, and $(0, -10)$.
The second equation implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which form a square with vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$.
The intersection of these two figures is the square with side length 8. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $8^2 = 64$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 64.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so one of the expressions must be zero. This gives us two separate conditions to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first condition to be true, we need both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$. These lines intersect at $(5,5)$ and $(-5,-5)$, forming a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

For the second condition to be true, we need both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$. These lines form a square with side length 8. The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$.

The area of the convex polygon formed by the union of the two squares is the sum of their areas, which is $100 + 64 = 164$. So the area of the convex polygon is 164.

The Python code to compute the area is as follows:
```python

def area_of_polygon():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    side_length_square1 = 10
    side_length_square2 = 8
    area_square1 = side_length_square1 ** 2
    area_square2 = side_length_square2 ** 2
    total_area = area_square1 + area_square2
    return total_area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

The area of the convex polygon is 164. The answer is: $164$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:


The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. For the product of two numbers to be zero, one of the numbers must be zero. Therefore, either
$$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$$ or $$(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0.$$
If the first equation is zero, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.
If the second equation is zero, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
These lines form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units.
The answer is: $256$

 The problem statement itself is not a mathematical question that can be solved directly by a Python program. However, based on the given equation, we can observe that for the product of two terms to be zero, either of the terms must be zero. Thus, we have two separate cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $-10 \leq x + y \leq 10$ and $-10 \leq x - y \leq 10$. Solving these inequalities, we get $-20 \leq x \leq 20$ and $-20 \leq y \leq 20$.

For the second case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $-8 \leq x \leq 8$ and $-8 \leq y \leq 8$.

The intersection of these two regions gives us a square with side length 8. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $8^2 = 64$. The answer is: $64$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The equation $ab=0$ is satisfied if and only if $a=0$ or $b=0$. Therefore, the given equation is satisfied if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The solutions to $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ are given by $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = \pm 10$. Similarly, the solutions to $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ are given by $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x - y = \pm 10$. The solutions to $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ are given by $\vert x \vert = 8$, which implies $x = \pm 8$. Finally, the solutions to $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ are given by $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $y = \pm 8$.
The solutions to these equations form a square with side length 16. Therefore, the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The problem statement is asking for the area of a polygon formed by the points that satisfy the given equation. The equation is
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]
For the product of two numbers to be zero, either one of the numbers must be zero. Therefore, either
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad ((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]
The first equation is zero only when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies that $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$. The second equation is zero only when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

Therefore, the polygon is a square with side length 16 (from $-10$ to $10$ in the $x$ and $y$ directions, and from $-8$ to $8$ in the $x$ and $y$ directions). The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
