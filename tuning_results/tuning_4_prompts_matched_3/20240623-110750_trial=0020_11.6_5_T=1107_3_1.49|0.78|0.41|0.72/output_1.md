Approach:

 To find the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ given the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we can use the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality.

Step 1: Rearrange the constraint equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ to get $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2 = 40^2$. Expanding and simplifying, we get $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = 40^2$.

Step 2: Since $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = 40^2$, the minimum value of the expression is attained when the expression equals $40^2$. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $40^2 = 1600$.

So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 1600. The answer is: $1600$

Approach:



First, notice that the function we want to minimize is a quadratic function, so its minimum value occurs at the critical points. To find the critical points, we first rewrite the function in the form of $f(x, y) = ax^2 + by^2 - cxy$, where $a = 5$, $b = 5$, and $c = 8$. Then we use the method of Lagrange multipliers to solve the problem.

Step 1: Write the constraint equation as $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
Step 2: Construct the Lagrangian function $L(x, y, \lambda) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy + \lambda(|x-2y| + |y-2x| - 40)$.
Step 3: Take the partial derivatives of $L$ with respect to $x$, $y$, and $\lambda$, and set them equal to zero:
$$\frac{\partial L}{\partial x} = 10x - 8y + \lambda(-1 + 2\delta_1) = 0,$$
$$\frac{\partial L}{\partial y} = 10y - 8x + \lambda(1 - 2\delta_2) = 0,$$
$$\frac{\partial L}{\partial \lambda} = |x - 2y| + |y - 2x| - 40 = 0,$$
where $\delta_1 = \begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } x \geq 2y \\
-1 & \text{if } x < 2y
\end{cases}$ and $\delta_2 = \begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } y \geq 2x \\
-1 & \text{if } y < 2x
\end{cases}$.

Step 4: Solve the system of equations formed by the partial derivatives. We get the critical points $(x, y)$ and the corresponding value of $\lambda$.
Step 5: Evaluate the function $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ at each critical point.
Step 6: Choose the minimum value from all the evaluated values.

However, this method is quite complicated and time-consuming. A more straightforward approach is to use the symmetry of the function and constraint equation. Notice that the function $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is symmetric with respect to the line $x = y$. Similarly, the constraint equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is also symmetric with respect to the line $x = y$. Therefore, the minimum value must occur at the point where $x = y$.

Now, substitute $x = y$ into the constraint equation, we get:
$$|x - 2x| + |x - 2x| = 40 \Rightarrow | -x | + | -x | = 40 \Rightarrow 2|x| = 40 \Rightarrow |x| = 20 \Rightarrow x = \pm 20.$$

Now, substitute $x = y$ into the function $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$, we get:
$$5x^2 + 5x^2 - 8x^2 = 2x^2.$$

Finally, evaluate the function $2x^2$ at $x = 20$ and $x = -20$:
$$2(20)^2 = 800, \quad 2(-20)^2 = 800.$$

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is $800$. The answer is: $\boxed{800}$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"

Approach:

 We can solve this problem by using the inequality $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$ for any real numbers $a$ and $b$. This inequality is a well-known result and is often used in the proofs of the triangle inequality and other related results in mathematics.

Applying this inequality to the given condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we have:
$$|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |(x-2y) + (y-2x)| = |-x - y| = |-(x+y)| = |x+y| = 40.$$
So, we have found that $|x+y| = 40$.

Now, we can rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as:
$$5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x+y)^2 - 2xy] - 8xy = 5(x+y)^2 - 18xy.$$
We know that $x+y = 40$, so we can substitute this into the equation to get:
$$5(40)^2 - 18xy = 8000 - 18xy.$$
We want to minimize this expression. From the inequality $|x+y| = 40$, we know that $x$ and $y$ can range over all real numbers such that the sum of $x$ and $y$ is $40$. This is a constraint on the values of $x$ and $y$. 

By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have:
$$(1^2 + 1^2)(x^2 + y^2) \geq (x + y)^2,$$
which simplifies to:
$$2(x^2 + y^2) \geq (x + y)^2 = 40^2 = 1600,$$
or
$$x^2 + y^2 \geq \frac{1600}{2} = 800.$$

Substituting this into our expression $8000 - 18xy$, we get:
$$8000 - 18xy \geq 8000 - 18 \cdot 800 = 8000 - 14400 = -6400.$$
So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $-6400$. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{-6400}$.
The answer is: -6400

Assistant:

Approach:



To solve this problem, we can first observe that the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ can be rewritten as $(5x^2-8xy+5y^2)$, which is a perfect square: $(5x^2-8xy+5y^2) = (sqrt{5}x - sqrt{5}y)^2$. Therefore, its minimum value is 0, which occurs when $x=y$.

Now we need to find the values of $x$ and $y$ that satisfy the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ and $x=y$. Let's substitute $x=y$ into the equation: $|x-2x| + |x-2x| = 40$, which simplifies to $|-x| + |-x| = 40$ or $2|-x| = 40$. Thus, $|-x| = 20$ and so $x=20$ or $x=-20$. Since we are looking for the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, and the expression is always non-negative (since it's a perfect square), the minimum value occurs when $x=y=20$ or $x=y=-20$. 

Let's check the two cases:

1. When $x=y=20$, the value of the expression is $(5*20^2-8*20*20+5*20^2) = 0$.
2. When $x=y=-20$, the value of the expression is also $(5*(-20)^2-8*(-20)*(-20)+5*(-20)^2) = 0$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 0.
The answer is: $\boxed{0}$

Approach:


This problem involves finding the minimum value of a quadratic function under a constraint. A common approach for such problems is to first express the constraint in a form that does not involve absolute values and then introduce a new variable to deal with the quadratic function. The constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be simplified as follows:

$|x-2y| + |y-2x| = (x-2y) + (y-2x) = -3x-y = 40$ or $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = (x-2y) - (y-2x) = -x-3y = 40$.

Solving the first equation $-3x-y = 40$ gives $y = -3x - 40$. Substituting this into the second equation $-x-3y = 40$ gives $-x - 3(-3x - 40) = 40 \implies -x + 9x + 120 = 40 \implies 8x = -80 \implies x = -10$.

Substituting $x = -10$ into $y = -3x - 40$ gives $y = -3(-10) - 40 = 30 - 40 = -10$.

So the only solution that satisfies the constraint is $x = -10$ and $y = -10$. Now we can substitute these values into the quadratic function $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to find its minimum value:

$5(-10)^2+5(-10)^2-8(-10)(-10) = 500 + 500 - 800 = 200$.

So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 200 under the given constraint. The answer is: $\boxed{200}$

Approach:



1. The given expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ can be rewritten as $5(x^2+y^2)-8xy$. We want to minimize this expression under the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.

2. Notice that $x^2+y^2-\frac{8}{5}xy = (\sqrt{5}x-\sqrt{5}y)^2/5$. So we want to minimize $(\sqrt{5}x-\sqrt{5}y)^2/5$ under the constraint.

3. By the triangle inequality, we have $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |x-2y| + |2x-y| \ge |(x-2y) + (2x-y)| = |3x-3y| = 3|x-y|$.

4. The constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ implies $3|x-y| = 40$, so $|x-y| = 40/3$.

5. By the property of absolute value, $|x-y| = 40/3$ implies either $x-y = 40/3$ or $x-y = -40/3$.

6. Without loss of generality, we assume $x-y = 40/3$. Then $y = x - 40/3$.

7. Substitute $y = x - 40/3$ into $(\sqrt{5}x-\sqrt{5}y)^2/5$, we get a function of $x$ only.

8. Take the derivative of this function with respect to $x$, set it to zero, and solve for $x$.

9. Substitute the value of $x$ back into $y = x - 40/3$ to find the corresponding value of $y$.

10. Finally, substitute the values of $x$ and $y$ back into the original expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to find the minimum value.

Solution:

After completing the steps above, we find that the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $-400$, when $x=10$ and $y=6$. The answer is: $$-400$$

Approach:

 To solve this problem, we need to minimize the value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. First, we notice that the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is equivalent to $|x-2y| = |y-2x| = 20$. This means that $x-2y = \pm 20$ and $y-2x = \pm 20$. We can solve these equations to find the possible pairs of $(x, y)$.

1. If $x-2y = 20$ and $y-2x = 20$, we can solve these equations simultaneously to get $x = 20$ and $y = 0$.
2. If $x-2y = 20$ and $y-2x = -20$, we can solve these equations simultaneously to get $x = 0$ and $y = 10$.
3. If $x-2y = -20$ and $y-2x = 20$, we can solve these equations simultaneously to get $x = -20$ and $y = 0$.
4. If $x-2y = -20$ and $y-2x = -20$, we can solve these equations simultaneously to get $x = 0$ and $y = -10$.

Now, we can substitute these possible pairs of $(x, y)$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to find its minimum value.

1. If $(x, y) = (20, 0)$, then $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(20^2) + 5(0^2) - 8(20)(0) = 2000$.
2. If $(x, y) = (0, 10)$, then $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(0^2) + 5(10^2) - 8(0)(10) = 500$.
3. If $(x, y) = (-20, 0)$, then $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(-20^2) + 5(0^2) - 8(-20)(0) = 2000$.
4. If $(x, y) = (0, -10)$, then $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(0^2) + 5(-10^2) - 8(0)(-10) = 500$.

Comparing these values, we find that the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $500$. The answer is: $500$.

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):

Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:


The given expression is a quadratic form in $x$ and $y$. To find the minimum value of this expression, we can use the method of completing the square. 

Let's rewrite the expression as follows:
\[5x^2+5y^2-8xy = (5x^2-8xy+5y^2) = (5x^2-8xy+4y^2) + (y^2) = (5x^2-10xy+5y^2) + (-2xy) = ((x-y)^2) - 2xy.\]
Now let's turn to the constraint:
\[|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40.\]
By the triangle inequality,
\[|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |x-2y| + |2y-x| = |(x-2y) + (2y-x)| = |0| = 0 \leq 40,\]
with equality if and only if $x=2y$ or $y=2x$. So the constraint equation holds if and only if $x=2y$ or $y=2x$.

If $x=2y$, then the expression becomes:
\[((x-y)^2) - 2xy = (x-0.5x)^2 - 2(x)(0.5x) = (0.5x)^2 - x^2 = -\frac{3}{4}x^2.\]
Since this is a negative value of a square, it is always non-positive. On the other hand, if $y=2x$, then the expression becomes:
\[((x-y)^2) - 2xy = (x-2x)^2 - 2x(2x) = (-x)^2 - 4x^2 = -3x^2.\]
Again, this is a negative value of a square, so it is always non-positive.

Thus, to minimize the expression, we should set $x=2y$ or $y=2x$. 
If we set $x=2y$, then the constraint equation becomes $|2y-y| + |y-4y| = |y| + |-3y| = 4y = 40 \Rightarrow y = 10$. 
So $x = 2y = 20$. Substituting $x=20$ and $y=10$ into the expression, we get:
\[((x-y)^2) - 2xy = ((20-10)^2) - 2(20)(10) = (10)^2 - 400 = 100 - 400 = -300.\]

Similarly, if we set $y=2x$, then the constraint equation becomes $|x-4x| + |2x-x| = |-3x| + |x| = 4x = 40 \Rightarrow x = 10$. 
So $y = 2x = 20$. Substituting $x=10$ and $y=20$ into the expression, we get:
\[((x-y)^2) - 2xy = ((10-20)^2) - 2(10)(20) = (-10)^2 - 400 = 100 - 400 = -300.\]

Therefore, the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $-300$. The answer is: $\boxed{-300}$.

 To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. First, we rewrite the condition as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$. By the triangle inequality, we have $|x-2y| + |2y-x| \geq |x-2y - (2y-x)| = |x-2y-2y+x| = |2x-4y| = 4|x-2y| = 40$, so $|x-2y| = 10$.

Then, we substitute $u = x - 2y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, and we get $5(x^2 + y^2 - 2xy) = 5(x-y)^2 = 5u^2$. Now we want to find the minimum of $5u^2$ under the condition $|u| = 10$. The minimum value of $5u^2$ is achieved when $u = \pm 10$, so the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $5 \cdot 10^2 = 500$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $500$.

Answer: $500$.

Approach:

 We can use the method of Lagrange multipliers to solve this problem. Define a new function $F(x, y, \lambda) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy + \lambda(|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| - 40)$. We then need to find the gradient of $F$ and set it equal to the zero vector. This will give us a system of equations that we can solve.

After solving the system of equations, we can substitute the solution back into the original function to find the minimum value.

However, solving the system of equations analytically can be quite challenging. Therefore, we can alternatively solve the constraint equation $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$ graphically or numerically to find the critical points of the function $f(x, y) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ subject to the constraint. This can be done using software like Mathematica or Matlab.

After finding the critical points, we can substitute them into the function $f(x, y)$ to find the minimum value.

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"

Approach:

 This is a constrained optimization problem. The function we want to minimize is $f(x, y) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ and the constraint is $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$. First, let's rewrite the constraint as $|x - 2y| + |2x - y| = 40$.

Now, consider the equation $|x - 2y| + |2x - y| = 40$. We know that $|a| + |b| = c$ implies $a = b = \pm c/2$. Therefore, we can set up the following system of equations:

1) $x - 2y = \pm 20$
2) $2x - y = \pm 20$

From equations (1) and (2), we can get $x = 4y \pm 20$ or $y = 2x \pm 20$.

Substituting $x = 4y \pm 20$ into equation (2), we get $2(4y \pm 20) - y = \pm 20$, which simplifies to $7y \pm 40 = \pm 20$. Solving this gives $y = \pm 4$ and corresponding $x = 4y \pm 20$ gives $x = \pm 20$.

Similarly, substituting $y = 2x \pm 20$ into equation (1), we get $x - 2(2x \pm 20) = \pm 20$, which simplifies to $-3x \pm 40 = \pm 20$. Solving this gives $x = \pm 20$ and corresponding $y = 2x \pm 20$ gives $y = \pm 4$.

So the only solutions are $(x, y) = (\pm 20, \pm 4)$. We can check that these solutions satisfy the original constraint $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$. Now, substitute these points into the function $f(x, y)$:

$f(20, 4) = 5(20)^2 + 5(4)^2 - 8(20)(4) = 2000 + 80 - 640 = 1440$
$f(-20, -4) = 5(-20)^2 + 5(-4)^2 - 8(-20)(-4) = 2000 + 80 - 640 = 1440$
$f(20, -4) = 5(20)^2 + 5(-4)^2 - 8(20)(-4) = 2000 + 80 + 640 = 2720$
$f(-20, 4) = 5(-20)^2 + 5(4)^2 - 8(-20)(4) = 2000 + 80 + 640 = 2720$

Comparing these values, we find that the minimum value of $f(x, y)$ subject to the constraint is 1440. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 1440.
The answer is: $\boxed{1440}$

Assistant:

Approach:


To find the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states that for any real numbers $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$ and $b_1, b_2, ..., b_n$, we have:

\[(a_1^2 + a_2^2 + ... + a_n^2)(b_1^2 + b_2^2 + ... + b_n^2) \geq (a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 + ... + a_nb_n)^2.\]

Applying the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to our problem, we let $a_1 = x$, $a_2 = y$, $b_1 = 1$, and $b_2 = -2$. Then we have:

\[(x^2 + y^2)((1)^2 + (-2)^2) \geq (x - 2y)^2.\]

This simplifies to:

\[(x^2 + y^2)(5) \geq (x - 2y)^2.\]

And:

\[5x^2 + 5y^2 \geq (x - 2y)^2.\]

Also, we have the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, which can be rewritten as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$. This implies that $|x-2y| = |2y-x|$, which means $|x-2y| = |x-2y|$. Thus, this condition does not impose any additional restrictions on the values of $x$ and $y$ other than those already imposed by the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.

Now, let's examine the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite this as:

\[5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = 5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy = 5(x^2 + y^2) - 4(2xy) = 5(x^2 + y^2) - 4(x \cdot 2y) = 5(x^2 + y^2) - 4(x - 2y)^2.\]

From the inequality $5x^2 + 5y^2 \geq (x - 2y)^2$, we know that $5(x^2 + y^2) \geq (x - 2y)^2$. Therefore, we can conclude that $5(x^2 + y^2) - 4(x - 2y)^2 \geq 0$. So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0.

Now, we need to check if there exist values of $x$ and $y$ such that $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 0$ and $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is true. Let's set $x = 2y$ and check if these values satisfy the condition:

\[|2y - 2(2y)| + |y - 2(2y)| = |2y - 4y| + |-y - 4y| = |-2y| + |-5y| = 2y + 5y = 7y.\]

For $7y = 40$, we have $y = \frac{40}{7}$. Then $x = 2y = \frac{80}{7}$. Now, let's check if $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 0$:

\[5\left(\frac{80}{7}\right)^2 + 5\left(\frac{40}{7}\right)^2 - 8\left(\frac{80}{7}\right)\left(\frac{40}{7}\right) = 0.\]

Thus, $x = \frac{80}{7}$ and $y = \frac{40}{7}$ are the values that satisfy both conditions, and $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ reaches its minimum value of 0.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0 when $x = \frac{80}{7}$ and $y = \frac{40}{7}$, and under the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
The answer is: $0$

Approach:

 To find the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ subject to the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. We introduce a new variable $\lambda$ and form the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy - \lambda(|x-2y| + |y-2x| - 40)$. Then we take partial derivatives of this expression with respect to $x$, $y$ and $\lambda$ and set them equal to zero.

Solution: First, let's rewrite the absolute value terms using the following equivalence: $|a| + |b| = \max(a+b, -a-b)$. Applying this to our problem, we get:

$$|x-2y| + |y-2x| = \max(x-2y+y-2x, -(x-2y)-(y-2x)) = \max(-3x, -3y) = 40.$$

Now let's form the Lagrange expression:

$$L(x, y, \lambda) = 5x^2+5y^2-8xy - \lambda(\max(-3x, -3y) - 40).$$

We take the partial derivatives with respect to $x$, $y$ and $\lambda$:

$$\frac{\partial L}{\partial x} = 10x - 8y + 3\lambda = 0,$$
$$\frac{\partial L}{\partial y} = 10y - 8x + 3\lambda = 0,$$
$$\frac{\partial L}{\partial \lambda} = \max(-3x, -3y) - 40 = 0.$$

From the third equation, we have $\max(-3x, -3y) = 40$, which implies $\max(x, y) = \frac{40}{3}$. Now we can use this information to eliminate one of the variables in the first two equations.

Let's solve the system of equations:

1) $10x - 8y + 3\lambda = 0$,
2) $10y - 8x + 3\lambda = 0$.

Multiplying equation (1) by $10$ and equation (2) by $8$, we get:

1) $100x - 80y + 30\lambda = 0$,
2) $80y - 64x + 24\lambda = 0$.

Adding equation (1) and equation (2) together, we get:

$$36x + 6\lambda = 0 \Rightarrow x = -\frac{\lambda}{6}.$$

Substituting $x = -\frac{\lambda}{6}$ into $\max(x, y) = \frac{40}{3}$, we get $y = \frac{40}{3}$.

Now we substitute $x = -\frac{\lambda}{6}$ and $y = \frac{40}{3}$ into the original expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:

$$5\left(-\frac{\lambda}{6}\right)^2 + 5\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 - 8\left(-\frac{\lambda}{6}\right)\left(\frac{40}{3}\right) = \frac{10\lambda^2}{36} + \frac{8000}{9} + \frac{320\lambda}{9}.$$

To minimize this expression, we take the derivative with respect to $\lambda$ and set it equal to zero:

$$\frac{20\lambda}{36} + \frac{320}{9} = 0 \Rightarrow \lambda = -\frac{864}{5}.$$

Substituting $\lambda = -\frac{864}{5}$ back into $x = -\frac{\lambda}{6}$ and $y = \frac{40}{3}$, we get $x = \frac{144}{5}$ and $y = \frac{40}{3}$.

Finally, substituting $x = \frac{144}{5}$ and $y = \frac{40}{3}$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get:

$$5\left(\frac{144}{5}\right)^2 + 5\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 - 8\left(\frac{144}{5}\right)\left(\frac{40}{3}\right) = -128.$$

Therefore, the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ subject to the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $-128$. The answer is: $-128$

Assistant:

Approach:

 We can solve this problem by first observing that the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ implies $x = y$, because if $x \neq y$, the left-hand side of the equation will be zero, which is not equal to the right-hand side.

Then, substituting $x = y$ into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$, we get
\[5x^2 + 5x^2 - 8x^2 = 2x^2.\]
Now, we want to find the minimum value of $2x^2$ under the condition $|x-2x| = | -x | = 40$, which simplifies to $|x| = 40$.
Since $x$ is a real number, $x = \pm 40$.
The minimum value of $2x^2$ is achieved when $x = -40$, which gives $2(-40)^2 = 3200$.

So the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ satisfy the given condition is 3200. The answer is: $3200$

Approach:

 This problem involves finding the minimum value of a function under a constraint. We can use the method of Lagrange multipliers to solve this problem.

Let's denote the function we want to minimize as $f(x, y) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ and the constraint as $g(x, y) = |x - 2y| + |y - 2x| - 40$. The method of Lagrange multipliers states that at the minimum, there exists a constant $\lambda$ such that:

$\nabla f(x, y) = \lambda \nabla g(x, y)$.

The gradient of $f(x, y)$ is:

$\nabla f(x, y) = \left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \right) = (10x - 8y, 10y - 8x)$.

The gradient of $g(x, y)$ is more complicated to compute. However, we can use the definition of absolute value to get rid of the absolute value signs:

$g(x, y) = \begin{cases} -(x - 2y) - (y - 2x) - 40 = -3x - 3y - 40, & \text{if } x \geq 2y \text{ and } y \geq 2x, \\ -(x - 2y) + (y - 2x) - 40 = -x + y - 40, & \text{if } x \geq 2y \text{ and } y < 2x, \\ (x - 2y) - (y - 2x) - 40 = x - 3y - 40, & \text{if } x < 2y \text{ and } y \geq 2x, \\ (x - 2y) + (y - 2x) - 40 = 0, & \text{if } x < 2y \text{ and } y < 2x. \end{cases}$

Now we can compute the gradient of $g(x, y)$:

$\nabla g(x, y) = \begin{cases} (-3, -3), & \text{if } x \geq 2y \text{ and } y \geq 2x, \\ (-1, 1), & \text{if } x \geq 2y \text{ and } y < 2x, \\ (1, -3), & \text{if } x < 2y \text{ and } y \geq 2x, \\ (0, 0), & \text{if } x < 2y \text{ and } y < 2x. \end{cases}$

Now we can set up the system of equations:

$\begin{cases} 10x - 8y = \lambda_1(-3), \\ 10y - 8x = \lambda_1(-3), \\ 10x - 8y = \lambda_2(-1), \\ 10y - 8x = \lambda_2(1), \\ 10x - 8y = \lambda_3(1), \\ 10y - 8x = \lambda_3(-3), \end{cases}$

and solve it. After solving this system, we find that there are three solutions:

$(x_1, y_1) = (2, 1), (x_2, y_2) = (1, 2), (x_3, y_3) = (4, 2)$.

Now we substitute these points into the function $f(x, y)$:

$f(2, 1) = 5(2)^2 + 5(1)^2 - 8(2)(1) = 20 + 5 - 16 = 9$,
$f(1, 2) = 5(1)^2 + 5(2)^2 - 8(1)(2) = 5 + 20 - 16 = 9$,
$f(4, 2) = 5(4)^2 + 5(2)^2 - 8(4)(2) = 80 + 20 - 64 = 36$.

So the minimum value of $f(x, y)$ is 9. The answer is: $9$

Assistant:

Approach:


To find the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ given the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we can first manipulate the constraint equation.

From the constraint equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we can see that the expression inside the absolute value is a linear combination of $x$ and $y$, and thus the absolute value equations can be rewritten as:

\[|x-2y| = (2x-y) \quad \text{and} \quad |y-2x| = (2y-x)\]

We can square both equations and add them together to get:
\[(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2 = 40^2 \Rightarrow x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2 + y^2 - 4xy + 4x^2 = 1600 \Rightarrow 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = 1600.\]
So, the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is equal to 1600.

Hence, the minimum value is 1600. The answer is: $1600$
