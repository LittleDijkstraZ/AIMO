Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Approach:


To find the area of the convex polygon, we need to solve the given equation and find the vertices of the polygon.

1. The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. For this to be true, either one of the factors has to be zero. Therefore, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

2. If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon: $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, and $(-10, 0)$.

3. If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So we get another set of vertices: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

4. The vertices of the polygon are $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$. We can see that these vertices form a square with side length $10$.

5. The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of the convex polygon is $10^2 = 100$.

The answer is: $100$

This problem involves understanding the properties of absolute value and how it can be used to define a region in the coordinate plane. The given equation contains absolute value expressions, and we can break them down into cases based on the sign of the expressions inside the absolute value.

Solution:
1. Let's break down the absolute value expressions inside the equation:

$\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0 \implies \vert x + y \vert = 10$

This equation represents a pair of lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$. Similarly, we have:

$\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0 \implies \vert x - y \vert = 10$, which represents lines $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.

$\vert x \vert - 8 = 0 \implies \vert x \vert = 8$, which represents a pair of lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.

$\vert y \vert - 8 = 0 \implies \vert y \vert = 8$, which represents a pair of lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

2. Now, let's combine these conditions to find the region in the coordinate plane:

The conditions $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ represent a diamond-shaped region with vertices at $(5,5), (5,-5), (-5,5),$ and $(-5,-5)$. The conditions $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ represent a square with vertices at $(8,8), (8,-8), (-8,8),$ and $(-8,-8)$.

3. The intersection of these two regions is a square with side length 10, centered at the origin.

4. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $100$. The answer is: $100$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

Approach:

 The equation given in the problem is satisfied only if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. From this, we get $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us the vertices of a square with side length 16.

Solution: The length of the side of the square is given by $2 \times 8 = 16$. The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side. Therefore, the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. So the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:



For the product of two numbers to be zero, at least one of the numbers must be zero. Thus, either
\begin{align*}
((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) &= 0, \\
((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) &= 0.
\end{align*}

For the first equation, it is equivalent to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The first equation represents a square with side length $20$ centered at the origin, and the second equation represents another square with side length $16$ centered at the origin. Their intersection is the convex polygon we are looking for.

For the second equation, it is equivalent to $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This represents a square with side length $16$ centered at the origin.

Thus, the convex polygon we are looking for is the intersection of the two squares, which is a square with side length $10$. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So the area of the convex polygon is $100$.
The answer is: $100$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:

 The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if either of the two terms in the product is zero. This means that the points $(x, y)$ either lie on the intersection of the four lines $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$, or they lie on one of these four lines.

To find the intersection of the lines $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, we solve these equations simultaneously. The solutions are the vertices of the convex polygon, and the area of the polygon is the sum of the areas of the triangles formed by the vertices.

1. For $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, the four lines are $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.
2. For $\vert x \vert = 8$, the lines are $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.
3. For $\vert y \vert = 8$, the lines are $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

By solving these equations simultaneously, we find the vertices of the convex polygon: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(2, 8)$, $(-2, 8)$, $(2, -8)$, and $(-2, -8)$.

To find the area of the convex polygon, we form the triangles with vertices $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, and $(2, -8)$, $(2, 8)$, $(-2, 8)$, and $(-2, -8)$, and $(8, 2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$. The first two triangles have a base of 16 and height of 6, so their combined area is $2 * (1/2) * 16 * 6 = 192$. The third triangle has a base of 16 and height of 8, so its area is $(1/2) * 16 * 8 = 64$. Therefore, the total area of the convex polygon is $192 + 64 = 256$. The answer is: $\boxed{256}$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:

 The given equation is a product of two terms being equal to zero, therefore either of the terms should be zero for the whole equation to hold true. The equation can be broken down into two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From case 1, it is clear that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies that $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$. Solving these systems of equations, we get the points as $(10,0)$, $(0,10)$, $(-10,0)$, and $(0,-10)$.

From case 2, it is clear that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that $x = 8$ and $y = 8$ or $x = -8$ and $y = -8$. So we get the points $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

Now, plotting these points on a graph, we see that these points form a square with side length 20. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$. So, the area of the convex polygon is $400$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $400$.
The answer is: $\boxed{400}$

Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:


The given equation is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. We know that for any real number $a$, we have $\vert a \vert^2 = a^2$, so we can rewrite the equations as $(x + y - 10)^2 + (x - y - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(x - 8)^2 + (y - 8)^2 = 0$.

The equation $(x + y - 10)^2 + (x - y - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that both $(x + y - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(x - y - 10)^2 = 0$, which means $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$. Adding these two equations, we get $2x = 20$, so $x = 10$. Substituting $x = 10$ into $x + y = 10$, we get $y = 0$. So one vertex of the polygon is $(10, 0)$.

Similarly, the equation $(x - 8)^2 + (y - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that both $(x - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(y - 8)^2 = 0$, which means $x = 8$ and $y = 8$. So another vertex of the polygon is $(8, 8)$.

Thus, the polygon is a square with side length $10 - 8 = 2$. The area of this square is $2^2 = 4$.

The answer is: 4

Approach:


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is true if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The only way this is possible is if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The equations $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$ form a rectangle with side lengths 16 and 20.
To find the area of this rectangle, we simply multiply the side lengths: $16 \times 20 = 320$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 320 square units.
The answer is: $320$

This equation will be zero only when both the terms are zero. So we have two sets of equations.
First set:
$\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x - y \vert = 10$.
The above equations imply that the vertices of the polygon are at points $(x, y)$ where $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. This gives us a square with side length 10sqrt(2). The area of the square is thus $(10\sqrt{2})^2 = 200$.
The second set of equations is $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert y \vert = 8$.
This implies that the vertices of the polygon are at points $(x, y)$ where $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us a square with side length 16. The area of this square is thus $16^2 = 256$.
Since the intersection of the two sets of vertices gives us the trivial set (only the origin), the area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares, which is $200 + 256 = 456$.
The answer is: $\boxed{456}$

Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:



The equation $f(x, y) = 0$ is satisfied if and only if at least one of the factors $g(x, y) = (\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ and $h(x, y) = (\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2$ is equal to 0. This is because the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. 

Therefore, $f(x, y) = 0$ is satisfied if and only if either $g(x, y) = 0$ or $h(x, y) = 0$. 

The equation $g(x, y) = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This system of equations represents two perpendicular lines, and the enclosed area is a square with side length 20. 

The equation $h(x, y) = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which is a square with side length 16.

Therefore, the points satisfying $f(x, y) = 0$ enclose the union of two squares, one with side length 20 and the other with side length 16. 

The area of a square is given by the square of its side length. Thus, the area of the square with side length 20 is $20^2 = 400$, and the area of the square with side length 16 is $16^2 = 256$. 

To find the total area of the convex polygon, we simply add the areas of the two squares: $400 + 256 = 656$.
The answer is: $\boxed{656}$.

Approach:


The equation given is a product of two terms equal to zero, which means either of the terms must be zero. Therefore, we have two cases:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
This case implies that both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us four equations:
- $x + y = 10$
- $x + y = -10$
- $x - y = 10$
- $x - y = -10$
These four equations represent the sides of a square with side length 10 units. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$ square units.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
This case implies that both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us four equations:
- $x = 8$
- $x = -8$
- $y = 8$
- $y = -8$
These four equations represent the sides of a square with side length 16 units. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$ square units.

However, the intersection of the two cases is the set of points satisfying both equations. The intersection is the set of points that form a square with side length 10 units (from Case 1), so the area of the convex polygon formed by the intersection is the same as the area of the square in Case 1, which is 100 square units.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units.
The answer is: $100$
