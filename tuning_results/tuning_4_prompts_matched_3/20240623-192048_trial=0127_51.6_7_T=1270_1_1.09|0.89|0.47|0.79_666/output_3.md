Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. List the variables and known values from the problem.
    - The problem contains only variables x and y. No specific values are provided.

2. Outline the steps using sympy to solve the problem:
    * Identify the sympy functions required for each step.
    * Implement these functions step-by-step, commenting each line for clarity.
    * Finally, calculate the area of the polygon.

Here is the outline of the steps using sympy:

- Recognize that the product of two expressions equals zero if and only if at least one of the expressions equals zero. So, the given equation is equivalent to two systems of equations:

  (1) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

  (2) $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.

- Solve each system of equations:

  (1a) $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.

  (1b) $\vert x \vert = 8$, which implies $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.

  (1c) $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

  (2) $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.

- Solve the four systems of equations to find the coordinates of the vertices of the polygon:

  (a) $x = 8, y = 2$.

  (b) $x = 8, y = -2$.

  (c) $x = -8, y = 2$.

  (d) $x = -8, y = -2$.

- Calculate the area of the polygon formed by these vertices. Since the vertices form a square with side length 16, the area is $16^2 = 256$.

3. Calculate the final answer and verify it's a positive integer:
    The area of the polygon is 256, which is a positive integer.

4. Output the result: The area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{256}$.

The area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{256}$.
The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



We are asked to find the area of the region that is enclosed by the points $\left(x, y\right)$ that satisfy the given equation. First, let's understand the equation:

$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$

The product of two factors is zero if and only if at least one of the factors is zero. Therefore, the equation is satisfied if either:

$$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad (\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0.$$

This means that either $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

For $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, we are dealing with a square with side length $10$ units. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$ square units.

For $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, we are dealing with a square with side length $8$ units. The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$ square units.

Adding the areas of the two squares, the total area of the region is $100 + 64 = 164$ square units.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $164$ square units. The answer is: $164$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation given is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

The only way a product of two terms equals zero is if either of the terms is zero. Thus, we have two separate cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

In the first case, both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ must be zero. This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two lines in the coordinate plane, and the intersection points of these lines form a square with side length 10.

In the second case, both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2$ must be zero. This implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two lines in the coordinate plane, and the intersection points of these lines form a square with side length 8.

The union of these two squares forms the convex polygon. To find its area, we simply add the areas of the two squares:

The area of the larger square is $10^2 = 100$ square units, and the area of the smaller square is $8^2 = 64$ square units. So the total area of the convex polygon is $100 + 64 = 164$.

However, this is incorrect because the points of intersection of the two squares were counted twice. To find the actual area of the convex polygon, we need to subtract the area of the overlapping region. The overlapping region is also a square, with side length equal to the difference of the side lengths of the two squares, which is $10 - 8 = 2$. So the area of the overlapping square is $2^2 = 4$ square units. Therefore, the actual area of the convex polygon is $164 - 4 = 160$ square units.

So the area of the convex polygon is 160 square units. The answer is: $160$

From the problem statement, the only way for the product of two numbers to be 0 is if at least one of the numbers is 0. Thus either
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0 \tag{1}$$
or
$$((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0. \tag{2}$$

From equation $(1)$, we have
$$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \text{ and } (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0.$$

This implies that $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$.
The solutions to these absolute value equations are:
$x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.

From equation $(2)$, we have
$$(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \text{ and } (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0.$$

This implies that $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$.
The solutions to these absolute value equations are:
$x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

The intersections of these lines are:
$(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(2, 8)$, $(-2, 8)$, $(2, -8)$, and $(-2, -8)$.

To find the area of the polygon, we can draw the figure and count the number of unit squares.
The figure is a square with side length 16, so its area is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

The equation given is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

For the product of two numbers to be zero, either one of the numbers must be zero. Therefore, we have two cases:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. Solving these equations gives us the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length 10.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. Solving these equations gives us the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length 16.

The intersection of these two squares forms a larger square with side length 16, but leaving a smaller square with side length 10 inside it. The area of the convex polygon is the area of the larger square minus the area of the smaller square.

```python

    side_large = 16

    area_large = side_large**2
    area_small = side_small**2

    # Area of the convex polygon
    area = area_large - area_small

    return area

result = calculate_area()

The area of the convex polygon is $156$. Since we were asked for a positive integer, this result is valid.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, we have two absolute value expressions. The absolute value of a real number is its numerical distance to zero. So $|x+y|$ is the distance between $x$ and $-y$, and $|x-y|$ is the distance between $x$ and $y$. Similarly, $|x|$ and $|y|$ are the distances from $x$ and $y$ to the origin, respectively.

2. Now, the problem states that the product of two expressions equals zero. The only way a product can be zero is if at least one of the factors is zero. Thus, we have two cases:

   a. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
   b. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

3. For each case, the equations are zero if the absolute value expressions are equal to $10$ or $8$. Thus, we have four equations:

   a. $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, $x - y = -10$.
   b. $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, $y = -8$.

4. Now, we solve these equations:

   a. For $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$, we get $y = 0$. Substituting into $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$, we get $x = 10$ and $x = -10$, respectively. Thus, we have four points: $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, and $(0, -10)$.
   
   b. For $x = 8$ and $x = -8$, substituting into $y = 8$ and $y = -8$, we get eight more points: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

5. All these points form a square with side length $20$. To find its area, we simply square the side length, so the area is $20^2 = 400$.

The area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{400}$ square units.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:


The expression $A = ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is a product of two terms. The product is zero if and only if at least one of the terms is zero. 
So, the equation is satisfied if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

These equations simplify to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The solutions to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ are all points $(x, y)$ such that $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$. The solutions to $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ are all points $(x, y)$ such that $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$. The solutions to $\vert x \vert = 8$ are all points $(x, y)$ such that $x = 8$ or $x = -8$. The solutions to $\vert y \vert = 8$ are all points $(x, y)$ such that $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

Plotting these lines on a coordinate plane, we find that they form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256.
The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Since we have a product of two terms equal to zero, either term must be zero. Hence, either of the two equations holds:
\[(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0\] or \[(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0.\]

Or:
\[(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0\] or \[(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0.\]

This means that the absolute values of $x+y$, $x-y$, $x$, and $y$ must all be equal to 10 or 8.

This gives us the following possibilities:
- For the first equation, $x+y=10$ or $x+y=-10$.
- For the second equation, $x-y=10$ or $x-y=-10$.
- For the third equation, $x=8$ or $x=-8$.
- For the fourth equation, $y=8$ or $y=-8$.

Solving these systems of equations, we find the vertices of the polygon:
\[(8,8), (8,-8), (-8,8), (-8,-8), (10,0), (-10,0), (0,10), (0,-10).\]

The vertices form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. Hence, the area of the polygon is 256.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$
