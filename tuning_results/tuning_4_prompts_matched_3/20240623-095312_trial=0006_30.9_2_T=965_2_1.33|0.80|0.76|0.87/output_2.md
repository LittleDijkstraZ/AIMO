Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions.

We know that the absolute value function $\vert x \vert$ is equal to $x$ if $x \geq 0$ and $-x$ if $x < 0$. So, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be broken down into two cases based on the value of $x$:

Case 1: When $x \geq 1$, we have $\vert x-1 -2 \vert = \vert x-3 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two sub-cases:

Case 1a: When $x-3 \geq 0$, we have $x-3 = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.
Case 1b: When $x-3 < 0$, we have $-(x-3) = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Case 2: When $x < 1$, we have $\vert 1-x -2 \vert = \vert -x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two sub-cases:

Case 2a: When $-x-1 \geq 0$, we have $-x-1 = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.
Case 2b: When $-x-1 < 0$, we have $-( -x-1) = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

For the equation to have four distinct solutions, we need to find the values of $m$ for which the solutions from cases 1a, 1b, 2a, and 2b are all distinct.

From case 1a, we have $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$, and from case 1b, we have $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$. These two solutions are distinct for $m \neq 0$.

From case 2a, we have $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$, and from case 2b, we have $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$. These two solutions are distinct for $m \neq 0$.

Additionally, we need the intersection points of case 1a and case 2a, and case 1b and case 2b to be distinct. This gives us the equations:

$3 + \frac{m}{100} = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $m = -75$.

$3 - \frac{m}{100} = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $m = 50$.

So, the only valid values of $m$ are $m = 50$ and $m = 75$. However, since we are asked for positive integers $m$, the only valid value of $m$ is $50$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions is 1. The answer is: $1$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}=2$. This is because the absolute value function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ attains the value of 2 exactly four times.
So we set $\frac{m}{100}=2$ and solve for $m$:
\[m = 2 \times 100 = 200.\]
Therefore, the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 200.
The answer is: $1$

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. This is because the graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has exactly 4 intersections with the line $y = 2$ at $y = \frac{m}{100} = 2$.

Solving $\frac{m}{100} = 2$ for $m$ gives $m = 200$.

However, the problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the equation, and since 200 is a positive integer, there is only 1 positive integer $m$ that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions.

So, the answer is $1$. The value of $m$ is $200$. The value of the unknown variable $m$ is $200$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}=2$. This is because the expression on the left side of the equation, $| |x-1|-2|$, is always between 0 and 2, inclusive. It equals to 0 when $|x-1|=2$, which gives two solutions. It equals to 2 when $|x-1|-2=\pm2$, which gives two more solutions. So for the equation to have four distinct solutions, the right side must be equal to 2, giving us $\frac{m}{100}=2$, or $m=200$. Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ that satisfies this condition. The answer is: $1$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions. This means that the right-hand side of the equation must be between 0 and 3.

Since $\frac{m}{100}$ is between 0 and 3, $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 3$.

Multiplying all sides of the inequalities by 100 gives $0 < m < 300$.

The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from 1 to 299.

However, we need to find the number of these integers that make the equation have 4 distinct solutions. This happens when $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to 1 or 2.

If $\frac{m}{100}=1$, then $m=100$.

If $\frac{m}{100}=2$, then $m=200$.

So the values of $m$ that make the equation have 4 distinct solutions are 100 and 200.

There are 2 such values, so the answer is 2. The answer is: 2

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

The absolute value function $\vert x-1 \vert -2$ can take on three different values depending on the value of $x$.

If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = y$, then $\vert x-1 \vert = y+2$. This gives us two cases:

1) If $x-1 \geq 0$, then $x-1 = y+2$, or $x = y+3$.
2) If $x-1 < 0$, then $-(x-1) = y+2$, or $x = 1 - (y+2)$, or $x = -y - 1$.

So the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be rewritten as two equations:

1) $\vert x - (3 + \frac{m}{100}) \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
2) $\vert x - (-1 + \frac{m}{100}) \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.

These two equations will each have two branches, making a total of four equations to solve.

We want these four equations to have four distinct solutions. This means the absolute value expressions on the left side of the equations must be nonnegative for some range of $x$, and negative elsewhere.

For the first equation, $2 - \frac{m}{100}$ must be positive and less than 3, so $2 - \frac{m}{100} < 3$ or $\frac{m}{100} > -1$, and $2 - \frac{m}{100} > 0$ or $\frac{m}{100} < 2$. This gives $-100 < m < 200$.

For the second equation, $2 - \frac{m}{100}$ must be positive and less than 1, so $2 - \frac{m}{100} < 1$ or $\frac{m}{100} > 1$, and $2 - \frac{m}{100} > 0$ or $\frac{m}{100} < 2$. This gives $100 < m < 200$.

The intersection of these two ranges gives $100 < m < 200$.

The question asks for the number of positive integer values of $m$ in this range, and that number is $100$. The answer is: $100$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. This means that the right side $\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal to either $2$ or $1$. This is because the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a graph with a "hump" shape, and the height of this hump is $2$. So for $f(x)$ to have $4$ distinct solutions, the right side of the equation must be $2$ or $1$.

If $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, then $m = 200$.
If $\frac{m}{100} = 1$, then $m = 100$.
So the possible values of $m$ are $100$ and $200$. The answer is: $2$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}=2$. This is because the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a graph that resembles a "V" with the vertex at $y=2$. The equation $f(x) = \frac{m}{100}$ will have four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$.

To find $m$, we multiply both sides of the equation $\frac{m}{100}=2$ by $100$ to get $m=200$. Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions, and that is $m=200$.
The answer is: $1$
