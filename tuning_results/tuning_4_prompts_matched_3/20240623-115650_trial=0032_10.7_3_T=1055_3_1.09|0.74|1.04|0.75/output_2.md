Approach:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 1 and 2. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a "V" shape with two "humps" of height 1 and 2 respectively. So, for there to be 4 distinct solutions, the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be strictly between these two humps.

Therefore, we need to find the value of $m$ such that $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$.

To find the value of $m$, we can multiply all sides of the inequality by 100 to get rid of the fraction: $100 < m < 200$.

Now we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality. This is simply the number of integers from 101 to 199 inclusive.

The number of integers from 101 to 199 inclusive is $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$.

So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 99.
The answer is: 99

Approach:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ reaches its maximum value of 2 exactly once.

Therefore, we need to solve the equation $\frac{m}{100} = 2$ for $m$.

Solution:
Multiplying both sides of the equation by 100 gives $m = 200$.

So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 1, since there is only one positive integer value of $m$ that satisfies the equation. The answer is: $1$

Approach:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is the maximum value of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$.
The function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a piecewise function that takes on the value of 3 when $x \leq 1$, the value of $1-2x$ when $1 < x < 3$, the value of 3 when $x \geq 3$.
Therefore, the maximum value of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is 3.
So, we want $\frac{m}{100} = 3$, which implies $m = 300$.
Therefore, there is only 1 positive integer $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions, namely $m = 300$.
The answer is: $1$

Assistant:

Approach:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a triangular wave with a maximum value of 2 and a minimum value of -2. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=k$ has 4 distinct solutions for any positive value of $k$. In this case, $k = \frac{m}{100}$, so $\frac{m}{100} = 2$ and $m = 200$.

To confirm this, we can solve the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{200}{100} = 2$. The solutions to this equation are $x = -1, 3, 5, 7$. These are 4 distinct solutions. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 1, namely $m = 200$. The answer is: $\boxed{1}$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:


We can start by analyzing the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.
The right-hand side, $\frac{m}{100}$, is a positive number since $m$ is a positive integer.
The left-hand side, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, is a nonnegative number.
Therefore, the equation has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} \leq 2$.
This implies $m \leq 200$.

Now, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation has 4 distinct solutions.
This is equivalent to finding the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy $0 < m \leq 200$.
The number of such integers is $200$.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 200. The answer is: $1$
