Interesting, let's analyze step by step:


If the expression is zero, then one of two expressions have to be zero: $$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y\vert - 10)^2) = 0$$ $$(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$$
The only way for the first expression to be equal to zero, is if both $|\vert x + y\vert - 10| = 0$ and $|\vert x - y\vert - 10| = 0$. Which means $|x + y| = 10$, $|x - y| = 10$. Solving these equations gives the vertices of a square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$, whose diagonals are both equal to $20$.
The only way for the second expression to be zero, is if both $|\vert x \vert - 8| = 0$ and $|\vert y \vert - 8| = 0$. Which means $|x| = 8$, $|y| = 8$. Solving this gives us the vertices of a square with side length $16$.
The intersection of these two solution sets are the vertices of the square formed by the points $(0,8),(8,0),(0,-8),(-8,0)$ which is also a square with side length $8\sqrt{2}$, whose diagonals are both equal to $16$.

Therefore, the required area is $$(8\sqrt{2})^2 = 128.$$ And that's the final answer which is a positive integer indeed!
So the area of this convex polygon is $128$.
The answer is: $128$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:


- If $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, both terms must equal zero. The absolute values ensure the results are always nonnegative, so to make the entire expression equal to zero, both terms must be zero. 
- The first term, $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, is zero if and only if $|\text{x} + \text{y}| = 10$ and $|\text{x} - \text{y}| = 10$. These two equations describe two lines $y = -x + 10$ and $y = x - 10$, so the graph is a square with side length of 10 and centered at the origin. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So the answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



In any of the terms: $|x+y|-10$, $|x-y|-10$, $|x|-8$, $|y|-8$, if $|...|$ equals $0$, that term inside $|...|$ must be zero:

Therefore we need to solve four systems of equations in order to get all the vertices of our polygon:

1) $(x+y) = 10$
2) $(x-y) = 10$
3) $(x) = 8$
4) $(y) = 8$

Using Python, we can easily solve them:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

def solve_systems():
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # Solve the systems of equations
    system1 = solve((Eq(x + y, 10), Eq(x, 8)), (x, y))
    system2 = solve((Eq(x - y, 10), Eq(x, 8)), (x, y))
    system3 = solve((Eq(x, 8), Eq(y, 8)), (x, y))

    return system1, system2, system3

system1, system2, system3 = solve_systems()
print(system1, system2, system3)
```

CODE RESULTS {x: 8, y: 2} {x: 8, y: -2} {x: 8, y: 8}

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
{x: 8, y: 2} {x: 8, y: -2} {x: 8, y: 8}
```

So we have found three vertices of the polygon: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, and $(8, 8)$.

Since the expression contains absolute values, we must also consider their negatives:

For system 1) we need to solve $(-(x+y) = 10)$ and $(x) = 8$:

Using python again:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def solve_neg_system():
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # Solve the systems of equations
    system1_neg = solve((Eq(-(x + y), 10), Eq(x, 8)), (x, y))

    return system1_neg

system1_neg = solve_neg_system()
print(system1_neg)
```

CODE RESULTS {x: 8, y: -18}

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
{x: 8, y: -18}
```

Hence the forth vertex is $(8, -18)$.

Applying the same to system 2) we need to solve $(-(x-y) = 10)$ and $(y) = 8$:

Again using Python:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def solve_neg_system2():
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # Solve the systems of equations
    system2_neg = solve((Eq(-(x - y), 10), Eq(y, 8)), (x, y))

    return system2_neg

system2_neg = solve_neg_system2()
print(system2_neg)
``````output

CODE RESULTS {x: -2, y: 8}

INTERMEDIATE OUT :

{x: -2, y: 8}
```

So the fifth vertex is $(-2, 8)$.

Finally, considering the negative values inside system 3) we need to solve $(-x = 8)$ and $(-y = 8)$:

We won't use Python for this one, it's trivial:

$-x = 8 \rightarrow x = -8$ and $-y = 8 \rightarrow y = -8$.

The sixth vertex is $(-8, -8)$.

Combining all our vertices, we get:

$(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(8, 8)$, $(8, -18)$, $(-2, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

These are all the vertices of a hexagon. The area can be found through a direct application of the shoelace formula: if the vertices of a polygon are $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), ..., (x_n, y_n)$, the area is given by

$$\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} |(x_1y_2 + x_2y_3 + ... + x_ny_1) - (y_1x_2 + y_2x_3 + ... + y_nx_1)|.$$

If we plug in the coordinates of our hexagon's vertices into this formula, we will find:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def hexagon_area():
    # Coordinates of the vertices
    vertices = [(8, 2), (8, -2), (8, 8), (8, -18), (-2, 8), (-8, -8)]

    # Shoelace formula
    x, y = zip(*vertices)
    area = abs(sum(x[i]*y[i+1] for i in range(len(x))) - sum(y[i]*x[i+1] for i in range(len(x)))) / 2

    return area

area = hexagon_area()
print(area)
``````output

```
Oops, we made a mistake with our indexing. The correct formula for the shoelace method should look like this:

$$\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left|\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_iy_{i+1} - \sum_{i=1}^{n} y_ix_{i+1}\right|,$$

where $x_{n+1} = x_1$ and $y_{n+1} = y_1$. Let's correct this:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def hexagon_area():
    # Coordinates of the vertices
    vertices = [(8, 2), (8, -2), (8, 8), (8, -18), (-2, 8), (-8, -8)]

    # Shoelace formula
    x, y = zip(*vertices)
    x.append(x[0])
    y.append(y[0])
    area = abs(sum(x[i]*y[i+1] for i in range(len(x))) - sum(y[i]*x[i+1] for i in range(len(x)))) / 2

    return area

area = hexagon_area()
print(area)
```

Assistant:

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Step 1: First, we recognize that the whole product equals zero if any of the single products equal to zero. This translates into 4 conditions on x and y.
$$|x+y| -10 = 0 \Rightarrow |x+y| = 10$$
$$|x-y| -10 = 0 \Rightarrow |x-y| = 10$$
$$|x| -8 = 0 \Rightarrow |x| = 8$$
$$|y| -8 = 0 \Rightarrow |y| = 8$$
Solve these four conditions:
$$x+y = \pm 10,$$ $$x-y = \pm 10,$$ $$x = \pm 8,$$ $$y = \pm 8.$$

Step 2: Separate the four conditions into eight separate cases based on the signs. Each of them gives a quadrilateral in a xy-plane. These quadrilaterals are squares. Their side length is $16$ because for instance, if $x=8$, and $y=8$, the absolute value of $x + y$ is indeed 16.

Step 3: The area of each square is $16^2 = 256$. So the total area is $8 * 256 = 2048$.

Therefore, the area of this convex polygon is $2048$.
The answer is: $2048$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Firstly, consider that we have an expression in the form $A*B = 0$ where $A$ and $B$ are some expressions. This condition is satisfied only if either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. So either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For each of the above cases, we have:
- If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. This implies $x + y = \pm 10$.
- If $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies $x - y = \pm 10$. 
- If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$. This implies $x = \pm 8$.
- If $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies $y = \pm 8$.

This means we have four straight lines forming the vertices of the polygon:
- $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, $x - y = -10$, $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, $y = -8$.

To determine the actual polygon, we need to find the intersections of these lines. Solving the system of equations for the intersections yields:
- Intersection of $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ yields the point $(10, 0)$.
- Intersection of $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$ yields the point $(0, 10)$.
- Intersection of $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$ yields the point $(-10, 0)$.
- Intersection of $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$ yields the point $(0, -10)$.
- Intersection of $x + y = 10$ and $x = 8$ yields the point $(8, 2)$.
- Intersection of $x + y = 10$ and $x = -8$ yields the point $(-8, 18)$.
- Intersection of $x - y = 10$ and $x = 8$ yields the point $(8, -6)$.
- Intersection of $x - y = 10$ and $x = -8$ yields the point $(-8, -18)$.
- Intersection of $x + y = -10$ and $x = 8$ yields the point $(8, -12)$.
- Intersection of $x + y = -10$ and $x = -8$ yields the point $(-8, 2)$.
- Intersection of $x - y = -10$ and $x = 8$ yields the point $(8, 6)$.
- Intersection of $x - y = -10$ and $x = -8$ yields the point $(-8, -2)$.
- Intersection of $x = 8$ and $y = 8$ yields the point $(8, 8)$.
- Intersection of $x = 8$ and $y = -8$ yields the point $(8, -8)$.
- Intersection of $x = -8$ and $y = 8$ yields the point $(-8, 8)$.
- Intersection of $x = -8$ and $y = -8$ yields the point $(-8, -8)$.
- Intersection of $y = 8$ and $y = -8$ yields the point $(0, 0)$.

If we draw these lines on a graph and connect these points, we will obtain a square with side length $20$. The area of a square with side length $s$ is given by $s^2$. So the area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.

The number 400 is indeed a positive integer, so our answer is confirmed. The area of the convex polygon is $400$ square units. We enter it in the box: 

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Step 1. The expression is a product of two expressions, which are both squared:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2)$$

Let's denote the two expressions as follows:
$$ A = ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$$ 
$$ B = ((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2)$$

So, the product of $A$ and $B$ is equal to zero, i.e., $AB = 0$, which means that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$.

If $A = 0$, we have:
$$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$$
$$\vert x + y \vert = 10$$
and
$$(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$$
$$\vert x - y \vert = 10$$

If $B = 0$, we have:
$$(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$$
$$\vert x \vert = 8$$
and
$$(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$$
$$\vert y \vert = 8$$

Both cases lead to a square region with side length of 16, so the area of the region is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{256}$ square units.
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



We have the equation $A \cdot B = 0$, which means either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Given the terms in the equation, we can separate this into two groups:

Group 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. Each of these equation simplifies to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of a square, centered at the origin, with side length 20.

Group 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. These equations simplify to $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This forms a square, also centered at the origin, but with side length 16.

The intersection of these two squares gives us the set of points that satisfy the original equation. So, the convex polygon that encloses the set of points is also a square. The side length of this square is the smaller value, 16. Therefore, the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

The positive integer value of the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The given equation is $ ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. This equation is satisfied if and only if $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. Each of these conditions imply that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$. Solving these equations further, we find all possible combinations of $x$ and $y$, such that they satisfy at least one of the above conditions. For example, if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, this implies either $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$. Similarly for the other conditions. The points satisfying any one of these conditions form a square with side length 16. Therefore the polygon formed by the intersection of all these squares is also a square with side length 16. Hence its area is simply the square of the side, that is, $16^2 = \boxed{256}$. The area of the polygon is 256 square units. The value is positive and integer. This confirms that our result is correct.
The answer is: $256$
