Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Approach:

 The given equation is a product of two expressions, so one of them must be zero for the product to be zero. Therefore, we can consider the two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
This can only happen if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
This means that the points must lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$.
The intersection of these lines is at $(5,5)$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
This can only happen if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
This means that the points must lie on the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$.
The intersection of these lines is at $(8,8)$.

The points satisfying the given equation form a square with vertices at $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,-5)$, and $(-5,5)$.
The side length of this square is $10$, so its area is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $\boxed{100}$

The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. Let's analyze these two cases separately.

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
This implies that both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. Therefore, $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. Solving these two equations gives $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. These four lines are the sides of a square with side length 10.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
This implies that both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. Therefore, $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This results in a square with side length 16.

The intersection of the two cases is the square with side length 10, which is completely contained in the square with side length 16. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of the square with side length 10, which is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

Approach:

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either one of the terms must be zero. This gives us two systems of equations to solve. The solutions to these systems of equations will give us the vertices of the polygon. Once we have the vertices, we can calculate the area of the polygon.

Step 1: Solve $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
From the first equation, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
From the second equation, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.

Step 2: Solve $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
From the first equation, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$, which implies $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
From the second equation, we have $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

Step 3: Combine the solutions from steps 1 and 2 to find the vertices of the polygon.
We have the following combinations:
- $(x, y) = (8, 2)$ from $x + y = 10$ and $x = 8$
- $(x, y) = (8, -10)$ from $x + y = -10$ and $y = -8$
- $(x, y) = (-8, 10)$ from $x - y = 10$ and $x = -8$
- $(x, y) = (-8, -8)$ from $x - y = -10$ and $y = -8$

Step 4: Calculate the area of the polygon.
The vertices of the polygon are $(8, 2)$, $(8, -10)$, $(-8, 10)$, and $(-8, -8)$. This forms a rectangle with side lengths 16 and 12. The area of the rectangle is $16 \times 12 = 192$.
The answer is: $192$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:


The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if either of the factors is zero.

The first factor is zero when either $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two lines passing through the origin at an angle of $45^\circ$ and $-45^\circ$, respectively.

The second factor is zero when either $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two lines parallel to the x-axis at y=8 and y=-8, and two lines parallel to the y-axis at x=8 and x=-8.

The intersection points of these lines are the vertices of the polygon: $(8,8), (8,-8), (-8,8),$ and $(-8,-8)$. These points form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units.
The answer is: $256$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:



The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$ and the second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$.

Setting each expression to zero gives us the following:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first equation to be zero, both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ must be zero. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two squares with side length 10, one centered at the origin with sides parallel to the x and y axes, and the other with the same dimensions and centered at (10,0) with sides parallel to the x and y axes.

For the second equation to be zero, both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2$ must be zero. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two squares with side length 16, one centered at the origin with sides parallel to the x and y axes, and the other with the same dimensions and centered at (8,0) with sides parallel to the x and y axes.

The intersection of these two squares forms a convex polygon. This polygon is a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Approach:


The equation $A \cdot B = 0$ implies that $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first case, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, it implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These two equations represent a square with side length 10 and diagonals of length 10$\sqrt{2}$.

For the second case, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, it implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which represent a square with side length 16 and diagonals of length 16$\sqrt{2}$.

To find the area of the convex polygon, we need to find the intersection of the two squares. The intersection is a square with side length 8 and diagonals of length 8$\sqrt{2}$.

The area of a square is given by side length squared. So, the area of the convex polygon is $8^2 = 64$.
The answer is: $64$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:

 The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if either of the two factors is zero. 

For the first factor to be zero, either $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. These equations simplify to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two lines in the plane, and they form a rectangle with side lengths of 20 units.

For the second factor to be zero, either $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. These equations simplify to $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two lines in the plane, and they form a square with side lengths of 16 units.

The intersection of the two rectangles is the convex polygon we are interested in. This polygon is a square with side length 20 units. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 400. The answer is: $400$.

Assistant:

Approach:

 The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This can only be true when $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$. The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This can only be true when $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

The points that satisfy both equations are $(\pm 10, \pm 10)$ and $(\pm 8, \pm 8)$. These points form a square with side length 20. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 400 square units. The answer is: $400$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first term to be zero, we need $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations gives us the vertices of the polygon as $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0)$.

For the second term to be zero, we need $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these four equations gives us the vertices of the polygon as $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$.

Now, we can plot these points on a coordinate plane to visualize the polygon. We find that the polygon is a square with side length 10. The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side, so the area of the polygon is $10^2 = 100$.

The answer is: $100$
