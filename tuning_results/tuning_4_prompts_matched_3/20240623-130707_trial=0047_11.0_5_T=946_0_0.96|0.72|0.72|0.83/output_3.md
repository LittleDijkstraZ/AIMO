The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, which means that either of the terms must be zero for the entire expression to be zero. Therefore, we have two sets of equations:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From the first set of equations, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the points $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, and $(-5,-5)$.

From the second set of equations, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations, we get the points $(8,0)$, $(0,8)$, $(-8,0)$, and $(0,-8)$.

The points that satisfy both sets of equations are the vertices of the polygon. Plotting these points on a coordinate plane, we can see that they form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units.

 The given equation is equal to zero if and only if both factors are equal to zero. This means we have two sets of conditions:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
From the first set of conditions, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.
From the second set of conditions, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
Combining these conditions, we have four cases to consider:
Case 1: $x = 8$ and $y = 8$.
Case 2: $x = 8$ and $y = -8$.
Case 3: $x = -8$ and $y = 8$.
Case 4: $x = -8$ and $y = -8$.
For Case 1, we have $x + y = 16$ and $x - y = 0$, which does not satisfy the conditions from the first set of conditions.
For Case 2, we have $x + y = 0$ and $x - y = 16$, which does not satisfy the conditions from the first set of conditions.
For Case 3, we have $x + y = 0$ and $x - y = -16$, which does not satisfy the conditions from the first set of conditions.
For Case 4, we have $x + y = -16$ and $x - y = 0$, which satisfies the conditions from the first set of conditions.
So the only valid case is Case 4, where $x = -8$ and $y = -8$.
This means the points satisfying the equation are $(-8, -8)$.
The polygon formed by these points is a square with side length 16.
The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.
Solving these equations, we get the lines $y = -x \pm 10$ and $y = x \pm 10$.
Similarly, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$,
which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
This gives us the lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
The intersection of these lines form a square with side length 16.
The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.

Let's consider the first expression: $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$. For this expression to be zero, both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, and $(-5,-5)$.

Now let's consider the second expression: $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. For this expression to be zero, both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. But this doesn't give us any new vertices.

So the vertices of the polygon are $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, and $(-5,-5)$. This forms a square with side length 10. The area of a square is given by the square of the side length, so the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero, which means that either one of the expressions is zero. 

The expressions are $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$, and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2$. 

For the first pair of expressions to be zero, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, -2)$, and $(-8, 2)$.

For the second pair of expressions to be zero, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$.

The vertices of the convex polygon are the intersections of these two squares. The convex polygon is a larger square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$, so its area is $(10\sqrt{2})^2 = 200$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 200. The answer is: $200$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The equation $AB = 0$ is equivalent to $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which gives $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
From $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which gives $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
From $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$, which gives $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
From $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

The solutions to these equations give us the vertices of the polygon:
$(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, $(-8,-8)$, $(10,0)$, $(-10,0)$, $(0,10)$, and $(0,-10)$.

Plotting these points, we can see that they form a square with side length 16. The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256.
The answer is: $256$

The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.

If $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.

If $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

The solutions to these equations are the vertices of the polygon. By plotting these points, we can see that the polygon is a square with side length 20. The area of the square is $20^2 = 400$.
The answer is: $400$

 The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied only when at least one of the factors is zero.
The first factor is zero when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two squares with side length 10 centered at the origin.
The second factor is zero when $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two squares with side length 16 centered at the origin.
The intersection of these four squares is a square with side length 8, so the area of the convex polygon is $8^2 = 64$. The answer is: $64$

This problem involves the properties of absolute value and how it interacts with equations and inequalities.

The equation $A \cdot B = 0$ implies that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

Solving these equations gives us the following four sets of solutions:

1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
2. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
3. $\vert x \vert = 8$, which implies $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
4. $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

The intersection of these solutions gives us the vertices of the polygon:

1. $(8, 2)$, $(8, -18)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -18)$.
2. $(18, 8)$, $(18, -8)$, $(-18, 8)$, and $(-18, -8)$.

The polygon is a square with side length 16. Therefore, its area is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$
