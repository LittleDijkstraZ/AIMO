 This problem is a challenging functional equation problem. To solve it, we need to find the function $f$ that satisfies the given conditions. One possible approach is to use a trial and error method by plugging in some values and see if it works.

Let's start with the simpler condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. If we plug in $n=1$, we get $f(2)=2f(1)+1$. This means that knowing the value of $f(1)$ will give us the value of $f(2)$.

Now let's look at the more complicated condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. If we plug in $n=1$, we get $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$. This means that $f(f(f(1)))=1$, and since $f(f(f(1)))=f(1)$, we have $f(1)=1$.

Now we can use $f(1)=1$ to find $f(2)$ using the simpler condition: $f(2)=2f(1)+1=2*1+1=3$.

We can continue this process to find $f(3)$, $f(4)$, and so on. After some trial and error, we find that the function $f(n)=2n-1$ satisfies both conditions.

Now we can use this function to find $f(100)$: $f(100)=2*100-1=199$. So the answer is $199$. The function $f(n)=2n-1$ satisfies both conditions in the problem.

Therefore, $f(100)=199$. The answer is: $199$

This problem requires a recursive approach to find the value of $f(100)$. We can start by evaluating the function for $n=100$ using the second condition provided:
\[f(2n)=2f(n)+1.\]
We can substitute $n=50$ to get:
\[f(100)=2f(50)+1.\]
Next, we can substitute $n=25$ into the second condition to get:
\[f(50)=2f(25)+1.\]
Continuing this process, we can substitute $n=12.5$ (which is not an integer, but we can use the first condition to find $f(12.5)$):
\[f(25)=f(f(f(12.5)))=8(12.5)-7=8*12.5-7=100-7=93.\]
Now we can substitute $n=25$ into the equation for $f(50)$:
\[f(50)=2f(25)+1=2*93+1=186+1=187.\]
Finally, we can substitute $n=50$ into the equation for $f(100)$:
\[f(100)=2f(50)+1=2*187+1=374+1=375.\]
So, $f(100)=375$. The answer is: $375$

To solve this problem, we can start by plugging in $n=1$ into the second equation to find $f(1)$.
We have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.
Then, we can plug in $f(1)$ into the first equation to find $f(f(1))$.
We have $f(f(1)) = 8 \cdot 1 - 7 = 1$.
Since $f(f(f(1))) = f(1)$, we have $f(1) = 1$.
Now we can use the second equation to find $f(2)$.
We have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2 \cdot 1 + 1 = 3$.
We can continue this process to find $f(3)$, $f(4)$, and so on.
After some calculations, we find that $f(100) = 199$. The answer is: $199$

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."

 The function $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ can be used to find $f(100)$ step by step.

First, we need to find the value of $f(1)$. We know that $f(2 \cdot 1) = 2f(1) + 1$. So, $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. But we also know that $f(f(f(1))) = 8 \cdot 1 - 7 = 1$. So, if we let $f(1) = x$, then $f(f(x)) = 1$. That means $f(x) = 1$ because $f(f(x)) = f(1) = x$. Substituting $x = 1$ into the equation $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$, we get $f(2) = 2 \cdot 1 + 1 = 3$.

Now, we can find $f(100)$ by using the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We know that $100 = 2 \cdot 50$, so $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$. We can continue to use the equation to find $f(50)$ from $f(25)$, $f(12)$, $f(6)$, and $f(3)$. We already know $f(2) = 3$, so:
- $f(3) = 2f(1.5) + 1 = 2f(2) + 1 = 2 \cdot 3 + 1 = 7$,
- $f(6) = 2f(3) + 1 = 2 \cdot 7 + 1 = 15$,
- $f(12) = 2f(6) + 1 = 2 \cdot 15 + 1 = 31$,
- $f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1 = 2f(13) + 1 = 2 \cdot 31 + 1 = 63$,
- $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1 = 2 \cdot 63 + 1 = 127$.

Finally, $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2 \cdot 127 + 1 = 255$. So, the value of $f(100)$ is 255. The answer is: $255$

 This problem is a bit tricky to solve directly, but we can use a recursive approach to find the value of $f(100)$.

First, we know that $f(f(f(100))) = 8 \cdot 100 - 7 = 793$. So we need to find a number $x$ such that $f(x) = 100$ and $f(f(f(x))) = 793$.

Let's start by finding $f(1)$. We know that $f(f(f(1))) = 8 \cdot 1 - 7 = -5$, but this doesn't help us because we want a positive number.

But if we look at the second equation, we know that $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. We can use this to find $f(1)$.

If we let $n = 1$ in the second equation, we get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. Since $f(2)$ is known to be 3 (because $f(2)$ is the first number $x$ such that $f(f(f(x))) = 8 \cdot 2 - 7 = 9$, and $f(f(f(x))) = 9$ implies $f(x) = 3$), we can solve for $f(1)$:
\[3 = 2f(1) + 1 \implies f(1) = 1.\]

Now that we have $f(1)$, we can find $f(2)$:
\[f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2 \cdot 1 + 1 = 3.\]

Continuing this process, we can find $f(3)$, $f(4)$, and so on, until we find $f(100)$.

After doing this, we find that $f(100) = 199$. So the value of $f(100)$ is 199. The answer is: $199$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."

Assistant:

 The problem is a bit complex to be solved directly by Python, but we can solve it step by step.

Firstly, let's set $n = 1$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we get $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$, so $f(f(1))=1$.

Then, let's set $n = 1$ in the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we get $f(2)=2f(1)+1$, so $f(2)=2*1+1=3$.

Now, we know that $f(f(1))=1$ and $f(2)=3$, so we can find $f(1)$ by setting $n = 2$ in the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we get $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2*3+1=7$, and then set $n = 4$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we get $f(f(f(4)))=8*4-7=27$, and since $f(f(f(4)))=f(7)$ and $f(f(4))=f(7)$, we have $f(7)=27$, so $f(1)=27$.

Now, we can find $f(100)$ by setting $n = 50$ in the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we get $f(100)=2f(50)+1$. But we don't know $f(50)$ yet.

However, we can find $f(50)$ by setting $n = 25$ in the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we get $f(50)=2f(25)+1$. And we can find $f(25)$ by setting $n = 12.5$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, but $12.5$ is not a positive integer, so we cannot directly apply the equation. However, we can notice that $f(f(1))=1$, $f(2)=3$, $f(4)=7$, $f(7)=27$, and $f(1)=27$, and the function $f$ seems to be a function that maps each integer to the next Fibonacci number. Therefore, we can guess that $f(n)$ is the $n$-th Fibonacci number.

Let's check if this guess is correct. If $f(n)$ is the $n$-th Fibonacci number, then $f(1)=1$, $f(2)=2$, $f(3)=3$, $f(4)=5$, $f(5)=8$, $f(6)=13$, $f(7)=21$, $f(8)=34$, $f(9)=55$, $f(10)=89$, $f(11)=144$, $f(12)=233$, $f(13)=377$, $f(14)=610$, $f(15)=987$, $f(16)=1597$, $f(17)=2584$, $f(18)=4181$, $f(19)=6765$, $f(20)=10946$, and so on. We can see that our guess is correct because $f(1)=1$, $f(2)=2$, $f(3)=3$, $f(4)=5$, $f(5)=8$, $f(6)=13$, $f(7)=21$, $f(8)=34$, $f(9)=55$, $f(10)=89$, $f(11)=144$, $f(12)=233$, $f(13)=377$, $f(14)=610$, $f(15)=987$, $f(16)=1597$, $f(17)=2584$, $f(18)=4181$, $f(19)=6765$, $f(20)=10946$, and so on, all match the Fibonacci sequence.

So, $f(n)$ is indeed the $n$-th Fibonacci number. Therefore, $f(50)$ is the 50th Fibonacci number, which is $f(50)=12586269025$. Then we can find $f(100)$ by setting $n = 50$ in the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we get $f(100)=2f(50)+1=2*12586269025+1=25172538051$.

So, $f(100)=25172538051$. The answer is: $25172538051$

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."

Assistant:


The problem asks us to find the value of $f(100)$ using the given two conditions. The first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ is a bit difficult to work with directly, so we can try to use the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ instead.

Let's start by evaluating $f(100)$ using the second condition. We can write $100 = 2 \cdot 50$, so we have $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$. Now we need to find the value of $f(50)$. We can write $50 = 2 \cdot 25$, so we have $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$. We can continue this process until we reach a value that we can easily find. 

After several steps, we find that $f(100) = 2(2(2f(12.5) + 1) + 1) + 1$. But we cannot go any further with this method because $12.5$ is not an integer. So we need to look at the first condition again.

Let's try to find a pattern by substituting some values into the first condition. If we let $n=1$, we have $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1$, so $f(f(1))=1$ and $f(1)=1$.
If we let $n=2$, we have $f(f(f(2)))=8(2)-7=9$, so $f(f(2))=3$ and $f(2)=3$.
If we let $n=3$, we have $f(f(f(3)))=8(3)-7=17$, so $f(f(3))=17$ and $f(3)=17$.

From these examples, we can see that $f(n)=n$ for $n=1,2,3$. Now let's check if this pattern holds for $n=4$. We have $f(f(f(4)))=8(4)-7=23$, so $f(f(4))=23$ and $f(4)=23$. But this does not match our pattern, so we must have made a mistake somewhere.

Let's go back and check our work. When we let $n=1$, we got $f(1)=1$, which is correct. When we let $n=2$, we got $f(2)=3$, which is correct. When we let $n=3$, we got $f(3)=17$, which is also correct. But when we let $n=4$, we got $f(4)=23$, which does not match our pattern.

The mistake was in our assumption that the pattern holds for all positive integers $n$. It seems that the pattern only holds for $n=1,2,3$. So we can conclude that $f(n)=n$ for $n=1,2,3$. Now we can use this result to find $f(100)$.

Since $100 = 2 \cdot 50$, we have $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$. Since $50 = 2 \cdot 25$, we have $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$. Since $25 = 2 \cdot 12.5$, we have $f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1$. But we know from our pattern that $f(n)=n$ for $n=1,2,3$, so $f(12.5)=12.5$. Therefore, $f(25) = 2(12.5) + 1 = 26$, $f(50) = 2(26) + 1 = 53$, and finally $f(100) = 2(53) + 1 = 107$.

So $f(100) = 107$. The answer is: $107$

 This problem requires a bit of mathematical thinking and not straightforward programming. However, one can notice that $f(1) = 3$ using the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$.
Then, $f(f(1)) = f(3) = 5$ using $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$.
And finally, $f(f(f(1))) = f(5) = 13$ using $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$.
But we also know that $f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = 1$. So we have $f(5) = 1$.
From $f(f(1)) = f(3) = 5$, we can get $f(f(3)) = f(5) = 1$. So $f(f(f(3))) = f(1) = 3$. But we also know that $f(f(f(3))) = 8*3 - 7 = 13$. So we have $f(1) = 3$.
Then we can use the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$ to find $f(100)$.
$f(f(f(100))) = 8*100 - 7 = 793$.
And since $f(f(f(100))) = f(f(f(100))) = f(f(100)) = f(100)$, we have $f(100) = 793$.

So the answer is $f(100) = 793$. The value of $f(100)$ is 793.
The answer is: $793$

To find $f(100)$, we can use the given equations to find $f(f(f(100)))$ and then work backwards to find $f(f(100))$ and finally $f(100)$.

First, let's set $n = 100$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to get $f(f(f(100)))=8*100-7=793$.

Now, let's set $n = f(100)$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=793$ to get $f(f(f(f(100))))=793$. But we know that $f(f(f(100)))=793$, so we have $f(793)=793$.

Next, let's set $n = f(f(100))$ in the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to get $f(2f(f(100)))=2f(f(100))+1$. Since we know that $f(f(f(100)))=793$, this equation becomes $f(2*793)=2*793+1$.

We know that $f(793)=793$, so we can substitute $793$ into the equation to get $f(2*793)=2*793+1$, which simplifies to $f(1586)=1587$.

Now, let's set $n = 1586$ in the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to get $f(2*1586)=2f(1586)+1$. This simplifies to $f(3172)=2*1587+1=3175$.

Finally, let's set $n = 3172$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=793$ to get $f(f(f(3172)))=793$. But we know that $f(3172)=3175$, so we have $f(3175)=793$.

Now, let's set $n = 793$ in the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to get $f(2*793)=2f(793)+1$. This simplifies to $f(1586)=2*793+1=1587$.

Finally, let's set $n = 1586$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to get $f(f(f(1586)))=8*1586-7=12685$. But we know that $f(1586)=1587$, so we have $f(1587)=12685$.

Now, let's set $n = 1587$ in the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to get $f(2*1587)=2f(1587)+1$. This simplifies to $f(3174)=2*12685+1=25371$.

Finally, let's set $n = 3174$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to get $f(f(f(3174)))=8*3174-7=25371$. But we know that $f(3174)=25371$, so we have $f(25371)=25371$.

Therefore, $f(100)$ is the value of $n$ that satisfies $f(n)=25371$. By trial and error, we find that $n=100$. So, $f(100)=100$.
The answer is: $100$

This problem is quite complex and requires a deep understanding of the properties of the function $f$. However, we can use the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to find some values of the function. For example, $f(2)=2f(1)+1$. Let's denote $f(1)$ as $x$. Then we have $f(2)=2x+1$. Now we can use the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to find the value of $x$. By setting $n=1$, we get $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$. Since $f(f(f(1)))=1$, we have $f(x)=1$. Substituting this into the equation $f(2)=2x+1$, we get $1=2x+1$, which implies $x=0$. Therefore, $f(1)=0$.
Now we can use the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to find $f(2), f(4), f(8), \ldots$ and so on, until we find $f(100)$. After calculating these values, we find that $f(100)=191$.
The answer is: $191$

 To solve this problem, we need to find the value of $f(100)$ using the given functional equations.

Let's start by finding the value of $f(1)$ using the second equation:
$f(2 \cdot 1) = 2f(1) + 1 \implies f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.

Now, let's find the value of $f(2)$ using the first equation:
$f(f(f(2))) = 8 \cdot 2 - 7 \implies f(f(f(2))) = 9$.

Since $f(f(f(2))) = 9$, we can substitute the value of $f(2)$ from the second equation into the first equation:
$f(f(2f(1) + 1)) = 9$.

Let's assume $f(1) = a$. Then $f(2f(1) + 1) = f(2a + 1)$.
So, $f(f(2a + 1)) = 9$.

Again, using the first equation, we have:
$f(f(2a + 1)) = 8(2a + 1) - 7 \implies f(f(2a + 1)) = 16a + 1$.

Setting this equal to 9, we get:
$16a + 1 = 9 \implies 16a = 8 \implies a = 0.5$.

But $f(1)$ cannot be a fraction, so we must have made a mistake in our calculations. Let's go back and retrace our steps.

After examining our calculations again, we realize that we assumed $f(1) = a$ and then found that $a = 0.5$. This is obviously incorrect.

Let's try a different approach. We know that $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. If we set $n = 1$, we get:
$f(f(f(1))) = 8 \cdot 1 - 7 \implies f(f(f(1))) = 1$.

This means that $f(f(f(1))) = 1$, and therefore $f(f(1)) = f(1)$ and $f(1) = 1$.

Now, we can use the second equation to find $f(2)$:
$f(2 \cdot 1) = 2f(1) + 1 \implies f(2) = 2 \cdot 1 + 1 \implies f(2) = 3$.

We can then use the first equation to find $f(3)$:
$f(f(f(3))) = 8 \cdot 3 - 7 \implies f(f(f(3))) = 17$.

Since $f(f(f(3))) = 17$, we can substitute the values of $f(3)$ and $f(2)$ into the equation:
$f(f(3)) = 8 \cdot f(1) - 7 \implies f(f(3)) = 8 \cdot 1 - 7 \implies f(f(3)) = 1$.

This means that $f(f(3)) = 1$, and therefore $f(3) = 1$.

Now, we can use the second equation to find $f(4)$:
$f(2 \cdot 2) = 2f(2) + 1 \implies f(4) = 2 \cdot 3 + 1 \implies f(4) = 7$.

We can then use the first equation to find $f(7)$:
$f(f(f(7))) = 8 \cdot 7 - 7 \implies f(f(f(7))) = 56 - 7 \implies f(f(f(7))) = 49$.

Since $f(f(f(7))) = 49$, we can substitute the values of $f(7)$ and $f(4)$ into the equation:
$f(f(7)) = 8 \cdot f(3) - 7 \implies f(f(7)) = 8 \cdot 1 - 7 \implies f(f(7)) = 1$.

This means that $f(f(7)) = 1$, and therefore $f(7) = 1$.

Now, we can use the second equation to find $f(8)$:
$f(2 \cdot 4) = 2f(4) + 1 \implies f(8) = 2 \cdot 7 + 1 \implies f(8) = 15$.

We can then use the first equation to find $f(15)$:
$f(f(f(15))) = 8 \cdot 15 - 7 \implies f(f(f(15))) = 120 - 7 \implies f(f(f(15))) = 113$.

Since $f(f(f(15))) = 113$, we can substitute the values of $f(15)$ and $f(8)$ into the equation:
$f(f(15)) = 8 \cdot f(7) - 7 \implies f(f(15)) = 8 \cdot 1 - 7 \implies f(f(15)) = 1$.

This means that $f(f(15)) = 1$, and therefore $f(15) = 1$.

Now, we can use the second equation to find $f(16)$:
$f(2 \cdot 8) = 2f(8) + 1 \implies f(16) = 2 \cdot 15 + 1 \implies f(16) = 31$.

We can then use the first equation to find $f(31)$:
$f(f(f(31))) = 8 \cdot 31 - 7 \implies f(f(f(31))) = 248 - 7 \implies f(f(f(31))) = 241$.

Since $f(f(f(31))) = 241$, we can substitute the values of $f(31)$ and $f(16)$ into the equation:
$f(f(31)) = 8 \cdot f(15) - 7 \implies f(f(31)) = 8 \cdot 1 - 7 \implies f(f(31)) = 1$.

This means that $f(f(31)) = 1$, and therefore $f(31) = 1$.

Now, we can use the second equation to find $f(32)$:
$f(2 \cdot 16) = 2f(16) + 1 \implies f(32) = 2 \cdot 31 + 1

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:


To solve this problem, we need to find the value of $f(100)$ given the two conditions $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.

First, let's try to find the value of $f(1)$ using the second condition. We have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. Since $f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = -1$, we have $f(f(1)) = 1$ because $f$ maps to natural numbers. So $f(1) = f(f(1)) = 1$.

Now, we can use the second condition to find $f(2)$: $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2*1 + 1 = 3$.

We can continue this process to find $f(3)$, $f(4)$, and so on. However, this process can be time-consuming and might not lead to a direct solution for $f(100)$.

To find $f(100)$, we can use the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. We can start by calculating $f(f(f(100)))$:

$$f(f(f(100))) = 8*100 - 7 = 793.$$

Now, we need to find a value of $n$ such that $f(n) = 100$. We can use the second condition $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to find such an $n$. We start with $n = 1$ and keep doubling $n$ until we find a value of $n$ such that $f(n) = 100$.

After some trial and error, we find that $f(50) = 100$. So, we have $f(f(f(50))) = 793$. But from the first condition, we have $f(f(f(50))) = 8*50 - 7 = 393$. This is a contradiction.

However, we made a mistake in our calculations. Let's correct it:

$$f(f(f(100))) = 8*100 - 7 = 793.$$

Now, we need to find a value of $n$ such that $f(n) = 793$. Again, we can use the second condition $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to find such an $n$. We start with $n = 1$ and keep doubling $n$ until we find a value of $n$ such that $f(n) = 793$.

After some trial and error, we find that $f(793) = 100$. So, we have $f(f(f(793))) = 8*793 - 7 = 6347$. But from the first condition, we have $f(f(f(793))) = f(100) = 6347$. This is consistent.

So, we have found that $f(793) = 100$. Now, we can use the second condition to find $f(50)$:

$$f(50) = \frac{f(100) - 1}{2} = \frac{100 - 1}{2} = 49.5.$$

But $f(50)$ should be an integer, so this result is not possible. Let's retrace our steps and look for a mistake.

We made a mistake when we used the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. This condition should be applied when $n = 793$. But we used it for $n = 100$, which is not correct.

Let's correct this:

$$f(f(f(793))) = 8*793 - 7 = 6347.$$

But from the first condition, we have $f(f(f(793))) = f(100) = 6347$. This is consistent.

So, we have found that $f(793) = 100$. Now, we can use the second condition to find $f(50)$:

$$f(50) = 2f(25) + 1.$$

But we cannot continue this process further because we do not know the value of $f(25)$. We need another condition to find the value of $f(25)$.

However, we can use the first condition to find $f(25)$:

$$f(f(f(25))) = 8*25 - 7 = 193.$$

Now, we need to find a value of $n$ such that $f(n) = 25$. Again, we can use the second condition $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to find such an $n$. We start with $n = 1$ and keep doubling $n$ until we find a value of $n$ such that $f(n) = 25$.

After some trial and error, we find that $f(25) = 25$. So, we have $f(f(f(25))) = f(25) = 193$. But from the first condition, we have $f(f(f(25))) = 193$. This is consistent.

So, we have found that $f(25) = 25$. Now, we can use the second condition to find $f(50)$:

$$f(50) = 2f(25) + 1 = 2*25 + 1 = 51.$$

And then we can use the second condition to find $f(100)$:

$$f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2*51 + 1 = 103.$$

So, the value of $f(100)$ is 103.

 The given function $f$ satisfies two conditions: $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. To find $f(100)$, we can use these conditions iteratively.

First, we can use the second condition to find $f(200)$: $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$. Then, we can use this result in the first condition to find $f(f(200))$: $f(f(200)) = 8(100) - 7 = 793$.

Now, we have $f(f(200)) = 793$, and we know that $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$. So, we can substitute $f(200)$ into the first condition: $f(793) = f(f(200)) = 793$.

We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, so we can set $n=100$ and find $f(f(100))$: $f(f(100)) = 8(100) - 7 = 793$.

Finally, we can substitute $f(f(100)) = 793$ into the second condition to find $f(100)$: $f(100) = \frac{f(200) - 1}{2}$.

Substitute $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$ into this equation: $f(100) = \frac{2f(100) + 1 - 1}{2}$, which simplifies to $f(100) = f(100)$.

So, we have found the value of $f(100)$ using the given conditions.

This problem is a bit tricky and requires some recursive thinking. First, we need to understand the two conditions given:

1. $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$
2. $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$

From the second condition, we can infer that $f(1) = 1$ because $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$ and if $f(1) \neq 1$, then $f(2)$ would not be an integer, which contradicts the first condition.

Now, let's try to find $f(2)$:

$f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2*1 + 1 = 3$.

Using the first condition, we can find $f(3)$:

$f(f(f(1))) = f(f(3)) = f(3) = 8*1 - 7 = 1$.

But we already know that $f(1) = 1$, so $f(3) = 1$.

Now, let's find $f(4)$:

$f(2*2) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2*3 + 1 = 7$.

And using the first condition:

$f(f(f(2))) = f(f(7)) = f(7) = 8*2 - 7 = 9$.

But we know that $f(7) = 9$ from the first condition applied to $n = 2$. So, $f(7) = 9$.

From this, we can see that $f(4) = 7$.

Continuing this process, we can find $f(5) = 3$, $f(6) = 5$, $f(8) = 15$, $f(10) = 29$, and so on. By observing the pattern, we can see that $f(n) = 2n - 1$ for all positive integers $n$.

So, $f(100) = 2*100 - 1 = 199$.

Therefore, the value of $f(100)$ is 199.
The answer is: $199$
