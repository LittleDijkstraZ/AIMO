Approach:


The equation given in the problem, $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$, implies that either of the two factors must be zero to make the whole expression zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. Each of these conditions corresponds to a set of points, and the intersection of these sets of points is the boundary of the polygon we are looking for.

1) For $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$, resulting in a square with side length 20.

2) For $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, resulting in a square with side length 16.

The smaller square is entirely contained within the larger square, so the area of the convex polygon is equal to the area of the larger square minus the area of the smaller square.

The area of a square with side length $s$ is $s^2$, so the area of the larger square (side length 20) is $20^2 = 400$ and the area of the smaller square (side length 16) is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $400 - 256 = 144$.
The answer is: $144$.

Approach:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So the given equation is equivalent to the following two conditions:
(i) $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$ or
(ii) $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
For (i) to be true, both $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ which implies $x = 0$ and $y = 0$.
For (ii) to be true, both $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ which implies $-8 \le x \le 8$ and $-8 \le y \le 8$.
So, the region enclosed by the polygon is a square with side length $16$ and its area is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is $256$.

The answer is: $256$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

The given expression is a product of two expressions, and it equals to zero if and only if at least one of the expressions is zero. Therefore, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first expression to be zero, both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which gives $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two intersecting lines, forming a square with side length 10 units. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

For the second expression to be zero, both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which gives $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two intersecting lines, forming a square with side length 16 units. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

We are asked to find the area of the convex polygon that is the intersection of the two squares. The intersection of the two squares is also a square, but its side length is the minimum of the side lengths of the two squares, which is 10 units. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $10^2 = 100$.

The solution is 100. The answer is: $100$.

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:

 The equation is equal to zero, which means the product of two expressions is zero. Thus, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. 

The first equation implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. 
This leads to a square with side length $20$ centered at the origin.

The second equation implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. 
This leads to a square with side length $16$ centered at the origin.

To find the area of the convex polygon, we take the intersection of the two squares. This intersection forms a smaller square with side length $20 - 16 = 4$ and area $4^2 = 16$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $16$.
The answer is: $16$

Assistant:

Approach:

 First, let's observe that the equation implies that both of the terms must be 0. So we have the following two systems of equations:

1) $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10 \Rightarrow x + y = \pm 10$ 

and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x - y \vert = 10 \Rightarrow x - y = \pm 10$

And, 

2) $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8 \Rightarrow x = \pm 8$ 

and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert y \vert = 8 \Rightarrow y = \pm 8$

From 1) we get the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. From 2) we get the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$ as well as the lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length 10. Therefore, the area of the square is $10^2 = \boxed{100}$. The answer is: $\boxed{100}$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

Approach:

 
For the product of two real numbers to be zero, one or both of the numbers must be zero. Therefore, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The first equation is satisfied if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only way this can happen is if both $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$ are satisfied simultaneously, which means $x = 0$ and $y = 0$. This forms a single point at the origin.
The second equation is satisfied if and only if $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$, which forms a square with side length 8.
The equation we are solving encloses a square of side length 8, which has an area of $8^2 = 64$ square units.The answer is: $64$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:


The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is equal to zero if any of its factors is equal to zero. This means either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which imply that $x = y = \pm 10$ or $x = -y = \pm 10$.

Similarly, if $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which imply that $x = y = \pm 8$.

Therefore, the four points $(\pm 10, 0)$ and $(0, \pm 10)$ and the four points $(\pm 8, 0)$ and $(0, \pm 8)$ are on the boundary of the convex polygon.

The polygon is a rectangle with side lengths $20$ and $16$, so its area is $20 \times 16 = 320$.
The answer is: 320

Approach:

 This problem involves understanding the absolute value function and recognizing that the given equation encloses a convex polygon. A careful look at the equation, however, can reveal that the only way the equation can be satisfied is when all the absolute value expressions are equal to zero. In other words, we have the following system of equations to solve:

1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$
2. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$
3. $\vert x \vert = 8$
4. $\vert y \vert = 8$

Solving this system of equations is straightforward. Using the fact that $\vert a \vert = b$ means $a = b$ or $a = -b$, we get the following system of equations from (1) and (2):

1'. $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$
2'. $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$

Solving these systems, we find that the system of equations can be further divided into four different cases. For (3) and (4), we have the same situation:

3'. $x = 8$ or $x = -8$
4'. $y = 8$ or $y = -8$

By combining these results, we can find the vertices of the polygon. There are 8 vertices in total: $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, $(-8,-8)$, $(0,10)$, $(0,-10)$, $(10,0)$, $(-10,0)$. The polygon is a square with side length 16. Therefore, its area is $16^2 = 256$. 

The Answer: The area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

Approach:


The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ gives us $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means $x + y = \pm10$ and $x - y = \pm10$. By solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the square. 
Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ gives us $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm8$ and $y = \pm8$. This also gives us the vertices of the square. 
To find the intersection of these two squares, we can plot them on the coordinate plane and find their intersection.

Here's a Python code to calculate the area:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_square(side_length):
    return side_length ** 2

# The side length of the square is the maximum of the absolute values of the coordinates
side_length = max(8, 10)
area = area_of_square(side_length)
print(area)
```

CODE RESULTS 100

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
100
```
The area of the convex polygon is 100 square units. The answer is $\boxed{100}$.
