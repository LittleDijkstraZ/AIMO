Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation given is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

The first term is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$ and the second term is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$.

For the first term to be zero, both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)$ must be zero. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only way this can happen is if $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$.

For the second term to be zero, both $(\vert x \vert - 8)$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)$ must be zero. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The only way this can happen is if $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

So the points that satisfy the equation are the points where $x = \pm 10$ or $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 10$ or $y = \pm 8$. These points form a square with side length 20, so the area of the square is $20^2 = 400$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 400. The answer is: $400$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is given as:
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0\]

This equation is equal to zero if either of the two factors is zero. Therefore, we have two sets of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first set of equations:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which gives us two lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us four lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersection of these lines form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

For the second set of equations:
1. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which gives us two lines $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us four lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersection of these lines form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is also $10^2 = 100$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon formed by the points satisfying the given equation is $100$. Since 100 is a positive integer, the answer is $\boxed{100}$.
The answer is: $100$

The equation is given as:
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0\]

This equation is equal to zero if either of the two factors is zero. Therefore, we have two sets of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first set of equations, we have:

1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$
2. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$

For the second set of equations, we have:

1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$
2. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$

In all cases, $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ imply that $-8 \leq x, y \leq 8$. The other conditions give us the following vertices of the polygon:

1. $(x, y) = (8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, $(-8, 0)$, $(0, -8)$, $(8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, $(-8, 0)$, $(0, -8)$
2. $(x, y) = (0, 8)$, $(8, 0)$, $(0, -8)$, $(-8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, $(8, 0)$, $(0, -8)$, $(-8, 0)$

These vertices form a square with side length 16. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

The equation is $0$ if either of the two factors is $0$. So we have two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10 \Rightarrow x + y = \pm 10$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8 \Rightarrow x = \pm 8$.
3. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert y \vert = 8 \Rightarrow y = \pm 8$.

The four lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x = 8$, and $x = -8$ together with the four lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$ form a square with side length $20$. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.

So the area of the convex polygon is $400$. The answer is: $400$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. This gives us two systems of equations to solve:

1. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$
2. $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$

For the first system, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon.

For the second system, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon.

Now, we can plot these points and find the vertices of the polygon. The polygon is a square with side length 16. To find the area, we simply square the side length: $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

This equation is equal to zero if either of the two factors is zero. Therefore, we have two sets of equations to solve:

2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first set of equations:

1. From $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. This implies $x + y = \pm 10$.
2. From $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

For the second set of equations:

1. From $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies $x - y = \pm 10$.
2. From $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

The solutions to the first set of equations are the points $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$. The solutions to the second set of equations are the points $(2, 8)$, $(2, -8)$, $(-2, 8)$, and $(-2, -8)$.

The convex polygon formed by these points is a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

The equation is given as:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$

This equation equals zero if either of the two factors equals zero. So we have two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 \neq 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 \neq 0$

For the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$. For the second case, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.

These equations define a square with side length 10. The vertices of the square are $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$. The area of the square is $10^2 = 100$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation given is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

This equation is equal to zero if and only if either of the two factors is equal to zero. This gives us two sets of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From the first set of equations, we get $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$, $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $-8 \leq x, y \leq 8$.

From the second set of equations, we get $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$, $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $-8 \leq x, y \leq 8$.

So, the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equation are those that lie in the square with vertices at $(-8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(8, 8)$, and $(8, -8)$. The area of this square is $16 \times 16 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

The answer is: $256$
