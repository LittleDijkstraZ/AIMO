 To solve this problem, we need to analyze the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] and determine for how many positive integers $m$ it has 4 distinct solutions.

The expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, will take on a value of 0 when $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$, which happens when $x = 3$ or $x = -1$. So the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be broken down into two separate equations: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ for $x \geq 1$ and $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$ for $x < 1$.

For $x \geq 1$, we have $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. The expression inside the absolute value will be equal to $2 + \frac{m}{100}$ when $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, or $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$, and it will be equal to $-(2 + \frac{m}{100})$ when $x-1 = -(2 + \frac{m}{100})$, or $x = -1 + \frac{2m}{100}$. The equation has two solutions for $x$ when the two values of $x$ are distinct, which happens when $-1 + \frac{2m}{100} > 3 + \frac{m}{100}$. This simplifies to $m > 400$, so the values of $m$ that satisfy this condition are the positive integers greater than 400.

For $x < 1$, we have $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. The expression inside the absolute value will be equal to $2 - \frac{m}{100}$ when $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, or $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, and it will be equal to $-(2 - \frac{m}{100})$ when $x-1 = -(2 - \frac{m}{100})$, or $x = -1 + \frac{2m}{100}$. The equation has two solutions for $x$ when the two values of $x$ are distinct, which happens when $-1 + \frac{2m}{100} < 3 - \frac{m}{100}$. This simplifies to $m < 200$, so the values of $m$ that satisfy this condition are the positive integers less than 200.

Putting these two conditions together, we find that the only positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions are the integers from 200 to 400 inclusive. The number of such integers is 201.
The answer is: $201$.

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. Therefore, $m = 200$. So the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition is $1$. The answer is: $1$

 The function $| |x-1|-2|$ has a graph which is a "V" shape, with its lowest point at $x=1$. The graph goes down from this point to $y=2- \frac{1}{2}=1.5$, then up to $y=2+ \frac{1}{2}=2.5$. The graph of $| |x-1|-2|$ consists of two lines with slopes $\pm 1$, and "V" vertices at $x=1 \pm 2 = 3, -1$. Thus the equation $| |x-1|-2|= \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ falls in the interval from $1.5$ to $2.5$. Thus we need $\frac{m}{100}$ to equal $1.5, 2, 2.5$. Solving these gives $m = 150, 200, 250$. Thus there are three such positive integers $m$. Therefore the number of such $m$ is 3. The answer is: $3$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"

Assistant:


We are looking for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. 

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is a variation of the classic "number of roots" problem. The number of roots will depend on the value of $m$. For example, if $m=1$, there are two roots; if $m=2$, there are four roots. 

Therefore, we need to find the value of $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct roots.

In this problem, we are only looking for positive integer solutions for $m$. So we only need to check the positive integers from $1$ to a certain number. 

After analyzing the problem, we find that $m=2$ is the only value that gives $4$ distinct solutions. 

So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $1$.

Therefore, the answer is $1$. The program doesn't add any additional value in this case.
The answer is: $1$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 We start by observing the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. The right side $\frac{m}{100}$ is a positive value, so the left side must be positive as well. This means $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert > 0$. 

We also know that $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ can be either $0$, $1$, or $3$ (since it's a double absolute value, it can be at most $3$). 

Therefore, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be $1$ or $3$. This gives us two possible values for $m$: $100$ and $300$. 

We can check both cases:

For $m=100$, the equation becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=1$. This has four distinct solutions: $x=0, 3, 5, 7$.

For $m=300$, the equation becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=3$. This has no solutions, because $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ cannot be greater than $3$.

So, the only value of $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is $m=100$. Therefore, the answer is $1$. The final numerical answer is $\boxed{1}$.
