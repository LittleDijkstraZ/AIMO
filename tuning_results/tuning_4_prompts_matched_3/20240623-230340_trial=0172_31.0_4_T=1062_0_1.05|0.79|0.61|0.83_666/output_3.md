Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if at least one of the factors is equal to zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. Each of these equations implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The equations $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ describe a square with side length 10, centered at the origin. The equations $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ describe a square with side length 16, centered at the origin. The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for.
The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side, so the area of the square described by $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ is $10^2 = 100$, and the area of the square described by $\vert x \vert = 8$ is $8^2 = 64$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the difference of these two areas, or $100 - 64 = 36$.
The answer is: $36$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The equation $AB=0$ is equivalent to $A=0$ or $B=0$. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to the union of the following two sets of points:
1. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, or
2. $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.
For the first set of points, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the points $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, and $(-5,-5)$.
For the second set of points, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations, we get the points $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.
Plotting these points on a coordinate plane, we see that they form a square with side length $10$. Therefore, the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$.
So, the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The equation is satisfied only when both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, and also both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This means that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The solutions to these equations are:
- For $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, we have $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
- For $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, we have $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
- For $\vert x \vert = 8$, we have $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
- For $\vert y \vert = 8$, we have $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

By considering all possible combinations of these equations, we find that the points satisfying the equation are:
- $(8, 2)$, $(8, -10)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, -10)$, $(2, 8)$, $(-10, 8)$, $(2, -8)$, and $(-10, -8)$.

These points form a square with side length $16$. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So the area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$

This problem is quite complex and requires a deep understanding of absolute value and the properties of square roots. However, it is also obvious that the area of the polygon is 0, because the polygon consists only of the point (8,8), because all other terms must be equal to zero for the equation to hold true. Therefore, the area of the polygon is 0.

Assistant:


The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, which means either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, and this equals zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us a square with side length 10, centered at the origin.

The second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$, and this equals zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us a square with side length 16, centered at the origin.

The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for. The side length of this square is the minimum of the side lengths of the two squares, which is 10. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $10^2 = 100$.

The answer is: $100$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is equal to zero if and only if both of its factors are equal to zero. This means that we have two separate cases to consider:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
For case 1, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$, $x = \pm 8$, and $y = \pm 8$. The possible combinations of these values give us the vertices of a square with side length 10.
For case 2, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x - y = \pm 10$, $x = \pm 8$, and $y = \pm 8$. The possible combinations of these values also give us the vertices of a square with side length 10.
The total area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of these two squares, which is $2 \times 10^2 = 200$. The answer is: $200$

The given equation is equal to zero if and only if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or both $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This means that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The solutions to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ are the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.
The solutions to $\vert x \vert = 8$ are the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.
The solutions to $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ are the lines $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.
The solutions to $\vert y \vert = 8$ are the lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.
The intersection of these lines form a square with side length 16.
The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
So, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

 The equation given in the problem is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. This expression equals to zero only when both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$.

The second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. This expression equals to zero only when both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$.

The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 10 (the distance from the origin to the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$), so the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100.

So, the solution to the problem is:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    side_length = 10
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 100

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
100
```
The area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is $\boxed{100}$.
