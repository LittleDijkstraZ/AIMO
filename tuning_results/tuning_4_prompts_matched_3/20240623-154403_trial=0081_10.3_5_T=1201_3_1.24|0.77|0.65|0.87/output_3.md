Approach:


The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.

Let's consider each case:

1. If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.

2. If $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.

3. If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.

4. If $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

By solving these equations, we find that the vertices of the polygon are:
$(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(2, 8)$, $(-2, 8)$, $(2, -8)$, and $(-2, -8)$.

To find the area of the polygon, we can use the Shoelace formula. The Shoelace formula is a method to find the area of a polygon given the coordinates of its vertices. For a polygon with vertices $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), \dots, (x_n, y_n)$, the area is given by:

$$\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| (x_1y_2 + x_2y_3 + \dots + x_ny_1) - (y_1x_2 + y_2x_3 + \dots + y_nx_1) \right|.$$

Applying the Shoelace formula to the vertices $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(2, 8)$, $(-2, 8)$, $(2, -8)$, and $(-2, -8)$, we find that the area of the polygon is $256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:



The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

For this equation to be true, either the first term in the product is zero, or the second term is zero.

If the first term is zero, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square formed by the points $(x, y)$.

Similarly, if the second term is zero, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square formed by the points $(x, y)$.

So the total region enclosed by the equation is the union of two squares. The first square has side length 20 (since the difference between the maximum and minimum values of $x+y$ or $x-y$ is 20), and its area is $20^2 = 400$. The second square has side length 16 (since the difference between the maximum and minimum values of $x$ or $y$ is 16), and its area is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the total area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares, which is $400 + 256 = 656$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 656. The answer is: $656$

Assistant:

Approach:


The equation given in the problem is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so we can set each expression equal to zero and solve for the corresponding conditions.

Step 1: Set the first expression to zero: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which simplifies to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These two equations represent two lines, and the points that satisfy them form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

Step 2: Set the second expression to zero: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which simplifies to $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These two equations represent two circles, and the points that satisfy them form a square with side length 16 (the diameter of the circles). The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

However, the points that satisfy both expressions simultaneously form the intersection of the two regions described above. This intersection is the square with side length 10, which is completely contained within the larger square with side length 16. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of the smaller square, which is 100.
The answer is: $100$

Approach:

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. Therefore, either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. We can solve each expression separately and find the intersection points. Then, we can use the Shoelace formula to find the area of the polygon.

First, let's solve the equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This gives us $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.

Similarly, for $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.

For $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$, which implies $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.

And for $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

By solving these equations, we find the intersection points of the lines forming the polygon: $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

Now, we can use the Shoelace formula to find the area of the polygon. The Shoelace formula states that if the vertices of a polygon are given by $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), \dots, (x_n, y_n)$, then the area of the polygon is given by:

$$\frac{1}{2} \vert (x_1y_2 + x_2y_3 + \dots + x_ny_1) - (y_1x_2 + y_2x_3 + \dots + y_nx_1) \vert$$

Applying the Shoelace formula to the points $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$, we get:

$$\frac{1}{2} \vert (8*(-8) + 8*8 + (-8)*8 + (-8)*(-8)) - (8*8 + (-8)*(-8) + 8*8 + (-8)*(-8)) \vert = 0$$

However, this result indicates that the four points are collinear, and the area of the polygon formed by these points is zero.

This seems incorrect, as the problem statement mentions that the points enclose a convex polygon. We must have made a mistake in our calculations. Let's go back and retrace our steps.

Upon reexamination, we realize that our interpretation of the given equation was incorrect. The equation should be interpreted as a product of two expressions equal to zero, not each expression separately. This means that we should consider the system of equations:

$$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$$

and

$$(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0.$$

Solving this system of equations, we find that the only solution is $(x, y) = (8, 8)$.

However, this does not correspond to a polygon. We must have made another mistake. Let's reconsider the given equation again.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:


The equation $AB = 0$ implies that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to the union of the following two sets of points:
1. Points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, and
2. Points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The first set of points is satisfied when $|x+y| = 10$ and $|x-y| = 10$. This implies that either $x+y = 10$ or $x+y = -10$, and either $x-y = 10$ or $x-y = -10$. Solving these four systems of equations, we find that the first set of points encloses a square with side length $20$ and area $400$.
The second set of points is satisfied when $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. This implies that either $x = 8$ or $x = -8$, and either $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. Solving these four systems of equations, we find that the second set of points encloses a square with side length $16$ and area $256$.
Therefore, the total area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of these two squares, which is $400 + 256 = 656$. The answer is: $656$

Assistant:

Approach:

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so it equals zero if either of the expressions equals zero. This means that the points satisfying the equation are the union of the points satisfying each of the expressions equal to zero.

Let's consider each expression separately:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$: This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. This is the equation of a square with side length 20 and vertices at $( \pm 10, 0)$ and $(0, \pm 10)$.

2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$: This implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This is also the equation of a square with side length 20 and vertices at $(0, \pm 10)$ and $(\pm 10, 0)$.

3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$: This implies $\vert x \vert = 8$, which gives us two vertical lines at $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.

4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$: This implies $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us two horizontal lines at $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$

Approach:


The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ is only possible when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0)$.

The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ is only possible when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So, the vertices of the polygon are $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$.

The polygon formed by the vertices $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0), (8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$ is a square with side length 10. The area of a square is given by the square of the side length. Therefore, the area of the polygon is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $\boxed{100}$

Approach:

 The given equation implies that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.

If $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.

If $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

The solutions to these equations form a square with vertices at $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$. The side length of this square is 16, so its area is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256.
The answer is: $256$

Approach:


The equation given is a product of two terms equal to zero, which means either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

Let's consider the two cases:

1) $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ which implies $|x + y| = 10$. This gives us two equations $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.

2) $|x - y| - 10 = 0$ which implies $|x - y| = 10$. This gives us two equations $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.

3) $|x| - 8 = 0$ which implies $|x| = 8$. This gives us two equations $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.

4) $|y| - 8 = 0$ which implies $|y| = 8$. This gives us two equations $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

Solving these equations, we find that the vertices of the polygon are:
$(8,8), (8,-8), (-8,8),$ and $(-8,-8)$. These vertices form a square with side length 16.

The area of a square is given by side length squared, so the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256.
The answer is: $256$
