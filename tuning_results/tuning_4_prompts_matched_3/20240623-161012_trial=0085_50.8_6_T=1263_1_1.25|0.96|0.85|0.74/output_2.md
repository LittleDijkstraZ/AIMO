Interesting, let's analyze step by step:


Firstly, the equation given is $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. It has 4 distinct solutions.
We need to determine the value of $m$, a positive integer.
By visualizing the left hand side of the equation, it can be seen that $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ can take values only in the range $[0,3]$. This is because the modulus function ensures that $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is always nonnegative, and the largest it can be is when $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$, which equals 3. So, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be in the range $[0,3]$.
This gives us: $0 \leq \frac{m}{100} \leq 3$, so $0 \leq m \leq 300$.
In other words, $m$ can be any integer between $0$ and $300$.
Now, for the equation to have four distinct solutions, it means that the right hand side $\frac{m}{100}$ must be able to jump between integer values only once. In the case of absolute value functions, the function equals an integer for specific values of $x$. Therefore, if the right hand side makes large jumps, the left hand side will not be able to follow these jumps. The right hand side should make small jumps.
In other words, $\frac{m}{100}$ should be able to jump by at most 1 unit. This is only possible when $m=100$.
Therefore, the only value of $m$ that makes the equation have four distinct solutions is $m = 100$. Is this a positive integer? Yes, it is.

So, for $m = 100$, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions. The answer is: $1$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Step 1: List the variables and known values from the problem.

The unknown variable in the problem is $m$. We want to find how many positive integer values of $m$ make the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have $4$ distinct solutions. 

Step 2: Outline the steps using sympy to solve the problem.

We need to solve the following steps:
1. Rewrite the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ into simpler form.
2. Analyze the number of solutions for different values of $m$.
3. Count how many positive integer values of $m$ result in $4$ distinct solutions.

Step 3: Implement these functions step-by-step, commenting each line for clarity.

_Step 1: Rewrite the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ into simpler form._

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is already in a simple form. We just need to find the number of solutions for different values of $m$.

_Step 2: Analyze the number of solutions for different values of $m$._

It's known that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100} = 1$. Therefore, we have $m = 100$.

_Step 3: Count how many positive integer values of $m$ result in $4$ distinct solutions._

For the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ to have $4$ distinct solutions, the only value of $m$ is $100$. Since $100$ is a positive integer, there is only one positive integer value of $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions.

Step 4: Calculate the final answer and verify it's a positive integer.

The final answer is $1$ which is a positive integer.

Step 5: Output the result within $\boxed{1}$.

The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $1$. So, the answer is $1$. The correct number is $\boxed{1}$. Answer: 1. The number of positive integers m for which the equation $||x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 1.
The answer is $\boxed{1}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:


We have the equation $|\vert x-1 \vert - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$.
This equation has 4 distinct solutions,
This happens when $\frac{m}{100} = 1, 2$.

To solve this, we can set $\frac{m}{100}$ equal to each of the values $1$ and $2$
and see how many solutions each equation gives us.

Setting $\frac{m}{100} = 1$, we get $|\vert x-1 \vert - 2| = 1$.
This simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert - 2 = 1 \text{ or } \vert x-1 \vert - 2 = -1$.
For each of these absolute value equations, we get two separate equations to solve:
$\vert x-1 \vert = 3$ or $\vert x-1 \vert = 1$.
For $\vert x-1 \vert = 3$, we get two solutions: $x=4$ and $x=-2$.
For $\vert x-1 \vert = 1$, we get two more solutions: $x=2$ and $x=0$.
So with $\frac{m}{100} = 1$, we have 4 distinct solutions: $0, 1, 2, 4$.

Setting $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, we get $|\vert x-1 \vert - 2| = 2$.
This simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert - 2 = 2 \text{ or } \vert x-1 \vert - 2 = -2$.
For each of these absolute value equations, we get two separate equations to solve:
$\vert x-1 \vert = 4$ or $\vert x-1 \vert = 0$.
For $\vert x-1 \vert = 4$, we get two solutions: $x=5$ and $x=-3$.
For $\vert x-1 \vert = 0$, we get only one solution: $x=1$.
So with $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, we have 3 distinct solutions: $1, 3, 5$.

Therefore, there is one possible value for $m$, namely $m=200$. Indeed, $200$ divided by $100$ gives $2$ which is the value that results in the desired 4 distinct solutions.

The answer is: $1$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $||x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.
We can start by considering how many times the right side equals the right side. 
If $||x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$, then we can start by solving the absolute value equations separately.
First, we have $|x-1|-2=\pm \frac{m}{100}$. 
Let's solve each case separately.

Case 1: $|x-1|-2= \frac{m}{100}$

First, we can add 2 to both sides to get $|x-1|=2 + \frac{m}{100}$. 

Now, we can split the absolute value equation into two cases again:

Case 1a: $x-1=2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which gives us $x=3 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Case 1b: $x-1=-2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which gives us $x=-1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Case 2: $|x-1|-2= - \frac{m}{100}$

First, we can add 2 to both sides to get $|x-1|=2 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Now, we can split the absolute value equation into two cases again:

Case 2a: $x-1=2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which gives us $x=3 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Case 2b: $x-1=-2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which gives us $x=-1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

To have four distinct solutions, we need three of the four solutions to be distinct. 
For example, the solutions from case 1a, 1b, 2a, and 2b should be distinct.
The solutions from case 1a and 2a are $3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $3 - \frac{m}{100}$, which are not distinct.
The solutions from case 1b and 2b are $-1 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $-1 + \frac{m}{100}$, which are not distinct either.

So, we need to look for a value of $m$ such that the solutions from cases 1a and 2b are distinct and the solutions from cases 1b and 2a are distinct.
This occurs when $2 - \frac{m}{100} > 0$, or $m < 200$.
The only positive integer solution in this range is $m=100$.

Therefore, there is only one value of $m$ that satisfies the condition, and that value is $m=100$. The answer is: $1$
