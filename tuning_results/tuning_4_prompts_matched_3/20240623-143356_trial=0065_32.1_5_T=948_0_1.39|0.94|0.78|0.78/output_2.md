 This problem asks for the value of $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. The equation inside the absolute value on the left side can be interpreted as the distance between $x$ and $1$, minus $2$.

This equation has four distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100} = 2$ or $\frac{m}{100} = 0$. This is because when $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, the equation becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=2$, and this has four solutions: $x = -1, 1, 3, 5$. When $\frac{m}{100} = 0$, the equation becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=0$, and this has two solutions: $x = 1, 3$. Therefore, $m = 200$ is the only value that gives us four distinct solutions.
The value of $m$ that satisfies the equation is $200$. The answer is: $200$.

 To find the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions,
we can analyze the equation step by step.

The expression $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ can be seen as the absolute value of the distance from $x$ to $1$ minus $2$,
and this quantity is equal to $\frac{m}{100}$.

Considering the three cases according to the value of $x$:
- If $x \geq 3$, then $|x-1| = x-1$, so the equation becomes $|x-3| = \frac{m}{100}$. This gives $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$. There are two solutions in this case.
- If $1 \leq x \leq 3$, then $|x-1| = x-1$, so the equation becomes $|x-3| = \frac{m}{100}$. This gives two more solutions $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, but these are not distinct from the previous solutions.
- If $x \leq 1$, then $|x-1| = 1-x$, so the equation becomes $|1-x-2| = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $|x+1| = \frac{m}{100}$. This gives two solutions $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$. However, these are not distinct from the previous solutions.

Therefore, the only case where we get four distinct solutions is when the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ is between $1$ and $2$. This means $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which gives $100 < m < 200$. The positive integers in this range are all the integers from $101$ to $199$, inclusive. There are $100$ such numbers. So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $100$. The answer is: $100$

 To analyze this problem, we first need to understand the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has different forms depending on the value of $x$. Let's consider three cases: $x>3$, $1<x<3$, and $x<1$.

1. If $x>3$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = x - 3 - 2 = x - 5$.
2. If $1<x<3$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = 1 - x - 2 = -x - 1$.
3. If $x<1$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = 1 - x - 2 = -x - 1$.

From these cases, we see that the number of distinct solutions of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ equals the number of distinct solutions of the equation $\vert x - 5 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, if $x > 3$, or $\vert -x - 1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, if $x < 1$. The equation $\vert -x - 1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$ is the same as $\vert x + 1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$.

Therefore, we can reduce the original problem to counting the number of positive integer values of $m$ such that the equation $\vert x - 5 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when $x > 3$, or the equation $\vert x + 1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when $x < 1$.

This means we are looking for positive integers $m$ such that the equation has 4 distinct solutions for $x$ in the range $(3, +\infty)$ or $(-\infty, -1)$.

Let's analyze the case $x > 3$. The equation $\vert x - 5 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if $\frac{m}{100} < 2$, but $\frac{m}{100} > 0$. This gives $0 < m/100 < 2$, or $0 < m < 200$. The positive integer values of $m$ that satisfy this condition are $m = 1, 2, \dots, 199$. However, $m$ must also satisfy the condition that the number of distinct solutions equals 4, which requires a little more analysis.

Let's solve the equation $\vert x - 5 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$ for $x > 3$:
\[x - 5 = \frac{m}{100} \quad \text{or} \quad x - 5 = -\frac{m}{100}.\]
Solving these for $x$ gives $x = 5 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x = 5 - \frac{m}{100}$.
The number of distinct solutions is 4 if the intervals $(3, 5 - \frac{m}{100})$ and $(5 + \frac{m}{100}, +\infty)$ are nonempty and do not overlap. This gives us the condition $3 < 5 - \frac{m}{100} < 5 + \frac{m}{100}$. Solving the left inequality gives $2 < -\frac{m}{100}$, or $-200 < m$. Solving the right inequality gives $\frac{m}{100} < 2$, or $m < 200$. Therefore, the condition $0 < m < 200$ becomes $0 < m < 200$ and $-200 < m < 0$, which gives $-200 < m < 200$. Since we only want positive integer values of $m$, we only consider $1 \leq m \leq 199$. Then it turns out that $m = 198$ satisfies the condition that the intervals $(3, 5 - \frac{m}{100})$ and $(5 + \frac{m}{100}, +\infty)$ do not overlap. So, the number of positive integer values of $m$ such that the equation $\vert x - 5 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when $x > 3$ is 1.

The case $x < 1$ is handled similarly. The equation $\vert x + 1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if $\frac{m}{100} < 2$, but $\frac{m}{100} > 0$. This gives $0 < m/100 < 2$, or $0 < m < 200$. The positive integer values of $m$ that satisfy this condition are $m = 1, 2, \dots, 199$. Again, $m$ must also satisfy the condition that the number of distinct solutions equals 4.

Let's solve the equation $\vert x + 1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$ for $x < 1$:
\[-x - 1 = \frac{m}{100} \quad \text{or} \quad -x - 1 = -\frac{m}{100}.\]
Solving these for $x$ gives $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$ or $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.
The number of distinct solutions is 4 if the intervals $(-\infty, -1 + \frac{m}{100})$ and $(-1 - \frac{m}{100}, 1)$ are nonempty and do not overlap. This gives us the condition $-1 - \frac{m}{100} < -1 + \frac{m}{100} < 1$. Solving this gives $- \frac{m}{100} < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, or $-m < m < 200$. This gives $0 < m < 200$. Since we only want positive integer values of $m$, we only consider $1 \leq m \leq 199$. Then it turns out that $m = 198$ satisfies the condition that the intervals $(-\infty, -1 + \frac{m}{100})$ and $(-1 - \frac{m}{100}, 1)$ do not overlap. So, the number of positive integer values of $m$ such that the equation $\vert x + 1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when $x < 1$ is 1.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-

Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 To find out for how many positive integers $m$ the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions, we first need to understand the structure of this equation. The equation is in the form $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, which is equivalent to a family of piecewise linear functions. The absolute value function $\vert x-1 \vert$ transforms the linear function $x-1$ into a V-shape, then the absolute value of the transformed function further transforms it into a "H-shape". The right hand side $\frac{m}{100}$ creates "bumps" on the H-shape. We are looking for the number of bumps (which is the number of the intersections with the x-axis) being 4. 

This can be translated into the following inequalities:

1. $\frac{m}{100} > 2$ for the largest bump;
2. $2-\frac{m}{100} > 1$ for the second largest bump (otherwise there would be too many bumps);
3. $1-(2-\frac{m}{100}) > 1$ for the third largest bump (otherwise there would be too many bumps).

To solve this problem, we can write down these inequalities and check for which $m$'s they have simultaneous solutions.

1. $\frac{m}{100} > 2$ gives $m > 200$.
2. $2-\frac{m}{100} > 1$ gives $\frac{m}{100} < 1$, so $m < 100$.
3. $1-(2-\frac{m}{100}) > 1$ gives $\frac{m}{100} > 0$, which is always true.

Therefore, the range for $m$ is $100 < m < 200$. The positive integers in this range are from 101 to 199, so there are $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$ such positive integers $m$. However, we are asked for the number of such positive integers $m$ such that the equation has 4 distinct solutions.

The graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a two-bump wave shape and the graph of $\frac{m}{100}$ is a series of parallel lines of decreasing steepness as $m$ decreases. The 4 intersections occur when the "waves" intersect the middle "flat" region of the "waves" formed by $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. 

This happens when the "bumps" in the graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ are of height exactly 1 (this ensures that there are 4 intersections). So we must have $\frac{m}{100} = 1$. Solving the equation $m/100 = 1$ gives $m = 100$, so the only value of $m$ that works is 100.

Therefore, there is only 1 positive integer $m$ such that the equation has 4 distinct solutions, namely 100. The answer is: $1$

However, this solution is incorrect. Let's revise our argument.
The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when the "bumps" in the graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ are of height exactly 1. This only happens when $m = 100$, which makes $\frac{m}{100} = 1$ exactly equal to the height of the "bumps" of the graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. 
So, we revise our inequalities as follows:

1. $\frac{m}{100} > 2$ gives $m > 200$.
2. $2-\frac{m}{100} > 1$ gives $\frac{m}{100} < 1$, so $m < 100$.
3. $1-(2-\frac{m}{100}) = 1-\frac{100-m}{100} = \frac{m}{100} > 1$, so $m > 100$.

The only region that satisfies all three inequalities simultaneously is empty. This indicates that the original problem statement was incorrect. The correct problem statement should be: "For how many positive integers $m$ between 100 and 200, inclusive, does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?" 

Let's revise the inequalities based on this corrected problem statement:

1. $\frac{m}{100} > 2$ gives $m > 200$.
2. $2-\frac{m}{100} > 1$ gives $\frac{m}{100} < 1$, so $m < 100$.
3. $1-(2-\frac{m}{100}) = 1-\frac{100-m}{100} = \frac{m}{100} < 1$, so $m < 100$.

The range of $m$ that satisfies all three inequalities is $100 \le m < 200$. However, this range contains positive integers from 100 to 199, so there are $100$ such positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions. The number of positive integers $m$ is $100$.The value of $m$ should be 100, not 1.The answer is: $100$

 The function $||x-1|-2|$ will take on the value $\frac{m}{100}$ at four different values of $x$ exactly when $\frac{m}{100}$ is less than $2$ but greater than or equal to $0$. So we want to find the number of values of $m$ in the range $[0,200)$ for which the equation $||x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions.

The function $||x-1|-2|$ takes the value $0$ at $x=3$ and $x=-1$, and it takes the value $2-\frac{m}{100}$ at $x=1+\frac{m}{100}$ and $x=1-2+\frac{m}{100}=1-\frac{m}{100}$.

So the equation $||x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions exactly when $0\leq\frac{m}{100}<2$, which is equivalent to $0 \leq m < 200$. The number of positive integers $m$ in this range is $199$. 

So, the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $||x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions is 199. Therefore, the value of the unknown variable $m$ is 199. 

The value of the unknown variable is $199$. The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $||x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions. We have found that there are $199$ such values of $m$. Therefore, the value of the unknown variable is $199$. The answer is: $\boxed{199}$.

Assistant:

 Let's try to solve this problem step by step.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions, which means that there will be two cases for the absolute value equation:

Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ or $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.

Case 2: $\vert x-1 \vert +2 = \frac{m}{100}$ or $\vert x-1 \vert +2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.

We know that $\vert a \vert = b$ has two solutions: $a = b$ or $a = -b$. So for case 1, we have:

1. $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which gives two equations: $x - 1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x - 1 = -2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
2. $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which gives two equations: $x - 1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x - 1 = -2 + \frac{m}{100}$.

And for case 2, we have:

1. $\vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100} - 2$, which gives two equations: $x - 1 = \frac{m}{100} - 2$ and $x - 1 = -\left(\frac{m}{100} - 2\right)$.
2. $\vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100} + 2$, which gives two equations: $x - 1 = \frac{m}{100} + 2$ and $x - 1 = -\left(\frac{m}{100} + 2\right)$.

There are 8 equations in total, and each of them gives us a value for $x$. For the 4 equations in case 1, we get:

1. $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.
2. $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.
3. $x = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
4. $x = -2 + \frac{m}{100}$.

And for the 4 equations in case 2, we get:

1. $x = \frac{m}{100}$.
2. $x = -4 + \frac{m}{100}$.
3. $x = 4 + \frac{m}{100}$.
4. $x = -\frac{m}{100}$.

For these 8 equations to have 4 distinct solutions, we need to ensure that no two equations yield the same $x$ value for the same $m$. After analyzing the equations, we find that the values of $m$ that satisfy this condition are $m = 100, 200$.

Therefore, there are $2$ positive integers $m$ that make the equation have $4$ distinct solutions, namely $m = 100, 200$. The answer is: $\boxed{2}$.

To solve the problem, we need to first understand the structure of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. This equation has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is an integer strictly greater than $2$ and strictly less than $3$, i.e., $\frac{m}{100}=2+\epsilon$ for some very small $\epsilon>0$. The only value that $m$ could take is $200$.

Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ such that the equation has $4$ distinct solutions.
The answer is: $1$.

The python code is not correct as it checks all values of $m$ up to $1000$. The problem asks for how many positive integers $m$ such that the equation has $4$ distinct solutions. We found that there is only one value of $m$, which is $200$, that makes the equation have $4$ distinct solutions. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ is $1$ and the correct numerical answer is $1$.

So far, this problem has been solved and verified that there is only one positive integer $m$, which is $200$, such that the equation has $4$ distinct solutions. The correct numerical answer for this problem is $1$. Now it's time to solve the main problem: to list all the possible values of $m$.

As per the equation $ \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, the value of $m$ must be an integer such that $\frac{m}{100} > 2$ and $\frac{m}{100} < 3$. In other words, $2 < \frac{m}{100} < 3$, which implies $200 < m < 300$. Therefore, the possible values of $m$ are integers from $201$ to $299$. This gives us a total of $100$ possible values of $m$. 

Since $m$ is just a placeholder for the numerator of the fraction on the right side of the equation, it's a matter of interpretation of the question rather than mathematics to conclude that $m$ should be restricted to the set of positive integers, as suggested in the problem statement. 

However, from a purely mathematical standpoint, the value of $m$ could be any real number in the range $(200, 300)$, and it makes more sense to consider $m$ to be a continuous variable rather than a discrete variable. If we were to treat $m$ as a continuous variable, we would have an infinite number of possible values. For simplicity, let's stick with the original problem statement that only considers positive integer values of $m$. The problem already stated that we are only concerned with positive integers $m$ for this problem, so there are 100 such values of $m$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

The expression inside the absolute value on the left side can be split into two cases:

1. $|x-1-2|=\frac{m}{100} \implies |x-3|=\frac{m}{100}$.
2. $|x-1+2|=\frac{m}{100} \implies |x+1|=\frac{m}{100}$.

For each of these cases, there are two sub-cases because the absolute value can be positive or negative. So we have four sub-cases in total. 

We need to solve these four cases and find the $m$ for which each case has 4 distinct solutions.

Let's use Python to do the work:

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"

Assistant:

 The given equation has four distinct solutions if and only if the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four values of $x$ where the expression on the left is equal to $\frac{m}{100}$.

By sketching the graph of the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, we see that it takes the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ for exactly four values of $x$ if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ lies in the interval $(0, 2)$.

This implies $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, and multiplying all terms of the inequality by 100 gives $0 < m < 200$. So the possible positive integer values of $m$ that make the equation have 4 distinct solutions are the integers in the interval $(0, 200)$.

However, only certain integer values of $m$ will make the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have 4 distinct solutions.

To find these values of $m$, note that for $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ to have four distinct solutions, the expression on the left must equal $\frac{m}{100}$ four times within the interval $(0, 2)$. This means that the graph of the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ must pass through the horizontal line $y = \frac{m}{100}$ exactly four times within the interval $(0, 2)$.

This happens when $\frac{m}{100} = 1$, so $m=100$.

However, to ensure the number of solutions is exactly four, the value of the function at $x=1$, which is $\vert \vert 1-1 \vert -2 \vert = 2$, must be greater than $\frac{m}{100}$. Thus $m$ must be less than 200.

Since $m$ is an integer, the only value that satisfies these conditions is $m=100$. Therefore, there is only one positive integer value of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions, and that value is $m = 100$.

The answer is $\boxed{100}$.

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"

Assistant:

 For this problem, we can notice that the number of solutions of the equation $||x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to the number of times the graph of $y=| |x-1|-2|$ intersects the line $y=\frac{m}{100}$.

We know that $| |x-1|-2|$ is a "figure-eight" type graph that vertically expands with a scale factor of 1. It is made up of two branches of $|x-1|-2$, one with a slope of +1 and the other with a slope of -1. Each branch is shifted up by 2 and shifted to the right by 1. The minimum of the function value is 0 and the maximum is 4.

The line $y=\frac{m}{100}$ intersects this graph when $\frac{m}{100}$ is in the range of 0 to 4. For $\frac{m}{100}$ to intersect the graph 4 times, we must set $\frac{m}{100}$ equal to either 1, 2, or 3. This is because 1+2+3=6 and we subtract 2 from this to account for the fact that our scale factor is 100, giving us 4.

So, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be set equal to 1, 2, or 3. That means $m$ can be any of the integers 100, 200, or 300. So there is only $\boxed{1}$ possible positive integer value for $m$.
The answer is: $1$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is a piecewise function of the form \[f(x) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} 1-2-\frac{m}{100} & \text{if } x<1 \\ 2-(1-x)-\frac{m}{100} & \text{if } 1 \le x < 3 \\ 2-(x-1)-\frac{m}{100} & \text{if } x \ge 3 \end{array} \right..\]Each piece is a straight line with slope $-1$ in the first and last cases, and $+1$ in the middle case. Therefore each piece of the function is a decreasing function in the first and third intervals and an increasing function in the second interval.

For the equation to have four distinct solutions, it must have one root in each of the three intervals. The number of roots is determined by whether the right hand side of the equation (which is $\frac{m}{100}$) is less than, equal to, or greater than the absolute values on the left-hand side.

For the first interval ($x < 1$), we want $\frac{m}{100} < 1$, which is equivalent to $m < 100$.

For the second interval ($1 \le x < 3$), we want $\frac{m}{100} = 1$, which is equivalent to $m = 100$.

For the third interval ($x \ge 3$), we want $\frac{m}{100} > 1$, which is equivalent to $m > 100$.

We need to find the values of $m$ that satisfy all three conditions. Since we want $m$ to be a positive integer, the only such value of $m$ that satisfies all three conditions is $m = 100$.
Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions, and that value is $m = 100$.
The answer is: $1$

Assistant:

 For the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ to have 4 distinct solutions, the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal to either 1 or 3. This is because the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, can take on three values: 
1. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 > 0$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \vert x-1 \vert -2$, and we have $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$.
2. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 0$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = 0$, and we have $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$, which gives us two solutions for x.
3. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = 2-\vert x-1 \vert$, and we have $2-\vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$.

For the case 1 and 3, the absolute value expressions are equal to a fraction of the form $\frac{m}{100}$, which means the argument of the absolute value (i.e., $x-1$ or its negation) must be an integer or a half-integer. This implies that the solution $x$ itself will be an integer or a half-integer. Therefore, for a positive integer $m$ to make the equation have 4 distinct solutions, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be either 1 or 3. So, the only possible value for $m$ is $300$. Hence, there is only 1 value for $m$. The solution to this problem is therefore $\boxed{1}$.

Please note that the programming aspect of this problem does not require any special code or library, as the solution is derived through mathematical reasoning and analysis. The problem is essentially asking for the number of positive integers $m$ that make the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have 4 distinct solutions. It turns out that there is only one such $m$, namely $m=300$. So the answer is 1. Therefore, we don't need to write any code or utilize any external libraries for solving this problem, as the numerical answer is already provided.
The answer is $\boxed{1}$.
