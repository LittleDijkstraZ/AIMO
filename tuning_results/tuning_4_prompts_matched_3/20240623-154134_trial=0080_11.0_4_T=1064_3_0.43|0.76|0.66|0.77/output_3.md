Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:


The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, -2)$, and $(-8, 2)$.

Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$.

The intersection of these two squares is a square with side length 8. The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 64.

The answer is: $64$

Approach:


The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These two equations represent two squares with side length 10, one for the sum of $x$ and $y$ and the other for the difference of $x$ and $y$. The intersection of these two squares forms a square with side length 10.

Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which represents a square with side length 16.

The convex polygon formed by the intersection of these two squares is a square with side length 10. To find the area of this square, we simply square the side length: $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units. The answer is: $100$

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means that $-8 \leq x \leq 8$ and $-8 \leq y \leq 8$.

The polygon is a square with side length 20. To find the area of the square, we simply square the length of one of its sides. The area of the square is $20^2 = 400$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 400 square units. The answer is: $400$

Approach:


The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. Let's consider each case separately.

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
For the sum of two squares to be zero, both squares must be zero. This gives us:
$\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$
Simplifying these equations, we get:
$\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$
This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.
Solving these equations, we get the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
For the sum of two squares to be zero, both squares must be zero. This gives us:
$\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$
Simplifying these equations, we get:
$\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$
This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
So we have the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The lines from both cases form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10 \times 10 = 100$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

Approach:


The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. This means that the points that satisfy the equation are either on the boundary of the two circles defined by the equations $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$, or on the boundary of the two circles defined by the equations $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$.

The intersection of these four circles is a square with side length 6 (since the distance between the centers of the circles $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$ is $\sqrt{2} \cdot 8 = 8\sqrt{2}$, and the distance from the center of either of these circles to the closest point on the circle $|x| = 8$ or $|y| = 8$ is $8 - \sqrt{2} \cdot 4 = 8 - 4\sqrt{2}$, so the side length of the square is $2(8 - 4\sqrt{2}) = 16 - 8\sqrt{2}$, but this simplifies to $8(2 - \sqrt{2}) = 8\sqrt{2}$, which is a contradiction, so the side length of the square is $8 - 4\sqrt{2}$, and this simplifies to 6).

The area of the square is therefore $6^2 = 36$.
The answer is: $36$

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
For the sum of two squares to be zero, both squares must be zero. This gives us:
$\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$
Simplifying these equations, we get:
$\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$
This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$
Solving these equations, we get the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

$\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$
Simplifying these equations, we get:
$\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$
This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$
This forms a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

However, the intersection of the two cases is the empty set, so the points that satisfy the original equation are those that satisfy either case. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares, which is $100 + 256 = 356$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 356. The answer is: $356$

The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero, which means that either one of the expressions is zero. This gives us two systems of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

Solving these systems of equations will give us the vertices of the polygon. Once we have the vertices, we can calculate the area of the polygon.

The vertices of the polygon are the points where the absolute value expressions are equal to zero. This means that the values inside the absolute value expressions are zero. So, we have:

1. For $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
2. For $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert x \vert = 8$, which implies $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
3. For $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
4. For $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

By solving these systems of equations, we find the vertices of the polygon:

1. For $x + y = 10$ and $x = 8$, we get $y = 2$. So, one vertex is $(8, 2)$.
2. For $x + y = 10$ and $x = -8$, we get $y = 18$. So, another vertex is $(-8, 18)$.
3. For $x + y = -10$ and $x = 8$, we get $y = -18$. So, another vertex is $(8, -18)$.
4. For $x + y = -10$ and $x = -8$, we get $y = -2$. So, another vertex is $(-8, -2)$.
5. For $x - y = 10$ and $x = 8$, we get $y = -2$. So, another vertex is $(8, -2)$.
6. For $x - y = 10$ and $x = -8$, we get $y = -18$. So, another vertex is $(-8, -18)$.
7. For $x - y = -10$ and $x = 8$, we get $y = 18$. So, another vertex is $(8, 18)$.
8. For $x - y = -10$ and $x = -8$, we get $y = 2$. So, another vertex is $(-8, 2)$.
9. For $y = 8$ and $x + y = 10$, we get $x = 2$. So, another vertex is $(2, 8)$.
10. For $y = 8$ and $x - y = 10$, we get $x = 18$. So, another vertex is $(18, 8)$.
11. For $y = 8$ and $x + y = -10$, we get $x = -18$. So, another vertex is $(-18, 8)$.
12. For $y = 8$ and $x - y = -10$, we get $x = -2$. So, another vertex is $(-2, 8)$.
13. For $y = -8$ and $x + y = 10$, we get $x = 2$. So, another vertex is $(2, -8)$.
14. For $y = -8$ and $x - y = 10$, we get $x = 18$. So, another vertex is $(18, -8)$.
15. For $y = -8$ and $x + y = -10$, we get $x = -18$. So, another vertex is $(-18, -8)$.
16. For $y = -8$ and $x - y = -10$, we get $x = -2$. So, another vertex is $(-2, -8)$.

The vertices of the polygon are: $(8, 2)$, $(-8, 18)$, $(8, -18)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, -18)$, $(8, 18)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(2, 8)$, $(18, 8)$, $(-18, 8)$, $(-2, 8)$, $(2, -8)$, $(18, -8)$, $(-18, -8)$, and $(-2, -8)$.

The polygon is a square with side length 16. The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of the polygon is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$

The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.
The first term is zero when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
The second term is zero when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The solutions to these equations are the vertices of the polygon.
To find the area of the polygon, we can find the vertices and then use a formula for the area of a polygon.

Solution:
The vertices of the polygon are the solutions to the equations $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
From $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, we have $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
From $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, we have $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
From $\vert x \vert = 8$, we have $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
From $\vert y \vert = 8$, we have $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

By solving these equations, we find the vertices of the polygon:
$(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, $(-8,-8)$, $(10,0)$, $(0,10)$, $(-10,0)$, and $(0,-10)$.

The polygon is a square with side length 16 (the distance between $(8,8)$ and $(8,-8)$ or $(8,8)$ and $(-8,8)$).
The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of the polygon is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$

The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. This means that the points that satisfy the equation are the union of the points that satisfy each expression separately.

1. For the first expression, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, both terms must be zero. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This forms a square with side length 20.

2. For the second expression, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, both terms must be zero. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This forms a square with side length 16.

The area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares. The area of a square is given by side length squared, so the area of the first square is $20^2 = 400$ and the area of the second square is $16^2 = 256$. Adding these two areas gives the total area of the convex polygon: $400 + 256 = 656$.

2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For each system, we set each squared expression equal to zero and solve for the absolute values. Then we solve for the variables $x$ and $y$. The solutions will give us the vertices of the polygon.

Once we have the vertices, we can calculate the area of the polygon using the Shoelace formula.

The Shoelace formula for a polygon with vertices $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), ..., (x_n, y_n)$ is given by:

$$\frac{1}{2} \vert (x_1y_2 + x_2y_3 + ... + x_ny_1) - (y_1x_2 + y_2x_3 + ... + y_nx_1) \vert$$

After calculating the area, we can provide the numerical answer.

The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. This means that the points that satisfy the equation are the union of the points that satisfy each expression separately.

Let's consider the two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$:
This equation is satisfied if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points must lie on the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length 10.

2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$:
This equation is satisfied if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that the points must lie on the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length 16.

The area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares. The area of a square with side length $s$ is $s^2$, so the area of the first square is $10^2 = 100$ and the area of the second square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $100 + 256 = 356$.
The answer is: $356$

The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero, which means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. We can analyze each case separately.

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
This case implies that both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which further simplifies to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$. These lines intersect at the point $(5,5)$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
This case implies that both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which further simplifies to $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$. These lines intersect at the point $(8,8)$.

The points that satisfy the given equation are the vertices of a square with side length 10 units. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$ square units.
The answer is: $100$

Approach:


The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. This means that the points that satisfy the equation are either on the boundary of the two circles defined by the equations $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$, or on the lines defined by $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$.

The intersection of the two circles is a square with side length 8*2 = 16. The intersection of the two lines is a square with side length 10*2 = 20. The union of these two squares is the convex polygon enclosed by the points that satisfy the equation.

To find the area of this convex polygon, we simply add the areas of the two squares. The area of a square is given by side length squared, so the area of the first square is $16^2 = 256$ and the area of the second square is $20^2 = 400$. Adding these two areas gives the total area of the convex polygon as $256 + 400 = 656$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 656. The answer is: $656$

The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. This means that the points that satisfy the equation are the union of the points that satisfy each expression separately.

1. For the first expression, we have:
$$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0.$$
This equation is only possible if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points must lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$. These lines intersect at $(5,5)$.

2. For the second expression, we have:
$$(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0.$$
This equation is only possible if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that the points must lie on the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$. These lines intersect at $(8,8)$.

So the points that satisfy the equation are the union of the points on the lines $x + y = 10$, $x - y = 10$, $x = 8$, and $y = 8$. These lines form a square with side length 10.

The area of this square is the side length squared, which is $10^2 = 100$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$
