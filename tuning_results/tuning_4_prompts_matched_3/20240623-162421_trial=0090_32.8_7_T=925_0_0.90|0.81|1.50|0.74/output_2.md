"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"

 The problem asks for how many positive integers $m$ the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. 

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be solved graphically. The graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a "V" shape with two "humps" that are each 1 unit wide and 2 units high. The graph of $\frac{m}{100}$ is a horizontal line that moves up and down as $m$ changes.

For the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, the line $\frac{m}{100}$ must intersect the graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ in exactly 4 places. This happens when the line is between the two humps of the "V" shape, and is exactly $\frac{m}{100}$ units above the lowest hump or below the highest hump.

The distance between the humps is 2 units, so the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be less than 2 units and greater than 0 units. This means $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Multiplying all sides of the inequalities by 100 gives $0 < m < 200$.

The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from 1 to 199. So, there are 199 positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

However, we must check each of these 199 values of $m$ to see if the equation actually has 4 distinct solutions. We find that for $m=100$, the equation has 4 distinct solutions. For all other values of $m$, the equation has either 2 or 0 distinct solutions.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 1. The answer is: $1$

Assistant:

 The equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. This is because the expression $| |x - 1| - 2 |$ can only be equal to 2 in four different ways:

1. When $|x - 1| - 2 = 2$, we get $|x - 1| = 4$, so $x - 1 = 4$ or $x - 1 = -4$. This gives us two solutions: $x = 5$ and $x = -3$.
2. When $|x - 1| - 2 = -2$, we get $|x - 1| = 0$, so $x - 1 = 0$, which gives us one solution: $x = 1$.
3. When $-|x - 1| + 2 = 2$, we get $ -|x - 1| = 0$, so $|x - 1| = 0$, which gives us one solution: $x = 1$.
4. When $-|x - 1| + 2 = -2$, we get $ -|x - 1| = -4$, which is not possible because the absolute value of a number cannot be negative.

So, the only way for the equation to have 4 distinct solutions is when $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. Solving for $m$, we get $m = 200$. So, the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 200. The answer is: $200$

Assistant:

 The number of distinct solutions to the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to 4 if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 1 and 2. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ takes on the values of 0, 1, 2 exactly once each in the interval $1 < x < 3$. Therefore, we have $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which implies $100 < m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from 101 to 199, inclusive. To find the number of such integers, we subtract the smallest integer from the largest and then add 1. So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$. The answer is: $99$

Assistant:

 The equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions, which means the right hand side $\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal to 2.
So we have $| |x-1|-2|=2$.
This equation can be solved in two cases:
1. $|x-1|-2=2$, which gives $|x-1|=4$. The solutions are $x=5$ and $x=-3$.
2. $|x-1|-2=-2$, which gives $|x-1|=0$. The solution is $x=1$.

The equation $| |x-1|-2|=2$ has three distinct solutions: $x=-3$, $x=1$, and $x=5$.
To have 4 distinct solutions, we need to consider the behavior of the equation inside the absolute value.
For $x<1$, $|x-1|$ becomes $1-x$, so the equation becomes $|1-x-2|=|\frac{m}{100}|$, which simplifies to $|x+1|=|\frac{m}{100}|$.
For $1<x<3$, $|x-1|$ becomes $x-1$, so the equation becomes $|x-1-2|=|\frac{m}{100}|$, which simplifies to $|x-3|=|\frac{m}{100}|$.
For $x>3$, $|x-1|$ becomes $x-1$, so the equation becomes $|x-1-2|=|\frac{m}{100}|$, which simplifies to $|x-3|=|\frac{m}{100}|$.

To have 4 distinct solutions, we need to find the value of $m$ such that $|\frac{m}{100}|=2$. This gives $m=200$.
Therefore, the value of $m$ that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions is 200. The answer is: 1

Assistant:

 To find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions, we need to consider the possible values of $m$ that make the right-hand side positive and smaller than $2$.
The right-hand side, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be positive, so $m$ must be positive.
Also, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be smaller than $2$, so $m$ must be smaller than $200$.
Therefore, the possible values of $m$ are the positive integers from $1$ to $199$.
We need to find the number of these values that result in $4$ distinct solutions for the equation.
This can be done by analyzing the different cases for the absolute values and solving the resulting equations.
After analyzing the cases and solving the equations, we find that the only value of $m$ that results in $4$ distinct solutions is $m=100$.
Therefore, there is only $1$ positive integer $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions. The answer is: $1$

Assistant:


The number of distinct solutions to the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $4$ if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$.

This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ takes the value $2$ exactly $4$ times.

To see this, consider the graph of $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. The graph is a series of V-shapes, with the vertex of each V at $x = 1 \pm 2$. The function takes the value $2$ at $x = 1 - 2 = -1$, $x = 1$, and $x = 1 + 2 = 3$. So, the function takes the value $2$ exactly $4$ times.

Therefore, if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, then $m = 200$.
The answer is: $200$

Assistant:


To solve this problem, we need to analyze the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ and find for how many positive integers $m$ it has $4$ distinct solutions.

First, let's rewrite the equation as $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. The right-hand side of the equation is always positive, so the left-hand side must be positive as well. This means that $\vert x-1 \vert -2 > 0$, or $\vert x-1 \vert > 2$. The absolute value inequality can be split into two cases:

1. If $x-1 > 2$, then $x > 3$, and the inequality becomes $x-1 > 2$, which simplifies to $x > 3$.
2. If $x-1 < -2$, then $x < -1$, and the inequality becomes $1-x > 2$, which simplifies to $x < -1$.

So the solutions to $\vert x-1 \vert > 2$ are $x > 3$ and $x < -1$.

Now let's consider the inner absolute value $\vert x-1 \vert$. We have two cases again:

1. If $x-1 > 0$, then $x > 1$, and the equation becomes $\vert x-1 -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert x-3 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two sub-cases:
   a. If $x-3 > 0$, then $x > 3$, and the equation becomes $x-3 = \frac{m}{100}$, or $x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$.
   b. If $x-3 < 0$, then $x < 3$, and the equation becomes $3-x = \frac{m}{100}$, or $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.

2. If $x-1 < 0$, then $x < 1$, and the equation becomes $\vert 1-x -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert -x-1 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, which is equivalent to $\vert x+1 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two sub-cases:
   a. If $x+1 > 0$, then $x > -1$, and the equation becomes $x+1 = \frac{m}{100}$, or $x = \frac{m}{100} - 1$.
   b. If $x+1 < 0$, then $x < -1$, and the equation becomes $-(x+1) = \frac{m}{100}$, or $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Now we need to find for how many positive integers $m$ the equations above have $4$ distinct solutions. After solving these equations, we find that:

1. $x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$ has a solution for $x > 3$, which gives $m > 0$ and $m < 100$.
2. $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ has a solution for $x < 3$, which gives $0 < m < 300$.
3. $x = \frac{m}{100} - 1$ has a solution for $x > -1$, which gives $m > 0$ and $m < 100$.
4. $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$ has a solution for $x < -1$, which gives $0 < m < 200$.

By analyzing these ranges of $m$, we find that the only values of $m$ that satisfy all four equations are those in the range $100 < m < 200$. Therefore, there are $100$ positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions. The answer is: $100$.

 To solve this problem, we need to analyze the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ and find out for how many positive integers $m$ it has 4 distinct solutions.

First, let's consider the right-hand side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$. Since $m$ is a positive integer, $\frac{m}{100}$ is a positive number.

The left-hand side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, is the absolute value of the absolute value of $x-1$ minus 2. This expression is always nonnegative, and it equals 0 when $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$, which means $x = 3$ or $x = -1$.

So the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 2 solutions, $x = 3$ and $x = -1$. To get 4 distinct solutions, we need to create two more solutions by solving the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ for two different values of $m$.

Let's consider the case when $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100} < 1$. This means $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = 0$ or $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = 1$.

If $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = 0$, we already know that the solutions are $x = 3$ and $x = -1$.

If $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = 1$, then $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \pm 1$. Solving these two equations gives us two more solutions: $x = 0$ and $x = 2$.

So for the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ to have 4 distinct solutions, we need $\frac{m}{100} = 1$. Solving this gives $m = 100$.

Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions, and that is $m = 100$. The answer is: $1$
