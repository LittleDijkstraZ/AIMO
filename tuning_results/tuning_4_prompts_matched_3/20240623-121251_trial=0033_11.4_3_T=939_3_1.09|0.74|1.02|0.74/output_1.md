Approach:


To find the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. Define the function $F(x, y, \lambda) = 5x^2+5y^2-8xy + \lambda(|x-2y| + |y-2x| - 40)$. Then we need to find the critical points of $F(x, y, \lambda)$ by setting the partial derivatives of $F$ with respect to $x$, $y$, and $\lambda$ equal to zero.

This will give us a system of equations to solve. However, this method can be quite involved. An alternative approach is to use the fact that the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ can be rewritten as $\frac{1}{2}((5x-4y)^2 + (4x-5y)^2)$. This is a sum of squares and is always nonnegative. Moreover, it is equal to zero if and only if $5x-4y = 0$ and $4x-5y = 0$, which implies $x = y = 0$. However, this does not satisfy the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.

Another way to proceed is to notice that the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ can be rewritten as $5(x-y)^2 + (x+y)^2$. Since both $(x-y)^2$ and $(x+y)^2$ are nonnegative, the minimum value of the expression is achieved when $(x-y)^2 = 0$ and $(x+y)^2 = 0$, which implies $x = y$. Substituting $x = y$ into the constraint equation, we get $|x-2x| + |x-2x| = 40$, which simplifies to $2|x| = 40$, so $|x| = 20$. Therefore, $x = \pm 20$.

Finally, substituting $x = y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get $10x^2 - 8x^2 = 2x^2$. Since $x = \pm 20$, the minimum value of $2x^2$ is achieved when $x = -20$, and the minimum value is $2(-20)^2 = 800$.

So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $-800$. However, this is not possible because the given expression is always nonnegative. There must have been a mistake in our calculations. Let's retrace our steps.

We started with the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = \frac{1}{2}((5x-4y)^2 + (4x-5y)^2)$. This is always nonnegative, and it is equal to zero if and only if $5x-4y = 0$ and $4x-5y = 0$, which implies $x = y = 0$. This does satisfy the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. Therefore, the minimum value of the expression is achieved when $5x-4y = 0$ and $4x-5y = 0$. Solving this system of equations, we find $x = y = 0$.

Substituting $x = y = 0$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get $0$. This is the minimum value of the expression. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $0$.

However, this contradicts the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. The mistake was in assuming that the minimum value of the expression is achieved when $x = y$. This is not always true.

To correct this, we need to consider the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as a function of the variable $x-y$, and find its minimum value as a function of $x-y$. Let $u = x-y$, then $y = x-u$. Substituting this into the expression, we get $5x^2 + 5(x-u)^2 - 8x(x-u) = 5x^2 + 5(x^2 - 2ux + u^2) - 8x^2 + 8ux = 10x^2 - 8ux + 5u^2$.

To find the minimum value of this expression as a function of $u$, we take the derivative with respect to $x$ and set it equal to zero: $20x - 8u = 0$, which gives $x = \frac{4u}{10} = \frac{2u}{5}$. Substituting this into the constraint equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we get $\left|\frac{2u}{5} - 2(x-u)\right| + \left|(x-u) - 2\left(\frac{2u}{5}\right)\right| = 40$.

Solving this equation for $u$, we find $u = \pm 10$. Therefore, the minimum value of the expression is achieved when $u = 10$, or when $u = -10$. Substituting $u = 10$ into the expression $10x^2 - 8ux + 5u^2$, we get $10x^2 - 80x + 500 = 10(x^2 - 8x + 50) = 10(x-4)^2 + 100$. This expression is minimized when $x = 4$, and the minimum value is $100$.

Substituting $u = -10$ into the expression $10x^2 - 8ux + 5u^2$, we get $10x^2 + 80x + 500 = 10(x+4)^2 + 100$. This expression is minimized when $x = -4$, and the minimum value is also $100$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $100$.
The answer is: $100$

Approach:


We will use the inequality $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$ to simplify the given equation.

Given $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we can rewrite it as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$. By the inequality mentioned above, we have $|(x-2y) + (2y-x)| = |0| = 0 \leq 40$, which is always true. So the given equation is always true.

Now we need to find the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite it as $5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy$. By the inequality of arithmetic and geometric means (AM-GM), we have $x^2+y^2 \geq 2\sqrt{x^2y^2} = 2|xy|$. So $5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy \geq 5*2|xy| - 8xy = 10|xy| - 8xy$.

Let $t = xy$, then $10|t| - 8t$ is minimized when $t = 0$. So the minimum value is $0$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $0$.
The answer is: $0$

This problem involves finding the minimum value of a function $f(x, y) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ under the constraint $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$. 

First, we can simplify the constraint equation. Notice that $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = |2x - y| + |2y - x| = 40$. By the triangle inequality, $|a| + |b| \geq |a + b|$, so $|2x - y| + |2y - x| \geq |(2x - y) + (2y - x)| = |x| = 40$. This implies that $x = \pm 20$.

Now, we can substitute $x = 20$ into the constraint equation to get $|20 - 2y| + |y - 40| = 40$. This simplifies to $|20 - 2y| + |40 - y| = 40$. We can consider two cases:

1. If $20 - 2y \geq 0$ and $40 - y \geq 0$, then $20 - 2y + 40 - y = 40$, which gives $y = 20$.
2. If $20 - 2y < 0$ and $40 - y < 0$, then $-(20 - 2y) - (40 - y) = 40$, which also gives $y = 20$.

So, the only solution for $x = 20$ is $y = 20$. We can check that this solution satisfies the constraint equation.

Similarly, if $x = -20$, we substitute into the constraint equation to get $|-20 - 2y| + |y + 40| = 40$. This simplifies to $|20 + 2y| + |-40 - y| = 40$. We can consider two cases:

1. If $20 + 2y \geq 0$ and $-40 - y \geq 0$, then $20 + 2y - 40 - y = 40$, which gives $y = -20$.
2. If $20 + 2y < 0$ and $-40 - y < 0$, then $-(20 + 2y) - (-40 - y) = 40$, which also gives $y = -20$.

So, the only solution for $x = -20$ is $y = -20$. We can check that this solution satisfies the constraint equation.

Now, we can substitute the solutions $(x, y) = (20, 20)$ and $(x, y) = (-20, -20)$ into the function $f(x, y) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$. We get:

$f(20, 20) = 5(20)^2 + 5(20)^2 - 8(20)(20) = 2000$,

$f(-20, -20) = 5(-20)^2 + 5(-20)^2 - 8(-20)(-20) = 2000$.

So, the minimum value of the function $f(x, y) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ under the constraint is 2000. The answer is: $2000$

Approach:


This is a constrained optimization problem. We need to minimize the function $f(x, y) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ subject to the constraint $g(x, y) = |x - 2y| + |y - 2x| - 40 = 0$. 

First, let's simplify the constraint equation. We have $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$. 

We can rewrite this as $|2x - y| + |2y - x| = 40$. 

Now, let's use the property of absolute values $|a - b| = |b - a|$ to simplify further: $|2x - y| = |y - 2x|$. 

This implies that $2x - y = y - 2x$ or $2x - y = -(y - 2x)$. 

Solving the first equation $2x - y = y - 2x$ gives $4x = 2y$ or $y = 2x$. 

Solving the second equation $2x - y = -(y - 2x)$ gives $2x - y = -y + 2x$ or $0 = 0$. This doesn't give us any new information.

So, the constraint equation simplifies to $y = 2x$.

Now, we can substitute $y = 2x$ into the function $f(x, y)$ to get a function of a single variable: $f(x) = 5x^2 + 5(2x)^2 - 8x(2x) = 5x^2 + 20x^2 - 16x^2 = 19x^2$.

To minimize $f(x)$, we take the derivative of $f(x)$ with respect to $x$ and set it equal to zero: $f'(x) = 38x = 0$. Solving for $x$, we get $x = 0$.

Substituting $x = 0$ into the constraint equation $y = 2x$, we get $y = 0$.

So, the point $(x, y) = (0, 0)$ satisfies both the constraint equation and the minimum condition.

Now, we can find the minimum value of $f(x, y)$ by substituting $(x, y) = (0, 0)$ into $f(x, y)$: $f(0, 0) = 5(0)^2 + 5(0)^2 - 8(0)(0) = 0$.

So, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ subject to the constraint $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$ is 0.
The answer is: $\boxed{0}$

Approach:


To find the minimum value of the function $f(x, y) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ subject to the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. First, let's rewrite the constraint as $g(x, y) = |x-2y| + |y-2x| - 40 = 0$.

The method of Lagrange multipliers states that we need to solve the system of equations:

1. $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} - \lambda \frac{\partial g}{\partial x} = 0$
2. $\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} - \lambda \frac{\partial g}{\partial y} = 0$
3. $g(x, y) = 0$

Let's find the partial derivatives:

$\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = 10x - 8y$
$\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = 10y - 8x$
$\frac{\partial g}{\partial x} = -2 + 2 = 0$
$\frac{\partial g}{\partial y} = -2 + 2 = 0$

From equations (1) and (2), we have $10x - 8y = 0$ and $10y - 8x = 0$. Solving this system of equations, we find $x = y$.

Now, substitute $x = y$ into the constraint equation $g(x, y) = 0$:

$|x-2x| + |x-2x| = 40 \Rightarrow |x| + |-x| = 40 \Rightarrow 2|x| = 40 \Rightarrow |x| = 20$.

So, $x = \pm 20$. Since $x = y$, we have $y = \pm 20$.

Now, substitute $x = y = 20$ and $x = y = -20$ into the function $f(x, y)$:

$f(20, 20) = 5(20)^2 + 5(20)^2 - 8(20)(20) = 2000$
$f(-20, -20) = 5(-20)^2 + 5(-20)^2 - 8(-20)(-20) = 2000$

Therefore, the minimum value of $f(x, y)$ is $2000$. The answer is: $2000$
