"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ equals to zero if and only if both factors equal zero.
The first factor equals zero if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
The second factor equals zero if $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
These conditions describe a square with side length 16.
The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So, the given equation implies that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$. This gives us two lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.

For $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = \pm 10$. This gives us two more lines $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.

For $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$. This gives us two vertical lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.

For $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = \pm 8$. This gives us two horizontal lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

The four lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, $x - y = -10$, $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$ enclose a rectangle with vertices at $(8, 2)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, -2)$, and $(8, -2)$. The side lengths of this rectangle are 16 and 4, so its area is $16 \times 4 = 64$. The answer is: $64$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $AB=0$ implies that $A=0$ or $B=0$. Therefore, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
If $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
If $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.
The points that satisfy these conditions are: $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, $(-8,-8)$, $(10,0)$, $(0,10)$, $(-10,0)$, and $(0,-10)$.
The plot of these points forms a square with side length 16, so the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



In order for the left hand side of the equation to be 0, one of the two factors must be zero. So, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. 

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. These equations simplify to $x = y$ or $x = -y$, so the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy these equations form a square with side length $20$ and area $400$.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$, so the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy these equations form a square with side length $16$ and area $256$.

Therefore, the convex polygon enclosed by the points that satisfy the given equation is the union of these two squares, and its area is the sum of their areas, $400 + 256 = 656$. The answer is: $\boxed{656}$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression equals zero if either of the factors equals zero. The first factor equals zero if either $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x-y| - 10 = 0$. These conditions simplify to $|x+y| = 10$ and $|x-y| = 10$. The second factor equals zero if either $|x|-8=0$ or $|y|-8=0$. These conditions simplify to $|x|=8$ and $|y|=8$.
The points satisfying $|x+y| = 10$ and $|x-y| = 10$ are the points in a square with side length $10$ centered at the origin. The points satisfying $|x|=8$ and $|y|=8$ are the points in a square with side length $16$ centered at the origin. The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for. The side length of this polygon is $10$, and the area is the square of the side length, so the area is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



A product of two or more factors is equal to zero if and only if at least one of the factors is zero. Therefore, the equation given in the problem can be simplified as follows:
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0\]
or
\[((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]
The first equation holds if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These two equations imply that $x$ and $y$ are both 0 or $x = y$ and $\vert x \vert = 10$, or $x = -y$ and $\vert x \vert = 10$. In other words, the points $(x, y)$ are on the lines $x + y = \pm 10$, $x - y = \pm 10$, $x = \pm 10$, and $y = \pm 10$. These lines form a square with side length 20. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $20^2 = 400$. The answer is: $400$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To solve this problem, we need to understand the conditions under which the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ holds true. The product of two factors equals zero if and only if at least one of the factors is zero. Therefore, we have two cases:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
From these equations, we can conclude that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. So we get two lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

Now we need to find the intersection points of these lines. The intersection points are $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$. These points form a square with side length $16$. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So the area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $\boxed{256}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if either of the two factors is equal to zero. This means that either:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, or
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From the first equation, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the points $(5, 5)$, $(-5, 5)$, $(5, -5)$, and $(-5, -5)$.

From the second equation, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the points $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

These eight points form a square with side length $10$, so the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to 0 if and only if either of the two factors is equal to 0. 
For the first factor to be 0, either $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two lines in the coordinate plane.
For the second factor to be 0, either $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of four lines in the coordinate plane.
The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 10, since the square with side length 8 encloses the square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation given in the problem is equal to zero, which means that one of the factors must be zero. This gives us two separate conditions:
1. $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$
2. $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$
For the first condition to be true, both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ must be zero. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only way this can happen is if $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$.
For the second condition to be true, both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2$ must be zero. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The only way this can happen is if $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
Therefore, the points that satisfy the equation are $(10,10)$, $(10,-10)$, $(-10,10)$, $(-10,-10)$, $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.
These points form a square with side length $20$, so the area of the square is $20^2 = 400$. The answer is: $400$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ is zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.
Solving these equations, we get four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.
Similarly, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
Solving these equations, we get four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.
The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 10.
The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.
So the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$
