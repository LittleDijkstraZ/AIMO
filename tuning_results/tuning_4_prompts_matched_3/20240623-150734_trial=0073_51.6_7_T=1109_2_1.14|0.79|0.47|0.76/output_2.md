Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions, which means that the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be equal to 2. This is because the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=2$ has 4 distinct solutions. Therefore, we must have $\frac{m}{100}=2$, which implies $m=200$. So the only possible value for $m$ is 200. The answer is: $1$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions, which means that the expression $|x - 1| - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$ or $|x - 1| - 2 = -\frac{m}{100}$ has two solutions each.

Let's consider the first equation $|x - 1| - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$. We can rewrite this as $|x - 1| = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. This equation has two solutions when $2 + \frac{m}{100} > 0$, which gives us $m > -200$.

Similarly, for the second equation $|x - 1| - 2 = -\frac{m}{100}$, we can rewrite it as $|x - 1| = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. This equation has two solutions when $2 - \frac{m}{100} > 0$, which gives us $m < 200$.

Combining these two inequalities, we find that $-200 < m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from 1 to 199. Therefore, there are 199 positive integers $m$ for which the given equation has 4 distinct solutions. The answer is: $199$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. 

This equation is a transformation of the basic equation $\vert \vert x \vert -a \vert=b$, which has 4 distinct solutions for certain values of $a$ and $b$. 

In this case, we can see that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is similar to the basic equation, with $a=2$ and $b=\frac{m}{100}$. 

For the basic equation to have 4 distinct solutions, we need $0<b<a$. In this case, $0<\frac{m}{100}<2$, which gives $0<m<200$.

The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from 1 to 199.

However, we are asked for the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. This means we are looking for the number of integers from 1 to 199.

The number of positive integers from 1 to 199 is simply 199.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 199.
The answer is: $199$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.
The expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a piecewise function that can take on the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ four times.
This means that the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be between 1 and 2.
So, we have $1 \leq \frac{m}{100} < 2$.
Multiplying all sides of the inequality by 100 gives $100 \leq m < 200$.
The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from 100 to 199, inclusive.
There are $100$ such integers. The answer is: $100$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



For the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ to have $4$ distinct solutions,
the right side $\frac{m}{100}$ must be strictly greater than $2$ and strictly less than $3$.
This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ oscillates between $1$ and $3$.
Therefore, we have $2 < \frac{m}{100} < 3$.
Multiplying all sides by $100$, we get $200 < m < 300$.
The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are $201, 202, ..., 299$.
There are $99$ such integers.
Therefore, the value of $m$ is $99$. The answer is: $99$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.
This equation is equivalent to a pair of absolute value equations:
$\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ or $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.

For the first equation, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.
This gives us two cases:

1) $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.
2) $-(x-1) = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

For the second equation, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
This gives us two more cases:

3) $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
4) $-(x-1) = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

For the four equations above to have distinct solutions, the fractions $\frac{m}{100}$ must be different from each other and from 2. This means $m$ must be an integer between 1 and 99, inclusive, such that none of the values $\frac{m}{100}$, $2 + \frac{m}{100}$, $2 - \frac{m}{100}$ are equal to each other.

By checking the values of $m$ from 1 to 99, we find that there are exactly 2 values of $m$ that satisfy this condition: $m=33$ and $m=67$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 2. The answer is: 2

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

Consider the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. The graph of $f(x)$ is as follows:

[asy]
unitsize(1 cm);

real func(real x) {
  return(abs(abs(x - 1) - 2));
}

draw(graph(func,-2.5,3.5),red);
draw((-2.5,0)--(3.5,0));
draw((0,-0.5)--(0,3.5));

label("$f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$", (3.5,func(3.5)), E);
[/asy]

The graph of $f(x)$ is a V-shape with the vertices at $x=1 \pm 2$, i.e. at $x=-1$ and $x=3$.

The equation $f(x) = \frac{m}{100}$ will have 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ lies strictly between the minimum and maximum values of $f(x)$. The minimum value of $f(x)$ is $0$ and the maximum value is $3 - 1 = 2$. So, $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Multiplying through by $100$, we get $0 < m < 200$.

The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from $1$ to $199$.

However, we need to count the number of these integers that divide $200$ exactly $4$ times. The prime factorization of $200$ is $2^3 \cdot 5^2$. A positive integer $m$ divides $200$ exactly $4$ times if and only if its prime factorization is of the form $2^a \cdot 5^b$ where $0 \le a \le 3$ and $0 \le b \le 2$. There are $4$ choices for $a$ (it can be $0$, $1$, $2$, or $3$) and $3$ choices for $b$ (it can be $0$, $1$, or $2$). Therefore, the number of such integers $m$ is $4 \cdot 3 = 12$.

So, there are 12 positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. The answer is: $12$

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}=2$.
This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is equal to 2 at 4 distinct points.

Solving the equation $\frac{m}{100}=2$, we find $m = 200$.
Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions, and that is $m = 200$. The answer is: 1

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}=2$. This is because the equation inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, can take on the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ twice: once when it's positive and once when it's negative. So we have $\frac{m}{100}=2$, which implies $m=200$. Thus, there is only one positive integer $m$ that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions, and that is $m=200$. The answer is: $\boxed{1}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions, which means the right side of the equation must be positive (since the absolute value function is always nonnegative, and if the right side is $0$, then there can only be $2$ or $1$ solutions). This means $\frac{m}{100} > 0$, which implies $m > 0$. So $m$ is a positive integer.
Now let's consider the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. The left side can be $0$ only when $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$, which gives us two solutions $x = 3$ and $x = -1$. So for the equation to have $4$ distinct solutions, the right side must be greater than $0$ but less than the distance between these two solutions. The distance between $3$ and $-1$ is $4$, so we need $\frac{m}{100} < 4$, which implies $m < 400$.
The possible values of $m$ are then the positive integers from $1$ to $399$.
However, we need to find the number of values of $m$ such that the equation has $4$ distinct solutions. By trial and error or by graphing the function $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ and the horizontal line $y = \frac{m}{100}$, we can find that the equation has $4$ distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100} = 1$. This gives us $m = 100$.
Therefore, there is only one positive integer value of $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions, and that is $m = 100$. The answer is: $1$
