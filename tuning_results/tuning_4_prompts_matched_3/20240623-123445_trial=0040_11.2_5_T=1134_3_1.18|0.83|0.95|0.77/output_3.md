Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:

 The equation given in the problem is a product of two expressions equated to zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. 

If the first expression is zero, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length 10.

If the second expression is zero, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So we have four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length 16.

Therefore, the points that satisfy the equation form the union of two squares: one with side length 10 and the other with side length 16. The area of a square is given by the square of the side length, so the area of the square with side length 10 is $10^2 = 100$ and the area of the square with side length 16 is $16^2 = 256$. 

Adding these two areas, we get the total area of the convex polygon as $100 + 256 = 356$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 356. The answer is: $356$

Approach:



The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These equations represent two pairs of lines parallel to the coordinate axes at a distance of 10 units from the origin.

Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which are two pairs of lines parallel to the coordinate axes at a distance of 8 units from the origin.

The intersection of these lines form a square with side length 16 (since the square is formed by the intersections of the lines at a distance of 8 units from the origin in all four directions). Therefore, the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

The Python script to compute the area is as follows:
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def square_area():
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = square_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon formed by the points satisfying the given condition is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:

 The given equation is a product of two expressions, one of which is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. This expression equals zero if and only if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
The other expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$, which equals zero if and only if both $(\vert x \vert - 8) = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8) = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The solutions to the system of equations $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ are the vertices of a square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$, centered at the origin. The solutions to the system of equations $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ are the vertices of a square with side length $16$, also centered at the origin.
Since the vertices of the two squares are the same, the convex polygon enclosed by the points satisfying the equation is the smaller square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$.
The area of this square is $(10\sqrt{2})^2 = 200$.
The answer is: $200$

Approach:

 The given equation is of the form $AB = 0$, which implies that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the points that satisfy the equation either satisfy $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. The expressions inside the absolute value functions in $A$ and $B$ represent the distances between the points $(x, y)$ and $(-10, 0)$ and $(10, 0)$ respectively, and between the points $(x, y)$ and $(0, 8)$ and $(0, -8)$ respectively. Therefore, the points that satisfy the equation are those that are either at a distance of 10 units from the points $(-10, 0)$ and $(10, 0)$ or at a distance of 8 units from the points $(0, 8)$ and $(0, -8)$. This describes a square with side length 20 units (from $(-10, 0)$ to $(10, 0)$) or a square with side length 16 units (from $(0, 8)$ to $(0, -8)$). The area of the convex polygon formed by these points is the sum of the areas of these two squares, which is $20^2 + 16^2 = 400 + 256 = 656$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 656 square units.

The answer is: $656$

Approach:


The equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, which means either of the terms must be zero. This gives us two sets of equations:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For both sets of equations, the solutions are:

1. $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
2. $x = y$ or $x = -y$.

The first set of solutions gives us a square with side length 16, so its area is $16^2 = 256$.

The second set of solutions gives us two lines, $x = y$ and $x = -y$, which intersect at the origin $(0, 0)$. The intersection of these lines with the square defined by the first set of solutions is another square with side length 8, so its area is $8^2 = 64$.

The area of the convex polygon is the difference of the areas of the two squares, which is $256 - 64 = 192$.
The answer is: $192$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:



The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if either of the two factors is zero. This gives us two conditions:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From condition 1, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the square as $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0)$.

From condition 2, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the square as $(8, 0), (-8, 0), (0, 8), (0, -8)$.

The intersection of these two squares is a square with side length 8, so its area is $8^2 = 64$. The area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points is therefore 64.
The answer is: $64$

Approach:

 The equation $AB = 0$ implies that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, we can break the problem down into two cases:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. Solving these equations gives us four lines: $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. These lines form a square with side length 20. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. Solving these equations gives us four lines: $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. These lines form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

The intersection of the two cases is the set of points that satisfy both conditions. However, the only point that satisfies both conditions is $(0, 0)$, which is not in either square. Therefore, the intersection is empty.

Therefore, the convex polygon is the union of the two squares, so its area is the sum of the areas of the two squares, which is $400 + 256 = 656$.

The answer is: $656$.

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

Approach:



The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero. Therefore, either of the expressions must be zero for the entire equation to be true. This gives us two sets of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From equation 1, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

From equation 2, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersection points of these lines are the vertices of the polygon: $(8,8)$, $(-8,8)$, $(-8,-8)$, and $(8,-8)$. These points form a square with side length 16. The area of a square is given by side length squared, so the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

The answer is: $256$.

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:


The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ will be zero only when their arguments are zero.
For the first equation, this implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
For the second equation, this implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
Combining these, we find the points that satisfy the equations are $(8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.
These points form a square with side length 16.
To find the area of this square, we simply square the length of one of its sides, giving us $16^2 = 256$.
So the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units.

The answer is: $256$
