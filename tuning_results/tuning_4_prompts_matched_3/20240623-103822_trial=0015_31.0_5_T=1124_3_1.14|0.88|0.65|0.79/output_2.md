Approach:

 We know that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. This equation represents the absolute value of the absolute value of $(x-1)$ minus $2$ equals a fraction. 

First, let's denote $y = |x-1|$, then the equation becomes $|y - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$. This equation will have two cases: 
1) $y - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$ when $y \geq 2$.
2) $2 - y = \frac{m}{100}$ when $y < 2$.

For the first case, we have $y = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, and since $y = |x-1|$, we get $|x - 1| = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. This will have two sub-cases: 
1.1) $x - 1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, when $x \geq 1$, so $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.
1.2) $1 - x = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, when $x < 1$, so $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

For the second case, we have $y = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, and since $y = |x-1|$, we get $|x - 1| = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. This will also have two sub-cases: 
2.1) $x - 1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, when $x \geq 1$, so $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
2.2) $1 - x = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, when $x < 1$, so $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

So, the four distinct solutions are: $3 + \frac{m}{100}$, $-1 - \frac{m}{100}$, $3 - \frac{m}{100}$, and $-1 + \frac{m}{100}$. 

For these four solutions to be distinct, we must have $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 - \frac{m}{100}$, $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 + \frac{m}{100}$, $-1 - \frac{m}{100} \neq 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, $-1 - \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 + \frac{m}{100}$, and $-1 - \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 + \frac{m}{100}$. 

Solving these inequalities, we get $m < 100$, and $m > 0$. So, $m$ must be an integer in the interval $(0, 100)$. 

To count the number of such integers, we calculate the number of positive integers less than $100$. This is simply $99$. 

So, the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $99$. The answer is: $99$

Approach:

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if the right-hand side is between $0$ and $3$. This is because the absolute value function has a triangular shape with a maximum value of $2$. So, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $\frac{m}{100}$ is between $0$ and $3$. Multiplying by $100$ gives $0 < m \leq 300$. The number of positive integers in this range is $300$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $300$.

So the answer is: $300$. The answer is: $\boxed{300}$

Approach:



The equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has 4 distinct solutions if and only if the value of the right-hand side $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly less than 2. This is because the absolute value of a quantity can be no greater than 2 units away from its absolute value. Thus, we have $\frac{m}{100} < 2$, which simplifies to $m < 200$. The positive integers that satisfy this condition are the integers from 1 to 199.

We need to count how many of these integers make the original equation have 4 distinct solutions. This is not a trivial task and it requires a deep understanding of the properties of the absolute value function. However, by analyzing the properties of the absolute value function, we can determine that the equation has 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100} \in (0, 2)$. This means $m \in (0, 200)$.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition is the number of integers from 1 to 199, which is $199$.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has 4 distinct solutions is $199$.

The answer is: $199$

Assistant:

Approach:


We know that the absolute value function has two cases, either $|x-1| - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$ or $-(|x-1| - 2) = \frac{m}{100}$. Simplify each equation to get $|x-1| = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $|x-1| = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. 
For the first equation $|x-1| = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, we have two cases: $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $-(x-1) = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.
For the second equation $|x-1| = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, we have two cases: $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $-(x-1) = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.
For the four distinct solutions to exist, the vertical lines $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$, $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$, $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, and $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$ must intersect the graph of $y = |x-1| - 2$ in four distinct points.
This means that $2 - \frac{m}{100} > 0$ and $2 + \frac{m}{100} > 0$, which implies that $-200 < m < 200$.
Now, we need to find the values of $m$ for which the four lines intersect the graph of $y = |x-1| - 2$ in four distinct points.
By graphing the function $y = |x-1| - 2$ and the four lines, we can see that the four lines intersect the graph in four distinct points when $0 < m < 200$.
The number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy this condition is equal to the number of positive integers from 1 to 200, which is 200.
However, we are asked to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation has exactly 4 distinct solutions. We can find this by subtracting the values of $m$ for which the four lines intersect the graph in less than 4 distinct points.
From the graph, we can see that the four lines intersect the graph in less than 4 distinct points when $m \leq 0$ or $m \geq 200$.
So, the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation has exactly 4 distinct solutions is 200 - 0 = 200.
Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition is 200. The answer is: $\boxed{200}$

Assistant:

Approach:

 The equation $||x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions means that the right hand side $\frac{m}{100}$ is greater than 2 but less than 3. This is because the left hand side $||x-1|-2|$ can take values from 0 to 3 only. So, $2 < \frac{m}{100} < 3$. This implies $200 < m < 300$. The positive integers $m$ in this range are from 201 to 299. So, there are 99 such positive integers $m$.
The answer is: $99$.

Approach:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have $4$ distinct solutions if $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to the distance between two consecutive points of the piecewise function defined by $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. The piecewise function defined by $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has $3$ pieces: a constant piece of value $2$, a decreasing piece from $2$ to $0$ as $x$ varies from $1$ to $3$, and an increasing piece from $0$ to $2$ as $x$ varies from $3$ to $5$. So, the distance between two consecutive points of the piecewise function is $2 - 0 = 2$. Thus, we need $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, which gives $m = 200$.

So, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions, and that integer is $200$.

The answer is: $1$

Approach:



We start by analyzing the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.

The left side of the equation represents the distance of $x$ from $1$ in a two-step process where first we move $1$ unit and then $2$ units. Therefore, this is equivalent to the distance of $x$ from $3$ or $-1$. 

Thus, we can rewrite the equation as:

\[\vert x-3 \vert + \vert x+1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}.\]

This equation has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to the sum of two positive numbers. The sum of two positive numbers is positive, so we must have $m > 0$.

Also, for the equation to have $4$ distinct solutions, we must have $\frac{m}{100} > 2$, because the distance between the two absolute values is $4$ units.

Thus, we have $2 < \frac{m}{100} < 4$, which implies $200 < m < 400$.

The only positive integer $m$ that satisfies this inequality is $m = 300$.

So, there is only $1$ value of $m$ that makes the equation have $4$ distinct solutions, namely $m = 300$. The answer is: $1$

Approach:


To count the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions, we first analyze the possible values of $\frac{m}{100}$.

Since the absolute value of a real number is always nonnegative, the right-hand side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be nonnegative, which implies that $m \geq 0$. Furthermore, the absolute value of the left-hand side is at most 2, which implies that $\frac{m}{100} \leq 2$, or $m \leq 200$. Therefore, $m$ must be an integer in the range $0 \leq m \leq 200$.

For each value of $m$, we can set up the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ and solve it to find the number of distinct solutions. This involves analyzing the cases based on the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ and solving the resulting absolute value equations.

After solving the equation for each value of $m$, we count the number of distinct solutions and record the values of $m$ for which there are 4 distinct solutions.

Solution:

After performing the steps above, we find that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when $m$ is equal to $50$, $100$, and $150$. Therefore, there are 3 positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions. The answer is: $3$

We start by solving the equation $| |x-1| -2 | = \frac{m}{100}$.
This equation has four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $2$.
This gives us $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$.
Multiplying all sides by $100$ gives $100 < m < 200$.
The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from $101$ to $199$, inclusive.
The number of such integers is $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$.
The answer is: $99$

Approach:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can have at most $4$ distinct solutions.

First, let's consider the cases for the absolute values. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be broken down into four separate cases:

1. $\vert x - 1 \vert - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$
2. $-\vert x - 1 \vert - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$
3. $\vert x - 1 \vert - 2 = - \frac{m}{100}$
4. $-\vert x - 1 \vert - 2 = - \frac{m}{100}$

Each of these cases will yield two linear equations when the absolute value is removed. Solving these equations will give us the values of $x$ for each case. We then count the number of distinct solutions for each case and sum up the number of distinct solutions for all cases.

However, instead of solving the equations and counting the number of distinct solutions for each case, we can observe that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. This is because for each case, the absolute value equations have a solution if and only if the right side is equal to $2$. Therefore, $m = 200$ is the only value that will yield $4$ distinct solutions.

So the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $1$. The answer is: $1$.
The answer is: $1$

Approach:



1. First, let's understand that the absolute value equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions means the right side, $\frac{m}{100}$, is a value such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=c$ has $4$ solutions for a constant $c$. 

2. To find the number of such $m$, we need to understand the properties of the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. The graph of $f(x)$ has a V-shape with the "valleys" at $x= -1$ and $x= 3$. So for the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=c$ to have $4$ solutions, we need to choose $c$ such that it cuts the graph in these two valleys. 

3. This means we need to choose $c$ such that $0 < c < 3$. 

4. Since $c = \frac{m}{100}$, we have $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 3$. 

5. Multiplying all sides of the inequalities by $100$ gives $0 < m < 300$. 

6. The positive integers $m$ satisfying this inequality are $1, 2, ..., 299$. 

7. The number of such $m$ is therefore $299$.
The answer is: $299$.

Approach:


The equation $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions, which means that $\frac{m}{100}$ is the distance between the two outer solutions and twice the distance between the two inner solutions.
The graph of $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|$ is a V-shape with the vertex at $(1,2)$. The distance between the two outer solutions is 2 and the distance between the two inner solutions is 1. Therefore, we have $\frac{m}{100}=2$ for the distance between the two outer solutions and $\frac{m}{100}=1$ for the distance between the two inner solutions.
Solving these equations, we get $m=200$ for the first equation and $m=100$ for the second equation. However, the number of distinct solutions of the equation $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|=\frac{m}{100}$ is a decreasing function of $m$, so we are interested in the larger value $m=200$.
Therefore, the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 200.

The solution is: $200$. The answer is: $\boxed{200}$

Assistant:

Approach:


To have 4 distinct solutions, the right side $\frac{m}{100}$ must equal $2$. This is because the absolute value function creates a piecewise function, which has two breakpoints at $x=1\pm2$, resulting in three intervals where the equation can have at most one solution. The value of $\frac{m}{100}$ determines the distance between the two breakpoints, and for $\frac{m}{100}=2$, the distance is $4$, allowing for four distinct solutions.

Therefore, we need to solve the equation $\frac{m}{100}=2$ for $m$.

$m=2 \times 100 = 200$.

So, the only positive integer $m$ that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions is $200$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition is $1$. The answer is: $1$
