Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:


The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, which means either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.
We will consider each case separately and find the points that satisfy each case.

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
This case implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.
Solving these equations, we get the points $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, and $(-5,-5)$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
This case implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
So, we get the points $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

The points that satisfy the given equation are the intersection points of these two cases, which are $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.
These points form a square with side length 16.
The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$

Approach:

 The equation $AB=0$ implies that either $A=0$ or $B=0$. So we can break the problem into two cases:
1) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
This equation is satisfied only when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(5,5), (5,-5), (-5,5), (-5,-5)$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
This equation is satisfied only when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8,8), (8,-8), (-8,8), (-8,-8)$.

The union of these two squares forms a larger square with side length 10 (the maximum of 8 and 10). The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

Approach:

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, which means either of the terms must be zero. This gives us four conditions:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x - y \vert = 10$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert y \vert = 8$.

From conditions 3 and 4, we get that the points lie in a square with side length 16 (since $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ implies $-8 \leq x, y \leq 8$).

From conditions 1 and 2, we get that the points lie on a square grid with a spacing of 10 units (since $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ implies that the points are 10 units apart in both the x and y directions).

The intersection of these two conditions is a square with side length 10 (since the side length of the grid is 10 units and it lies inside the larger square of side length 16 units).

The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:


The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$.

The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$, and $y = 8$ and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length $16$.

The area of the first square is $(10\sqrt{2})^2 = 200$, and the area of the second square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon formed by the intersection of these two squares is the sum of the areas of the two squares, which is $200 + 256 = 456$.

The answer is: $456$

Approach:

 The equation $AB = 0$ implies that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. So, we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle.

2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines also form a rectangle.

The intersection of these two rectangles is the square with vertices at $(8,8)$, $(-8,8)$, $(-8,-8)$, and $(8,-8)$. The side length of this square is 16, so its area is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Approach:



The equation given in the problem, $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$, is satisfied only when either of the two factors is zero. This means that the points that satisfy the equation are either on the boundary of the square with side length 16 (formed by the equations $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$) or on the boundary of the square with side length 20 (formed by the equations $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$).

The intersection of these two squares is a square with side length 8. So, the convex polygon formed by the points that satisfy the equation is a square with side length 8. The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$.

The answer is: $64$

Approach:



The equation given is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. For the product of two numbers to be zero, either one of the numbers must be zero. Therefore, we have two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only way this can happen is if $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$. So we have four points: $(10, 10)$, $(10, -10)$, $(-10, 10)$, and $(-10, -10)$.

2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The only way this can happen is if $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So we have four more points: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The eight points form a square with side length 20. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 400.

The answer is: $400$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):

Approach:


The given equation is a product of two terms equals to zero, which implies that either of the terms should be zero. So we have two cases to consider:
1) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations we get the vertices of the polygon as $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0)$.

For the second case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations we get the vertices of the polygon as $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$.

Now, we can plot these points on a graph to visualize the polygon. It turns out to be a square with side length 10. The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side, so the area of the polygon is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:



The equation $AB=0$ implies that either $A=0$ or $B=0$. So the given equation can be rewritten as:

$$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$$
or
$$(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0.$$

For the first equation to be true, both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that the points lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$.

For the second equation to be true, both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that the points lie on the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$.

The four lines $x + y = 10$, $x - y = 10$, $x = 8$, and $y = 8$ enclose a rectangle. The vertices of the rectangle are $(8,2)$, $(8,-2)$, $(-2,8)$, and $(10,0)$.

The length of the rectangle is the distance between the points $(8,2)$ and $(8,-2)$, which is $4$. The width of the rectangle is the distance between the points $(8,2)$ and $(-2,8)$, which is $6$. Therefore, the area of the rectangle is $4 \times 6 = 24$.
The answer is: $24$

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0)$ and $(-10, 0)$.

Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So the polygon is a square with side length 16.

The area of a square is given by side length squared, so the area of the polygon is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units.

The equation given in the problem is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. We will solve each case separately.

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
For the sum of two squares to be zero, both squares must be zero. This gives us two equations:
$\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$
Solving these, we get $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$
This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$
Solving these equations, we get the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
Similarly to case 1, this equation gives us $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. These lines form a square.

The intersection of the two cases is the square formed by the lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. The area of this square is $8 \times 8 = 64$. So the area of the convex polygon is 64.
The answer is: $64$

Approach:


The equation given is a product of two terms equal to zero, which means that either one of the terms is zero or both are zero. This gives us two sets of equations to solve:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For each set of equations, we can set the absolute values equal to zero and solve for $x$ and $y$. This will give us the vertices of the polygon.

After finding the vertices, we can use the Shoelace Formula to find the area of the polygon. The Shoelace Formula states that if the vertices of a polygon are $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), ..., (x_n, y_n)$, then the area of the polygon is given by:

$$\frac{1}{2} \vert (x_1y_2 + x_2y_3 + ... + x_ny_1) - (y_1x_2 + y_2x_3 + ... + y_nx_1) \vert$$

Approach:


The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied only when either of the two factors is zero.
The first factor is zero when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which are the equations of two squares.
The second factor is zero when $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$, which are the equations of two circles.
The intersection of these shapes forms a square with side length 10 and four quarter circles with radius 8.
The area of the square is $10^2 = 100$.
The area of each quarter circle is $\frac{1}{4} \pi \cdot 8^2 = 16\pi$.
So the total area of the convex polygon is $100 - 4 \cdot 16\pi = 100 - 64\pi$.
The answer is: $100-64\pi$

The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.
Let's analyze each case:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$: This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$: This implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = \pm 10$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$: This implies $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$: This implies $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = \pm 8$.

From these conditions, we can draw the following conclusions:

1. $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$ imply that $x = 0$ and $y = \pm 10$ or $x = \pm 10$ and $y = 0$. These are the vertices of a square with side length 10.
2. $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$ imply that the square is contained within a larger square with side length 16.

The area of the smaller square is $10^2 = 100$, and the area of the larger square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the difference between the areas of the two squares, which is $256 - 100 = 156$. The answer is: $156$

14_User:

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Approach:



The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if either of the two factors is zero. This gives us two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 \neq 0$.
2. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 \neq 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

In the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies that $x = 0$ and $y = 0$. In the second case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that $-8 \leq x, y \leq 8$.

Therefore, the points that satisfy the equation form a square with side length $16$. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$
