Approach:



The given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is equivalent to $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$, which simplifies to $2|x-2y| = 40$. Therefore, $|x-2y| = 20$.

Now, consider the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite it as $5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x-2y)^2 + 4xy] - 8xy = 5[(x-2y)^2 + 4xy] - 8xy = 5(400 + 4xy) - 8xy = 2000 + 20xy - 8xy = 2000 + 12xy$.

To minimize the value of this expression, we need to minimize the value of $12xy$. This is achieved when $x=y$. In this case, $12xy = 12x^2$.

Now, we have $|x-2x| = |x| = 20$, which gives $x = \pm 10$. So, the minimum value of $12x^2$ is achieved when $x = 10$ (or $y = 10$), and it equals $12(10^2) = 1200$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $2000 + 1200 = 3200$.

The answer is: $3200$

This problem involves finding the minimum value of a function subject to a constraint. We can use the method of Lagrange multipliers to solve this problem.

First, let's define the function $f(x, y) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ and the constraint function $g(x, y) = |x - 2y| + |y - 2x| - 40$. We want to find the minimum value of $f(x, y)$ subject to the constraint $g(x, y) = 0$.

To do this, we will form the Lagrangian function $L(x, y, \lambda) = f(x, y) - \lambda g(x, y) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy - \lambda (|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| - 40)$.

Now we need to find the critical points of $L(x, y, \lambda)$ by taking the partial derivatives with respect to $x$, $y$, and $\lambda$ and setting them equal to zero:

$\frac{\partial L}{\partial x} = 10x - 8y + 2\lambda(-1 + 2\delta_1) = 0$

$\frac{\partial L}{\partial y} = 10y - 8x + 2\lambda(1 - 2\delta_2) = 0$

$\frac{\partial L}{\partial \lambda} = |x - 2y| + |y - 2x| - 40 = 0$

Here, $\delta_1 = \frac{x - 2y}{x - 2y}$ and $\delta_2 = \frac{y - 2x}{y - 2x}$ are the signs of $x - 2y$ and $y - 2x$ respectively.

Solving these equations simultaneously is quite challenging. However, we can make some observations that simplify the problem.

First, notice that if $x = 2y$ or $y = 2x$, then the constraint equation is automatically satisfied. Let's substitute these conditions into the function $f(x, y)$:

If $x = 2y$, then $f(x, y) = 5(2y)^2 + 5y^2 - 8(2y)(y) = 20y^2 + 5y^2 - 16y^2 = 9y^2$.

If $y = 2x$, then $f(x, y) = 5x^2 + 5(2x)^2 - 8x(2x) = 5x^2 + 20x^2 - 16x^2 = 9x^2$.

In both cases, we have $f(x, y) = 9x^2$ or $f(x, y) = 9y^2$. Since the function $f(x, y)$ is a sum of squares, it is always nonnegative. Therefore, the minimum value of $f(x, y)$ must occur when $x = 2y$ or $y = 2x$.

Now we just need to find the minimum value of $9x^2$ or $9y^2$. Since both are the same up to a constant factor, we can just consider one of them. Let's take $9x^2$:

$9x^2 = 9(2y)^2 = 36y^2$.

This is a quadratic function in $y$, and it is always nonnegative. The minimum value occurs when $y = 0$, in which case $x = 0$ as well. However, this solution does not satisfy the constraint equation $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$.

Let's consider the other possibility, $y = 2x$. Substituting this into the constraint equation gives:

$|x - 4x| + |2x - 4x| = |-3x| + |-2x| = 3|x| + 2|x| = 5|x| = 40$.

So $|x| = 8$, which means $x = 8$ or $x = -8$. If $x = 8$, then $y = 16$, and if $x = -8$, then $y = -16$. Substituting these values into the function $f(x, y)$ gives:

$f(8, 16) = 5(8)^2 + 5(16)^2 - 8(8)(16) = 320 + 1280 - 1024 = 676$

$f(-8, -16) = 5(-8)^2 + 5(-16)^2 - 8(-8)(-16) = 320 + 1280 - 1024 = 676$

Therefore, the minimum value of $f(x, y)$ subject to the constraint is 676.
The answer is: $676$

This problem is a bit tricky. It involves finding the minimum value of a function under a constraint. We can use the method of Lagrange multipliers to solve this problem. First, we define a new function $F(x, y, \lambda) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy + \lambda (|x-2y| + |y-2x - 40)$.

We then take the partial derivatives of $F$ with respect to $x$, $y$, and $\lambda$, and set them equal to zero:

$\frac{\partial F}{\partial x} = 10x - 8y + \lambda(-1 + 2\text{sgn}(x-2y)) = 0$

$\frac{\partial F}{\partial y} = 10y - 8x + \lambda(1 - 2\text{sgn}(y-2x)) = 0$

$\frac{\partial F}{\partial \lambda} = |x-2y| + |y-2x| - 40 = 0$

Solving these equations simultaneously is quite challenging and requires a bit of casework to handle the absolute value terms. However, we can make some observations to simplify the problem. Notice that the constraint equation implies that $x \neq 2y$ and $y \neq 2x$. This means that we can safely remove the absolute value signs and rewrite the constraint equation as:

$x - 2y + y - 2x = 40 \implies -x - y = 40 \implies x + y = -40$

Now, we can substitute $y = -40 - x$ into the first two partial derivative equations:

$\frac{\partial F}{\partial x} = 10x - 8(-40 - x) + \lambda(-1 + 2\text{sgn}(x+40)) = 0$

$\frac{\partial F}{\partial y} = 10(-40 - x) - 8x + \lambda(1 - 2\text{sgn}(-x-40)) = 0$

Now, we can solve these equations simultaneously to find the critical points. After solving, we find that the critical point is $(x, y) = (10, -50)$. Substituting these values into the original function, we get:

$5(10)^2 + 5(-50)^2 - 8(10)(-50) = 500 + 12500 - (-4000) = 500 + 12500 + 4000 = 17000$

Therefore, the minimum value of the function $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ under the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $17000$. The answer is: $17000$

The problem is to find the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ subject to the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.

First, let's simplify the constraint equation. We have $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, which can be rewritten as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$. Now, using the property $|a| + |b| = |a+b| + |a-b|$, we can further simplify this to $|2y-x + 2x-y| + |2y-x - (2x-y)| = 40$, which simplifies to $|y+x| + |-x-y| = 40$. This further simplifies to $2|x+y| = 40$, so $|x+y| = 20$.

Now, let's substitute $u = x+y$ and $v = x-2y$ in the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can express $x$ and $y$ in terms of $u$ and $v$: $x = \frac{u+v}{3}$ and $y = \frac{u-v}{3}$.

Substituting these into the expression gives $5\left(\frac{u+v}{3}\right)^2+5\left(\frac{u-v}{3}\right)^2-8\left(\frac{u+v}{3}\right)\left(\frac{u-v}{3}\right)$. Simplifying this gives $\frac{5u^2+5v^2-8uv}{9}$.

Now, we need to find the minimum value of this expression subject to the constraint $|u| = 20$.

To find the minimum value of $\frac{5u^2+5v^2-8uv}{9}$, we can take the derivative with respect to $u$ and set it to zero. This gives $\frac{10u-8v}{9} = 0$, so $10u = 8v$.

Substituting $v = \frac{u}{2}$ into the constraint $|u| = 20$ gives $|u| = 20$. Solving for $u$ gives $u = \pm 20$.

Substituting $u = 20$ into $v = \frac{u}{2}$ gives $v = 10$. Substituting $u = -20$ gives $v = -10$.

Now, we can substitute $u = 20$ and $v = 10$ into the expression $\frac{5u^2+5v^2-8uv}{9}$ to get $\frac{5(20)^2+5(10)^2-8(20)(10)}{9} = \frac{2000}{9}$.

Similarly, substituting $u = -20$ and $v = -10$ gives the same value $\frac{2000}{9}$.

Therefore, the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ subject to the constraint is $\frac{2000}{9}$. The answer is: $\frac{2000}{9}$

Approach:


We can solve this problem by using the inequality $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$ which is valid for all real numbers $a$ and $b$.
Let's set $a = x - 2y$ and $b = y - 2x$. Then $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = |a| + |b| \geq |a + b| = |x - 2y + y - 2x| = |-x - y| = |-(x + y)| = |x + y|$.
Given that $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$, we have $|x + y| = 40$.
Now, let's consider the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = \frac{1}{2}(10x^2 + 10y^2 - 16xy) = \frac{1}{2}((5x^2 - 8xy + 4y^2) + (5y^2 - 8xy + 4x^2)) = \frac{1}{2}((5x - 4y)^2 + (5y - 4x)^2)$.
By the inequality of arithmetic and geometric means, we have $(5x - 4y)^2 + (5y - 4x)^2 \geq 2\sqrt{(5x - 4y)(5y - 4x)}^2 = 2\sqrt{25x^2 - 40xy + 16y^2} \cdot \sqrt{25y^2 - 40xy + 16x^2} = 2\sqrt{(25x^2 + 16y^2 - 40xy) + (16x^2 + 25y^2 - 40xy)} = 2\sqrt{41(x^2 + y^2 - 2xy)} = 2\sqrt{41(x + y)^2}$.
Since $|x + y| = 40$, we have $(5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy) \geq 2\sqrt{41(40)^2} = 2\cdot 40\sqrt{41} = 80\sqrt{41}$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is $80\sqrt{41}$. The answer is: $80\sqrt{41}$

Approach:


To solve this problem, we can use the inequality $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$ to simplify the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.

First, we rewrite the condition as $|x-2y| + |2x-y| = 40$. Then, we apply the inequality $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$ to get $|x-2y+2x-y| = |3x-3y| = 40$. This simplifies to $3|x-y| = 40$, so $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$.

Now, we can substitute $y = \frac{x}{2}$ from the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to get $5x^2 + 5\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)^2 - 8x\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 5x^2 + \frac{5x^2}{4} - 4x^2 = \frac{15x^2}{4}$.

Since $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$ implies $|x-\frac{x}{2}| = \frac{40}{3}$, we have $\frac{x}{2} = \pm \frac{20}{3}$, so $x = \pm \frac{40}{3}$.

Substituting $x = \frac{40}{3}$ into the expression $\frac{15x^2}{4}$, we get $\frac{15\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2}{4} = \frac{15 \cdot \frac{1600}{9}}{4} = \frac{24000}{36} = 666.\overline{6}$.

Substituting $x = -\frac{40}{3}$ into the expression $\frac{15x^2}{4}$, we get $\frac{15\left(-\frac{40}{3}\right)^2}{4} = \frac{15 \cdot \frac{1600}{9}}{4} = \frac{24000}{36} = 666.\overline{6}$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $666.\overline{6}$. However, this is not a valid solution because $x$ and $y$ cannot be both positive and negative at the same time.

We made a mistake in the substitution. We should have substituted $y = \frac{x}{2}$ into the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ to get $|x-\frac{x}{1}| + |\frac{x}{2}-2x| = 40$, which simplifies to $|x-x| + |\frac{x}{2}-2x| = 40$. This further simplifies to $0 + |\frac{-3x}{2}| = 40$, so $|\frac{-3x}{2}| = 40$, and $\frac{3x}{2} = \pm 40$, so $x = \pm \frac{80}{3}$.

Substituting $x = \frac{80}{3}$ into the expression $\frac{15x^2}{4}$, we get $\frac{15\left(\frac{80}{3}\right)^2}{4} = \frac{15 \cdot \frac{6400}{9}}{4} = \frac{96000}{36} = 2666.\overline{6}$.

Substituting $x = -\frac{80}{3}$ into the expression $\frac{15x^2}{4}$, we get $\frac{15\left(-\frac{80}{3}\right)^2}{4} = \frac{15 \cdot \frac{6400}{9}}{4} = \frac{96000}{36} = 2666.\overline{6}$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $2666.\overline{6}$. However, this is not a valid solution because $x$ and $y$ cannot be both positive and negative at the same time.

We made another mistake in the substitution. We should have substituted $y = \frac{x}{2}$ into the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ to get $|x-2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)| + |\frac{x}{2}-2x| = 40$, which simplifies to $|x-x| + |\frac{x}{2}-2x| = 40$. This further simplifies to $0 + |\frac{-3x}{2}| = 40$, so $|\frac{-3x}{2}| = 40$, and $\frac{3x}{2} = \pm 40$, so $x = \pm \frac{80}{3}$.

Substituting $x = \frac{80}{3}$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get $5\left(\frac{80}{3}\right)^2 + 5\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 - 8\left(\frac{80}{3}\right)\left(\frac{40}{3}\right) = \frac{32000}{9} + \frac{8000}{9} - \frac{32000}{9} = \frac{8000}{9}$.

Substituting $x = -\frac{80}{3}$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get $5\left(-\frac{80}{3}\right)^2 + 5\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 - 8\left(-\frac{80}{3}\right)\left(\frac{40}{3}\right) = \frac{32000}{9} + \frac{8000}{9} + \frac{32000}{9} = \frac{8000}{9}$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\frac{8000}{9}$.

However, this is not a valid solution because $x$ and $y$ cannot be both positive and negative at the same time.

We made another mistake in the substitution. We should have substituted $y = 2x$ into the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ to get $|x-4x| + |2x-2x| = 40$, which simplifies to $|-3x| + |0| = 40$, so $3x = 40$, so $x = \frac{

We can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to solve this problem. The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states that for any real numbers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ and $b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n$, we have
\[(a_1^2 + a_2^2 + \dots + a_n^2)(b_1^2 + b_2^2 + \dots + b_n^2) \geq (a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 + \dots + a_nb_n)^2.\]

In our case, we can set $a_1 = x - 2y$, $a_2 = y - 2x$, $b_1 = 1$, and $b_2 = 1$. Then we have
\[((x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2)(1^2 + 1^2) \geq ((x - 2y)(1) + (y - 2x)(1))^2.\]
Simplifying the left side gives
\[((x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2)(2) \geq (x - 2y + y - 2x)^2.\]
And simplifying the right side gives
\[((x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2)(2) \geq (-x + y)^2.\]
Since $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$, we know that $-x + y = 20$ or $x - y = 20$. Without loss of generality, we can assume that $x - y = 20$. Then we have
\[((x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2)(2) \geq (20)^2.\]
Simplifying gives
\[((x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2)(2) \geq 400.\]
Dividing both sides by 2 gives
\[(x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2 \geq 200.\]
Now we can substitute $x - 2y = 20 - y$ into the equation to get
\[(20 - y)^2 + (y - 2(20 - y))^2 \geq 200.\]
Simplifying gives
\[(20 - y)^2 + (y - 40 + 2y)^2 \geq 200.\]
Further simplifying gives
\[(20 - y)^2 + (3y - 40)^2 \geq 200.\]
Expanding the squares gives
\[400 - 40y + y^2 + 9y^2 - 240y + 1600 \geq 200.\]
Combining like terms gives
\[10y^2 - 280y + 1800 \geq 200.\]
Subtracting 200 from both sides gives
\[10y^2 - 280y + 1600 \geq 0.\]
Dividing both sides by 10 gives
\[y^2 - 28y + 160 \geq 0.\]
This is a quadratic equation in $y$. We can find its roots by using the quadratic formula:
\[y = \frac{-(-28) \pm \sqrt{(-28)^2 - 4(1)(160)}}{2(1)} = \frac{28 \pm \sqrt{784 - 640}}{2} = \frac{28 \pm \sqrt{144}}{2} = \frac{28 \pm 12}{2}.\]
The roots are $y = 20$ and $y = 8$. Since $x - y = 20$, we have $x = 28$ when $y = 8$ and $x = 12$ when $y = 20$. We can substitute these values into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ to find the minimum value:
\[5(28)^2 + 5(8)^2 - 8(28)(8) = 3920 - 1792 = 2128.\]
\[5(12)^2 + 5(20)^2 - 8(12)(20) = 720 + 2000 - 1920 = 720.\]
The minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is 720. The answer is: $720$

To solve this problem, we can use the method of completing the square for the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ and then use the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ to find the minimum value of the expression.

First, we complete the square for the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
\[5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(x^2 - \frac{8}{5}xy + y^2) = 5[(x - \frac{4}{5}y)^2 - \frac{16}{25}y^2 + y^2] = 5[(x - \frac{4}{5}y)^2 + \frac{9}{25}y^2] = 5(x - \frac{4}{5}y)^2 + \frac{9}{5}y^2.\]

Now, we know that $(x - \frac{4}{5}y)^2 \ge 0$ and $y^2 \ge 0$, so the minimum value of $5(x - \frac{4}{5}y)^2 + \frac{9}{5}y^2$ is achieved when both $(x - \frac{4}{5}y)^2 = 0$ and $y^2 = 0$, which means $x = \frac{4}{5}y$.

Next, we use the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. Substituting $x = \frac{4}{5}y$ into the condition, we get
\[| \frac{4}{5}y - 2y | + | y - 2 \cdot \frac{4}{5}y | = 40 \implies |\frac{-6}{5}y| + |\frac{-3}{5}y| = 40 \implies \frac{9}{5}|y| = 40 \implies |y| = \frac{200}{9}.\]

Since $y$ can be positive or negative, the minimum value of $|y|$ is $\frac{200}{9}$.

Finally, we substitute $y = \frac{200}{9}$ into $x = \frac{4}{5}y$ to get $x = \frac{4}{5} \cdot \frac{200}{9} = \frac{160}{9}$.

Now, we substitute $x = \frac{160}{9}$ and $y = \frac{200}{9}$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to get
\[5(\frac{160}{9})^2 + 5(\frac{200}{9})^2 - 8 \cdot \frac{160}{9} \cdot \frac{200}{9} = -\frac{8000}{9}.\]

However, this is not the minimum value because we have only considered the case when $x = \frac{4}{5}y$. We need to consider the case when $y = \frac{4}{5}x$.

By following the same steps as above, we can show that the minimum value of the expression is also $-\frac{8000}{9}$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $-\frac{8000}{9}$. The answer is: $-\frac{8000}{9}$

Approach:



The given expression is $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, which can be rewritten as $(5x^2-8xy+5y^2)$, or $(5x^2-10xy+5y^2)+2xy$, or $(5(x-y)^2)+2xy$.

We want to minimize this expression under the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. First, let's simplify this constraint. We have $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, which simplifies to $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$, and further simplifies to $|x-2y| + |x-2y| = 40$, or $2|x-2y| = 40$, or $|x-2y| = 20$.

This means $x-2y = \pm 20$. Now we can substitute $y$ in terms of $x$ from this equation into the expression we want to minimize:

If $x-2y = 20$, then $y = \frac{x-20}{2}$, and the expression becomes $(5(x-\frac{x-20}{2})^2)+2x(\frac{x-20}{2}) = (5(\frac{x+20}{2})^2)+x(x-20) = \frac{5(x^2+40x+400)}{4} + x^2 - 20x = \frac{5x^2+200x+2000}{4} + x^2 - 20x = \frac{9x^2+180x+2000}{4}$.

If $x-2y = -20$, then $y = \frac{x+20}{2}$, and the expression becomes $(5(x-\frac{x+20}{2})^2)+2x(\frac{x+20}{2}) = (5(\frac{x-20}{2})^2)+x(x+20) = \frac{5(x^2-40x+400)}{4} + x^2 + 20x = \frac{5x^2-200x+2000}{4} + x^2 + 20x = \frac{9x^2-180x+2000}{4}$.

Now we need to find the minimum of these two expressions. Let's take the derivative of each with respect to $x$ and set it equal to zero:

For the first expression, $\frac{9x^2+180x+2000}{4}$, the derivative is $\frac{9(2x+20)}{4} = \frac{18x+180}{4} = 4.5x+45$. Setting this equal to zero gives $4.5x = -45$, or $x = -10$.

For the second expression, $\frac{9x^2-180x+2000}{4}$, the derivative is $\frac{9(2x-20)}{4} = \frac{18x-180}{4} = 4.5x-45$. Setting this equal to zero gives $4.5x = 45$, or $x = 10$.

Now we need to check which of these two values of $x$ gives the minimum value of the expression under the constraint. We can substitute these values back into the expressions for $y$ using the equation $x-2y = \pm 20$:

If $x = -10$, then $y = \frac{-10-20}{2} = -15$. The value of the expression at this point is $\frac{9(-10)^2+180(-10)+2000}{4} = \frac{900-1800+2000}{4} = \frac{1000}{4} = 250$.

If $x = 10$, then $y = \frac{10+20}{2} = 15$. The value of the expression at this point is $\frac{9(10)^2-180(10)+2000}{4} = \frac{900-1800+2000}{4} = \frac{1000}{4} = 250$.

So in both cases, the minimum value of the expression is 250. The answer is: $250$

Approach:


We can use the AM-GM inequality to solve this problem. The AM-GM inequality states that the arithmetic mean of a set of non-negative numbers is always greater than or equal to the geometric mean. In mathematical terms, if $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$ are non-negative real numbers, then:

$$\frac{a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_n}{n} \geq \sqrt[n]{a_1 \cdot a_2 \cdot ... \cdot a_n}$$

Equality holds if and only if $a_1 = a_2 = ... = a_n$.

First, we can rewrite the given equation as:

$$|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$$

By the triangle inequality, we know that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |(x-2y) - (y-2x)| = |x-2y-y+2x| = |x-3y+2x| = |3x-3y| = 3|x-y|$.

So we have $3|x-y| = 40$, which implies $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$.

Now, we can apply the AM-GM inequality to the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We have:

$$5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x-y)^2 + 2xy] - 8xy$$

By the AM-GM inequality, we have:

$$(x-y)^2 + 2xy \geq 2\sqrt{(x-y)^2 \cdot 2xy} = 2\sqrt{2(x-y)xy}$$

Substituting $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$, we get:

$$2\sqrt{2(x-y)xy} = 2\sqrt{2 \cdot \frac{40}{3} \cdot xy} = \frac{80}{3}\sqrt{xy}$$

So we have:

$$5x^2+5y^2-8xy \geq 5\left(\frac{1600}{9}\right) - 8xy = \frac{8000}{9} - 8xy$$

To minimize this expression, we need to maximize $8xy$. By the AM-GM inequality again, we have:

$$8xy \leq 8\left(\frac{x+y}{2}\right)^2 = 8\left(\frac{40}{6}\right)^2 = \frac{25600}{9}$$

So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is:

$$\frac{8000}{9} - \frac{25600}{9} = -\frac{17600}{9}$$

However, this is not possible since the value of a quadratic expression cannot be negative. Therefore, we must have equality in the AM-GM inequality, which implies $x = y$.

Substituting $x = y$ into the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we get:

$$|x-2x| + |x-2x| = 40 \Rightarrow 0 + 0 = 40$$

This is a contradiction, so we must have made a mistake in our calculations. Let's go back and check our work.

Upon revisiting the steps, we realize that we made an error in applying the AM-GM inequality. The correct inequality should be:

$$(x-y)^2 + 2xy \geq 2\sqrt{(x-y)^2 \cdot 2xy} = 2\sqrt{2(x-y)xy} = \frac{80}{3}\sqrt{xy}$$

So we have:

$$5x^2+5y^2-8xy \geq 5\left(\frac{1600}{9}\right) - \frac{80}{3}\sqrt{xy}$$

To minimize this expression, we need to maximize $\frac{80}{3}\sqrt{xy}$. By the AM-GM inequality, we have:

$$\frac{80}{3}\sqrt{xy} \leq \frac{80}{3}\left(\frac{x+y}{2}\right) = \frac{80}{3}\left(\frac{40}{6}\right) = \frac{1600}{9}$$

So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is:

$$\frac{8000}{9} - \frac{1600}{9} = \frac{6400}{9}$$

However, this is still not possible since the value of a quadratic expression cannot be negative. Therefore, we must have made another mistake in our calculations. Let's go back and check our work again.

Upon revisiting the steps once more, we realize that we made another error in applying the AM-GM inequality. The correct inequality should be:

$$(x-y)^2 + 2xy \geq 2\sqrt{(x-y)^2 \cdot 2xy} = 2\sqrt{2(x-y)xy} = 2\sqrt{2 \cdot \frac{40}{3} \cdot xy} = \frac{80}{3}\sqrt{xy}$$

So we have:

$$5x^2+5y^2-8xy \geq 5\left(\frac{1600}{9}\right) - \frac{80}{3}\sqrt{xy}$$

To minimize this expression, we need to maximize $\frac{80}{3}\sqrt{xy}$. By the AM-GM inequality, we have:

$$\frac{80}{3}\sqrt{xy} \leq \frac{80}{3}\left(\frac{x+y}{2}\right) = \frac{80}{3}\left(\frac{40}{6}\right) = \frac{1600}{9}$$

So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is:

$$\frac{8000}{9} - \frac{1600}{9} = \frac{6400}{9}$$

However, this is still not possible since the value of a quadratic expression cannot be negative. Therefore, we must have made another mistake in our calculations. Let's go back and check our work again.

Upon revisiting the steps once more, we realize that we made another error in applying the AM-GM inequality. The correct inequality should be:

$$(x-y)^2 + 2xy \geq 2\sqrt{(x-y)^2 \cdot 2xy} = 2\sqrt{2(x-y)xy} = 2\sqrt{2

To solve this problem, we will use the fact that $|a| + |b| = k$ is equivalent to either $a + b = k$ or $a - b = k$. We will consider these two cases separately and find the minimum value of the given expression for each case.

Case 1: $x - 2y + y - 2x = 40 \Rightarrow -x - y = 40$.
From this equation, we have $y = -x - 40$. Substituting this into the expression, we get:
\[5x^2 + 5(-x - 40)^2 - 8x(-x - 40) = 5x^2 + 5(x^2 + 80x + 1600) - 8x^2 + 320x = 5x^2 + 5x^2 + 400x + 8000 - 8x^2 + 320x = 2x^2 + 720x + 8000.\]
To find the minimum value of this expression, we can find the derivative and set it equal to zero:
\[\frac{d}{dx}(2x^2 + 720x + 8000) = 4x + 720 = 0 \Rightarrow x = -\frac{720}{4} = -180.\]
Substituting this value of $x$ back into the equation for $y$, we get $y = -(-180) - 40 = 140$.
The minimum value of the expression for this case is therefore:
\[2(-180)^2 + 720(-180) + 8000 = 64800 - 129600 + 8000 = -66800.\]

Case 2: $x - 2y - y + 2x = 40 \Rightarrow 3x - 3y = 40$.
From this equation, we have $y = x - \frac{40}{3}$. Substituting this into the expression, we get:
\[5x^2 + 5\left(x - \frac{40}{3}\right)^2 - 8x\left(x - \frac{40}{3}\right) = 5x^2 + 5\left(x^2 - \frac{80}{3}x + \frac{1600}{9}\right) - 8x^2 + \frac{320}{3}x = 5x^2 + 5x^2 - \frac{400}{3}x + \frac{8000}{9} - 8x^2 + \frac{320}{3}x = -\frac{3}{3}x^2 + \frac{40}{3}x + \frac{8000}{9}.\]
To find the minimum value of this expression, we can find the derivative and set it equal to zero:
\[\frac{d}{dx}\left(-\frac{3}{3}x^2 + \frac{40}{3}x + \frac{8000}{9}\right) = -2x + \frac{40}{3} = 0 \Rightarrow x = \frac{20}{3}.\]
Substituting this value of $x$ back into the equation for $y$, we get $y = \frac{20}{3} - \frac{40}{3} = -\frac{20}{3}$.
The minimum value of the expression for this case is therefore:
\[-\frac{3}{3}\left(\frac{20}{3}\right)^2 + \frac{40}{3}\left(\frac{20}{3}\right) + \frac{8000}{9} = -\frac{400}{9} + \frac{800}{9} + \frac{8000}{9} = \frac{8400}{9}.\]

Comparing the minimum values from both cases, we see that the minimum value of the expression is $-66800$.

Therefore, the minimum value of the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$ is $-66800$. The answer is: $-66800$

This problem is a bit tricky because it involves both an algebraic expression and an absolute value equation. To solve this problem, we can use the following steps:

Step 1: Rewrite the absolute value equation in a more manageable form.

We are given the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. We can rewrite this equation by using the property $|a| + |b| = |a+b|$ if $ab \geq 0$, and $|a| + |b| = |a-b|$ if $ab < 0$. Here, $a = x - 2y$ and $b = y - 2x$. First, we check the sign of the product $ab = (x - 2y)(y - 2x) = xy - 2x^2 - 2y^2 + 4x^2y = xy - 2x^2 - 2y^2 + 4x^2y$.

If $xy - 2x^2 - 2y^2 + 4x^2y \geq 0$, then $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = |x - 2y - (y - 2x)| = |x - 2y - y + 2x| = |3x - 3y| = 3|x - y| = 40$. So, $|x - y| = \frac{40}{3}$.

If $xy - 2x^2 - 2y^2 + 4x^2y < 0$, then $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = |x - 2y + (y - 2x)| = |-x + 2y + y - 2x| = |-3x + 3y| = 3|x - y| = 40$. So, $|x - y| = \frac{40}{3}$.

In both cases, we have $|x - y| = \frac{40}{3}$. This equation is equivalent to $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$ or $x - y = -\frac{40}{3}$.

Step 2: Substitute $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$ or $x - y = -\frac{40}{3}$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.

Let's consider the case $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$. Solving for $y$ gives $y = x - \frac{40}{3}$. Substituting this into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ gives $5x^2 + 5\left(x - \frac{40}{3}\right)^2 - 8x\left(x - \frac{40}{3}\right)$.

Now, let's consider the case $x - y = -\frac{40}{3}$. Solving for $y$ gives $y = x + \frac{40}{3}$. Substituting this into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ gives $5x^2 + 5\left(x + \frac{40}{3}\right)^2 - 8x\left(x + \frac{40}{3}\right)$.

Step 3: Find the minimum value of the expression $5x^2 + 5\left(x - \frac{40}{3}\right)^2 - 8x\left(x - \frac{40}{3}\right)$ and $5x^2 + 5\left(x + \frac{40}{3}\right)^2 - 8x\left(x + \frac{40}{3}\right)$.

By completing the square or using calculus, we can find the minimum value of each expression. After some calculations, we find that the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5\left(x - \frac{40}{3}\right)^2 - 8x\left(x - \frac{40}{3}\right)$ is $-\frac{1600}{3}$, and the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5\left(x + \frac{40}{3}\right)^2 - 8x\left(x + \frac{40}{3}\right)$ is also $-\frac{1600}{3}$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $-\frac{1600}{3}$. The answer is: $\boxed{-\frac{1600}{3}}$

We will use the AM-GM inequality to solve this problem. The AM-GM inequality states that for any non-negative real numbers $a$ and $b$, we have $\frac{a+b}{2} \geq \sqrt{ab}$.

Step 1: We start by rewriting the given expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as follows:
\[5x^2+5y^2-8xy = \frac{1}{2}(5x^2+5y^2-8xy+5x^2+5y^2+8xy) = \frac{1}{2}(10x^2+10y^2) = 5(x^2+y^2).\]

Step 2: Next, we use the AM-GM inequality to find a lower bound for $x^2+y^2$. We have
\[x^2+y^2 \geq 2\sqrt{x^2y^2} = 2|xy|.\]

Step 3: Now, we use the given condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. By the triangle inequality, we have
\[|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |(x-2y) - (y-2x)| = |x-2y-y+2x| = |3x-3y| = 3|x-y| = 40.\]
Thus, we have $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$.

Step 4: We square both sides of the equation $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$ to get $(x-y)^2 = \left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2$. This simplifies to $x^2 - 2xy + y^2 = \frac{1600}{9}$. Rearranging terms, we get $x^2+y^2 = 2xy + \frac{1600}{9}$.

Step 5: Substituting this into the lower bound for $x^2+y^2$, we have $x^2+y^2 \geq 2xy + \frac{1600}{9}$. Multiplying both sides by 5, we get $5(x^2+y^2) \geq 10xy + \frac{8000}{9}$.

Step 6: Comparing this with the expression $5(x^2+y^2)$ from Step 1, we have $5(x^2+y^2) \geq 10xy + \frac{8000}{9} \implies 5(x^2+y^2) - 10xy \geq \frac{8000}{9}$.

Step 7: Since the left side of this inequality is the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we have found that the minimum value is $\frac{8000}{9}$.
The answer is: $\frac{8000}{9}$

To find the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.

The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states that for any real numbers $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$ and $b_1, b_2, ..., b_n$, we have
\[(a_1^2 + a_2^2 + ... + a_n^2)(b_1^2 + b_2^2 + ... + b_n^2) \geq (a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 + ... + a_nb_n)^2.\]

Let's set $a_1 = x - 2y$, $a_2 = y - 2x$, $b_1 = 1$, and $b_2 = 1$. Then we have
\[(a_1^2 + a_2^2)(b_1^2 + b_2^2) \geq (a_1b_1 + a_2b_2)^2.\]

Substituting the values of $a_1$, $a_2$, $b_1$, and $b_2$, we get
\[((x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2)(1^2 + 1^2) \geq ((x - 2y)(1) + (y - 2x)(1))^2.\]

Simplifying the left side gives
\[((x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2)(2) \geq ((x - 2y) + (y - 2x))^2.\]

Simplifying the right side gives
\[((x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2)(2) \geq (x - 2y + y - 2x)^2 = (-x + y)^2 = (y - x)^2.\]

Expanding both sides gives
\[2((x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2) \geq (y - x)^2.\]

Expanding the left side gives
\[2(x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2 + y^2 - 4xy + 4x^2) \geq (y - x)^2.\]

Simplifying the left side gives
\[2(5x^2 - 8xy + 5y^2) \geq (y - x)^2.\]

We are given that $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$, so by the triangle inequality, we have
\[|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| \geq |(x - 2y) - (y - 2x)| = |x - 2y - y + 2x| = |x - 3y + 2x| = |3x - 3y| = 3|x - y|.\]

Therefore, we have $3|x - y| = 40$, which implies $|x - y| = \frac{40}{3}$.

Substituting this into the inequality $2(5x^2 - 8xy + 5y^2) \geq (y - x)^2$, we get
\[2(5x^2 - 8xy + 5y^2) \geq \left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{1600}{9}.\]

Dividing both sides by 2 gives
\[5x^2 - 8xy + 5y^2 \geq \frac{800}{9}.\]

Thus, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is $\frac{800}{9}$.

The answer is: $\boxed{\frac{800}{9}}$

Approach:


To find the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ subject to the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states that for any real numbers $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$ and $b_1, b_2, ..., b_n$, we have
\[(a_1^2 + a_2^2 + ... + a_n^2)(b_1^2 + b_2^2 + ... + b_n^2) \geq (a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 + ... + a_nb_n)^2.\]
In this case, we can let $a_1 = x - 2y$, $a_2 = y - 2x$, $b_1 = 1$, and $b_2 = 1$. Then we have
\[((x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2)(1^2 + 1^2) \geq (x - 2y + y - 2x)^2.\]
Simplifying, we get
\[((x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2)(2) \geq (-x + y)^2.\]
Since $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$, we have $-x + y = 20$. Substituting this into the inequality, we get
\[((x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2)(2) \geq 400.\]
Now, let's express the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ in terms of $(x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2$. We have
\[5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy = 5((x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2) - 20xy.\]
We know that $-x + y = 20$, so $xy = \frac{1}{2}(-x + y)^2 = \frac{1}{2}(20)^2 = 200$. Substituting this into the expression, we get
\[5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5((x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2) - 20(200) = 5((x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2) - 4000.\]
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we know that $5((x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2) \geq 400$, so
\[5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5((x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2) - 4000 \geq 400 - 4000 = -3600.\]
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $-3600$. The answer is: $-3600$

To find the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ subject to the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states that for any real numbers $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$ and $b_1, b_2, ..., b_n$, we have

$$(a_1^2 + a_2^2 + ... + a_n^2)(b_1^2 + b_2^2 + ... + b_n^2) \geq (a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 + ... + a_nb_n)^2.$$

Let $a_1 = x - 2y$, $a_2 = y - 2x$, $b_1 = 1$, and $b_2 = 1$. Then we have

$$((x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2)(1^2 + 1^2) \geq (x - 2y + y - 2x)^2.$$

Simplifying, we get

$$((x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2)(2) \geq (-x + y)^2.$$

Simplifying further, we get

$$2((x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2) \geq (x - y)^2.$$

Expanding and simplifying, we get

$$2(x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2 + y^2 - 4xy + 4x^2) \geq x^2 - 2xy + y^2.$$

Simplifying, we get

$$2(5x^2 - 8xy + 5y^2) \geq x^2 - 2xy + y^2.$$

Expanding and simplifying, we get

$$10x^2 - 16xy + 10y^2 \geq x^2 - 2xy + y^2.$$

Simplifying further, we get

$$9x^2 - 14xy + 9y^2 \geq 0.$$

Now, let $A = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$. We want to minimize $A$ subject to the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. From the inequality above, we have

$$A = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy \geq \frac{1}{2}(9x^2 - 14xy + 9y^2) = \frac{1}{2}(3x - y)^2.$$

Since $(3x - y)^2$ is always non-negative, the minimum value of $A$ is 0, which occurs when $3x = y$.

Now, we need to find the specific values of $x$ and $y$ that satisfy the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. When $3x = y$, we have

$$|x - 2(3x)| + |3x - 2x| = 40.$$

Simplifying, we get

$$|-x - 6x| + |x| = 40.$$

Simplifying further, we get

$$|-7x| + |x| = 40.$$

This simplifies to

$$7|x| + |x| = 40.$$

Simplifying further, we get

$$8|x| = 40.$$

Dividing both sides by 8, we get

$$|x| = 5.$$

Since $3x = y$, we have

$$y = 15.$$

So, the specific values of $x$ and $y$ that minimize $A$ are $x = -5$ and $y = 15$. Substituting these values into $A$, we get

$$A = 5(-5)^2 + 5(15)^2 - 8(-5)(15) = 125 + 1125 + 600 = 1850.$$

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 1850. The answer is: $1850$
