Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. This gives us two lines: $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.

For $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us two more lines: $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.

For $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$. This gives us two vertical lines: $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.

For $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us two horizontal lines: $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$. The length of the rectangle is $16$ and the width is $16$, so the area of the rectangle is $16 \times 16 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. This means that the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square with side length 10: $(5,5), (-5,5), (-5,-5), (5,-5)$.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square with side length 16: $(8,8), (-8,8), (-8,-8), (8,-8)$.

The union of these two squares forms a larger square with side length 16 (the maximum of the side lengths of the two squares). Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the equation
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$
implies that either
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$$ or $$((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$

The first equation is satisfied if and only if both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$, which gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

The second equation is satisfied if and only if both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$, which gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersection of these lines form a square with side length $20$. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.
The answer is: $400$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if either of the two factors is zero.
The first factor is zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
These are the equations of two squares in the coordinate plane:
$\vert x + y \vert = 10$ is a square with vertices at $(10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, $(-10, 0)$, and $(0, -10)$.
$\vert x - y \vert = 10$ is a square with vertices at $(10, 0)$, $(0, -10)$, $(-10, 0)$, and $(0, 10)$.
The second factor is zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
These are the equations of two squares in the coordinate plane:
$\vert x \vert = 8$ is a square with vertices at $(8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, $(-8, 0)$, and $(0, -8)$.
$\vert y \vert = 8$ is a square with vertices at $(0, 8)$, $(8, 0)$, $(0, -8)$, and $(-8, 0)$.
The intersection of these four squares forms a square with side length 10, so the area of the convex polygon is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if either of the following conditions is true:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
For the first condition to be true, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we find that the points satisfying the first condition are $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, and $(-5,-5)$.
For the second condition to be true, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So the points satisfying the second condition are $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.
The convex polygon enclosed by these points is a square with side length 10. Therefore, the area of the polygon is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $A \cdot B = 0$ is equivalent to saying that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. So the given equation is equivalent to one of the following two equations:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0,$$
$$((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$
For the first equation to hold, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two lines in the plane: $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. These lines form a square with side length 10 and area $100$.
For the second equation to hold, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two lines in the plane: $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. These lines form a square with side length 16 and area $256$.
However, the points that satisfy both equations simultaneously are the vertices of the square formed by the lines $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon formed by these points is the area of the square with side length 10, which is $100$. The answer is: $100$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $AB=0$ implies that $A=0$ or $B=0$. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:
Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.
Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines also form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares, which is $100 + 256 = 356$. The answer is: $356$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if at least one of the factors is zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square with side length 10: $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, and $(-5,-5)$.
The expression $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square with side length 16: $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.
Therefore, the points that satisfy the given equation are the vertices of a larger square that includes the smaller square. The side length of the larger square is the distance between the points $(8,8)$ and $(-8,-8)$, which is $8\sqrt{2}$. The area of the larger square is $(8\sqrt{2})^2 = 128$. The area of the smaller square is $10^2 = 100$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points is $128 - 100 = 28$.
The answer is: 28

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is equal to zero if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This means that either $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The equations $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$ represent four lines in the coordinate plane.
The intersection points of these lines form a rectangle with side lengths 16 and 20.
The area of this rectangle is $16 \times 20 = 320$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 320 square units.
The answer is: $320$

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression equals zero if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
For the first two expressions to equal zero, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
For the last two expressions to equal zero, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
These conditions define a square with side length 16. The vertices of the square are $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.
To find the area of the square, we simply square the length of one of its sides. The side length is 16, so the area is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $\boxed{256}$

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ equals to zero if and only if at least one of the factors equals to zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.
The expression $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us four more lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.
The intersection of these lines form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$
