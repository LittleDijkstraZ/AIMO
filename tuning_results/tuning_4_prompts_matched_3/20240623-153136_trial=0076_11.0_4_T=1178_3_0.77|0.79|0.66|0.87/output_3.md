Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Approach:


The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied only when both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or when both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

This gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$ for the first part, and $x = 8$ and $y = 8$ for the second part.

The four lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$ form a square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$. The area of this square is $(10\sqrt{2})^2 = 200$.

The lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$ form a square with side length $16$. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

However, the area of the polygon formed by the intersection of these two squares is the area of the smaller square, which is $256 - 200 = 56$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 56.
The answer is: $56$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:



The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if either of the two factors is zero. This gives us two sets of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first set of equations, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$. This gives us the vertices of a square with side length 10 and vertices at $(8,0), (0,8), (-8,0), (0,-8)$.

For the second set of equations, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us the vertices of another square with side length 10 and vertices at $(0,8), (-8,0), (0,-8), (8,0)$.

The union of these two squares forms a larger square with side length 16 and area $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256.
The answer is: $256$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:

 The equation given in the problem, $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$, is a product of two expressions. The product of two factors is zero if and only if at least one of the factors is zero. Therefore, the equation is satisfied if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These equations represent two lines in the coordinate plane, and the intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These equations represent two pairs of parallel lines, each a distance of 8 units from the origin. The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

However, the problem asks for the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points that satisfy the given equation. The square with side length 10 is entirely contained within the square with side length 16, so the area of the convex polygon is the area of the 10x10 square, which is 100. The answer is: $100$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:


The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, -2)$, and $(-8, 2)$.

Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$.

The intersection of these two squares is another square with side length 6 (obtained by subtracting the distance of the vertices from the origin from 10). The area of this square is $6^2 = 36$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 36.
The answer is: $36$

Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:


The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, and $(-10, 0)$.

Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So the vertices of the polygon are also $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The polygon formed by these vertices is a square with side length $10$. The area of a square is given by the square of its side length, so the area of the polygon is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$

Approach:


The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These two equations represent two lines in the coordinate plane, and their intersection points form a square with side length 20. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.

The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which represent four lines in the coordinate plane, and their intersection points form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

However, the intersection of the two sets of points is the set of points that satisfy both equations. This intersection is the set of points that form the square with side length 20. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points is 400.
The answer is: $400$

Assistant:

Approach:


The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. We can analyze each case separately.

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
This equation implies that both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$.
So, $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.
Solving these equations, we get the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
This equation implies that both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.
So, $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
So, we get the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$ form a square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$. The lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$ form a square with side length 16.

The area of the convex polygon is the area of the larger square minus the area of the smaller square.
The area of the larger square is $(10\sqrt{2})^2 = 200$, and the area of the smaller square is $16^2 = 256$.
So, the area of the convex polygon is $200 - 256 = -56$.
However, the area cannot be negative, so there must have been a mistake in our calculations.

Let's reevaluate the problem.

The equation given is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
This equation is satisfied if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
This case gives the same lines as before: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
This case also gives the same lines as before: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

However, the original equation should be satisfied if either of these cases is true. This means that the intersection of the lines from both cases forms the polygon.

The intersection of the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$ with the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$ forms a square with side length 8.

The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 64.
The answer is: $64$

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, which means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. Let's consider these two cases separately.

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
For this to be true, both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ must be zero. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only way this can happen is if $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$. This gives us a square with side length 20.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
For this to be true, both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2$ must be zero. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us a square with side length 16.

Now, we need to find the intersection of the two cases. The intersection happens when $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$ and $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. The only points that satisfy both conditions are the four corners of the squares, i.e., $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

Therefore, the convex polygon is the intersection of the two squares, which is a smaller square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This is only possible when $x = y = 5$ or $x = -y = -5$. This gives us two points: $(5,5)$ and $(-5,-5)$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This is only possible when $x = 8$ or $x = -8$ and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. This gives us four points: $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

Now, we plot these points on a graph and connect them to form a square with side length $10$. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:



The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero, which means that either of the expressions must be zero for the entire equation to be zero. So we have two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first case, we have two absolute value expressions equaling a constant. This implies that $|x+y| = 10$ and $|x-y| = 10$. This forms a square with side length 10.

For the second case, we have two absolute value expressions equaling a constant. This implies that $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. This forms a square with side length 16.

The area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares. The area of a square is given by side length squared, so the area of the first square is $10^2 = 100$ and the area of the second square is $16^2 = 256$. The total area is $100 + 256 = 356$.

The answer is: $356$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:

 The equation $A \cdot B = 0$ implies that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the given equation is satisfied if either of the following two conditions holds:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first condition to be true, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$, which gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length 10.

For the second condition to be true, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length 16.

The area of the convex polygon formed by the intersection of these two squares is the area of the smaller square, which has side length 10. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $10^2 = 100$.

The answer is: $100$
