Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We have two absolute value expressions, $|x+y|$ and $|x-y|$, and two other absolute value expressions, $|x|$ and $|y|$. Each of these absolute value expressions equals to $10$ or $8$. Therefore, we have four possible cases:
   a) $x+y = 10$, $x-y = 10$, $x = 8$, $y = 8$.
   b) $x+y = -10$, $x-y = -10$, $x = 8$, $y = 8$.
   c) $x+y = 10$, $x-y = 10$, $x = -8$, $y = -8$.
   d) $x+y = -10$, $x-y = -10$, $x = -8$, $y = -8$.
2. Solving these four systems of equations, we find the four vertices of the polygon: $(0,0)$, $(16,0)$, $(0,16)$, and $(16,16)$.
3. To find the area of the polygon, we can use the formula for the area of a square: $A = side^2$. The side length of the square is $16$, so $A = 16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $256$.
The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The given equation is:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$
This equation is equal to zero if and only if either of the two factors is equal to zero. Therefore, we have two sets of equations:
1) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
2) $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From 1), we get $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$. This implies that $-10 \leq x + y \leq 10$ and $-8 \leq x \leq 8$.
From 2), we get $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $-10 \leq x - y \leq 10$ and $-8 \leq y \leq 8$.

The intersection of these four inequalities gives us the coordinates $(x, y)$ that satisfy the original equation. These coordinates form a square with side length 16.

The area of this square is therefore $16^2 = 256$. So the area of the convex polygon is 256.

To summarize, we have identified the equations and their solutions, then analyzed the intersection of the solutions to form a square, and finally calculated its area. The area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



We have the equation: $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$

The product of two terms is zero if and only if one of the terms is zero. Therefore, we have two cases:

1) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10$
2) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8$

And the same for the other term.

This gives us a total of 4 equations:

1) $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$
2) $x = 8$ or $x = -8$
3) $y = 10 - x$ or $y = -10 - x$
4) $y = 8$ or $y = -8$

Now we can plot these lines and find the vertices of the polygon.

The lines are:
1) $y = 10 - x$ and $y = -10 - x$
2) $x = 8$ and $x = -8$
3) $y = 8$ and $y = -8$

The vertices of the polygon are the intersections of these lines.

After plotting the lines, we find a square with side length 10.

The area of the square is $10^2 = 100$.

The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either of the expressions must be zero. That gives us two systems of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From the first system, we get $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$. This implies $-10 \leq x + y \leq 10$ and $-8 \leq x \leq 8$. Similarly, from the second system, we get $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies $-10 \leq x - y \leq 10$ and $-8 \leq y \leq 8$.

The intersection of these inequalities gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(8,0), (0,8), (-8,0), (0,-8), (8,16), (16,8), (-8,-16), (-16,-8)$.

To find the area of the polygon, we can use the Shoelace formula. The Shoelace formula states that if the vertices of a polygon are given by $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), \ldots, (x_n, y_n)$, then the area of the polygon is given by:

$$\frac{1}{2} \left| (x_1y_2 + x_2y_3 + \ldots + x_ny_1) - (y_1x_2 + y_2x_3 + \ldots + y_nx_1) \right|.$$

Applying the Shoelace formula to the vertices $(8,0), (0,8), (-8,0), (0,-8), (8,16), (16,8), (-8,-16), (-16,-8)$, we get:

$$\frac{1}{2} \left| (8 \cdot 8 + 0 \cdot (-8) + (-8) \cdot 0 + 0 \cdot 16 + 8 \cdot 8 + 16 \cdot (-8) + (-8) \cdot (-16) + (-16) \cdot (-8)) - (0 \cdot 0 + 8 \cdot 0 + 0 \cdot (-8) + 8 \cdot 16 + (-8) \cdot 8 + (-16) \cdot (-8) + 16 \cdot (-8) + (-8) \cdot 0) \right|.$$

Simplifying this expression, we get the area to be $256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



We are given an equation with absolute values and a product equals to zero. A product is zero if and only if at least one of its factors is zero. Therefore, we have two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first case, we have:
- $\vert x + y \vert = 10$
- $\vert x - y \vert = 10$

This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations, we get four points: $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0)$.

For the second case, we have:
- $\vert x \vert = 8$
- $\vert y \vert = 8$

This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these four equations, we get four more points: $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$.

So, the eight points $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0), (8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$ enclose a convex polygon.

Now, let's calculate its area. The polygon is a square with side length $10$, so its area is $10^2 = 100$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $100$.
The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.

Now let's denote $A = |x + y| - 10$, $B = |x - y| - 10$, $C = |x| - 8$, and $D = |y| - 8$. The equation can be rewritten as:

$$(A^2 + B^2)(C^2 + D^2) = 0.$$

This equation is satisfied if either $A^2 + B^2 = 0$ or $C^2 + D^2 = 0$.

For $A^2 + B^2 = 0$, we have $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$. This means that the distance between $(x, y)$ and $(-x, -y)$ is 20, and the distance between $(x, y)$ and $(x, -y)$ is 20. These are the conditions for a square.

For $C^2 + D^2 = 0$, we have $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. This means that the point $(x, y)$ is within a square with side length 16.

However, the second condition does not give us a valid polygon, so we only consider the first condition.

The square with side length 20 centered at the origin has vertices at $(10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, $(-10, 0)$, and $(0, -10)$. The side length of this square is 20, so the area is $20^2 = 400$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 400.

The result is a positive integer, so we can output it as:
$$\boxed{400}.$$
The answer is: $\boxed{400}$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



If the product of two numbers is zero, then at least one of the numbers must be zero. Therefore, the equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ must be true.

For the first equation, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, to be true, both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

For the second equation, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, to be true, both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 10. Therefore, the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$. The square is indeed a convex polygon. The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ can be true only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These conditions imply that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon: $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0)$.

2. Similarly, the expression $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ can be true only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. The vertices of the polygon are also $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$.

3. The convex polygon formed by these vertices is a square with side length $10$. The area of a square is given by the square of its side length, so the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

Now let's verify that the area is a positive integer:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Rational

def polygon_area():
    # Define the side length of the square
    side_length = 10

    # Calculate the area of the square
    area = side_length ** 2

    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 100

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
100
```
The area of the convex polygon is $100$, which is a positive integer. The answer is: $100$
