 This problem seems to be ill-posed or at least very difficult to solve directly using a Python program (not necessarily impossible, but it'd probably be a challenge to come up with a good implementation). The condition given is that the product of two expressions is equal to zero, which implies that each of these expressions must be zero.

For $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which implies that $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.

For $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies that $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.

For $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$, which implies that $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.

For $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

Solving these equations gives a set of vertices for the polygon: $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

The polygon is a square with side length 16. Its area is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256.
The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The given equation is equivalent to $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)( \vert x - y \vert - 10)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
For the product to be zero, at least one of the factors must be zero.
Setting each factor to zero, we get four equations:
1. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0 \implies \vert x + y \vert = 10$,
2. $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0 \implies \vert x - y \vert = 10$,
3. $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0 \implies \vert x \vert = 8$,
4. $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0 \implies \vert y \vert = 8$.

From the first two equations, we get four lines: $x + y = \pm 10$, $x - y = \pm 10$. From the last two equations, we get four more lines: $x = \pm 8$, $y = \pm 8$.
These eight lines form a square with side length 16.
The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: 256

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 This problem asks us to find the area of the region defined by the inequality
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]
The equation equals to zero if and only if both factors equal to zero.
The factor $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which are the equations of the four lines passing through the point $(8,8)$ with slopes $1$, $-1$, $1$, and $-1$.
The factor $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which are the equations of the four lines passing through the origin with slopes $1$, $-1$, $1$, and $-1$.
The intersection of these four lines forms a square with side length $16$, hence the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.
However, the points inside the square but outside the square formed by the lines $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ should be excluded.
By drawing the lines, we find that the area of the convex polygon formed by these points is the area of the square minus the area of the square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$, which is $(10\sqrt{2})^2 = 200$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $256 - 200 = 56$.
The answer is: $56$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 To solve this problem, we can first analyze the equation. The product of two factors is zero if and only if at least one of the factors is zero. So, we have two cases:

1. Either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. All the factors are zero.

For the first case, we get four equations:

1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$,
2. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$,
3. $\vert x \vert = 8$,
4. $\vert y \vert = 8$.

For the second case, all variables $x$ and $y$ must be equal to 8 or -8.

Now let's analyze each case:

1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ implies that either $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$. The four equations are the equations of two lines: $y = -x + 10$ and $y = -x - 10$.

2. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ implies either $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$, which gives the equations of the lines $y = x - 10$ and $y = x + 10$.

3. $\vert x \vert = 8$ implies either $x = 8$ or $x = -8$, which are the equations of the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.

4. $\vert y \vert = 8$ implies either $y = 8$ or $y = -8$, which are the equations of the lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

So, the boundary of the region is formed by the lines $x = \pm 8$, $y = \pm 8$, $y = x - 10$, $y = x + 10$, $y = -x - 10$, and $y = -x + 10$. This region is a square with side length 16, so its area is $16^2 = 256$.

The Python code to calculate the area of the square is:
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_square():
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = area_of_square()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$
