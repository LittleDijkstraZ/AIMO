Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The expression is equal to 0 if and only if both of the expressions are 0:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$$
$$(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$$

The first equation implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which are the equations of two lines parallel to the x-axis and y-axis, respectively, and 10 units away from the origin.

The second equation implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which are the equations of two lines parallel to the y-axis and x-axis, respectively, and 8 units away from the origin.

The intersection of these lines form a square with side length 16 units. So the area of the convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The problem asks for the area of a polygon formed by the points satisfying the given equation.
2. The equation is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
3. If the product of two numbers is zero, then at least one of the numbers must be zero. So either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
4. If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x = 0$ and $y = 0$.
5. If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $-8 \leq x \leq 8$ and $-8 \leq y \leq 8$.
6. Thus, the polygon is a square with side length $16$, so its area is $16^2 = 256$.

Let's verify that the area is a positive integer:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Rational, simplify

def polygon_area():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    # The side length of the square
    side_length = 16

    # Calculate the area
    area = side_length**2

    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is $256$. Since $256$ is a positive integer, we have successfully calculated the area of the polygon as per the given problem. The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ can only hold if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These imply that both $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$. Solving the first set of equations gives $x = 10$ and $y = 0$. Solving the second set gives $x = 0$ and $y = -10$. So the vertices of the polygon are $(10, 0)$ and $(0, -10)$.

Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ can only hold if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These imply that both $x = 8$ and $y = 8$ or $x = -8$ and $y = -8$. So the vertices of the polygon are also $(8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(8, -8)$.

Now we plot these points on the coordinate plane and connect them to form a square. The side length of the square is the distance between any two adjacent vertices, say $(10, 0)$ and $(0, -10)$. Using the distance formula, the side length is $\sqrt{(10 - 0)^2 + (0 - (-10))^2} = \sqrt{100 + 100} = \sqrt{200} = 10\sqrt{2}$. The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of this square is $(10\sqrt{2})^2 = 200$.

So the area of the polygon is 200 square units. The answer is: $\boxed{200}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation we are given is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

For this equation to be $0$, at least one of the two factors must be $0$. 

So, we have two conditions:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From condition 1, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
From condition 2, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

Taking the absolute value equations in their piecewise form, we can solve for the intersections and draw the lines.

From condition 1, we have four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.
From condition 2, we have four more lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

Plotting these lines, we see that they enclose a square with side length $20$.

The area of this square is $20 \times 20 = 400$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $400$. The answer is: $400$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is defined as: 
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$

If a product of terms equals zero, then at least one of the terms must be zero. Thus, we have two cases to consider:

1) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 \neq 0$
2) $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 \neq 0$

From case 1, we get $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = \pm 10$. Similarly, from case 2, we get $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x - y = \pm 10$. 

These four equations form the lines of the rectangle. The vertices of the rectangle are at $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$. The side lengths of the rectangle are $16$ and $20$, so its area is $16 \times 20 = 320$.

Now let's use Python to compute this area:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def rectangle_area():
    side1 = 16
    side2 = 20
    area = side1 * side2
    return area

result = rectangle_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 320

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
320
```
The area of the convex polygon is $320$. The result is a positive integer as required. The answer is $\boxed{320}$.

This is a math problem where the product of two functions equals zero. That means either the first function equals zero or the second function equals zero. This will split the points into two groups, each satisfying one of the functions equals to zero. Now, we have to find the area of those two geometric shapes separately.

The two functions in the problem are $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ on one hand, and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2$ on the other hand.

The function $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which gives two lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$. Similarly, the function $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which gives two lines $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$. The intersections of these lines form a rectangle with side length $20$.

The function $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x \vert = 8$, which gives two lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$. Similarly, the function $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives two lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$. The intersections of these lines form a square with side length $16$.

So the area of the rectangle is $20 \times 20 = 400$ and the area of the square is $16 \times 16 = 256$. The total area of the polygon is the sum of these two areas, which is $400 + 256 = 656$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $656$. The answer is: $656$.

We need to find the set of all points $(x, y)$ such that 
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]

This equation is equal to zero if either of the following two equations is true:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For equation 1 to be true, both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which imply $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these equations are lines in the plane.

For equation 2 to be true, both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which imply $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are two vertical lines and two horizontal lines, which form a rectangle.

The intersection of the solutions to equation 1 and equation 2 gives us the set of all points $(x, y)$ satisfying the original equation, which forms a rectangle with side length 16 (since $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ imply $-8 \leq x, y \leq 8$, and the maximum difference in $x$ or $y$ is $8 + 8 = 16$).

The area of a rectangle is given by the product of its side lengths, so the area of this rectangle is $16 \times 16 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon formed by the set of all points $(x, y)$ satisfying the original equation is 256. Since we are asked for a positive integer value, the result is indeed a positive integer: $\boxed{256}$.
The answer is: $256$
