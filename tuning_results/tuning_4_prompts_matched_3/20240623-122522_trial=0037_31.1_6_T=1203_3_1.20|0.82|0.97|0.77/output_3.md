Approach:



The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The first two equations describe squares in the coordinate plane, centered at the origin with side length $20$, and centered at the origin with side length $16$, respectively.

The intersection of these two squares is a square with side length $8$, since the smaller square is entirely contained within the larger square.

The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$. So, the area of the convex polygon is $64$.
The answer is: 64

Approach:


The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if either of the two factors is zero. 
If the first factor is zero, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These two equations represent the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length 10.
If the second factor is zero, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These two equations represent the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length 16.
The area of the first square is $10^2 = 100$ and the area of the second square is $16^2 = 256$. However, since the second square is completely contained within the first square, the area of the convex polygon formed by the intersection of the two squares is equal to the area of the first square, which is 100.
The answer is: $100$

Approach:

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

Let's consider the first term $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This can only be true if both $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$.

The second term $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ can only be true if both $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means the points are on a square with side length 16.

Therefore, the vertices of the polygon are the intersections of the two circles $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ with the square $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The square has side length 16, so its area is $16^2 = 256$.

The two circles intersect the square at the points $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$.

To find the area of the convex polygon, we need to subtract the area of the four right triangles formed by these points from the area of the square. The right triangles are isosceles with base and height of 8 units each, so their combined area is $2 * (1/2 * 8 * 8) = 64$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $256 - 64 = 192$. The answer is: $192$.

Approach:


The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if either of the two factors is zero. This gives us two sets of equations:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first set of equations, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$. This gives us the vertices of a square with side length 10, centered at $(0,0)$ and with vertices at $(8,0), (0,8), (-8,0), (0,-8)$.

For the second set of equations, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us the same square.

So, the points satisfying the equation form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$.

Approach:

 The equation given in the problem is equivalent to the product of two quadratic expressions being equal to zero. This means that either of the quadratic expressions must be zero for the product to be zero. We therefore have two sets of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For each set of equations, we solve for $x$ and $y$. The solutions are the vertices of the polygon. Then we can calculate the area of the polygon using the Shoelace formula.

Here's a Python script to solve this problem:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    # Vertices of the polygon
    vertices = [(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)]

    # Shoelace formula
    x, y = zip(*vertices)
    area = 0.5 * abs(sum([x[i] * y[i+1] - x[i+1] * y[i] for i in range(len(x))]) - sum([x[i] * y[i-1] - x[i-1] * y[i] for i in range(len(x))]))

    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS Traceback: line 11, in <listcomp>
    area = 0.5 * abs(sum([x[i] * y[i+1] - x[i+1] * y[i] for i in range(len(x))]) - sum([x[i] * y[i-1] - x[i-1] * y[i] for i in range(len(x))]))
IndexError: tuple index out of range

FAIL


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

IndexError: tuple index out of range

FAIL

```

The error in the above code is caused by the use of negative indices in the list `y`. We need to modify the code to handle this correctly.

Corrected Python Script:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    # Vertices of the polygon
    vertices = [(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)]

    # Shoelace formula
    x, y = zip(*vertices)
    area = 0.5 * abs(sum([x[i] * y[(i+1)%len(x)] - x[(i+1)%len(x)] * y[i] for i in range(len(x))]) - sum([x[i] * y[(i-1)%len(x)] - x[(i-1)%len(x)] * y[i] for i in range(len(x))]))

    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 0.0

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output

```
The area of the convex polygon is 0. However, this is not correct as the polygon is non-degenerate. There seems to be an error in the calculation of the area using the Shoelace formula. Let's re-examine the Shoelace formula:

The Shoelace formula states that the area of a polygon with vertices $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), ..., (x_n, y_n)$ is given by:

$$\frac{1}{2} |(x_1y_2 + x_2y_3 + ... + x_ny_1) - (y_1x_2 + y_2x_3 + ... + y_nx_1)|.$$

However, in our case, the polygon has vertices $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$. By inspection, we can see that the polygon is a square with side length 16. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256.
The answer is $\boxed{256}$.

Approach:


The equation given is a product of two expressions, and it equals to zero. This means that either the first expression equals to zero or the second expression equals to zero.

Let's set each expression to zero and solve for the possible values of $x$ and $y$.

For the first expression, we have:

$$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$$

This equation will be zero if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.

For the second expression, we have:

$$(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$$

This equation will be zero if both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$.
This implies $x + y = \pm 10$.

From $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
This implies $x - y = \pm 10$.

From $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$.
This implies $x = \pm 8$.

From $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert y \vert = 8$.
This implies $y = \pm 8$.

By solving these equations, we find that the points that satisfy the equations are $(8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

These points form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$

Approach:


The expression equals zero if either of the factors equals zero.
For the first factor to be zero, either $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x-y| - 10 = 0$, which gives us $|x+y| = 10$ or $|x-y| = 10$.
For the second factor to be zero, either $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$, which gives us $|x| = 8$ or $|y| = 8$.
The solutions to these equations are four lines: $x+y = \pm 10$, $x-y = \pm 10$, $x = \pm 8$, and $y = \pm 8$.
Plotting these lines on a coordinate plane, we can see that they form a square with side length 20. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 400.
The answer is: $400$

Approach:


The given equation is of the form $AB=0$, which implies either $A=0$ or $B=0$. 
The first term, $A=(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$, equals zero when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This results in a square with side length 10 and vertices at $(0, 0)$, $(0, 20)$, $(20, 0)$, and $(-20, 0)$.
The second term, $B=(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2$, equals zero when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This results in a square with side length 16 and vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(8, -8)$.
The intersection of these two squares forms a smaller square with side length 8 and vertices at $(4, 4)$, $(-4, 4)$, $(-4, -4)$, and $(4, -4)$.
The area of this smaller square is $8^2 = 64$. So the area of the convex polygon is 64 square units.
The answer is: 64

The equation is satisfied if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
For the first two cases, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that either $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$ and either $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the polygon: $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0)$.
For the last two cases, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that either $x = 8$ or $x = -8$ and either $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the polygon: $(8, 0), (-8, 0), (0, 8), (0, -8)$.
Now we can plot these eight points and connect them to form the convex polygon.
The polygon is a square with side length 10. The area of a square is given by side length squared, so the area of this polygon is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if either of the two factors is zero. This gives us two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This is possible only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only way this can happen is if $x = 0$ and $y = 0$. So, this case gives us a single point $(0, 0)$.

2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This is possible only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us a square with side length 16.

Therefore, the points satisfying the equation form a square with side length 16. The area of a square is given by the square of its side length. So, the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $\boxed{256}$

Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Approach:

 The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. This equation is equal to zero if and only if either of the two factors is zero. So we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
This can only be true if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. Solving these equations gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(10,0)$, $(-10,0)$, $(0,10)$, and $(0,-10)$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This can only be true if both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. Solving these equations gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with vertices at $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

The intersection of the regions defined by the two cases is the convex polygon whose area we want to find. This intersection is the square with vertices at $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$. The side length of this square is 16, so its area is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$.
