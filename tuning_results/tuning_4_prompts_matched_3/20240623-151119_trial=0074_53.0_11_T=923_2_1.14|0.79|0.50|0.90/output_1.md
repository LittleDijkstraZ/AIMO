Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we note that the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is equivalent to $|x-2y| = |2x-y|$.
Expanding the absolute value signs, we have two cases:
Case 1: $x - 2y = 2x - y \Rightarrow y = x$.
Case 2: $x - 2y = -(2x - y) \Rightarrow x - 2y = -2x + y \Rightarrow 3x = 3y \Rightarrow x = y$.
For both cases, we find that $x = y$.
Substituting $x = y$ into the given equation, we have $|x - 2x| + |x - 2x| = 40 \Rightarrow |-x| + |-x| = 40 \Rightarrow 2|x| = 40 \Rightarrow |x| = 20$.
So $x = \pm 20$ and $y = \pm 20$.
Now we substitute $x = y$ into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$, we get $5x^2 + 5x^2 - 8x^2 = 2x^2$.
Since $x = \pm 20$, the minimum value of $2x^2$ is achieved when $x = -20$, giving $2(-20)^2 = 800$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is 800. The answer is: $800$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We first note that the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is equivalent to $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$, which simplifies to $|x-2y| - |x-2y| = 40$, or simply $0 = 40$. This is a contradiction, so we must have made an error in our simplification.

Let's correct our mistake. The equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is equivalent to $|x-2y| + |-1(x-2y)| = 40$. The absolute value of a number and its negative are equal, so we can simplify this to $2|x-2y| = 40$. Dividing both sides by 2 gives $|x-2y| = 20$.

Now we substitute $u = x-2y$ and $v = y-2x$. Then we have $|u| = 20$ and $|v| = 20$. The value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ can be rewritten as $\frac{5}{2}((x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2)$. Substituting $u$ and $v$ gives $\frac{5}{2}(u^2 + v^2)$. We know that $u^2 = (x-2y)^2 = 20^2 = 400$ and $v^2 = (y-2x)^2 = (2y-x)^2 = 20^2 = 400$. Substituting these values gives $\frac{5}{2}(400 + 400) = \frac{5}{2}(800) = 2000$.

So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 2000. The answer is: $2000$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find the minimum value of the function $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ subject to the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$,
we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers.
Let $F(x,y,\lambda) = 5x^2+5y^2-8xy + \lambda (|x-2y| + |y-2x| - 40)$.
To find the critical points, we need to solve the system of equations $\frac{\partial F}{\partial x} = 0$, $\frac{\partial F}{\partial y} = 0$, and $\frac{\partial F}{\partial \lambda} = 0$.

However, finding the partial derivatives of $F(x,y,\lambda)$ with respect to $x$, $y$, and $\lambda$ and solving the resulting system of equations can be quite involved.

A simpler approach is to recognize that the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is equivalent to $x=2y$ or $y=2x$.
We can substitute these into the function $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ and find the minimum value for each case.

If $x=2y$, then $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(2y)^2 + 5y^2 - 8(2y)y = 20y^2 + 5y^2 - 16y^2 = 9y^2$.
If $y=2x$, then $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5x^2 + 5(2x)^2 - 8x(2x) = 5x^2 + 20x^2 - 16x^2 = 9x^2$.

In both cases, the function is of the form $9k^2$, where $k$ is either $x$ or $y$. Since the minimum value of $k^2$ is $0$, the minimum value of $9k^2$ is also $0$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ subject to the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $0$.
The answer is: $0$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We know that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, we have $|x-2y| + |y-2x| \ge |(x-2y) - (y-2x)| = |x-2y - y + 2x| = |x-3y+2x| = |3x-3y| = 3|x-y|$.
So, we have $3|x-y| = 40$, and thus $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$.
Now, let's consider the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite it as $(5x^2-8xy+5y^2) = (5x^2-10xy+5y^2) + (-2xy) = (5(x^2-2xy+y^2)) - 2xy = 5(x-y)^2 - 2xy$.
We know that $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$, so $(x-y)^2 = \left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{1600}{9}$.
We also know that $-2xy \ge -2|xy|$, and by the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, $|xy| \le \frac{(x^2+y^2)}{2}$, so $-2|xy| \le -2\frac{(x^2+y^2)}{2} = -x^2-y^2$.
Therefore, $5(x-y)^2 - 2xy \ge 5\left(\frac{1600}{9}\right) - (x^2+y^2) = \frac{8000}{9} - (x^2+y^2)$.
To minimize this expression, we need to minimize $x^2+y^2$. By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, $(x^2+y^2) \ge 0$, so the minimum value of $x^2+y^2$ is 0, when $x=0$ and $y=0$.
Substituting this into our expression, we have $\frac{8000}{9} - 0 = \frac{8000}{9}$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\frac{8000}{9}$. The answer is: $\boxed{\frac{8000}{9}}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we can simplify the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ by noticing that $|a-b| = |-(b-a)| = |b-a|$, so we can rewrite the equation as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$.
Now, we can use the property of absolute value that $|a| + |b| = |a+b|$ if and only if $ab \geq 0$.
In this case, we have $(x-2y) + (2y-x) = 40$, which simplifies to $0 = 40$. This is a contradiction, so we must have $(x-2y)(2y-x) \geq 0$.
Expanding, we get $(x-2y)(2y-x) = -x^2 + 4xy - 4y^2 \geq 0$, which simplifies to $x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2 \leq 0$.
Adding $8xy$ to both sides, we get $x^2 + 4y^2 \leq 8xy$.
Now, we want to minimize the value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite this expression as $5x^2 + 5y^2 - x^2 - 4y^2 = 4x^2 + y^2$.
Using the inequality $x^2 + 4y^2 \leq 8xy$, we can say that $4x^2 + y^2 \geq 4(8xy) = 32xy$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is achieved when $4x^2 + y^2 = 32xy$.
From this equation, we can solve for $y$ in terms of $x$: $y = \frac{4x}{3}$.
Substituting this into the expression $4x^2 + y^2$, we get $4x^2 + \left(\frac{4x}{3}\right)^2 = 4x^2 + \frac{16x^2}{9} = \frac{40x^2}{9}$.
To minimize this expression, we want to minimize $x^2$. Since $x$ and $y$ can range over all real numbers, we can take $x = 0$ to minimize $x^2$.
When $x = 0$, we have $y = 0$. Substituting these values into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get $5(0)^2 + 5(0)^2 - 8(0)(0) = 0$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0.
The answer is: $0$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $\frac{1}{2}((5x-4y)^2+(4y-5x)^2)$.
Then, let's consider the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, we know that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |(x-2y) - (y-2x)| = |x-y|$.
So, we have $|x-y| = 40$.
Now, let's consider the expression $(5x-4y)^2+(4y-5x)^2$.
By the difference of squares, we can rewrite this as $(5x-4y)^2 + (5x-4y)^2 = 2(5x-4y)^2 = 2((5x-4y)^2 + (4y-5x)^2)$.
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we know that $(5x-4y)^2 + (4y-5x)^2 \geq (|5x-4y| + |4y-5x|)^2 = (|x-y|)^2 = 40^2$.
So, we have $(5x-4y)^2 + (4y-5x)^2 \geq 2(40^2)$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\frac{1}{2}(2(40^2)) = 40^2 = 1600$.
The answer is: $1600$.

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To solve this problem, we need to use the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ and the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.
First, let's simplify the condition:
$|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$.
Using the property $|a| = |-a|$, we can rewrite this as:
$|x-2y| - |2y-x| = 40$.
Now, let's consider the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.
We can rewrite it as $(5x^2-8xy+4y^2) + (y^2-8xy+4x^2) = (5x^2-8xy+4y^2) - (2y^2-4xy+2x^2)$.
Using the identity $(a-b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2$, we can rewrite this as:
$(3x-2y)^2 + (x-y)^2$.
Now, we want to find the minimum value of this expression under the condition $|x-2y| - |2y-x| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, we know that $|a| - |b| \leq |a-b|$.
So, we have $|x-2y| - |2y-x| \leq |(x-2y) - (2y-x)| = 0$.
But we are given that $|x-2y| - |2y-x| = 40$, so we must have equality in the triangle inequality.
This means that $(x-2y)$ and $(2y-x)$ must have the same sign.
Without loss of generality, let's assume that $x-2y > 0$ and $2y-x > 0$.
Then we have $x-2y = 2y-x$, which implies $x = 2y$.
Substituting this into the condition, we get $|x-2y| - |2y-x| = |0| - |0| = 0$, which is not equal to 40.
So, our assumption that $x-2y > 0$ and $2y-x > 0$ must be wrong.
Instead, let's assume that $x-2y < 0$ and $2y-x < 0$.
Then we have $-(x-2y) = -(2y-x)$, which also implies $x = 2y$.
Substituting this into the condition, we get $|x-2y| - |2y-x| = |-3y| - |-3y| = 0$, which is not equal to 40.
So, our assumption that $x-2y < 0$ and $2y-x < 0$ must be wrong as well.
The only remaining possibility is that $x-2y > 0$ and $2y-x < 0$.
Then we have $x-2y = -(2y-x)$, which implies $x = 0$ and $y = 0$.
Substituting these values into the expression $(3x-2y)^2 + (x-y)^2$, we get $0 + 0 = 0$.
However, this is not the minimum value, as the expression is always nonnegative.
To find the minimum value, we need to consider the expression $(3x-2y)^2 + (x-y)^2$ under the condition $x = 2y$.
Substituting $x = 2y$ into the expression, we get $(3(2y)-2y)^2 + (2y-y)^2 = (4y)^2 + y^2 = 16y^2 + y^2 = 17y^2$.
Since $y^2$ is always nonnegative, the minimum value of $17y^2$ is 0, which occurs when $y = 0$.
Substituting $y = 0$ into $x = 2y$, we get $x = 0$.
Thus, the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 0.
The answer is: $0$
