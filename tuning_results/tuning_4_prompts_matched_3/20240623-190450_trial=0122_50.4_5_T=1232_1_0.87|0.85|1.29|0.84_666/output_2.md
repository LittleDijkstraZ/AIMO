Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation has four distinct solutions, so we need to find out for which values of $m$ the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly four distinct solutions.

First, we need to understand the graph of the function $y=\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. The graph is a V-shape with the vertex at $(1,2)$. The "bottom" of the V is a distance of 2 units from the x-axis, and the "left" and "right" arms extend 2 units away from the vertex.

Now, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have four distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to the "height" of the V (which is 2). Therefore, we have $\frac{m}{100}=2$, which gives $m=200$.

Now let's verify that this value of $m$ works. The equation becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{200}{100}=2$. This equation has four distinct solutions: $x=-1, 1, 3, 5$.

So, the only positive integer value of $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is $m=200$.

The answer is: $1$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. This means that the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be the value that splits the 4 branches of the absolute value function into two parts, each containing two solutions.

Let's denote $y = \vert x - 1 \vert$. Then the equation becomes $\vert y - 2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$. This equation will have 4 solutions if and only if $2 - \frac{m}{100} < 0$ and $\frac{m}{100} < 2$, which simplifies to $0 < m < 200$.

Now, let's find the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy this condition. Since $m$ is a positive integer and $0 < m < 200$, the number of such $m$ is $199$. However, we need to find the value of $m$ such that the equation has exactly 4 solutions.

To find this value, we need to consider the equation $\vert y - 2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$ again. This equation will have 4 solutions if and only if the distance between the two branches is exactly $\frac{m}{100}$. In other words, we need to find the value of $m$ such that $2 - \frac{m}{100} = \frac{m}{100} - 0$, which simplifies to $2 = \frac{2m}{100}$ and further simplifies to $m = 100$.

So, the value of $m$ that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions is $100$.

Since $100$ is a positive integer, we have found the value of $m$ that satisfies the condition. Now, let's output the result:

The number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $1$.

Therefore, the answer is $1$.
The answer is: $1$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. We want to find for how many positive integers $m$ this is true.

Let's denote $a = \frac{m}{100}$. Then we have the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=a$.

We know that the absolute value function $\vert x \vert$ splits into two cases: $x$ if $x \geq 0$ and $-x$ if $x < 0$. Therefore, we have four cases for the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=a$:

1. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 \geq 0$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \vert x-1 \vert - 2$. So the equation becomes $\vert x-1 \vert - 2 = a$, or $\vert x-1 \vert = a + 2$. This gives us two sub-cases:
   a) If $x-1 \geq 0$, then $\vert x-1 \vert = x - 1$. So the equation becomes $x - 1 = a + 2$, or $x = a + 3$.
   b) If $x-1 < 0$, then $\vert x-1 \vert = 1 - x$. So the equation becomes $1 - x = a + 2$, or $x = -a - 1$.
2. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = -( \vert x-1 \vert - 2) = 2 - \vert x-1 \vert$. So the equation becomes $2 - \vert x-1 \vert = a$, or $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - a$. This gives us two sub-cases:
   a) If $x-1 \geq 0$, then $\vert x-1 \vert = x - 1$. So the equation becomes $x - 1 = 2 - a$, or $x = a + 1$.
   b) If $x-1 < 0$, then $\vert x-1 \vert = 1 - x$. So the equation becomes $1 - x = 2 - a$, or $x = a - 1$.

So we have the four solutions $x = a + 3$, $x = -a - 1$, $x = a + 1$, and $x = a - 1$. For the equation to have $4$ distinct solutions, the ranges of $a$ for which two of these solutions are equal must not overlap with the ranges of $a$ for which the other two solutions are equal.

After some analysis, we find that the equation has $4$ distinct solutions when $1 < a < 2$. This means $a$ can be any number in the interval $(1, 2)$. Therefore, $m = 100a$ can be any number in the interval $(100, 200)$. The only positive integer in this interval is $101$. So there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions, and that is $m = 101$. The answer is: $1$.
The answer is: $1$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

The number of distinct solutions depends on the value of $\frac{m}{100}$, which must be equal to 2.

So, we have $\frac{m}{100}=2$, which implies $m=200$.

We need to check if this value of $m$ gives us 4 distinct solutions.

Using Python's sympy module, we can solve this problem as follows:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Eq, Abs, solveset, S

def count_distinct_solutions():
    x = symbols('x')
    m = 200

    # The equation
    equation = Eq(Abs(Abs(x - 1) - 2), m / 100)

    # Solve the equation
    solutions = solveset(equation, x, domain=S.Reals)

    # Count the number of distinct solutions
    num_solutions = len(solutions)

    return num_solutions

num_solutions = count_distinct_solutions()
print(num_solutions)
```

```
The number of distinct solutions for $m=200$ is 3, not 4.

Let's try a different value of $m$. We know that $\frac{m}{100}=2$ gives us $m=200$.

If we try a smaller value, say $m=100$, we get:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def count_distinct_solutions():
    x = symbols('x')
    m = 100

    # The equation
    equation = Eq(Abs(Abs(x - 1) - 2), m / 100)

    # Solve the equation
    solutions = solveset(equation, x, domain=S.Reals)

    # Count the number of distinct solutions
    num_solutions = len(solutions)

    return num_solutions

num_solutions = count_distinct_solutions()
print(num_solutions)
``````output

CODE RESULTS 4

INTERMEDIATE OUT :

4
```
The number of distinct solutions for $m=100$ is 4.

So, the value of $m$ that gives us 4 distinct solutions is $m=100$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 1, namely $m=100$.

Therefore, the answer is $1$.
The answer is: $1$
