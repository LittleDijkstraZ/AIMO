The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

This equation is satisfied only when both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, or when both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The first set of conditions simplifies to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, and the second set of conditions simplifies to $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The solutions to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ form a square with side length 10, while the solutions to $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ form a square with side length 16.

The area of the square formed by the solutions to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ is $10^2 = 100$.

The area of the square formed by the solutions to $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ is $16^2 = 256$.

The region that satisfies both conditions is the intersection of these two squares, which is also a square.

The side length of this square is the smaller side length of the two squares, which is 10. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon formed by the intersection of the two squares is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

This problem requires a deep understanding of absolute value function and its properties, especially when it comes to setting the expressions inside the absolute value to zero. The equation is also a product of two expressions that are being set to zero, which implies that either one or both of the expressions must be zero.

Let's break down the equations:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10 \Rightarrow x + y = \pm 10$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x - y \vert = 10 \Rightarrow x - y = \pm 10$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8 \Rightarrow x = \pm 8$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert y \vert = 8 \Rightarrow y = \pm 8$.

From equations 1 and 2, we can get the four lines $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. From equations 3 and 4, we can get the two lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

The eight lines form a square with side length 16.

The area of this square is the side length squared, which is $16^2 = 256$.

```python

    side_length = 16
    area = side_length**2

result = area_of_square()

This problem seems to be a bit beyond the scope of what we can reasonably cover with Python code. However, it is possible to solve this problem manually by understanding the properties of absolute value and the conditions that make a product of two expressions equal to zero.

The given equation is:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$

A product of two expressions is zero if and only if at least one of the expressions is zero. This means that either:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, or
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, or
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For each of these cases, we can solve for $x$ and $y$ to find the points that satisfy these conditions. The solutions are the vertices of the polygon.

Then, we can use a formula to calculate the area of the polygon based on the coordinates of its vertices.

But to solve this problem, it is more efficient to recognize that the polygon is actually a square, with side length of 16 units (since the absolute value expressions represent distances from the origin to a point, and the values set to zero represent distances of 10 or 8 units from the origin). The area of a square is simply the side length squared.

So the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$ square units. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units.

The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The given equation is equal to zero if either of the two terms in the product is equal to zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the rectangle.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square.

Combining these two sets of vertices, we find that the polygon is a rectangle with side lengths of 20 and 16. The area of a rectangle is given by the product of its side lengths, so the area of the polygon is $20 \times 16 = 320$. The answer is: $320$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The problem statement implies that the points $\left(x, y\right)$ that satisfy the equation
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0\]
form a convex polygon. This means that the area of this polygon is zero if either of the two factors is zero.

The first factor is zero when either $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. These conditions simplify to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, respectively. These are the equations of two lines in the plane, forming a rectangle with side lengths of 20 units in the x and y directions.

The second factor is zero when either $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. These conditions simplify to $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, respectively. These are the equations of two lines in the plane, forming a square with side length of 16 units.

The intersection of the two rectangles is the convex polygon formed by the points $\left(x, y\right)$ that satisfy the original equation. This intersection is the square with side length of 8 units.

The area of this square is then $8^2 = 64$ square units.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 64 square units. The answer is: $64$

 The given equation is $0$ if and only if at least one of the factors is $0$. Thus, we have four cases to consider:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
3. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
4. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For each case, we have:
1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$. Solving for $y$, we have $y = 10 - x$ or $y = -10 - x$. Also, $-8 \leq x \leq 8$. This gives us a square with side length $20$.
2. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. Similar to the first case, we have $y = 10 - x$ or $y = -10 - x$. Also, $-8 \leq y \leq 8$. This also gives us a square with side length $20$.
3. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$. Solving for $y$, we have $y = x - 10$ or $y = x + 10$. Also, $-8 \leq x \leq 8$. This gives us a square with side length $20$.
4. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. Similar to the third case, we have $y = x - 10$ or $y = x + 10$. Also, $-8 \leq y \leq 8$. This also gives us a square with side length $20$.

Since all four cases give us squares with side length $20$, the area of the convex polygon is $20^2 = 400$. The answer is: $400$

The equation $AB = 0$ is equivalent to $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0\]
or
\[((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]
The first equation implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which are equivalent to $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. These four equations represent the sides of a square with side length 20. The second equation implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which are equivalent to $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. These four equations represent the sides of a square with side length 16. Therefore, the points satisfying the given equation encloses a square with side length 20. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.
The answer is: $400$.

The expression is equal to zero if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

This means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

Solving these equations gives the following points on the coordinate plane:
$(8,0)$, $(0,8)$, $(-8,0)$, $(0,-8)$, $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

These points form a square with side length 16. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.
