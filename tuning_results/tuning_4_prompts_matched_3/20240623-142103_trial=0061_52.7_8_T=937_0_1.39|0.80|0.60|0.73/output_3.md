Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. 

The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. These four lines form a square with side length 20.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. These four lines form a square with side length 16.

Therefore, the convex polygon is a square with side length 20. The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of the square with side length 20 is $20^2 = 400$.
The answer is: $400$

 This problem involves a product of two expressions equaling zero. The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. This is the equation of a square with side length 20.
From $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This is the equation of a square with side length 20.
From $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert x \vert = 8$. This is the equation of a square with side length 16.
From $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert y \vert = 8$. This is the equation of a square with side length 16.

The points satisfying the original equation are the intersections of the squares. The intersection of the two squares with side length 20 is a square with side length 10. The intersection of the square with side length 16 and the square with side length 20 is a square with side length 8.

Therefore, the convex polygon enclosed by the points is a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

First, let's understand the problem. The given equation is a product of two expressions that are squared. The product is zero if either of the expressions is zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

Each of these equations implies that $|x+y| = 10$, $|x-y| = 10$, $|x| = 8$, or $|y| = 8$. 

These are the equations of 4 lines in the coordinate plane: $|x+y| = 10$, $|x-y| = 10$, $|x| = 8$, and $|y| = 8$. 

The points that satisfy any of these equations are the vertices of the convex polygon we are looking for. 

To find the area of the polygon, we can draw these lines and find the intersection points. Then, we can connect these intersection points to form the polygon. The area of the polygon can then be found using standard formulas for the areas of polygons.

Solving the absolute value equations gives us the vertices of the polygon:

For $|x+y| = 10$, we have $x+y = 10$ and $x+y = -10$, which gives us two lines. Their intersection points are $(-10, 20)$, $(10, -20)$, $(20, -10)$, and $(-20, 10)$.

For $|x-y| = 10$, we have $x-y = 10$ and $x-y = -10$, which gives us two more lines. Their intersection points are $(10, -10)$, $(-10, 10)$, $(20, 10)$, and $(-20, -10)$.

For $|x| = 8$, we have $x = 8$ and $x = -8$, which gives us two vertical lines. Their intersection points are $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$.

For $|y| = 8$, we have $y = 8$ and $y = -8$, which gives us two horizontal lines. Their intersection points are $(2, 8)$, $(-2, 8)$, $(-2, -8)$, and $(2, -8)$.

Connecting these points, we form a square with side length 20. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$. So, the area of the convex polygon is 400 square units.

The Python code to find the vertices and the area of the polygon is not necessary for solving this problem, as it is a logical and analytical problem. The calculations above give the final numerical answer:

The area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{400}$ square units. The answer is: $400$

The equation is satisfied only if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $|x + y| = 10$, $|x - y| = 10$, $|x| = 8$, and $|y| = 8$. These absolute value equations split into two cases for each equation:
- For $|x + y| = 10$, we have $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
- For $|x - y| = 10$, we have $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
- For $|x| = 8$, we have $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
- For $|y| = 8$, we have $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.
Combining all the cases, we have the following 16 points:
\[(8, 2), (8, -18), (-8, 2), (-8, -18), (2, 8), (-18, 8), (2, -8), (-18, -8).\]
These points form a square with side length 16. The area of the square is therefore $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$.

The given equation is a product of two quadratic expressions equal to zero. This equation will be zero if either of the expressions is zero. Thus, we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From the first case, we get $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. From the second case, we get $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The absolute value equations $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ represent four lines in the plane: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. The intersection points of these lines are $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, and $(-5,-5)$.

The absolute value equations $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ represent four lines in the plane: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. The intersection points of these lines are $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

The points satisfying both sets of equations are the intersection points of the lines. These points are the vertices of the polygon: $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, $(-5,-5)$, $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

To find the area of the polygon, we can divide it into four right triangles. The vertices of the triangles are: $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, and $(8,8)$; $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, and $(8,-8)$; $(-5,5)$, $(-5,-5)$, and $(-8,8)$; and $(-5,5)$, $(-5,-5)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

The area of each triangle is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot base \cdot height = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 3 \cdot 3 = 4.5$. Since there are four triangles, the total area of the polygon is $4 \cdot 4.5 = 18$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 18 square units. The answer is: 18

 The given equation is a product of two terms, and the product is equal to zero if and only if at least one of the terms is zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that the points lie on the lines $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.

For the second case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that the points lie on the lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

The four lines form a rectangle with side lengths 16 and 20. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $16 \times 20 = 320$. The answer is: $320$

 The expression $AB=0$ is equivalent to $A=0$ or $B=0$. So the given equation is equivalent to the union of the following two equations:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
The second equation gives $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This forms a square with side length 16, so its area is $16^2 = 256$.
The first equation gives $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This forms a rhombus with diagonals of length 20 (from $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$), so its area is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot 20 \cdot 20 = 200$.
The area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the square and the rhombus, which is $256 + 200 = 456$. The answer is: 456

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The equation given is: $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
This equation equals zero if either of the two factors equal zero. 
For the first factor to be zero, either $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$.
For the second factor to be zero, either $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.
Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon:
- For $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$, we have $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
- For $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, we have $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
- For $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$, we have $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
- For $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, we have $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

Combining these solutions, we find the vertices of the polygon to be:
- $(8, 2)$, $(8, -18)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, -18)$ from $x + y = 10$, $x - y = 10$, $x = 8$, $y = 8$.
- $(8, 18)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 18)$, $(-8, -2)$ from $x + y = -10$, $x - y = -10$, $x = -8$, $y = -8$.

The polygon formed by these vertices is a square with side length 20. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$. The answer is: $\boxed{400}$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given equation and understand its implications for the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy it. The equation is:
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]
For this equation to be true, either of the two terms inside the product must be zero.

The first term, $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, is zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that both $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these two equations simultaneously, we get the points $(x, y)$ as $(\pm 10, 0)$, $(0, \pm 10)$, $(\pm 5, \pm 5)$.

The second term, $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$, is zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that both $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these two equations simultaneously, we get the points $(x, y)$ as $(\pm 8, 0)$, $(0, \pm 8)$.

So, the points that satisfy the equation are the vertices of a square with side length $10$. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points that satisfy the given equation is $100$. The answer is: $100$

 The given equation is $0$, which means either the first term is $0$ or the second term is $0$. 

If either $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x - y| - 10 = 0$, then $|x+y| = 10$ or $|x - y| = 10$. This implies that the points $(x, y)$ lie on a square with side length $20$.

If either $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$, then $|x| = 8$ or $|y| = 8$. This implies that the points $(x, y)$ lie inside a square with side length $16$.

The intersection of these two conditions is the square with side length $16$, which is the convex polygon that the points $(x, y)$ enclose. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

 The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.
