Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's consider the equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This equation can only be equal to 0 if both terms inside the absolute value are 0. So we have:
\[\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0 \implies \vert x + y \vert = 10 \implies x + y = \pm 10,\]
and
\[\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0 \implies \vert x - y \vert = 10 \implies x - y = \pm 10.\]
These four equations represent the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which are the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$.

Plotting these lines on the coordinate plane, we find that they form a square with side length 20. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.
The answer is: $400$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we can see that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So, the equation
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0\]
implies that either
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0\]
or
\[((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]
If $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$, then both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
The solutions to these equations are the lines $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.
If $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$, then both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The solutions to these equations are the lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
Therefore, the points satisfying the equation form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So, the area of the convex polygon is 256.
The answer is: 256

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The given equation is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
This equation is equal to zero if either of the factors is equal to zero.

The first factor is equal to zero when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
These are the equations of a square with side length 10.

The second factor is equal to zero when $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
These are the equations of a square with side length 16.

The intersection of these two squares forms a smaller square with side length 8.

To find the area of this convex polygon, we simply calculate the area of the smaller square. The area of a square is given by the side length squared, so the area of this square is $8^2 = 64$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 64 square units. The answer is: $64$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The expression equals zero if either of the factors equals zero. So we have two cases:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The absolute value equations give us four equations: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These equations describe a square with side length 10 and vertices at $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,-5)$, and $(-5,5)$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us four equations: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These equations describe a square with side length 16 and vertices at $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,-8)$, and $(-8,8)$.

The intersection of the two squares is a smaller square with side length 10 and area $10^2 = 100$. Thus, the area of the convex polygon is 100.
The answer is: $100$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation is equal to 0 if either of the factors is equal to 0.
So, we have two cases:
Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
For this case to be true, both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, so $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations, we get the points: $(5, 5), (5, -5), (-5, 5),$ and $(-5, -5)$. These four points form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.
Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
For this case to be true, both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, so $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So, we have four more points: $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8),$ and $(-8, -8)$. These four points also form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
Therefore, the total area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares, which is $100 + 256 = 356$.
The value of the area of the convex polygon is 356. The answer is: $356$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



To solve this problem, we need to find the area of the convex polygon that is enclosed by the points satisfying the given equation.

First, we need to understand the given equation:

$((|x + y| - 10)^2 + (|x - y| - 10)^2)((|x| - 8)^2 + (|y| - 8)^2) = 0$

The equation equals zero if either of the two factors equals zero. This gives us two sets of conditions:

1. $(|x + y| - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(|x| - 8)^2 + (|y| - 8)^2 \neq 0$.
2. $(|x - y| - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(|x| - 8)^2 + (|y| - 8)^2 \neq 0$.

For the first set of conditions, $|x + y| = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$. These are the equations of two lines.

For the second set of conditions, $|x - y| = 10$, which means $x - y = \pm 10$. These are also the equations of two lines.

And $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$ give us four lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

The intersection of these lines form a square with side length 10 (from $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$), and another square inside it with side length 8 (from $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$).

The area of the larger square is $10^2 = 100$, and the area of the smaller square is $8^2 = 64$.

So the area of the convex polygon is the difference of the areas of the two squares, which is $100 - 64 = 36$. The answer is: $36$

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ can only be true if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these two equations, we get the four points $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, and $(-5,-5)$.

Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ can only be true if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So we get the four points $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

The eight points form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. So the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units.
The answer is: $100$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, we have two separate cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
In this case, both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. Solving these equations, we get the four lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(0, 10)$, $(10, 0)$, $(0, -10)$, and $(-10, 0)$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
In this case, both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. Solving these equations, we get the four lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(8, -8)$.

The intersection of the regions defined by these cases is the convex polygon whose area we are asked to find. This polygon is a square with side length 10, because the vertices of the square defined by Case 2 lie on the lines defined by Case 1. The area of this square is side length squared, so the area is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression equals zero if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The first two equations are satisfied if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$.
The last two equations are satisfied if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

The eight points are then $(\pm 10, \pm 10)$ and $(\pm 8, \pm 8)$. These points form a square with side length 20, so its area is $20^2 = 400$.
The answer is: $400$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $A \cdot B = 0$ implies that either $A=0$ or $B=0$. So, the given equation is equivalent to the system of equations:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From equation (1), we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 2), (8, -2), (-8, 2), (-8, -2)$.

From equation (2), we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$.

Combining the two sets of vertices, we see that the convex polygon is a $8 \times 8$ square. The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$.
The answer is: $64$

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the equation
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$
implies that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. These four lines form a square with side length 20.
If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. These four lines form a square with side length 16.
The convex polygon enclosed by the points is the union of these two squares, so its area is the sum of the areas of the two squares. The area of a square is the side length squared, so the area of the larger square is $20^2 = 400$ and the area of the smaller square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $400 + 256 = 656$. The answer is: $656$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $ab=0$ is true if and only if either $a=0$ or $b=0$. So, the given equation is satisfied if either $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)=0$ or $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)=0$.
If $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)=0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get that the points satisfying this condition are $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, and $(-5,-5)$.
If $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)=0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations, we get that the points satisfying this condition are $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.
The points $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, $(-5,-5)$, $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$ enclose a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$
