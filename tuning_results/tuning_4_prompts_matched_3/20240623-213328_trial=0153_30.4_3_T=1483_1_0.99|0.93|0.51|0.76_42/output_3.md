Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation involves absolute value, so we need to split the absolute value into cases:
- If $x \ge 0$, $|x| = x$.
- If $x < 0$, $|x| = -x$.

So we have four cases to consider for each absolute value:
1. $(x + y - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(x - y - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(x + y - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(-(x - y) - 10)^2 = 0$.
3. $(-(x + y) - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(x - y - 10)^2 = 0$.
4. $(-(x + y) - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(-(x - y) - 10)^2 = 0$.

Each of these cases corresponds to a line in the coordinate plane. The intersection of these lines form a square with side length 20. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.

Now, we calculate the area of the square and verify it's a positive integer:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Rational, simplify

def calculate_area():
    # Side length of the square
    side_length = 20

    # Area of the square
    area = side_length**2

    return area

result = calculate_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 400

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
400
```

The area of the convex polygon is $400$. Since $400$ is a positive integer, the calculation is correct. The answer is: $\boxed{400}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ is true only when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$.

Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ is true only when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

Thus, the solution set of the system of equations is the four points $(8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

These points form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $256$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Rational, simplify

def area_of_polygon():
    # Side length of the square
    side_length = 16

    # Area of the square
    area = side_length**2

    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is given as:

$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$

From this equation, we can infer that either the first part of the equation is zero or the second part of the equation is zero. This means either:

$$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad (\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$$

From the first equation, we can see that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$. These lines intersect at $(5, 5)$, forming a square with side length $10$ units. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$ square units.

From the second equation, we can see that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$. These lines form a square with side length $16$ units. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$ square units.

Since the points that satisfy the original equation are those that satisfy either of the conditions, the points that satisfy the equation are those that lie within the smaller square with side length $10$ units. Thus, the area of the convex polygon is $10^2 = 100$ square units.

The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



This problem asks to find the area of the polygon defined by the points that satisfy the given equation. The equation is a product of two other equations, and the product is zero if and only if at least one of the equations is zero. This means that the points that satisfy the given equation are exactly the points that satisfy either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

By solving these equations, we find the vertices of the polygon: $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, $(-8,-8)$, $(10,0)$, $(-10,0)$, $(0,10)$, $(0,-10)$.

The polygon is a square with side length 16 (the distance between $(8,8)$ and $(8,-8)$ or between $(8,8)$ and $(10,0)$), so its area is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$.
The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The expression $AB=0$ is equivalent to $A=0$ or $B=0$. Thus the given equation is equivalent to the union of two equations:
   $$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0,$$
   $$(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0,$$
   $$(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0,$$
   $$(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0.$$

2. Each of these equations has solutions only when the absolute values are zero, i.e., when $x+y=0$, $x-y=0$, $x=-8$, or $y=-8$.

3. The first two equations have solutions $x=-y$ and $x=y$, respectively. The last two equations have solutions $x=-8$ and $y=-8$.

4. The intersection of these solutions gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(-8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, and $(8,8)$.

5. The polygon is a square with side length 16. To find its area, we square the side length: $16^2 = 256$.

The area of the convex polygon is $256$. Since we are asked for a positive integer value, we can conclude that the area of the polygon is $256$. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{256}$.
