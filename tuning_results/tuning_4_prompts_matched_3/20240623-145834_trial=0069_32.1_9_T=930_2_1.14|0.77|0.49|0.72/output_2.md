Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. This means that the right-hand side $\frac{m}{100}$ must be a value that splits the graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ into 4 segments.
The graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ consists of 3 segments: a segment that goes from 0 to 2, a segment that goes from 2 to 4, and a segment that goes from 4 to infinity.
To have 4 distinct solutions, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be a value that falls into the gap between the first two segments, which is from 2 to 4.
This means $2 < \frac{m}{100} < 4$, or equivalently, $200 < m < 400$.
The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from 201 to 399, inclusive.
To find the number of these integers, we subtract the smallest integer from the largest integer and add 1: $399 - 201 + 1 = 199$.
Therefore, there are 199 positive integers $m$ that satisfy the given condition. The answer is: $199$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, let's understand the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.

This equation has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is between 1 and 2. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a "V" shape with the "valleys" at 1 and 3, and the height of the "walls" is 2. Therefore, the equation has 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is between 1 and 2, or equivalently, when $1 \leq \frac{m}{100} < 2$.

Multiplying through by 100, we get $100 \leq m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from 100 to 199, inclusive. To find the number of these integers, we subtract the smallest integer from the largest and add 1: $199 - 100 + 1 = 100$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 100. The answer is: $100$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}=2$.
Solving the equation $\frac{m}{100}=2$ gives $m=200$.
Therefore, the value of $m$ is 200.
The value of $m$ is 200.
The answer is: $1$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $2$. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ oscillates between $1$ and $2$ as $x$ varies over the real numbers.

So we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$.

Multiplying all parts of the inequality by $100$ gives $100 < m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from $101$ to $199$, inclusive.

To find the number of these integers, we subtract the smallest integer in the range from the largest, and then add $1$ (because both ends are inclusive). So the number of such integers is $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$.
The answer is: $99$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}=2$. This is because the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, will be equal to $2$ or $-2$ for 4 distinct values of $x$. 

To find the value of $m$, we solve the equation $\frac{m}{100}=2$. Multiplying both sides by 100 gives $m=200$.

Therefore, the value of $m$ that makes the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have 4 distinct solutions is 200.

The answer is: $1$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.
This means that the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, must take on two positive values and two negative values for the given equation to have 4 distinct solutions.
Let's consider the equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$.
If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, then $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.
For this equation to have two positive values, we must have $2 + \frac{m}{100} > 0$, which implies $m > -200$.
Similarly, if $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$, then $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
For this equation to have two negative values, we must have $2 - \frac{m}{100} < 0$, which implies $m < 200$.
Combining these inequalities, we have $-200 < m < 200$.
The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the positive integers from 1 to 199.
Therefore, there are 199 positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. The answer is: $199$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.
The right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, is a positive value.
The number of solutions of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=k$ (where $k$ is a positive number) depends on the value of $k$.
If $k < 1$, there are no solutions.
If $k = 1$, there is one solution.
If $1 \leq k < 2$, there are two solutions.
If $k = 2$, there are three solutions.
If $k > 2$, there are four solutions.
So, in order for the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ to have $4$ distinct solutions, we need $\frac{m}{100} = 2$.
Solving this equation gives $m = 200$.
Therefore, the only positive integer value of $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $m = 200$.
The answer is: $1$
