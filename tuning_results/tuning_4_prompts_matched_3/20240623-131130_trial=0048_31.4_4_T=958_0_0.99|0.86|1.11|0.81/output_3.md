 The given equation is equal to zero if and only if both of its factors are equal to zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
For the first factor to be zero, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we find that the points satisfying this condition are $(5, 5), (5, -5), (-5, 5),$ and $(-5, -5)$.
For the second factor to be zero, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations, we find that the points satisfying this condition are $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8),$ and $(-8, -8)$.
The convex polygon enclosed by these points is a square with side length 10. Therefore, the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:


The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero, or the second expression is zero, or both are zero. 

For the first expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, it can only be zero if both terms are zero, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

For the second expression $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, it can only be zero if both terms are zero, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So we have the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The points that satisfy both conditions are the intersections of these lines. The intersections form a square with side length $20$ (the distance between the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$, or the distance between the lines $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$). 

The area of a square is the side length squared, so the area of this square is $20^2 = 400$. The answer is: $400$.

Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The equation is satisfied if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The first two equations are satisfied if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
These are the equations of the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.
The last two equations are satisfied if $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
These are the equations of the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.
The intersection points of these lines are $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$.
The polygon formed by these points is a square with side length 8.
Therefore, the area of the polygon is $8^2 = 64$. The answer is: $64$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
This equation is equal to zero if either of the factors is equal to zero.
The first factor is zero if $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$.
This means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
The second factor is zero if $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.
This means $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
Solving these equations, we get the following vertices for the polygon:
$(8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, $(-8, 0)$, $(0, -8)$.
These points form a square with side length $16$.
The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
So the area of the convex polygon is $256$.
The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The expression $A \cdot B = 0$ is true if either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the given equation is satisfied if either of the following two conditions is true:
1. $(|x + y| - 10)^2 + (|x - y| - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(|x| - 8)^2 + (|y| - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first condition to be true, both $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x - y| - 10 = 0$, which implies $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$. This means that the points must lie on the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(0, 10)$, $(10, 0)$, $(0, -10)$, and $(-10, 0)$.

For the second condition to be true, both $|x| - 8 = 0$ and $|y| - 8 = 0$, which implies $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. This means that the points must lie on the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The intersection of the two sets of points is the square with vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$. The side length of this square is 16, so its area is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is equal to zero when either of the factors is zero.
The factors are: $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$ and $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$.
For the first factor to be zero, both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length 10.
For the second factor to be zero, both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$ or $y = 8$ and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length 16.
The area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares.
The area of the first square is $10^2 = 100$ and the area of the second square is $16^2 = 256$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $100 + 256 = 356$. The answer is: $356$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The equation given is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. For the product of two numbers to be zero, either one of them must be zero. Therefore, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations, we get the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The points that satisfy either of these conditions form a square with side length 20. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.
The answer is: $400$

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. Therefore, either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

The first term is zero when $|\pm x \pm y| - 10 = 0$, which simplifies to $|\pm x \pm y| = 10$. The four equations this can represent are:
1. $x + y = 10$
2. $x + y = -10$
3. $x - y = 10$
4. $x - y = -10$

The second term is zero when $|\pm x| - 8 = 0$ or $|\pm y| - 8 = 0$, which simplifies to $|\pm x| = 8$ or $|\pm y| = 8$. The four equations this can represent are:
5. $x = 8$
6. $x = -8$
7. $y = 8$
8. $y = -8$

The intersection points of these lines are:
$(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(2, 8)$, $(-2, 8)$, $(2, -8)$, $(-2, -8)$.

These points form a square with side length 8$\sqrt{2}$. The area of this square is $(8\sqrt{2})^2 = 128$. So, the area of the convex polygon is 128.

The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The first term being zero means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0)$.

The second term being zero means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$.

So the vertices of the polygon are $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0), (8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$. These vertices form a square with side length 10.

The area of a square is given by the square of its side length, so the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

 The equation is satisfied only when both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The first pair of equations implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only way for both of these equations to be true is if $x = 0$ and $y = 10$ or $x = 10$ and $y = 0$. This is the vertex set of a square with side length 10.

The second pair of equations implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The only way for both of these equations to be true is if $-8 \le x \le 8$ and $-8 \le y \le 8$. This forms a square of side length 16.

The intersection of the two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for. The side length of the convex polygon is the smaller of the two squares, which is 10. The area of the square is side length squared, so the area of the convex polygon is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so one or both of the expressions must be zero.
The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, and the second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$.

For the first expression to be zero, both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ must be zero. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. Solving these equations gives the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ as well as their reflections across the coordinate axes.

For the second expression to be zero, both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2$ must be zero. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. Solving these equations gives the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$ as well as their reflections across the coordinate axes.

The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256.
