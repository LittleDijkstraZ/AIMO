Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:


First, let's analyze the problem. The equation is equal to zero if and only if both factors are zero. This gives us two systems of absolute value equations:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first system, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$, which implies that $-10 \leq x + y \leq 10$ and $-8 \leq x \leq 8$. Similarly, for the second system, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that $-10 \leq x - y \leq 10$ and $-8 \leq y \leq 8$.

These inequalities define a rectangle with side lengths of 20 and 16. The area of this rectangle is $20 \times 16 = 320$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 320.

Here is the Python code to calculate the area:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    side_length_1 = 20
    side_length_2 = 16
    area = side_length_1 * side_length_2
    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 320

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
320
```
The area of the convex polygon is 320. The answer is: $320$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Step 1: Observe that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Thus, the given equation is equivalent to the system of equations:
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0,\]
\[((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]

Step 2: The second equation implies that both $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. The four points are $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

Step 3: For the first equation, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that both $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the four points $(5, 5)$, $(5, -5)$, $(-5, 5)$, and $(-5, -5)$.

Step 4: The eight points form a square with side length 10. Therefore, the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The given equation is equal to zero if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
From the first two equations, we get $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
From the last two equations, we get $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

From $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, we get $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.
From $\vert x \vert = 8$, we get $x = \pm 8$.
From $\vert y \vert = 8$, we get $y = \pm 8$.

Solving these equations, we find the following points:
$(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, $(-8,-8)$, $(0,10)$, $(0,-10)$, $(10,0)$, $(-10,0)$.

Plotting these points on a coordinate plane, we see that they form a square with side length 16.
The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
So, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



We have a system of equations where the product of two expressions equals to zero. Therefore, either the first expression equals to zero, or the second one equals to zero.

Let's analyze each case:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10 \Rightarrow x + y = \pm 10$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x - y \vert = 10 \Rightarrow x - y = \pm 10$
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8 \Rightarrow x = \pm 8$
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert y \vert = 8 \Rightarrow y = \pm 8$

These four equations represent the lines in the coordinate plane. The intersection points of these lines are the vertices of the polygon.

To find the vertices, we can solve the systems of equations formed by the pairs of equations:

1. $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$
2. $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$
3. $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$
4. $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$
5. $x = 8$ and $y = 8$
6. $x = 8$ and $y = -8$
7. $x = -8$ and $y = 8$
8. $x = -8$ and $y = -8$

By solving these systems of equations, we find the vertices of the polygon:

1. $(10, 0)$
2. $(0, 10)$
3. $(-10, 0)$
4. $(0, -10)$
5. $(8, 8)$
6. $(8, -8)$
7. $(-8, 8)$
8. $(-8, -8)$

These vertices form a square with side length 20. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 400. The answer is: $400$

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The condition $A \cdot B = 0$ implies that $A=0$ or $B=0$. Thus the given equation implies
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0\]
or
\[((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]
In the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
This implies that $x+y = \pm 10$ and $x-y = \pm 10$. Solving this system of equations gives the vertices of the square as $(0,10),(10,0),(-10,0),(0,-10)$.
In the second case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives the vertices $(8,8),(-8,8),(8,-8),(-8,-8)$.
Therefore, the points $\left(x, y\right)$ that satisfy the equation enclose a square with side length $20$.
The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.
The answer is: $400$.

2. If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = \pm 10$. Similarly, we can find the other three conditions lead to $x - y = \pm 10$, $x = \pm 8$, and $y = \pm 8$.
3. These equations represent the equations of lines in the coordinate plane. By plotting these lines, we can find the vertices of the polygon.
4. To find the area of the polygon, we can use the shoelace formula. The vertices of the polygon are: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, $(10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(0, -10)$.
5. Applying the shoelace formula to these vertices, we can find the area of the polygon.

```python

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The expression $ ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) $ equals zero if and only if at least one of the following conditions is true:

1. $ (\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 $ or $ (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 $
2. $ (\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 $ or $ (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 $

Each of these conditions implies that $|x+y|=10$, $|x-y|=10$, $|x|=8$, or $|y|=8$. These conditions are the equations of four lines in the $xy$-plane, forming a rectangle with side lengths of 16 and 20.

To find the area of the rectangle, we simply multiply the side lengths: $16 \times 20 = 320$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 320 square units. The correct numerical answer is 320.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, we see that the product of two expressions is zero, which means that each of these expressions must be zero:
$$ ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0 $$
$$ ((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0 $$

From the first equation, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. 
This means that either $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$, and either $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
Solving these four systems of equations, we find the following vertices of the polygon:
$(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$.

From the second equation, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
This means that either $x = 8$ or $x = -8$, and either $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

Now we plot these points on a coordinate plane and connect them with line segments to form a square. The side length of the square is $8 - (-8) = 16$, so the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units.

The final answer is: $256$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The given equation is of the form $AB=0$. This implies that either $A=0$ or $B=0$. So, the given equation is equivalent to the union of two sets of points:

a) $(|x+y| - 10)^2 = 0$ or $|x+y| = 10$. This gives us a square with side length $20$.

b) $(|x-y| - 10)^2 = 0$ or $|x-y| = 10$. This also gives us a square with side length $20$.

2. The other part of the equation is $(|x| - 8)^2 = 0$ or $|x| = 8$. This gives us two vertical lines at $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.

3. And the other part of the equation is $(|y| - 8)^2 = 0$ or $|y| = 8$. This gives us two horizontal lines at $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

4. The intersection of all these lines forms a square with side length $20$.

5. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 400. The answer is: $400$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. If the product of two numbers is zero, it means at least one of them must be zero. Therefore, we can separate the problem into two cases: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

2. Solving each of these equations separately gives us the points that satisfy the conditions. For example, if $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$. Solving these equations for $x$ and $y$ gives us the coordinates of the points that satisfy this condition.

3. Similarly, we can find the points that satisfy the other conditions.

4. The points that satisfy any of these conditions form a square with side length 16.

5. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256. The python code to calculate this would look like this:

```python

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The expression $A * B = 0$ is true if and only if either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. So, the given equation is satisfied if either $A = (\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $B = (\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $A = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square $(0, 0), (0, 20), (20, 0), (0, -20)$.

If $B = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square $(-8, 8), (8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, -8)$.

The combined solution is the union of these two squares, which is a rectangle with side lengths 20 and 16. The area of this rectangle is $20 * 16 = 320$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 320. The answer is: $320$

 The equation given in the problem is:
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]
This equation is satisfied only when either of the two factors is zero, i.e., 
\[(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad (\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0.\]
From the first equation, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two squares in the $x$-$y$ plane with side length 20 units. The intersection of these squares forms a square with side length 10 units.
From the second equation, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two squares in the $x$-$y$ plane with side length 16 units. The intersection of these squares forms a square with side length 8 units.
The convex polygon formed by the intersection of the two squares has a side length of 10 units. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $10^2 = 100$ square units.
The answer is: $100$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The condition $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $|x+y| = 10$ and $|x-y| = 10$. This implies that $x+y = \pm 10$ and $x-y = \pm 10$. Solving these two equations for $x$ and $y$, we find that the four lines $x+y = \pm 10$ and $x-y = \pm 10$ bound a square with side length 20. The square has vertices at $(\pm 10, 0)$, $(0, \pm 10)$.

Similarly, the condition $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$, which gives us a square with side length 16 and vertices at $(\pm 8, 0)$, $(0, \pm 8)$.

The intersection of the two squares is another square with side length 8 and vertices at $(\pm 4, 4)$, $(\pm 4, -4)$, $(4, \pm 4)$, $(-4, \pm 4)$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of the smaller square, which is $8^2 = 64$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 64 square units.

Here is a python code to calculate the area:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    side_length = 8
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 64

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
64
```
The area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{64}$ square units. The answer is: $64$

The equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, which means either one of the terms is zero or both are zero.
The term $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ is zero when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which gives two lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.
Similarly, the term $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ is zero when $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which gives two lines $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.
The term $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ is zero when $\vert x \vert = 8$, which gives two lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.
Similarly, the term $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2$ is zero when $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives two lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.
The intersection of these lines form a square with side length 16.
The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
So the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$
