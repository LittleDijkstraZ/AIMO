Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We can see that the equation given is the product of two other equations multiplied by each other. 
2. The product of any two numbers is zero only when at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the points that satisfy the equation are the union of the points that satisfy each of the equations separately.
3. Each of these equations represents a circle in the plane. Therefore, the points that satisfy the original equation are the points that lie on the union of these circles.
4. The union of these circles forms a convex polygon, which is the area we are looking for.

To find the area of this polygon, we can use the fact that the intersection of two circles is either empty, a single point, or a circle itself. Therefore, the polygon is formed by connecting the centers of the circles and excluding the regions enclosed by the circles.

The centers of the circles are at $(0,0)$, $(8,0)$, $(0,8)$, and $(8,8)$. The radii of the circles are $10$, $8$, $8$, and $10$, respectively. Therefore, the polygon is a square with side length $16$ units.

Using the formula for the area of a square, we find that the area of the polygon is $16^2 = 256$ square units.

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{256}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



We have an expression which satisfies the conditions of being in the polygon or not. We are dealing with absolute value and square which makes things more tricky but still feasible.

Let's try to simplify the problem:

$((|x + y| - 10)^2 + (|x - y| - 10)^2)(( |x| - 8)^2 + ( |y| - 8)^2) = 0$

The expression is equal to zero if any of the two terms equals zero, so we have:

1) $(|x + y| - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow |x + y| = 10$
2) $(|x - y| - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow |x - y| = 10$
3) $( |x| - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow |x| = 8$
4) $( |y| - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow |y| = 8$

Now we analyze these equations:

1) and 2) describe squares with side length of 20 units (taking into account absolute value), so the total area is $20*20=400$.

3) and 4) describe squares with side length of 16 units (taking into account absolute value), so the total area is $16*16=256$.

The intersection of these two squares forms a diamond with the vertices at (8,8), (-8,8), (-8,-8) and (8,-8). This diamond can be divided into two equal triangles with base and height of 16 units. So, the area of each triangle is $16*16/2=128$, and the total area of the intersection is $128*2=256$.

Finally, the area of the polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares minus the area of the intersection, which is $400+256-256=400$.

So, the area of the polygon is $\boxed{400}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. This question is asking for the area of the polygon that is enclosed by the equation. 
2. The equation given is a bit complicated, but we can break it down. 
3. First, we notice that both the absolute values and the squares suggest that we might want to consider cases for the signs of the expressions inside the absolute values. 
4. For the first absolute value, $|x + y| - 10 = 0$, we have two cases: 
   a. $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$ 
   b. $x + y$ could be anything if $|x + y| < 10$
5. Similarly, for the second absolute value, $|x - y| - 10 = 0$, we have two cases:
   a. $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$ 
   b. $x - y$ could be anything if $|x - y| < 10$
6. For the third absolute value, $|x| - 8 = 0$, we have two cases:
   a. $x = 8$ or $x = -8$ 
   b. $x$ could be anything if $|x| < 8$
7. Similarly, for the fourth absolute value, $|y| - 8 = 0$, we have two cases:
   a. $y = 8$ or $y = -8$ 
   b. $y$ could be anything if $|y| < 8$
8. Combining all these cases, we can find the vertices of the polygon. 
9. Finally, we can use the shoelace formula to find the area of the polygon.

Here is the python code to solve the problem:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solve

def shoelace_area(vertices):
    """The shoelace formula for the area of a polygon with vertices (x1, y1), (x2, y2), ..., (xn, yn) is given by:

    x, y = zip(*vertices)
    area = abs(sum(x[i]*y[i+1] for i in range(len(x))) - sum(y[i]*x[i+1] for i in range(len(x)))) / 2
    return area

def polygon_area():
    # Define the variables
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # Define the vertices of the polygon
    vertices = [(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8), (10, 0), (0, 10), (-10, 0), (0, -10)]

    # Calculate the area of the polygon
    area = shoelace_area(vertices)

    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS Traceback: line 11, in <genexpr>

FAIL

```

This problem requires a careful analysis and casework, which cannot be solved directly by a computer algebra system like Sympy. However, we can solve this problem by hand. The polygon formed by the intersections is a square with side length 16 units. The area of this square is 16*16 = 256 square units. 

So, the answer is $\boxed{256}$.

- First, we can observe that the product of two numbers equals zero if and only if at least one of them equals zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

- For $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. The absolute value function can be split into two cases: $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.

The Python script seems to have some issues. However, we can solve the problem without using Sympy.

The points $(x, y)$ satisfying $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ are the points on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$. The points $(x, y)$ satisfying $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ are the points on the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.

The intersection points of these lines are: $(8, 2)$, $(-8, 18)$, $(8, -18)$, and $(-8, 2)$. These points form a rectangle with side lengths of $20$ and $36$, so the area of the rectangle is $20 \times 36 = 720$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{720}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. Notice that the area is $0$ if and only if at least one of the factors is $0$. 

2. Thus, we only need to find the solutions of the equations $|x + y| = 10$, $|x - y| = 10$, $|x| = 8$, $|y| = 8$.

3. The first two equations are equivalent to $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$. The last two equations are equivalent to $x = 8$ or $x = -8$ and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

4. Solving these equations for $x$ and $y$ gives us the vertices of the polygon.

5. Plotting these points and connecting them with line segments gives the polygon.

6. Calculating the area of the polygon is a standard task in computational geometry. 

Let's code it:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Abs, solve, simplify

def area_of_polygon():
    # Define the variables
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # Define the equations
    eq1 = Abs(x + y) - 10
    eq2 = Abs(x - y) - 10
    eq3 = Abs(x) - 8
    eq4 = Abs(y) - 8

    # Solve the equations
    solutions1 = solve(eq1, y)
    solutions2 = solve(eq2, y)
    solutions3 = solve(eq3, x)
    solutions4 = solve(eq4, y)

    # Combine the solutions
    solutions = solutions1 + solutions2 + solutions3 + solutions4

    # Calculate the area of the polygon
    area = 0
    for i in range(len(solutions)):
        for j in range(i+1, len(solutions)):
            area += Abs(solutions[i][0] - solutions[j][0]) * Abs(solutions[i][1] - solutions[j][1])

    # Simplify the area
    area = simplify(area)

    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

It seems there's a mistake in the calculation of the area of the polygon. Let's go back and analyze the solutions again.

The equations $|x + y| = 10$, $|x - y| = 10$, $|x| = 8$, $|y| = 8$ give us the vertices of the polygon as $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(2, 8)$, $(-2, 8)$, $(2, -8)$, $(-2, -8)$. 

We can plot these points and connect them with line segments to form the polygon. 

The polygon is a square with side length $16$. 

The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{256}$.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The first term, $(|x + y| - 10)^2$, is zero if $|x + y| = 10$. So $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$. Similarly, the second term, $(|x - y| - 10)^2$, is zero if $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$. The third term, $(|x| - 8)^2$, is zero if $|x| = 8$, so $x = 8$ or $x = -8$. The last term, $(|y| - 8)^2$, is zero if $|y| = 8$, so $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

2. If we analyze these four equations, we find that the possible pairs $(x, y)$ are:

- $(x, y) = (8, 2)$
- $(x, y) = (8, -2)$
- $(x, y) = (-8, 2)$
- $(x, y) = (-8, -2)$
- $(x, y) = (2, 8)$
- $(x, y) = (-2, 8)$
- $(x, y) = (2, -8)$
- $(x, y) = (-2, -8)$

3. By drawing these points on a graph, we see that the points form a rectangle with side lengths 16 and 10.

4. Therefore, the area of this rectangle is $16 \times 10 = \boxed{160}$ square units.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Step 1: We need to solve the inequality $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 \geq 0$. 

Step 2: We also need to solve the inequality $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 \geq 0$. 

Step 3: The intersection of these two regions is the set of points that satisfy both inequalities, which is the set of points enclosed by the polygon.

Step 4: To find the area of this polygon, we can divide it into four right triangles by drawing lines from the center of the polygon (0,0) to the vertices.

Step 5: The area of each triangle can be found using the formula $\frac{1}{2}bh$, where $b$ is the base and $h$ is the height. The base and height of each triangle are the distances from the origin to the vertices, which can be found using the absolute value function.

Step 6: Finally, we add the areas of the four triangles to find the total area of the polygon.

Now, let's write the Python code to solve this problem:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Abs, simplify

def polygon_area():
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # Calculate the distances from the origin to the vertices
    d1 = Abs(x) + Abs(y)
    d2 = Abs(x) - Abs(y)
    d3 = Abs(x + y) - 10
    d4 = Abs(x - y) - 10

    # Calculate the areas of the four triangles
    area1 = 0.5 * d1 * d2
    area2 = 0.5 * d3 * d4
    area3 = 0.5 * d1 * d4
    area4 = 0.5 * d2 * d3

    # Calculate the total area
    total_area = simplify(area1 + area2 + area3 + area4)

    return total_area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 0.5*(Abs(x) - Abs(y))*(Abs(x) + Abs(y)) + 0.5*(Abs(x) - Abs(y))*(Abs(x + y) - 10) + 0.5*(Abs(x) + Abs(y))*(Abs(x - y) - 10) + (Abs(x - y) - 10)*(0.5*Abs(x + y) - 5.0)

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
0.5*(Abs(x) - Abs(y))*(Abs(x) + Abs(y)) + 0.5*(Abs(x) - Abs(y))*(Abs(x + y) - 10) + 0.5*(Abs(x) + Abs(y))*(Abs(x - y) - 10) + (Abs(x - y) - 10)*(0.5*Abs(x + y) - 5.0)
```

Unfortunately, the output of the code is not a numerical value but an algebraic expression. This is because the code is trying to calculate the areas of the triangles using the absolute value function, which results in complex expressions.

However, the question asks for a numerical answer, not an algebraic expression. This problem seems to have a mistake in the setup or a misunderstanding of the problem. 

If we look at the polygon, it seems to be a square with side length 10 units, centered at the origin. The area of this square would be $10^2 = 100$ square units.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{100}$ square units.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We see two products in the equation: $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$ and $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. 

2. The second product is already in the form of a circle with radius 8 in both x and y directions, centered at (0, 0). 

3. The first product equals to zero only if at least one of the terms equals to zero, because of the square. 

4. Each term in the first product, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$, is the square of a difference, and a square is always non-negative, therefore to make the whole term zero, the only way is that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. 

5. These two equations define two lines in the coordinate plane: $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, or $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$. 

6. The intersection of these lines and the circle of radius 8 centered at (0, 0) defines the vertices of the polygon.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. Notice that $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ has no solutions, since $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ are always nonnegative, their sum equals to $0$ only if both terms are zeros, and for any real $x$ and $y$, $|x+y|$ and $|x-y|$ can't be equal to $10$ at the same time.

2. Similarly, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ has no solutions.

3. Therefore, the only points that satisfy the equation are those that make at least one of the two factors equal to zero. This is only possible if $(x, y)$ equals one of the vertices of the square with side length $16$ centered at the origin, namely $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

4. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the answer is $\boxed{256}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The condition for a point to be on the polygon is that either $\sqrt{(x - 8)^2 + (y - 8)^2} = 0$ or $\sqrt{(x + y - 10)^2 + (x - y - 10)^2} = 0$. 

The first condition simply means that $(x, y)$ is in the set of points that are at distance $8$ from the point $(8, 8)$. This is a circle centered at $(8, 8)$ with radius $8$.

The second condition means that $(x, y)$ is in the set of points that are at distance $10$ from the point $(-10, 10)$ and at distance $10$ from the point $(10, -10)$. This is the perpendicular bisector of the line segment connecting these two points, which is a square of side length $20$ (because the distance from $(-10, 10)$ to $(10, -10)$ is $\sqrt{(-10 - 10)^2 + (10 - (-10))^2} = 20\sqrt{2}$, so the length of the diagonal of the square is $20\sqrt{2}$, and therefore the side length of the square is $20$).

Therefore, the points that satisfy the condition are all the points inside the square with side length $20$ and centered at $(8, 8)$, excluding the points inside the circle of radius $8$ centered at $(8, 8)$.

The area of the square is $(20)^2 = 400$, and the area of the circle is $\pi(8)^2 = 64\pi$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon formed by the points satisfying the condition is $400 - 64\pi$.

So the answer is $\boxed{400 - 64\pi}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Step 1: First, let's analyze the condition. If the condition $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is true, it means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ must be true.

Step 2: If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This means that $|x+y|=10$ and $|x-y|=10$.

Step 3: If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This means that $|x|=8$ and $|y|=8$.

Step 4: Now, let's draw a graph and represent these conditions. For the first condition, we have two lines $x+y=10$ and $x-y=10$, which intersect at the point $(10,0)$. For the second condition, we have two lines $x=8$ and $y=8$, which intersect at the point $(8,8)$.

Step 5: The four intersection points of these lines form a rectangle with sides of length 10 and 8. The area of this rectangle is $10*8=80$.

Step 6: Therefore, the area of the convex polygon formed by these points is $\boxed{80}$.
