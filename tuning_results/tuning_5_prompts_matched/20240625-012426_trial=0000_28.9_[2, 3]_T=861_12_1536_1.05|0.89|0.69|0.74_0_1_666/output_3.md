"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations, we find that the points that satisfy the equation are $(0,10)$, $(0,-10)$, $(10,0)$, and $(-10,0)$.

Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these four equations, we find that the points that satisfy the equation are $(8,0)$, $(-8,0)$, $(0,8)$, and $(0,-8)$.

Therefore, the points that satisfy the original equation are $(0,10)$, $(0,-10)$, $(10,0)$, $(-10,0)$, $(8,0)$, $(-8,0)$, $(0,8)$, and $(0,-8)$. These points form a square with side length 10. The area of the square is $10 \times 10 = 100$. So the area of the convex polygon is $100$ square units. The answer is: $100$

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, which means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. 

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, and this expression is zero if and only if both $|x+y| = 10$ and $|x-y| = 10$. These equations represent two pairs of lines: $x+y = 10$ and $x+y = -10$, and $x-y = 10$ and $x-y = -10$. The intersection points of these lines are $(0,10)$, $(10,0)$, $(-10,0)$, and $(0,-10)$.

The second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$, and this expression is zero if and only if both $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. These equations represent two pairs of lines: $x = 8$ and $x = -8$, and $y = 8$ and $y = -8$. The intersection points of these lines are $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

The convex polygon formed by the intersection points of these lines is a square with side length $10+8 = 18$. The area of this square is $18^2 = 324$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $324$.

Here is a Python function to calculate the area of the polygon:

```python

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. 

Let's consider each expression separately:

1. For the first expression, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. Since squares of real numbers are always non-negative, for this equation to hold, both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. Solving these absolute value equations, we get $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. These equations represent a square with side length 10 and diagonals of length $10\sqrt{2}$.

2. For the second expression, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. Similar to the first expression, this equation implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which represents a square with side length 8 and diagonals of length $8\sqrt{2}$.

The intersection of these two squares is a smaller square with side length 6 and diagonals of length $6\sqrt{2}$. 

The area of a square is given by side length squared. So the area of the convex polygon (the smaller square) is $6^2 = 36$. The answer is: $36$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. Therefore, either the first term $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$ is zero, or the second term $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is zero.

If the first term is zero, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the coordinates of the vertices of the polygon: $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0)$.

If the second term is zero, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us four more vertices: $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$.

So, the polygon is a square with side length 10. The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of this polygon is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is $0$ if and only if at least one of the factors is $0$. This happens if and only if either of the following conditions is met:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first condition, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us the lines $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.

For the second condition, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us the lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

These lines enclose a square with side length $20$. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$. So the area of the convex polygon is $400$.

Here is a python program to calculate the area of the square:
```python

def square_area():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""

The area of the convex polygon is $400$.
The answer is $\boxed{400}$.

First, we need to understand the given equation and the properties of absolute values and squares to solve the problem.
The equation is of the form $AB = 0$, which means either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$.

Consider the term $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. For this to be zero, both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only way this can happen is when $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$. This gives us a square with side length 20.

Similarly, for the term $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$, we get $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us a square with side length 16.

The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for. The area of this convex polygon is the area of the smaller square, which is the side length squared: $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:


The problem is asking for the area of a polygon enclosed by the points that satisfy the given equation.

First, we need to analyze the equation:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$

This equation is equal to 0 if either of the two factors is equal to 0. This gives us two sets of equations to solve:
1. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$
2. $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$

For the first set of equations, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm10$ and $x - y = \pm10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of a square with side length 10.

For the second set of equations, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm8$ and $y = \pm8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of a square with side length 16.

The polygon formed by the points that satisfy the given equation is the union of these two squares. The side length of the larger square is 16, so its area is $16^2 = 256$. The side length of the smaller square is 10, so its area is $10^2 = 100$. The area of the polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares, which is $256 + 100 = 356$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 356. The answer is: $356$

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. This expression is zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle with side lengths 20.

The second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. This expression is zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. These lines form a square with side length 16.

The convex polygon that is the intersection of these two regions is a square with side length 20 (since the rectangle and the square have the same side length, the smaller one). The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.
The answer is: $400$

Assistant:

 The problem is asking for the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

This equation is equal to 0 if and only if either of the two factors is equal to 0. 

The first factor is equal to 0 if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) = 0$. This means either $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

The second factor is equal to 0 if either $(\vert x \vert - 8) = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8) = 0$. This means either $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

These conditions describe a square with side length 16 (since $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ implies $-8 \leq x, y \leq 8$, and $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ implies the maximum possible value of $x$ and $y$ are $8$ and $-8$, respectively, when $x=y=8$ or $x=-y=-8$).

The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

 The given equation is a product of two expressions, and it equals zero. This means that either the first expression equals zero, or the second expression equals zero, or both equal zero.

For the first expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, this can only happen if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle.

The intersection of the two shapes is the convex polygon we are looking for. This polygon is a rectangle with side lengths 20 and 16. The area of a rectangle is given by the product of its side lengths, so the area of the convex polygon is $20 \times 16 = 320$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 320 square units. The answer is: $320$.
