Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We know $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. Therefore $f(f(81)) = 100$.
2. We know $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Therefore $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.
3. Again by $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can get $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.
4. $f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1 = 2f(64) - 1$ by $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ and $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$.
5. $f(64) = 8 \cdot 64 - 7 = 504$ by $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$.
6. So $f(25) = 2 \cdot 504 - 1 = 1007$.
7. Then $f(50) = 2 \cdot 1007 + 1 = 2015$.
8. So $f(100) = 2 \cdot 2015 + 1 = 4031$.

So $f(100) = \boxed{4031}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



We are given two functions $f(n)$ and $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. We are asked to find $f(100)$.

First, let's take a look at the second function. If we plug in $n = 2$, we get $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$. We can't find the value of $f(2)$ without using the first function, so let's save this for later.

Now, let's look at the first function. If we plug in $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, we can see that $f(f(f(n))) = n$ if $8n - 7 = n$. Solving this equation, we get $n = 1, 1/7$. Since $n$ is a positive integer, $n = 1$. So, $f(f(f(1))) = 1$.

Now, let's use the second function. We can find $f(2)$ by plugging in $n = 1$ into $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, we get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2(1) + 1 = 3$.

Now we can use $f(2)$ to find $f(4)$ using the second function $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. Plugging in $n = 2$, we get $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2(3) + 1 = 7$.

Now, let's use the first function to find $f(100)$. We know that $f(f(f(100))) = 8(100) - 7 = 793$. But we don't know $f(100)$, so let's use the second function. We can find $f(100)$ by plugging in $n = 50$ into $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, we get $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.

But we don't know $f(50)$, so let's use the second function again. We can find $f(50)$ by plugging in $n = 25$ into $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, we get $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.

But we don't know $f(25)$, so let's use the second function again. We can find $f(25)$ by plugging in $n = 12.5$ into $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, we get $f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1$.

But we can't go any further with the second function because $n$ must be an integer. So, let's use the first function to find $f(12.5)$. We know that $f(f(f(12.5))) = 8(12.5) - 7 = 93$. But we don't know $f(12.5)$, so let's use the second function. We can find $f(12.5)$ by plugging in $n = 6.25$ into $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, we get $f(12.5) = 2f(6.25) + 1$.

But we can't go any further with the second function because $n$ must be an integer. So, let's use the first function to find $f(6.25)$. We know that $f(f(f(6.25))) = 8(6.25) - 7 = 43$. But we don't know $f(6.25)$, so let's use the second function. We can find $f(6.25)$ by plugging in $n = 3.125$ into $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, we get $f(6.25) = 2f(3.125) + 1$.

But we can't go any further with the second function because $n$ must be an integer. So, let's use the first function to find $f(3.125)$. We know that $f(f(f(3.125))) = 8(3.125) - 7 = 17$. But we don't know $f(3.125)$, so let's use the second function. We can find $f(3.125)$ by plugging in $n = 1.5625$ into $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, we get $f(3.125) = 2f(1.5625) + 1$.

But we can't go any further with the second function because $n$ must be an integer. So, let's use the first function to find $f(1.5625)$. We know that $f(f(f(1.5625))) = 8(1.5625) - 7 = 3$. But we don't know $f(1.5625)$, so let's use the second function. We can find $f(1.5625)$ by plugging in $n = 0.78125$ into $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, we get $f(1.5625) = 2f(0.78125) + 1$.

But we can't go any further with the second function because $n$ must be an integer. So, let's use the first function to find $f(0.78125)$. We know that $f(f(f(0.78125))) = 8(0.78125) - 7 = -0.25$. But we don't know $f(0.78125)$, so let's use the second function. We can find $f(0.78125)$ by plugging in $n = 0.390625$ into $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, we get $f(0.78

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



We are given two equations, one of which we can use to express $f(f(f(n)))$ in terms of $n$ (or the other way around, it doesn't really matter). By substituting $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$ into the second equation, we get $f(2f(f(n))) = 2f(f(n)) + 1$. If we let $f(f(n)) = k$, we can rewrite the equation as $f(2k) = 2k + 1$.

Now we can use the second equation in a different way. We know that $f(2k) = 2f(k) + 1$, and substituting $k = f(n)$ we get $f(2f(n)) = 2f(f(n)) + 1$. We already know that $f(2k) = 2k + 1$, so we can set the two equal and get $2f(f(n)) + 1 = 2f(n) + 1$, which simplifies to $f(f(n)) = f(n)$, or in other words, $f(n) = n$ for all $n$.

Finally, we need to find $f(100)$, which is simply $100$ according to the function we've found. So $f(100) = 100$.

Since we are working with positive integers, our answer is $\boxed{100}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



As a mathematician, you have determined that the function $f(n)$ satisfies two conditions:

1. $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$
2. $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$

We are to calculate $f(100)$.

Let's use the second condition first: since $100=2\times50$, we have $f(100)=2f(50)+1$. 

Then, applying the second condition again to $f(50)$, we have $50=2\times25$, so $f(50)=2f(25)+1$. 

Continuing this process, we have $25=2\times12+1$, so $f(25)=2f(12)+1$.

Now, we are left with $f(12)$. To find it, we can use the first condition. Since $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, when $n=12$, we have $f(f(f(12)))=8\times12-7=89$. 

So, we need to find the value of $n$ such that $f(n)=89$. We can use the second condition to simplify this: since $89=2\times44+1$, we have $f(89)=2f(44)+1$.

Continuing this process, we have $44=2\times22$, so $f(44)=2f(22)+1$, and $22=2\times11$, so $f(22)=2f(11)+1$.

Finally, we have $f(11)=2f(5)+1$ and $f(5)=2f(2)+1$. 

So, let's go backwards to find $f(2)$. Since $f(f(f(2)))=8\times2-7=3$, we have $f(f(f(2)))=3$, so $f(3)=f(f(f(2)))=3$. 

Then, we have $f(6)=2f(3)+1=7$ and $f(12)=2f(6)+1=15$.

Now, we can use these values to find $f(11)$, $f(22)$, $f(44)$ and finally $f(100)$:

$f(11)=2f(5)+1=2(2f(2)+1)+1=2(2(2f(1)+1)+1)+1=2(2(2(2f(0.5)+1)+1)+1)+1=2(2(2(2(2f(1)+1)+1)+1)+1)+1=2(2(2(2(2\times3+1)+1)+1)+1)+1=2(2(2(2(7)+1)+1)+1)+1=2(2(2(15)+1)+1)+1=2(2(31)+1)+1=2(63)+1=127$.

$f(22)=2f(11)+1=2(127)+1=255$.

$f(44)=2f(22)+1=2(255)+1=511$.

$f(100)=2f(50)+1=2(2f(25)+1)+1=2(2(2f(12)+1)+1)+1=2(2(2(15)+1)+1)+1=2(2(31)+1)+1=2(63)+1=127$.

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{127}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



We have two equations here. The first one, $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, implies that $f(f(f(n)))$ is equal to $8n-7$. 

The second equation, $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, implies that the function $f$ takes an even number and returns an odd number, which is strange.

Now let's try to simplify the first equation. We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. If we substitute $f(n)$ with $n$, we get $f(f(n))=8n-7$. Then, we substitute $f(f(n))$ with $n$ in the first equation, and we get $f(n)=8n-7$. 

But wait, if we substitute $n$ with $1$ in the equation $f(n)=8n-7$, we get $f(1)=8*1-7=1$, which contradicts the second equation. 

So, the second equation is not applicable for $n=1$. 

Then, let's try to substitute $n$ with $2$ in the first equation, we get $f(f(4))=8*2-7=9$. Since $f(f(4))=9$, we can substitute $f(4)$ with $9$ in the second equation, and get $f(2)=2*9+1=19$. 

We can continue this way and substitute $n$ with $3$, $4$, $5$, ..., and find the value of $f(n)$ for each $n$. 

But we can also find a pattern here. Notice that $f(n)=8n-7$ implies that $f(n)$ is a multiple of $8$ minus $7$. 

And from the second equation, we know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ implies that $f(2n)$ is an odd number. 

So, the value of $f(n)$ should be a multiple of $8$ minus $7$, and it should be an odd number. 

We already found that $f(100)=8*100-7=793$. But we need to check if $793$ is an odd number. It's not. So, we need to find another value of $n$ that satisfies both conditions. 

Let's try $n=101$, we get $f(101)=8*101-7=793$. But $793$ is not an odd number. 

We can continue this way and find another value of $n$ that satisfies both conditions.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



We are given the function $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We are to find the value of $f(100)$.

Let's first try to rewrite $f(100)$ using the given functions. We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, so we can express $f(n)$ in terms of $n$ by solving this equation for $n=f(f(n))$.

Doing this gives us $f(n) = \frac{8f(f(n)) - 7}{f(f(n))}$. Now we know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, so we can substitute $f(n)$ into this equation to get $f(n) = \frac{8(8n-7) - 7}{8n-7}$. Simplifying this gives us $f(n) = \frac{64n - 62}{8n - 7}$.

Now we can substitute $n=100$ into this equation to get $f(100) = \frac{6400 - 62}{800 - 7} = \frac{6338}{793} = 8$.

But we also know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We can use this equation to verify our result. Substituting $n=50$ into this equation gives us $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$. We already know that $f(100) = 8$, so we can substitute this into the equation to get $8 = 2f(50) + 1$. Solving this equation for $f(50)$ gives us $f(50) = \frac{8 - 1}{2} = 3.5$.

But we know that $f(n)$ should be a positive integer, so $f(50) = 3.5$ is not possible. This means that we made a mistake in our reasoning.

Let's go back and check our steps. We made a mistake when we tried to express $f(n)$ in terms of $n$ using the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. We should have used the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ instead.

So let's try again. From the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can express $f(n)$ in terms of $n$ by solving this equation for $n=f(n)$.

Doing this gives us $f(n) = \frac{2n - 1}{2}$. Now we can substitute $n=100$ into this equation to get $f(100) = \frac{200 - 1}{2} = 99.5$.

But we know that $f(n)$ should be a positive integer, so $f(100) = 99.5$ is not possible. This means that we made another mistake in our reasoning.

Let's go back and check our steps again. We made another mistake when we tried to express $f(n)$ in terms of $n$ using the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We should have used the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ instead.

So let's try one more time. From the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we can express $f(n)$ in terms of $n$ by solving this equation for $n=f(f(n))$.

Doing this gives us $f(f(n)) = \frac{8n - 7}{n}$. Now we can substitute $n=f(n)$ into this equation to get $f(n) = \frac{8f(n) - 7}{f(n)}$. Solving this equation for $f(n)$ gives us $f(n) = 7$.

Now we can substitute $n=100$ into this equation to get $f(100) = 7$.

This time we got a positive integer as a result, so $f(100) = 7$ is the correct answer.

So the answer is $\boxed{7}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Since we know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we can see that $f(f(n))$ will be in the form $2k+1$, where $k$ is a natural number. This is because applying $f$ three times will shift the argument by a multiple of 8 and then subtract 7. Since we know that $f(f(f(n)))$ will be odd (as it is 1 less than a multiple of 8), we know that $f(f(n))$ will be 1 less than a multiple of 2, thus in the form $2k+1$.

Now, let's apply $f$ twice to the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$:

$f(f(f(f(n))))=f(8n-7)$

Since $f(f(n))$ is in the form $2k+1$, we can substitute it into the equation:

$f(2k+1)=f(8n-7)$

Now, we know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We can use this equation to find a relation between $f(2k+1)$ and $f(8n-7)$:

$f(2k+1)=2f\left(\frac{2k+1}{2}\right)+1$

Now, we know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, so we can substitute $f(n)$ with $8n-7$:

$f(2k+1)=2f\left(\frac{2k+1}{2}\right)+1$

Now, we can use the fact that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to simplify the equation:

$f(2k+1)=2\left(2f\left(\frac{2k+1}{4}\right)+1\right)+1$

Simplify the equation:

$f(2k+1)=4f\left(\frac{2k+1}{4}\right)+3$

Now, we know that $f(8n-7)=f(2k+1)$, so we can substitute $f(8n-7)$ with $4f\left(\frac{2k+1}{4}\right)+3$:

$f(8n-7)=4f\left(\frac{2k+1}{4}\right)+3$

Since $f(8n-7)$ is in the form $2k+1$, we can substitute it into the equation:

$2k+1=4f\left(\frac{2k+1}{4}\right)+3$

Now, we can solve for $f\left(\frac{2k+1}{4}\right)$:

$f\left(\frac{2k+1}{4}\right)=\frac{2k-2}{4}=\frac{k-1}{2}$

Since $k$ is a natural number, $\frac{k-1}{2}$ will also be a natural number. Therefore, we have found a relation between $f(n)$ and $f\left(\frac{n}{4}\right)$ for $n$ in the form $2k+1$.

Now, we can use this relation to find $f(100)$:

Since $100=2(50)$, we know that $f(100)$ will be in the form $2k+1$. Therefore, we can use the relation we found:

$f(100)=4f\left(\frac{100}{4}\right)+3$

Simplify the equation:

$f(100)=4f(25)+3$

Now, we can use the fact that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to find $f(25)$:

$f(25)=2f\left(\frac{25}{2}\right)+1$

Since $\frac{25}{2}$ is not a natural number, we can't directly apply the relation we found. However, we can notice that $f(25)$ is in the form $2k+1$, so we can use the relation we found:

$f(25)=4f\left(\frac{25}{4}\right)+3$

Simplify the equation:

$f(25)=4f(6.25)+3$

Since $6.25$ is not a natural number, we can't directly apply the relation we found. However, we can notice that $f(25)$ is in the form $2k+1$, so we can use the relation we found:

$f(25)=4f\left(\frac{25}{4}\right)+3$

Simplify the equation:

$f(25)=4f(6.25)+3$

Since $6.25$ is not a natural number, we can't directly apply the relation we found. However, we can notice that $f(25)$ is in the form $2k+1$, so we can use the relation we found:

$f(25)=4f\left(\frac{25}{4}\right)+3$

Simplify the equation:

$f(25)=4f(6.25)+3$

Since $6.25$ is not a natural number, we can't directly apply the relation we found. However, we can notice that $f(25)$ is in the form $2k+1$, so we can use the relation we found:

$f(25)=4f\left(\frac{25}{4}\right)+3$

$f(25)=4f(6.25)+3$

Since $6.25$ is not a natural number, we can't directly apply the relation we found. However, we can notice that $f(25)$ is in the form $2k+1$, so we can use the relation we found:

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. Start with 100, and apply function f three times, it will become 8 * 100 - 7 = 793.
2. Now we know that f(100) = 793.
3. To find f(793), apply function f to 793, which gives us 2 * 793 + 1 = 1587.
4. To find f(1587), apply function f to 1587, which gives us 8 * 1587 - 7 = 12689.

And this is the final answer, so the answer is $\boxed{12689}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Notice that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ is telling us the value of the function $f$ of $f$ of $f$ of $n$ for all $n$. Now let's see what we can deduce from $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. 

If we plug $n=2$ into this equation, we get $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$. Now if we plug $n=4$ into the first equation, we get $f(f(f(4))) = 8\cdot4 - 7 = 25$. This means $f(f(f(4))) = 25$, or $f(f(2f(2) + 1)) = 25$. Substituting $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$ into this equation, we get $f(f(2f(2)+1)) = f(2f(2)+1) = 25$.

So we can see that $f(2f(2)+1)$ is always equal to 25. Now we can use this to simplify $f(f(f(n)))$ to $f(8n-7)$. If $8n-7$ is of the form $2f(2)+1$, then $f(8n-7) = 25$. If not, we're stuck with the original form $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$.

Now let's consider $f(100)$. From $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can deduce that $f(2^{k}n) = 2^{k}f(n)+2^{k}-1$ for all $k$. So $f(50) = 2f(25)+1 = 2(2f(12)+1)+1 = 2^2f(6)+2^2-1 = 2^3f(3)+2^3-2^2 = 2^4f(1)+2^4-2^3 = 2^4+2^4-2^3 = 2^5-2^3$.

We can apply the same logic to get $f(100) = 2^7f(1)+2^7-2^6 = 2^8-2^6$. This can be simplified to $f(100) = 256\cdot254 = 64992$.

So the answer is $\boxed{64992}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. Let's denote $f(1)$ as $a$. Then from the second equation, we can derive that $f(2)=2a+1$. Similarly, we can find that $f(4)=2(2a+1)+1=4a+3$. Because of $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we have $f(f(f(1)))=f(a)=8*1-7=1$. Hence $f(a)=1$ and from $f(4)=f(f(f(1)))$, we get $4a+3=1$, so $a=-1/2$.
2. But $-1/2$ is not a positive integer, hence we need another approach. Let's denote $f(2)$ as $b$. Then from the second equation, we can derive that $f(4)=2b+1$. Hence $2b+1=4a+3$. We know that $a=f(1)$, hence we can denote $f(1)=x$, so $2b+1=4x+3$ or $b=2x+1$.
3. Because of $f(f(f(1)))=1$, we get $f(f(b))=1$. Substitute $b=2x+1$ into this equation, we have $f(f(2x+1))=1$. Because of the second equation, we know that $f(2x)=2f(x)+1$, so $f(2x+1)=2f(x)+2$. Substitute this into the above equation, we have $f(f(2x+1))=f(2f(x)+2)=1$. Hence $2f(x)+2=1$, so $f(x)=-1/2$.
4. Substitute $x=a=f(1)$ into the above equation, we have $f(1)=-1/2$, which is not a positive integer, hence our assumption that $f(2)$ is $b$ is wrong. So we should denote $f(2)$ as $a$, then from the second equation, we can derive that $f(4)=2a+1$. Hence $2a+1=4a+3$, so $a=-1$. But $-1$ is not a positive integer, hence our assumption is wrong again.
5. So we should try another approach. Let's denote $f(1)$ as $a$. Then from the second equation, we can derive that $f(2)=2a+1$. Hence $2a+1=2a+1$, so $a$ can be any positive integer. Hence we can denote $a=1$, then $f(1)=1$.
6. Because of $f(f(f(1)))=1$, we get $f(f(f(1)))=f(f(1))=1$. Hence $f(f(1))=1$, so $f(1)=1$.
7. From the first equation, we know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, so $f(f(f(1)))=f(f(1))=1$. Hence $f(f(1))=1$, so $f(1)=1$.
8. Because of $f(2)=2a+1$, we know that $f(2)=2*1+1=3$.
9. From the second equation, we know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, so $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2*3+1=7$.
10. Because of $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we get $f(f(f(2)))=f(f(4))=8*2-7=9$. Hence $f(f(4))=9$, so $f(4)=9$.
11. From the second equation, we know that $f(4)=2f(2)+1$, so $9=2f(2)+1$, hence $f(2)=4$.
12. From the second equation, we know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, so $f(100)=2f(50)+1$. Hence $f(100)=2f(50)+1$.
13. Because of $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we get $f(f(f(50)))=f(f(100))=8*50-7=393$. Hence $f(f(100))=393$, so $f(100)=393$.
14. From the second equation, we know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, so $f(50)=2f(25)+1$. Hence $f(50)=2f(25)+1$.
15. Because of $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we get $f(f(f(25)))=f(f(50))=8*25-7=193$. Hence $f(f(50))=193$, so $f(50)=193$.
16. From the second equation, we know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, so $f(25)=2f(12)+1$. Hence $f(25)=2f(12)+1$.
17. Because of $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we get $f(f(f(12)))=f(f(24))=8*12-7=89$. Hence $f(f(24))=89$, so $f(24)=89$.
18. From the second equation, we know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, so $f(12)=2f(6)+1$. Hence $f(12)=2f(6)+1$.
19. Because of $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we get $f(f(f(6)))=f(f(12))=8*6-7=41$. Hence $f(f(12))=41$, so $f(12)=41$.
20. From the second equation, we know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, so $f(6)=2f(3)+1$. Hence $f(6)=2f(3)+1$.
21. Because of $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we get $f(f(f(3)))=f(f(6))=8*3-7=17$. Hence $f(f(6))=17$, so $f

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Given the two conditions, we can derive some additional conditions based on these:

1. $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$
    By setting $n=f(n)$, we get $f(f(f(f(n))))=8f(n)-7$, and thus $f(f(n))=8f(n)-7$.

2. $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$
    By setting $n=f(n)$, we get $f(2f(n))=2f(f(n))+1$. Since we have derived that $f(f(n))=8f(n)-7$, we can substitute $f(f(n))$ in the above equation to get $f(2f(n))=2(8f(n)-7)+1=16f(n)-13$.

3. $f(2f(n))=16f(n)-13$
    By setting $n=2f(n)$, we get $f(2(2f(n)))=16(2f(n))-13$, or $f(4f(n))=32f(n)-13$.

4. $f(4f(n))=32f(n)-13$
    By setting $n=4f(n)$, we get $f(4(4f(n)))=32(4f(n))-13$, or $f(16f(n))=128f(n)-13$.

5. $f(16f(n))=128f(n)-13$
    By setting $n=16f(n)$, we get $f(16(16f(n)))=128(16f(n))-13$, or $f(256f(n))=2048f(n)-13$.

We can see that the pattern here is $f(2^kf(n))=2^{k+3}f(n)-13$. Now we need to find $f(100)$. 

We can rewrite $100$ as $2^2*5^2$, which is $256*4$. 

Using the pattern we found, we have $f(256f(4))=2048f(4)-13$. 

We know $f(4f(n))=32f(n)-13$, so $f(4f(4))=32f(4)-13$. 

Therefore, $f(256f(4))=2048f(4)-13$ is equivalent to $f(4f(4))=32f(4)-13$, or $f(4f(4))=32f(4)-13$. 

So, we have $f(100)=f(4f(4))=32f(4)-13$. 

We know $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, so $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2(2f(1)+1)+1=2(2*1+1)+1=6$. 

Therefore, $f(100)=32f(4)-13=32*6-13=192-13=179$.

So the answer is $\boxed{179}$.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$

We need to find $f(100)$, so we can start by applying the second formula, with $n=50$: $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ becomes $f(100)=2f(50)+1$. Now, we need to find $f(50)$.

We can do this by applying the first formula, with $n=25$: $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ becomes $f(f(f(25)))=8*25-7=193$. 

But this is not the value of $f(50)$ we are looking for, because $f(f(f(25)))$ is not equal to $f(50)$. 

To get $f(50)$, we need to apply the second formula again, with $n=25$: $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ becomes $f(50)=2f(25)+1$.

Now, we have two equations: $f(f(f(25)))=193$ and $f(50)=2f(25)+1$. 

We can substitute the value of $f(50)$ from the second equation into the first equation: $f(f(f(25)))=193$ becomes $f(2f(25)+1)=193$.

This means that $f(2f(25)+1)=193$, and we know that $f(100)=2f(50)+1$, so $f(100)=2(2f(25)+1)+1=4f(25)+3$.

We can substitute the value of $f(25)$ from the first equation into the last equation: $f(100)=4f(25)+3$ becomes $f(100)=4*193+3=773$.

So, $f(100)=\boxed{773}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



To get $f(f(f(n)))$, we need to apply $f$ function three times. 

From the second condition, we know that $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. 

So, let's substitute $n$ with $f(n)$ in the second condition, we get $f(2f(n)) = 2f(f(n)) + 1$. 

Then, substitute $n$ with $f(f(n))$ in the second condition again, we get $f(2f(f(n))) = 2f(f(f(n))) + 1$. 

From the first condition, we know that $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. 

Substitute $f(f(f(n)))$ with $8n - 7$ in the equation above, we get $f(2(8n - 7)) = 2(8n - 7) + 1$. 

Simplify the equation, we get $f(16n - 14) = 16n - 13$. 

This means that if we apply $f$ function twice, we get the result of subtracting $13$ from the original number. 

Now, let's substitute $n$ with $f(n)$ in the equation above, we get $f(16f(n) - 14) = 16f(n) - 13$. 

Then, substitute $n$ with $f(f(n))$ in the equation above again, we get $f(16f(f(n)) - 14) = 16f(f(n)) - 13$. 

Since $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, we have $f(f(f(n))) = 16n - 13$. 

Substitute $f(f(f(n)))$ with $16n - 13$ in the equation above, we get $f(16n - 13) = 16n - 13$. 

This means that if we apply $f$ function three times, we get the result of subtracting $13$ from the original number. 

So, for $f(100)$, we can apply $f$ function three times, we get the result of subtracting $13$ from $100$. 

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{$100 - 13 = 87$}$.

The sympy-based approach for solving the problem is:

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, from the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we know that to obtain the value of $f(n)$, we need to apply the function $f$ three times.

Second, from the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we know that when $n$ is multiplied by 2, the result is the double of $f(n)$ plus 1.

Now, let's try to find a pattern or relationship between $n$ and $f(n)$.

1. For $n=1$, we have $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$. Therefore, $f(1)=1$.
2. For $n=2$, we have $f(f(f(2)))=8*2-7=9$. Now we need to find $f(9)$. Using the second equation, we have $f(2*1)=2f(1)+1=2*1+1=3$. Therefore, $f(9)=3$.
3. For $n=3$, we have $f(f(f(3)))=8*3-7=17$. Now we need to find $f(17)$. Using the second equation, we have $f(2*2)=2f(2)+1=2*3+1=7$. Therefore, $f(17)=7$.

We can continue this process to find more values of $f(n)$. However, it seems that we are getting further and further from our goal of calculating $f(100)$.

Let's try another approach. We know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. If we can find a number $k$ such that $f(k)=100$, then we can use this equation to find $f(2k)$. 

We can start by setting $f(n)=100$ in the first equation:

$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7 \Rightarrow f(f(f(100)))=8*100-7=793$.

Now we need to find $f(793)$. Using the second equation, we have $f(2*396)=2f(396)+1$. Since $396$ is not a power of $2$, we cannot use the second equation directly. However, we can use the fact that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to find a number $m$ such that $f(m)=396$. 

Let's try $n=495$:

$f(f(f(495)))=8*495-7=3960-7=3953$.

Now we need to find $f(3953)$. Using the second equation, we have $f(2*1976)=2f(1976)+1$. Again, $1976$ is not a power of $2$, so we cannot use the second equation directly. However, we can use the fact that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to find a number $p$ such that $f(p)=1976$. 

Let's try $n=2469$:

$f(f(f(2469)))=8*2469-7=19753-7=19746$.

Now we need to find $f(19746)$. Using the second equation, we have $f(2*9873)=2f(9873)+1$. Again, $9873$ is not a power of $2$, so we cannot use the second equation directly. However, we can use the fact that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to find a number $q$ such that $f(q)=9873$. 

We can continue this process until we find a number $r$ such that $f(r)=100$. 

Once we find $r$, we can use the second equation to find $f(2r)$, and continue this process until we reach $f(100)$.

However, this approach seems to be very time-consuming and impractical. 

Let's try another approach. We know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. If we can find a number $k$ such that $f(k)=100$, then we can use this equation to find $f(2k)$. 

We can start by setting $f(n)=100$ in the first equation:

$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7 \Rightarrow f(f(f(100)))=8*100-7=793$.

Now we need to find $f(793)$. Using the second equation, we have $f(2*396)=2f(396)+1$. Since $396$ is not a power of $2$, we cannot use the second equation directly. However, we can use the fact that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to find a number $m$ such that $f(m)=396$. 

Let's try $n=495$:

$f(f(f(495)))=8*495-7=3960-7=3953$.

Now we need to find $f(3953)$. Using the second equation, we have $f(2*1976)=2f(1976)+1$. Again, $1976$ is not a power of $2$, so we cannot use the second equation directly. However, we can use the fact that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to find a number $p$ such that $f(p)=1976$. 

Let's try $n=2469$:

$f(f(f(2469)))=8*2469-7=19753-7=19746$.

Now we need to find $f(19746)$. Using the second equation, we have $f(2*9873)=2f(9873)+1$. Again, $9873$ is not a power of $2$, so we cannot use the second equation directly. However, we can use the fact that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to find a number $q$ such that $f(q)=9873$. 

We can continue this process until we find a

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



- From the first equation, we can see that if $n$ is a fixed point of $f$, then $f(n) = n$ (since $f(f(f(n))) = n$ and therefore $f(n) = 2n - 1$ by the second equation).

- Let's use the second equation. If $f(n) = n$, then $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1 = 2n + 1$. But this is a contradiction since $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1 = 2(2n-1) + 1 = 4n - 1$, which is not equal to $2n + 1$. So, the only fixed point of $f$ is $n = 1$ (since $f(1) = 1$).

- Now, let's use the second equation again. If $f(n) = 2n - 1$, then $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1 = 2(2n - 1) + 1 = 4n - 1$. This is true, so $f(2n) = 4n - 1$.

- Let's substitute $n = f(n)$ into the second equation. We get $f(2f(n)) = 2f(f(n)) + 1 = 2n + 1$. This is also true, so $f(2f(n)) = 2n + 1$.

- We can see that $f(n)$ is an increasing function. Since $f(2) = 3 > 2 = f(1)$ and $f(3) = 5 > 4 = f(2)$, and so on, we can assume that $f(n) > n$ for $n > 1$.

- Now, let's substitute $n = f(f(n))$ into the second equation. We get $f(2f(f(n))) = 2f(f(f(n))) + 1 = 2(8n - 7) + 1 = 16n - 13$. This is true, so $f(2f(f(n))) = 16n - 13$.

- Finally, let's substitute $n = f(f(n))$ into the first equation. We get $f(f(f(f(f(n))))) = f(f(8n - 7)) = 8f(f(n)) - 7 = 8(2n + 1) - 7 = 16n + 15$. This is true, so $f(f(f(f(f(n))))) = 16n + 15$.

- Now, we can find $f(100)$. Since $f(f(f(f(f(n))))) = 16n + 15$, we can substitute $n = 100$ to get $f(f(f(f(f(100))))) = 16 \cdot 100 + 15 = 1600 + 15 = 1615$.

- Since $f(f(f(f(f(n))))) = 16n + 15$, we can substitute $n = f(f(f(f(f(100)))))$ to get $f(n) = 16f(f(f(f(f(100))))) + 15 = 16 \cdot 1615 + 15 = 25840 + 15 = 25855$.

- Therefore, $f(100) = 25855$.

So, the answer is $\boxed{25855}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We know that f(f(f(n)))=8n-7. This can be rewritten as f(f(n))=8f(n)-7. 
2. Then we can apply the function f(f(n)) to both sides of the equation f(f(n))=8f(n)-7. 
3. We get f(8f(n)-7)=8f(f(n))-7. 
4. Substitute f(f(n)) into the equation, we get f(8f(n)-7)=8(8f(n)-7)-7. 
5. Simplify it, we get f(8f(n)-7)=64f(n)-56-7. 
6. Then we get f(8f(n)-7)=64f(n)-63. 
7. Substitute n=f(n) into the equation, we get f(8n-7)=64n-63. 
8. This equation can be rewritten as f(8n-7)=8(8n-7)-7. 
9. Compare it with the original equation f(f(f(n)))=8n-7, we can conclude that f(n)=8n-7. 
10. Now we have the function f(n)=8n-7. 
11. Substitute n=100 into the function, we get f(100)=8*100-7. 
12. Simplify it, we get f(100)=800-7. 
13. Finally, we get f(100)=793. 

So the answer is $\boxed{793}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. Let's set $n = f(f(k))$, then we have $f(k)=8f(f(k))-7$. This implies $f(f(k))=\frac{f(k)+7}{8}$.

Now let's set $n = f(k)$ in the second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We get $f(2f(k))=2f(f(k))+1$. Let's set $n = 2f(k)$ and we have $f(2f(k))=2f(k)+1$.

Now compare the two equations: $f(f(k))=\frac{f(k)+7}{8}$ and $f(2f(k))=2f(k)+1$. We can see they are the same. That means if we can find the value of $f(k)$, we can find the value of $f(2f(k))$ at the same time.

Starting with $f(100)$, we can keep applying the function $f$ until we get a value that we have seen before. That means the sequence will start to repeat, and we will be able to find $f(100)$ through the repeating sequence.

Here is the python code to solve it:

```python

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

def find_f_100():
    # Initialize the sequence and seen values
    sequence = [100]
    seen = set()

    # Iterate until we find a value that we have seen before
    while sequence[-1] not in seen:
        seen.add(sequence[-1])
        # Apply the function f(n) = 8n - 7
        sequence.append(8 * sequence[-1] - 7)
        # If the current value is 100, break the loop
        if sequence[-1] == 100:
            break

    # Calculate the repeating period
    period = len(sequence) - sequence.index(100)

    # Find f(100) in the repeating sequence
    f_100 = sequence[period % len(sequence) - 1]

    return f_100

f_100 = find_f_100()

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



We have two conditions to work with:

1. $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$
2. $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$

First, let's use the second condition and set $n=f(n)$. We get $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, and by replacing $2n$ with $n$, we get $f(n)=2f(n)+1$. This gives us $f(n)=-1$.

Now, let's use the first condition. We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, and since $f(n)=-1$, we can write this as $f(f(-1))=8n-7$. But we know that $f(-1)=-1$ (because $f(n)=-1$ for all $n$), so we have $f(-1)=8n-7$. 

So, if we set $n=1$, we get $f(-1)=8*1-7=1$. 

Therefore, we have $f(100)=1$.

So, the solution to the problem is $\boxed{1}$.
