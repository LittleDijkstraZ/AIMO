Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The area of a polygon is determined by the number of its vertices and the sides. In this case, the given equation is equal to zero, which means either the first or the second set of parentheses must be zero. 

For the first set of parentheses to be zero, we need $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only way for these conditions to be met is if $x = y = \pm 10$ or $x = -y = \pm 10$. This gives us a rectangle with dimensions $20 \times 20$.

For the second set of parentheses to be zero, we need $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The only way for these conditions to be met is if $x = y = \pm 8$. This gives us another rectangle with dimensions $16 \times 16$.

To find the total area of the polygon, we add the areas of the two rectangles:

```python

    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    # Dimensions of the first rectangle
    length_1 = 20
    width_1 = 20

    # Dimensions of the second rectangle
    length_2 = 16
    width_2 = 16

    # Calculate the areas of the rectangles
    area_1 = length_1 * width_1
    area_2 = length_2 * width_2

    # Add the areas of the rectangles to get the total area of the polygon
    total_area = area_1 + area_2

    return total_area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

The area of the convex polygon is $656$ square units. The answer is $\boxed{656}$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.
If the first expression is zero, we have $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x-y| - 10 = 0$, or equivalently, $|x+y| = 10$ and $|x-y| = 10$.
This implies that $x+y = \pm 10$ and $x-y = \pm 10$.
Solving these equations, we get the solutions: $(x, y) = (5, 5), (5, -5), (-5, -5), (-5, 5)$.
If the second expression is zero, we have $|x| - 8 = 0$ and $|y| - 8 = 0$, or equivalently, $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$.
This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
Solving these equations, we get the solutions: $(x, y) = (8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, -8), (-8, 8)$.
Plotting these points on a coordinate plane, we can see that they enclose a square with side length $10$.
The area of this square is $10 \times 10 = 100$.
So the area of the convex polygon is 100.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    side_length = 10
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so one of the expressions must be zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.

If $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$. This means that $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.

If $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

By solving these equations, we find that the points that satisfy the equation are the vertices of a square with side length 16. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256.
The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The problem is asking for the area of a convex polygon formed by the points that satisfy the given equation.

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is equal to zero if and only if at least one of the factors is equal to zero. This happens if and only if at least one of the following conditions is satisfied:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert y \vert = 8$.

From conditions 3 and 4, we get that the points must lie inside the rectangle formed by the lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
From conditions 1 and 2, we get that the points must lie on the lines $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.

The intersection points of these lines are:
- $(8,2)$, $(-8,2)$, $(8,-2)$, $(-8,-2)$, $(2,8)$, $(-2,8)$, $(2,-8)$, and $(-2,-8)$.

These points form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 100.

The Python code to calculate the area of the polygon is:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    # side length of the square
    side_length = 10
    
    # calculate the area of the square
    area = side_length ** 2
    
    return area

result = polygon_area()

The area of the convex polygon is $100$. The answer is: $100$

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The equation is satisfied if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

This means that either $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The solutions to these equations are the lines $x+y=10$, $x-y=10$, $x=-8$, $x=8$, $y=-8$, and $y=8$.

Plotting these lines in a coordinate plane, we find that they enclose a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. 

If the first expression is zero, then either $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x-y| - 10 = 0$. This implies $|x+y| = 10$ or $|x-y| = 10$. In the coordinate plane, these equations represent a square with side length 20.

If the second expression is zero, then either $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$. This implies $|x| = 8$ or $|y| = 8$. In the coordinate plane, these equations represent a square with side length 16.

Therefore, the convex polygon that the points enclose is the intersection of these two squares. The intersection is a square with side length equal to the shorter side of the two squares, which is 8. The area of the square is $8^2 = 64$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 Since the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero, the equation is satisfied if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. 

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ which means $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$. 
If $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ which means $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$. 
If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ which means $x = 8$ or $x = -8$. 
If $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert y \vert = 8$ which means $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. 

The solutions to these equations are the vertices of the polygon, and the polygon is a square with side length 16 (the distance between the lines $x+y=10$ and $x+y=-10$ is 16, and the same for the other three lines). 

The area of a square is the side length squared, so the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $\boxed{256}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The equation is given as:
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0\]
For the product of two terms to be zero, either one of the terms must be zero.
This gives us two sets of conditions:
1) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
2) $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
From the first set of conditions:
$\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
This implies $-10 \leq x + y \leq 10$, $-8 \leq x \leq 8$, and $-8 \leq y \leq 8$.
From the second set of conditions:
$\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
This implies $-10 \leq x - y \leq 10$, $-8 \leq x \leq 8$, and $-8 \leq y \leq 8$.
So the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equation are in the intersection of these four regions.
The intersection is a square with side length 16.
The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. Let's analyze each term:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = \pm 10$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = \pm 8$.

By solving these equations, we can find the vertices of the polygon:
- For $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, we get $(x, y) = (5, 5)$.
- For $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$, we get $(x, y) = (-5, -5)$.
- For $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$, we get $(x, y) = (0, 10)$ and $(x, y) = (10, 0)$.
- For $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$, we get $(x, y) = (0, -10)$ and $(x, y) = (-10, 0)$.
- For $x = 8$ and $y = 8$, we get $(x, y) = (8, 8)$.
- For $x = -8$ and $y = -8$, we get $(x, y) = (-8, -8)$.

So the polygon is a square with side length 20. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. This equation is satisfied if either of the two factors is zero.

The first factor is zero when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of a square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$.

The second factor is zero when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of a square with side length $16$.

Combining these two sets of vertices, we see that the points $\left(x, y\right)$ that satisfy the given equation form a larger square with side length $16$. The smaller square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$ is entirely inside this larger square.

The area of a square with side length $a$ is $a^2$, so the area of the smaller square is $(10\sqrt{2})^2 = 200$ and the area of the larger square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon formed by the points $\left(x, y\right)$ is the area of the larger square minus the area of the smaller square, which is $256 - 200 = 56$. The answer is: $56$.
