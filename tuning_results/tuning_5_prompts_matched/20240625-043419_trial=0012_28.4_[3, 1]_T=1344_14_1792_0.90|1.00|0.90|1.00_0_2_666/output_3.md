This problem seems to be a bit complicated to be solved directly using Python. Instead, let's try to analyze the problem and simplify it.

The equation given is: $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

For the product of two numbers to be zero, either one of the numbers must be zero. So, either $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$ or $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

If $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length 10.

Similarly, if $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length 16.

The intersection of the two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for. The side length of the smaller square is 10, so its area is $10^2 = 100$. The side length of the larger square is 16, so its area is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the difference between the area of the larger square and the area of the smaller square: $256 - 100 = 156$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 156. The answer is: $156$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if both factors are equal to zero. 

The factor $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$ equals zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These equations represent two lines in the plane: $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$. These lines intersect at the points $(5,5)$ and $(5,-5)$. The lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ intersect at the points $(5,5)$ and $(5,-5)$, respectively, forming a rectangle with vertices at $(5,5)$, $(-5,5)$, $(-5,-5)$, and $(5,-5)$.

The factor $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ equals zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These equations represent two lines in the plane: $x = 8$ and $x = -8$, and $y = 8$ and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with vertices at $(8,8)$, $(-8,8)$, $(-8,-8)$, and $(8,-8)$.

The intersection of the rectangle and the square is the convex polygon formed by the points $(5,5)$, $(-5,5)$, $(-5,-5)$, and $(5,-5)$. The area of this convex polygon is the area of the rectangle, which is the product of its length and width. The length of the rectangle is $10$ units (the difference between $x+y$ and $x-y$), and the width is $10$ units (the sum of $x$ and $y$ at the points $(5,5)$ and $(5,-5)$). Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $10 \times 10 = 100$ square units.

So the area of the convex polygon is $100$. The answer is: $100$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The equation is given by $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. In order for the product of two numbers to be zero, one of them must be zero. So, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which give us the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$. Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which give us the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$.

These lines enclose a square with side length 10, since the distance from the line $x + y = 10$ to the line $x - y = 10$ is 10 (when $x = 0$), and the distance from the line $x = 8$ to the line $y = 8$ is also 10 (when $y = 0$).

The area of this square is the side length squared, which is $10^2 = 100$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: 100.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The expression $ab = 0$ if and only if $a = 0$ or $b = 0$. Therefore, the given equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The first equation implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the square as $(5, 5), (5, -5), (-5, -5), (-5, 5)$.
The second equation implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the square as $(8, 0), (0, 8), (-8, 0), (0, -8)$.
The union of these two squares forms a rectangle with side lengths 10 and 16. The area of this rectangle is $10 \times 16 = 160$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 160. The answer is: $160$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The given equation is of the form $A*B = 0$. Hence, either $A=0$ or $B=0$. We need to find the area of the polygon enclosed by the points that satisfy either $A=0$ or $B=0$.

1. Set $A = (|x + y| - 10)^2 + (|x - y| - 10)^2 = 0$. This gives $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$. From these, we have four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(8, 2)$, $(8, -12)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -12)$.
2. Set $B = (|x| - 8)^2 + (|y| - 8)^2 = 0$. This gives $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. From these, we have four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.
3. The convex polygon formed by the intersection of the regions defined by $A=0$ and $B=0$ is a square with side length 16.

The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import *

# Define the side length of the square
side_length = 16

# Calculate the area of the square
area = side_length**2
print(area)
```

The area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:


The equation $A \cdot B = 0$ implies that $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. So we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ 
This implies that $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, so $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This is the equation of a square with side length 20.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
This implies that $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, so $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This is the equation of a square with side length 16.

The intersection of these two squares forms a smaller square with side length 8. So the area of the convex polygon is $8^2 = 64$. The answer is: 64

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. Therefore, either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.
The first term is zero when $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
The second term is zero when $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
From the first set of equations, we have $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the four vertices of the square as $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0)$.
From the second set of equations, we have $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations, we get the four vertices of the square as $(8, 0), (-8, 0), (0, 8), (0, -8)$.
The vertices of the polygon formed by the union of these two squares are the points where the vertices of the two squares intersect. The convex polygon formed by these vertices is a square with side length 10. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $10^2 = 100$.
```python

The area of the convex polygon is $100$. The answer is $\boxed{100}$.
