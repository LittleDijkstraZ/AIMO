Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The equation is equal to 0 if either of the factors is equal to 0. Therefore, we have three cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. This gives us two lines: $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ which implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us two lines: $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$. This gives us two lines: $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ which implies $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us two lines: $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

These lines form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10 \times 10 = 100$. So, the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The problem asks for the area of a convex polygon formed by the points that satisfy the given equation. Since the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero, the equation is satisfied if at least one of the following conditions holds:

1. $(|\vert x + y \vert - 10|^2 + |\vert x - y \vert - 10|^2) = 0$
2. $(|\vert x \vert - 8|^2 + |\vert y \vert - 8|^2) = 0$

For the first condition to hold, we must have $|\vert x + y \vert - 10| = 0$ and $|\vert x - y \vert - 10| = 0$. This implies that $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$. The only natural numbers that satisfy these conditions are $(x, y) = (5, 5), (5, -5), (-5, 5), (-5, -5)$.

For the second condition to hold, we must have $|\vert x \vert - 8| = 0$ and $|\vert y \vert - 8| = 0$. This implies that $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. The only natural numbers that satisfy these conditions are $(x, y) = (8, 8), (8, 0), (0, 8), (0, 0), (8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$.

Combining both conditions, we find that the points that satisfy the equation are $(5, 5), (5, -5), (-5, 5), (-5, -5), (8, 8), (8, 0), (0, 8), (0, 0), (8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$.

The points form a square with side length $10$, so the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The expression is equal to zero if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. These equations are satisfied when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$. Solving these equations gives the vertices of the polygon: $(8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, $(-8, 0)$, $(0, -8)$, $(8, 10)$, $(10, 8)$, $(-8, -10)$, and $(-10, -8)$.

These points form a square with side length 16. The area of a square is given by the side length squared, so the area of the polygon is $16^2 = 256$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so one of the expressions must be zero for the product to be zero. This gives us two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From the first case, we have:

$\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$

This implies $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$, which gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. The points enclosed by these lines form a square with side length 10.

From the second case, we have:

$\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$

This implies $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$, which gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. The points enclosed by these lines also form a square with side length 16.

The convex polygon formed by the union of the two sets of points is a larger square with side length 16.The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So the area of the convex polygon is $256$.
The answer is: $256$

For the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us $x = \pm 10$ and $y = 0$ or $x = 0$ and $y = \pm 10$. So the points are at $(10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, $(-10, 0)$, and $(0, -10)$.

For the second case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So the points are at $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

Plotting these points on a coordinate plane, we see that they form a square with side length $20$. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.
The answer is: 400

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, which means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. This expression is zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$, which give us the system of equations:

1. $x + y = 10$
2. $x + y = -10$
3. $x - y = 10$
4. $x - y = -10$

Solving these systems of equations, we find that the points are: $((5,5),(-5,-5), (5,-5), (-5,5))$.

The second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. This expression is zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$, which gives us the system of equations:

1. $x = 8$
2. $x = -8$
3. $y = 8$
4. $y = -8$

Solving these systems of equations, we find that the points are: $((8,8), (-8,-8), (8,-8), (-8,8))$.

The points that satisfy the equation are the intersections of these two sets of points, which are the vertices of a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two terms, both of which must be zero for the equation to be true. Therefore, we have two separate cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This means that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This means that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

For the first case, we have $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the four points $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, and $(-5,-5)$.

For the second case, we have $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations, we get the four points $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

The eight points form a square with side length $10$. The area of the square is $10^2 = 100$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $100$.

Here is a Python code to calculate the area:
```python

    # Calculate the side length of the square
    side_length = 10

    # Calculate the area of the square
    area = side_length ** 2
