Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The given equation is a product of two terms equals to zero. This means that at least one of the terms must be zero for the equation to be true. 

2. For the first term, either $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x - y| - 10 = 0$. This implies $|x+y| = 10$ or $|x - y| = 10$.

3. For the second term, either $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$. This implies $|x| = 8$ or $|y| = 8$.

4. Combining the above results, we get four cases:
   a) $x+y = \pm 10$ and $x = \pm 8$.
   b) $x+y = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 8$.
   c) $x - y = \pm 10$ and $x = \pm 8$.
   d) $x - y = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 8$.

5. Solving these four cases, we find the vertices of the polygon: $(\pm 8, 0), (0, \pm 8), (\pm 6, \pm 6)$.

6. The vertices of the polygon form a square with side length $8\sqrt{2}$.

7. The area of the square is side length squared, so the area is $(8\sqrt{2})^2 = 128$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 128. The answer is: $128$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The given equation is:
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0\]

This equation equals to zero if either of the two products equals to zero. So we have two cases:

1) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
2) $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

Let's solve each case:

For case 1):
From $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. This gives us two lines: $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.
From $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$, which gives us two lines: $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.
From $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us two lines: $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

The intersection of these lines form a square with side length 10, so the area is $10^2 = 100$.

For case 2):
From $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us two lines: $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.
From $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$, which gives us two lines: $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.
From $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us two lines: $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

The intersection of these lines form a square with side length 10, so the area is also $10^2 = 100$.

Adding the areas from both cases, we have a total area of $100 + 100 = 200$.

However, we must consider that the points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying the equation are only in the first quadrant ($x, y \geq 0$), so we need to take only the first quadrant part of the square. The area of the first quadrant part of the square is $\frac{100}{4} = 25$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 25. The answer is: $25$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The expression $A \cdot B = 0$ is equivalent to $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. So the given equation is equivalent to the union of the two equations:

1. $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$.
2. $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

The first equation implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which are the equations of two lines in the plane. The second equation implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which are the equations of two squares in the plane. 

The intersection of these lines and squares form a convex polygon, which is the region enclosed by the four lines $x + y = \pm 10$, $x - y = \pm 10$, $x = \pm 8$, and $y = \pm 8$.

To find the area of this polygon, we can calculate the area of each square and subtract the area of the four overlapping triangles. The side length of the squares is 16 (from $\vert x \vert = 8$), so the area of each square is $16^2 = 256$. There are four squares in total, so the total area of the squares is $4 \cdot 256 = 1024$.

The overlapping triangles are isosceles right triangles with legs of length 10 (from $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$), so their area is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot 10^2 = 50$. There are four overlapping triangles in total, so the total area of the overlapping triangles is $4 \cdot 50 = 200$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the total area of the squares minus the total area of the overlapping triangles, which is $1024 - 200 = 824$. So the area of the convex polygon is 824.

However, it seems that we've made a mistake. The side length of the squares should be 16, not 8. Let's correct this.

The side length of the squares is now 16 (from $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$), so the area of each square is $16^2 = 256$. There are four squares in total, so the total area of the squares is $4 \cdot 256 = 1024$.

The overlapping triangles are isosceles right triangles with legs of length 10 (from $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$), so their area is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot 10^2 = 50$. There are four overlapping triangles in total, so the total area of the overlapping triangles is $4 \cdot 50 = 200$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the total area of the squares minus the total area of the overlapping triangles, which is $1024 - 200 = 824$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 824.

The answer is: $824$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We have a system of equations: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. For the first equation, $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
3. Similarly, for the second equation, $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$, which implies that $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
4. To satisfy both equations, we need to consider the intersections of the solutions. For example, if $x + y = 10$, then we can find the corresponding $y$ for each $x$ value.
5. Plotting these points, we can see that they form a rectangle with vertices at $(8, 2)$, $(8, -18)$, $(-8, 18)$, and $(-8, -2)$.
6. The length of the rectangle is $16$ (from $8$ to $-8$) and the width is $20$ (from $2$ to $-18$), so the area is $16 \times 20 = 320$.

The area of the convex polygon is $320$.
The answer is: $320$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. If $A \cdot B = 0$, either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$.
2. So, if we multiply two expressions, the product equals zero if any of the two expressions equals zero.
3. So we can break down our problem into two cases:

Case 1: $ ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$
4. From step 1, this is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) = 0$.
5. Solving these two equations, we get $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.
6. These are the equations of four lines, and plotting these lines on a graph will give us a square with side length 20.

Case 2: $ ((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$
7. From step 1, this is equivalent to either $(\vert x \vert - 8) = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8) = 0$.
8. Solving these two equations, we get $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
9. These are the equations of four lines, and plotting these lines on a graph will give us a square with side length 16.

10. The convex polygon formed by the intersection of the regions defined by the two cases is the intersection of the two squares.
11. This intersection is a square with side length equal to the smaller side of the two squares, which is 8.
12. The area of the square is $8^2 = 64$.

The area of the convex polygon is 64 square units.

So the final answer is $\boxed{64}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The condition $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only possible solution for this condition is $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$.

Similarly, the condition $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

So the points that satisfy both conditions are $(\pm 10, \pm 10)$ and $(\pm 8, \pm 8)$.

The points $(\pm 10, \pm 10)$ form a square with side length 20, and the area of this square is $20^2 = 400$. The points $(\pm 8, \pm 8)$ form a square with side length 16, and the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

The union of these two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for.

Therefore, the area of this convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares, which is $400 + 256 = 656$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



This problem involves absolute values, which can be tricky to deal with. However, we can simplify this problem by noting that the expression will be zero if either of the factors is zero. This allows us to solve two separate systems of inequalities.

First, consider the factor $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. For this to be zero, we must have:

$$\vert x + y \vert = 10 \quad \text{and} \quad \vert x - y \vert = 10.$$

This represents a square with side length 20.

Second, consider the factor $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. For this to be zero, we must have:

$$\vert x \vert = 8 \quad \text{and} \quad \vert y \vert = 8.$$

This represents a square with side length 16.

Now, to find the intersection of these two regions, we can simply draw the squares on the same coordinate plane and find their intersection. The intersection is a smaller square, with side length equal to the difference of the side lengths of the two squares, which is $20 - 16 = 4$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $4^2 = 16$.

So the area of the convex polygon is $16$. The answer is: $16$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The expression is equal to 0 if and only if both factors are equal to 0. So we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For case 1, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us the rectangle with vertices $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

For case 2, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us the rectangle with vertices $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

So, the points satisfying the equation are the vertices of a rectangle with side lengths of 16 and 16, which is a square. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Step 1: Analyzing the equations, we can see that the only way to get the product of two numbers equal to zero is if at least one of them is zero. So, we have two separate cases:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

Step 2: Solving each case:

Case 1: For $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
Similarly, for $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.

Case 2: For $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
Similarly, for $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

Step 3: Combining the solutions from the two cases, we have the following vertices of the polygon:

$(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8), (10, 0), (0, 10), (-10, 0), (0, -10)$.

Step 4: Plotting these points on a graph, we can see that these points form a square with side length 16.

Step 5: The area of a square is given by the square of its side length, so the area of the polygon is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    # The side length of the square
    side_length = 16

    # The area of the square

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

The area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{256}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, we need to notice that the expression inside the brackets will equal zero only when each of the terms equals zero. Therefore, we have two sets of equations:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first set of equations, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get four possible solutions: $(x, y) = (5, 5), (5, -5), (-5, 5), (-5, -5)$.

For the second set of equations, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations, we get four more possible solutions: $(x, y) = (8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$.

Therefore, the eight points that satisfy the given equation are: $(5, 5), (5, -5), (-5, 5), (-5, -5), (8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$. These eight points form a square with side length 10, so its area is $10^2 = 100$.

So the area of the convex polygon is $100$. The answer is: $100$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, we know that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The set of points satisfying one of these conditions form a square with side length $20$.

For the second case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. The set of points satisfying one of these conditions form a square with side length $16$.

Therefore, the set of points satisfying both conditions form a square with side length $20$, which is the convex polygon we are looking for.

To find the area of this square, we simply square the side length, so the area is $20^2 = 400$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $400$.
The answer is: $400$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, we notice that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if one or both of the numbers are zero. So we have two equations to solve:

   (i) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, and
   (ii) $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, or
   (iii) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or
   (iv) $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

2. Each of these equations simplifies to:

   (i) $\vert x + y \vert = 10$,
   (ii) $\vert x - y \vert = 10$,
   (iii) $\vert x \vert = 8$, and
   (iv) $\vert y \vert = 8$.

3. Solving (iii) and (iv) gives us the coordinates of the vertices of the polygon:

   (A) $(8, 8)$, (B) $(-8, 8)$, (C) $(-8, -8)$, and (D) $(8, -8)$.

4. Now we need to calculate the area of the polygon. The polygon ABCD forms a square with side length 16. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the polygon is 256.

The entire script to solve this problem is as follows:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solve, Abs

def polygon_area():
    # Coordinates of the vertices of the polygon
    A = (8, 8)
    B = (-8, 8)
    C = (-8, -8)
    D = (8, -8)

    # Calculate the side length of the square
    side_length = max(A[0] - B[0], A[1] - B[1])

    # Calculate the area of the square
    area = side_length**2

    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the polygon is $\boxed{256}$.
