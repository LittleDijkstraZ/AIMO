 The problem is asking for the area of a convex polygon that is enclosed by the points $\left(x, y\right)$ that satisfy the equation $$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$
The equation equals zero when either of the factors equals zero. Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the following conditions:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \implies \vert x + y \vert = 10$,
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \implies \vert x - y \vert = 10$,
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \implies \vert x \vert = 8$,
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \implies \vert y \vert = 8$.
These conditions define a square with side length 16 (the square is centered at the origin and has side length twice the absolute value of the coordinates that make each factor equal to zero). Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of the square, which is calculated as the side length squared: $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The condition $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ encloses a polygon. It equals zero when either of the two factors equals zero. 

The first factor equals zero when both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only way this can be true is if $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$. This gives us a square with side length 20.

The second factor equals zero when both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. This implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The only way this can be true is if $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us a square with side length 16.

Therefore, the area of the polygon is the sum of the areas of these two squares. The area of a square with side length $a$ is $a^2$, so the area of the larger square is $20^2 = 400$, and the area of the smaller square is $16^2 = 256$.

Adding these two areas gives the total area of the polygon as $400 + 256 = 656$. 

Since the problem asks for a numerical answer, the final answer is $\boxed{656}$. Now let's code it using Sympy.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Rational, simplify

def calculate_area():
    # Side lengths of the squares
    side1 = 20
    side2 = 16

    # Areas of the squares
    area1 = side1**2
    area2 = side2**2

    # Total area of the polygon
    total_area = area1 + area2

    return total_area

result = calculate_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 656

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
656
```
The area of the convex polygon is 656 square units. Hence, the answer is $\boxed{656}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Step 1: The given equation is $0 = 0$. Obviously, this equation holds true for all values of x and y. 

Step 2: The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ can only be true when both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. From these, we get that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the coordinates $(5,5), (5,-5), (-5,5), (-5,-5)$.

Step 3: The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ can only be true when both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. From these, we get that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the coordinates $(8,0), (8,8), (0,8), (-8,8), (-8,0), (-8,-8), (0,-8), (8,-8)$.

Step 4: Now, we need to find the intersection points of these coordinates. The intersection points are $(8,0), (8,8), (0,8), (-8,8), (-8,0), (-8,-8), (0,-8), (8,-8), (5,5), (5,-5), (-5,5), (-5,-5)$.

Step 5: Plot these points on a coordinate plane. We observe that these points form a square with side length $10$.

Step 6: The area of the square is $side^2 = 10^2 = 100$. So the area of the convex polygon is $100$.

So the area of the convex polygon is $100$. Thus, the final answer is $100$. However, because the problem asks for a positive integer answer, the correct answer is $100$.

    # The side length of the square is 10
    side_length = 10

    # The area of the square is side^2

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The equation given is equivalent to the product of two equations being zero:
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0\]
and
\[((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]
The first equation implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. This gives us four equations:
\[x + y = 10, \quad x + y = -10, \quad x - y = 10, \quad x - y = -10.\]
Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8,2)$, $(8,-2)$, $(-8,2)$, and $(-8,-2)$.
The second equation implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us another four points: $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.
All these eight points are on the vertices of the square. Therefore, the convex polygon is a square with side length 16.
The area of a square is the square of the side length, so the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
```python

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, which means that either of the expressions must be zero for the product to be zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. In this case, both expressions inside the parentheses must be zero, which gives us:
$\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. 
This implies that the points lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ or their opposites $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. In this case, both expressions inside the parentheses must be zero, which gives us:
$\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. 
This implies that the points lie on the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$ or their opposites $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

The four lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$ form a square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$, while the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$ form a square with side length 16.

The intersection of these two sets of lines forms a smaller square inside the larger one. The side length of the smaller square is the difference of the side lengths of the larger and smaller squares, which is $16 - 10\sqrt{2}$. The area of a square is the square of its side length, so the area of the convex polygon is $(16 - 10\sqrt{2})^2$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import sqrt

def area_of_polygon():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    side_length = 16 - 10*sqrt(2)
    area = side_length**2

    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
(16 - 10*sqrt(2))**2
```

The area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{(16 - 10\sqrt{2})^2}$. However, this expression is not simplified. Let's simplify it further.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import simplify

def simplify_area():
    """Simplify the area of the convex polygon."""
    area = (16 - 10*sqrt(2))**2
    simplified_area = simplify(area)

result = simplify_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 456 - 320*sqrt(2)

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
456 - 320*sqrt(2)
```

The simplified area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{456 - 320\sqrt{2}}$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $456 - 320\sqrt{2}$.

Unfortunately, this is not the correct solution. We made a mistake when we tried to simplify the area of the polygon. Let's go back and check our work.

The area of the larger square is $10\sqrt{2} \times 10\sqrt{2} = 200$, and the area of the smaller square is $16 \times 16 = 256$. The area of the convex polygon is the difference of these two areas, which is $256 - 200 = 56$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $56$.

The value we got earlier, $(16 - 10\sqrt{2})^2$, is not the area of the polygon. It is the square of the side length of the smaller square, but we need to find the difference of the areas of the larger and smaller squares. Let's go back to the beginning and correct our work.

The intersection of the two sets of lines forms a smaller square inside the larger one. The side length of the smaller square is the difference of the side lengths of the larger and smaller squares, which is $16 - 10\sqrt{2}$. The area of the smaller square is then $(16 - 10\sqrt{2})^2$.

To find the area of the convex polygon, we need to subtract this area from the area of the larger square. The area of the larger square is $10\sqrt{2} \times 10\sqrt{2} = 200$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $200 - (16 - 10\sqrt{2})^2$. Let's simplify this expression.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import simplify

def simplify_area():
    """Simplify the area of the convex polygon."""
    area = 200 - (16 - 10*sqrt(2))**2
    simplified_area = simplify(area)

    return simplified_area

result = simplify_area()
print(result)
``````output

CODE RESULTS -256 + 320*sqrt(2)

INTERMEDIATE OUT :

-256 + 320*sqrt(2)
```

The simplified area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{-256 + 320\sqrt{2}}$.

However, this is not the correct area of the polygon. The area should be positive. Let's go back and correct our work again.

The intersection of the two sets of lines forms a smaller square inside the larger one. The side length of the smaller square is the difference of the side lengths of the larger and smaller squares, which is $16 - 10\sqrt{2}$. The area of the smaller square is then $(16 - 10\sqrt{2})^2$.

To find the area of the convex polygon, we need to subtract this area from the area of the larger square. The area of the larger square is $10\sqrt{2} \times 10\sqrt{2} = 200$. So, the area of the convex polygon is $200 - (16 - 10\sqrt{2})^2$.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So the given equation is equal to zero if and only if 
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0\]
or 
\[((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]
The first equation is satisfied if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations we get the vertices of a square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$:
\[(5\sqrt{2}, 5\sqrt{2}), (5\sqrt{2}, -5\sqrt{2}), (-5\sqrt{2}, -5\sqrt{2}), (-5\sqrt{2}, 5\sqrt{2}).\]
The second equation is satisfied if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations we get the vertices of a square with side length $16$:
\[(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, -8), (-8, 8).\]
Thus, the points satisfying the given equation are the union of these two squares. The area of the first square is $(10\sqrt{2})^2 = 200$, and the area of the second square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $200 + 256 = 456$.
The answer is: $456$

Assistant:

 To find the area of the convex polygon formed by the points that satisfy the given condition, we first need to understand the condition itself. The condition is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

This condition is satisfied if either of the two terms in the product is zero. 

The first term, $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, being zero means that both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the points $(\pm 10, 0)$, $(0, \pm 10)$, $(\pm 5, \pm 5)$.

The second term, $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$, being zero means that $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So we get the points $(\pm 8, 0)$, $(0, \pm 8)$.

By plotting these points on a graph, we find that they form a square with side length 10 units. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$ square units. So the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These conditions hold only when $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$. Similarly, the expression $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These conditions hold only when $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
Therefore, the polygon is a square with side length 20 (from $-10$ to $10$ on the x-axis and y-axis, and from $-8$ to $8$ on the x and y axes). The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of this square is $20^2 = 400$. The answer is: 400.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So the given equation is equivalent to the system of equations:
1. $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$
2. $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$

From the second equation, we get that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, so $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. These give us a total of 4 points: $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

Now let's analyze the first equation. It simplifies to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This system of equations represents a square with side length 10. The vertices of this square are the points that make both equations true.

By drawing a diagram, we can see that the square formed by the vertices $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$ is the convex polygon we are looking for.

The area of this square is $10 \times 10 = 100$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100.
