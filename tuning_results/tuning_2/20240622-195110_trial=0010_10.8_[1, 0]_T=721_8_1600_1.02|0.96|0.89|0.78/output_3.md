Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first list the problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge, and thens solve the problem step by step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions, and related knowledge are as follows:

1. The equation is of the form $AB = 0$, which means that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$.
2. The absolute value function $\vert x \vert$ is defined as $x$ if $x \geq 0$ and $-x$ if $x < 0$.
3. To find the area of the polygon, we need to find the number of points satisfying the equation and then use the formula for the area of a polygon.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step.

Step 1: Simplify the equation

We have $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
Since the product of two numbers is zero if and only if one of the numbers is zero, we have two cases:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
The square of a real number is zero if and only if the number itself is zero. Therefore, we have $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$.
This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

Step 2: Find the points satisfying the equation

From Case 1, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
The possible pairs $(x, y)$ satisfying these equations are: $(0, \pm 10), (\pm 10, 0), (\pm 5, \pm 5)$.

From Case 2, we have $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. The possible pairs $(x, y)$ satisfying these equations are: $(\pm 8, \pm 8)$.

Step 3: Find the number of points and the area of the polygon

The total number of points is $8$. The polygon is a square with side length $20$, so the area of the polygon is $20^2 = 400$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $400$. The answer is: $400$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge are:

1. The equation is satisfied if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$. Similarly, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ implies $x - y = \pm 10$. $\vert x \vert = 8$ implies $x = \pm 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$ implies $y = \pm 8$.
3. The solutions to these equations are the vertices of the polygon.
4. The area of the polygon can be found by counting the number of vertices and using the Shoelace formula.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. From $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$. This gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.
2. From $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = \pm 10$. This gives us two more lines: $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.
3. From $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$. This gives us two vertical lines: $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.
4. From $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = \pm 8$. This gives us two horizontal lines: $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.
5. The intersections of these lines are the vertices of the polygon. By solving these equations, we find the vertices: $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.
6. To find the area of the polygon, we use the Shoelace formula. The Shoelace formula for the area of a polygon with vertices $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), ..., (x_n, y_n)$ is given by:
\[ \frac{1}{2} |(x_1y_2 + x_2y_3 + ... + x_ny_1) - (y_1x_2 + y_2x_3 + ... + y_nx_1)|. \]

For the given polygon with vertices $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$, the Shoelace formula gives:
\[ \frac{1}{2} |(8*(-8) + 8*8 + (-8)*8 + 8*(-8)) - (8*8 + (-8)*(-8) + 8*8 + (-8)*(-8))| = 0. \]

This result is expected because the polygon is a square with side length 16. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge are:

1. The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is true if and only if either one of the two factors is zero.

2. If a product of two numbers is zero, then at least one of the numbers must be zero.

3. Therefore, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

4. If a square of a real number is zero, then the number itself must be zero.

5. Therefore, either $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.

6. This implies that either $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

7. Solving these equations, we get the following four sets of solutions:
   - $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, which gives $x = 10$ and $y = 0$.
   - $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$, which gives $x = 0$ and $y = 10$.
   - $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$, which gives $x = -10$ and $y = 0$.
   - $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$, which gives $x = 0$ and $y = -10$.
   - $x = 8$ and $y = 8$.
   - $x = 8$ and $y = -8$.
   - $x = -8$ and $y = 8$.
   - $x = -8$ and $y = -8$.

8. These solutions represent the vertices of a square with side length 10.

9. The area of a square with side length $s$ is $s^2$.

10. Therefore, the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two expressions being equal to zero, which means either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.

For the first expression to be zero, we have
$$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \text{ or } (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0.$$
This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
The absolute value equations can be split into two cases each:
Case 1: $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
Case 2: $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.

For the second expression to be zero, we have
$$(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \text{ or } (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0.$$
This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The absolute value equations can be split into two cases each:
Case 3: $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
Case 4: $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

Now we need to find the intersection of these cases.
From Case 1 and Case 3, we get the vertices $(8,2)$ and $(8,-2)$.
From Case 1 and Case 4, we get the vertices $(2,8)$ and $(-2,8)$.
From Case 2 and Case 3, we get the vertices $(-8,2)$ and $(-8,-2)$.
From Case 2 and Case 4, we get the vertices $(2,-8)$ and $(-2,-8)$.

These points form a rectangle with length $16$ and width $16$. So the area of the rectangle is $16 \times 16 = 256$.
The answer is $\boxed{256}$.

 The problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge are:
The equation is defined over the set of all real numbers. However, since we are dealing with absolute values and squares, the values of $x$ and $y$ must be such that the result of the operations under the square root is non-negative. This means that the expression inside the square root must be equal to zero. This gives us the following conditions:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert y \vert = 8$.
From conditions 3 and 4, we find that $-8 \leq x, y \leq 8$.
From conditions 1 and 2, we find that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.

Now, we can solve the system of equations formed by these conditions.
From $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$, we have the following possibilities:

1. If $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, then solving this system gives $x = 10$ and $y = 0$.
2. If $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$, then solving this system gives $x = 0$ and $y = 10$.
3. If $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$, then solving this system gives $x = -10$ and $y = 0$.
4. If $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$, then solving this system gives $x = 0$ and $y = -10$.

So the vertices of the polygon are $(10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, $(-10, 0)$, and $(0, -10)$.

To find the area of the polygon, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle and subtract the areas of the four right triangles that are formed at the corners. The rectangle has dimensions $20 \times 16$, so its area is $20 \times 16 = 320$. Each of the right triangles has legs of length 10 and 8, so their areas are $\frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 8 = 40$. Since there are four such triangles, the total area of the triangles is $4 \times 40 = 160$. Therefore, the area of the polygon is $320 - 160 = 160$. The answer is: $160$

 The given equation is: $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
For the product of two numbers to be zero, one of the numbers must be zero. Thus, either $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$ or $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
If $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. These points are the vertices of a square with side length 16. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.
If $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives the vertices of a square with side length 20. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.
Therefore, the convex polygon formed by the points is the union of the two squares, which is also a square. The side length of this square is the larger of the two side lengths, which is 20. The area of the square is $20^2 = 400$.
The answer is: 400.

The problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge are:

The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is equal to zero if and only if either of the factors is equal to zero. This gives us two sets of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For each set of equations, we have:

1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$
2. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$

The solutions to these equations are:

1. $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x = \pm 8$. This gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.
2. $x - y = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us four lines: $x - y = 10$, $x - y = -10$, $x + y = 10$, and $x + y = -10$.

The intersection points of these lines are the vertices of the polygon:

1. $(8, 2)$, $(8, -18)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, -18)$
2. $(18, 8)$, $(18, -8)$, $(-18, 8)$, $(-18, -8)$

The polygon formed by these points is a square with side length 20. The area of a square is the side length squared, so the area of this square is $20^2 = 400$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 400 square units. The answer is: $400$

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge are:

1. The equation is a product of two terms set equal to zero: $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. This means that either of the two terms must be zero for the entire equation to hold.

2. If either of the two terms is zero, then each term in the product must be zero because a product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero.

3. This gives us two sets of conditions: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

4. The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the conditions for a square with side length 10.

5. The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the conditions for a square with side length 16.

6. The points that satisfy either of these conditions form a square. The larger square has side length 16, and the smaller square has side length 10. The convex polygon formed by the intersection of these two squares is a smaller square with side length equal to the difference of the side lengths of the two squares, which is $16 - 10 = 6$.

7. The area of a square is given by the square of the side length, so the area of the convex polygon is $6^2 = 36$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 36. The answer is: $\boxed{36}$
