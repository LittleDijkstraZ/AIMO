 The problem asks for how many positive integers $m$ the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

First, we need to understand the nature of the equation. The left side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, is a function that takes on the value of $2-x$ when $x<1$, $1$ when $1\leq x\leq3$, and $x-3$ when $x>3$. This function is a V-shape with the vertex at $x=1$. The right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, is a horizontal line that varies with $m$.

The equation has $4$ distinct solutions when the horizontal line intersects the V-shape at $4$ different points. This happens when the height of the line is $1$ (one intersection), or between $0$ and $1$ (three intersections). Therefore, the possible values of $\frac{m}{100}$ are $1$ and numbers between $0$ and $1$.

For $\frac{m}{100}=1$, we have $m=100$. For $\frac{m}{100}$ between $0$ and $1$, we have $0<m<100$. Since $m$ must be a positive integer, the possible values of $m$ are $1$ through $99$.

Therefore, there are $99$ positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions. The answer is: $99$.

 The problem states that the equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. 

We first consider the absolute value equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$. 

The expression $|x - 1| - 2$ can be either positive or negative. So we have two cases to consider:

1. $|x - 1| - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$: In this case, $|x - 1| = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two sub-cases:
   a. $x - 1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.
   b. $x - 1 = -(2 + \frac{m}{100})$, which simplifies to $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

2. $|x - 1| - 2 = -\frac{m}{100}$: In this case, $|x - 1| = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two sub-cases:
   a. $x - 1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
   b. $x - 1 = -(2 - \frac{m}{100})$, which simplifies to $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

So we have a total of $4$ solutions: $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$, $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$, $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, and $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

These $4$ solutions are distinct if and only if the $4$ values of $\frac{m}{100}$ are distinct. 

This is true if and only if $m$ is an integer in the range $1 \leq m \leq 100$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $100$. The answer is: $100$

 The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

First, let's simplify the equation. Since $\frac{m}{100}$ is a positive number, the absolute value equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}=2$.

Solving the equation $\frac{m}{100}=2$ for $m$ gives $m=200$.

Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ that satisfies the conditions of the problem, namely $m=200$. The answer is: $1$

Assistant:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

We know that the absolute value function $\vert x \vert$ is defined as $x$ if $x \geq 0$ and $-x$ if $x < 0$. Therefore, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be split into two cases:

Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$.

Case 2: $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = \frac{m}{100}$.

For each case, we can solve the equation $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $-\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ respectively.

For Case 1, we have two sub-cases:

Sub-case 1.1: $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. Solving this gives $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Sub-case 1.2: $-(x-1) = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. Solving this gives $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

For Case 2, we again have two sub-cases:

Sub-case 2.1: $x-1 = -2 + \frac{m}{100}$. Solving this gives $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Sub-case 2.2: $-(x-1) = -2 + \frac{m}{100}$. Solving this gives $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Comparing the solutions from the four sub-cases, we see that there are two distinct solutions $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.

For the equation to have four distinct solutions, each of the two solutions must have two distinct values for $m$. This means that the difference between the two solutions must be an integer, which gives us $3 + \frac{m}{100} - (-1 + \frac{m}{100}) = 4$, so the difference between the two solutions must be an integer. This implies that $m = 200k$ for some integer $k$.

Since $m$ is a positive integer, $k$ must be a positive integer. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when $m = 200$.
The answer is: $1$

The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be rewritten as $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.

The expression inside the absolute value can be equal to $\frac{m}{100}$, $-\frac{m}{100}$, or any value between these two values.

We know that $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ can take on a maximum value of $2$ and a minimum value of $0$. Therefore, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be between $0$ and $2$. This means $0 \leq \frac{m}{100} \leq 2$, which simplifies to $0 \leq m \leq 200$.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $1$. This gives us $m=100$.

Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ that satisfies the given conditions, namely $m=100$. The answer is: $1$

Assistant:

 The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

The absolute value function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a piecewise form:
- If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 \geq 0$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \vert x-1 \vert - 2$.
- If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = -( \vert x-1 \vert - 2) = 2 - \vert x-1 \vert$.

So we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \vert x-1 \vert - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$.
This implies $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.
So we have two subcases:
- If $x-1 \geq 0$, then $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which gives $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.
- If $x-1 < 0$, then $-(x-1) = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which gives $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Case 2: $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = 2 - \vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$.
This implies $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
So we have two subcases:
- If $x-1 \geq 0$, then $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which gives $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
- If $x-1 < 0$, then $-(x-1) = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which gives $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

For the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, the four expressions for $x$ must be distinct. This happens when the four values of $\frac{m}{100}$ are distinct and non-negative.

This means $0 \leq \frac{m}{100} \leq 2$, which implies $0 \leq m \leq 200$.

So the positive integers $m$ that satisfy the equation are the integers from 1 to 200.

To count the number of such integers, we simply count the number of positive integers less than or equal to 200. There are 200 such integers.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 200. The answer is: $200$

Assistant:

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. This means that the right-hand side, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be a value that makes the equation true for 4 different values of $x$.

The expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a piecewise function with 4 cases to consider:

1. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 > 0$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \vert x-1 \vert - 2$.
2. If $0 \leq \vert x-1 \vert -2 \leq 1$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \vert x-1 \vert - 2$.
3. If $-1 < \vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = (\vert x-1 \vert - 2) \cdot -1 = 2 - \vert x-1 \vert$.
4. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = 2 - \vert x-1 \vert$.

Now, we need to find the values of $m$ that make the equation true for 4 different values of $x$. By analyzing the piecewise function, we can see that $\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal to 2 for the equation to have 4 distinct solutions. This is because:

- If $\frac{m}{100} > 2$, then the equation will have 2 solutions.
- If $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, then the equation will have 2 solutions.
- If $-1 < \frac{m}{100} < 0$, then the equation will have 2 solutions.
- If $\frac{m}{100} < -1$, then the equation will have no solutions.

Therefore, we need $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, which implies $m = 200$. So, there is only 1 value of $m$ that makes the equation true for 4 distinct solutions, and that value is $m = 200$. The answer is: $1$
