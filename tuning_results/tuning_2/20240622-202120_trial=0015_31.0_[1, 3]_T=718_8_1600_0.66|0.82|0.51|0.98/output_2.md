 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

First, let's consider the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$. Since $m$ is a positive integer, $\frac{m}{100}$ is a positive rational number.

Now, let's consider the left side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. This expression is equal to a non-negative value, and it is equal to $\frac{m}{100}$.

The expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ can be equal to a non-negative value in four ways:

1. When $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.
2. When $-\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = -2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
3. When $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
4. When $-\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.

However, the second and fourth cases are the same as the first and third cases respectively, so we only need to consider the first and third cases.

For the first case, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. This equation has two solutions: $x = 1 + 2 + \frac{m}{100} = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = 1 - (2 + \frac{m}{100}) = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

For the third case, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. This equation has two solutions: $x = 1 + (2 - \frac{m}{100}) = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = 1 - (2 - \frac{m}{100}) = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

So, the four distinct solutions of the equation are: $3 + \frac{m}{100}$, $-1 - \frac{m}{100}$, $3 - \frac{m}{100}$, and $-1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

For these four solutions to be distinct, we must have $-1 - \frac{m}{100} \neq 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, $-1 - \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 + \frac{m}{100}$, $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, and $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Simplifying these inequalities, we get:

1. $-1 - \frac{m}{100} \neq 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ gives $-4 \neq 0$, which is true.
2. $-1 - \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 + \frac{m}{100}$ gives $-\frac{m}{100} \neq \frac{m}{100}$, which gives $m \neq 0$.
3. $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ gives $\frac{m}{100} \neq -\frac{m}{100}$, which gives $m \neq 0$.
4. $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 + \frac{m}{100}$ gives $4 \neq 0$, which is true.

So, all these inequalities are true for all $m \neq 0$.

Now, we need to find the values of $m$ for which the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, is less than $2$. This gives $m < 200$.

Also, we need to find the values of $m$ for which the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, is greater than $0$. This gives $m > 0$.

Combining these two conditions, we get $0 < m < 200$.

The only positive integer $m$ in this range is $100$.

So, the only value of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $m = 100$.
The answer is: $1$

Assistant:

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

We know that the absolute value function $\vert x \vert$ is a piecewise function defined as:
\[
\vert x \vert = 
\begin{cases}
x & \text{if } x \geq 0 \\
-x & \text{if } x < 0
\end{cases}
\]

So, we can rewrite the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ as:
\[
\vert x-1 -2 \vert = \frac{m}{100} \quad \text{or} \quad \vert x-1 +2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
\vert x-3 \vert = \frac{m}{100} \quad \text{or} \quad \vert x+1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}
\]

For the first equation $\vert x-3 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, we have two cases:
\[
x-3 = \frac{m}{100} \quad \text{or} \quad -(x-3) = \frac{m}{100}
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
x = 3 + \frac{m}{100} \quad \text{or} \quad x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}
\]

For the second equation $\vert x+1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, we again have two cases:
\[
x+1 = \frac{m}{100} \quad \text{or} \quad -(x+1) = \frac{m}{100}
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
x = \frac{m}{100} - 1 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}
\]

For the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, the two pairs of solutions must intersect each other. This happens when the sum of the absolute values of the differences of the corresponding solutions is equal to the difference of the absolute values of the corresponding constants.

For the first pair of solutions $(3 + \frac{m}{100})$ and $(3 - \frac{m}{100})$, the difference is $\frac{m}{50}$.
For the second pair of solutions $(\frac{m}{100} - 1)$ and $(-1 - \frac{m}{100})$, the difference is $-\frac{m}{50} - 2$.

Setting the sum of the absolute values of the differences equal to the difference of the absolute values of the constants, we get:
\[
\left\vert \frac{m}{50} \right\vert + \left\vert -\frac{m}{50} - 2 \right\vert = \frac{m}{100}
\]

Solving this equation, we find that $m = 100$.

Therefore, the only value of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is $m = 100$. The answer is: $1$

Assistant:

 The equation has four distinct solutions, which means that the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be equal to one of the four values that make the left side of the equation have four distinct solutions.

The left side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, is a piecewise function that takes on the value $3-x$ when $x<1$, $1$ when $1\leq x\leq3$, and $x-3$ when $x>3$.

So, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $1$. Therefore, $m=100$.
The value of $m$ that makes the equation have four distinct solutions is $100$. The answer is: $1$

Assistant:

 The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

First, let's consider the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. The right-hand side of the equation is always non-negative, so the left-hand side must also be non-negative. This means that $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert \geq 0$. The absolute value function is always non-negative, so $\vert x-1 \vert -2 \geq 0$. Adding 2 to both sides gives $\vert x-1 \vert \geq 2$. The absolute value function is non-negative, so $x-1 \geq 2$ or $x-1 \leq -2$. Simplifying these inequalities gives $x \geq 3$ or $x \leq -1$. Therefore, the solutions to the equation must lie in the interval $(-\infty, -1] \cup [3, \infty)$.

Now, let's consider the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. This equation has 4 distinct solutions if and only if the equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2=\frac{m}{100}$ has 2 distinct solutions in each of the intervals $(-\infty, -1]$ and $[3, \infty)$.

For $x \in (-\infty, -1]$, the equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2=\frac{m}{100}$ becomes $1-x-2=\frac{m}{100}$, or $-x-1=\frac{m}{100}$. Multiplying both sides by -1 gives $x+1=-\frac{m}{100}$. This equation has 2 distinct solutions in the interval $(-\infty, -1]$ if and only if $-\frac{m}{100} > -1$, or $m < 100$.

For $x \in [3, \infty)$, the equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2=\frac{m}{100}$ becomes $x-1-2=\frac{m}{100}$, or $x-3=\frac{m}{100}$. This equation has 2 distinct solutions in the interval $[3, \infty)$ if and only if $\frac{m}{100} > 0$, or $m > 0$.

Combining these results, we see that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $0 < m < 100$. The positive integers $m$ in this range are 1, 2, ..., 99. Therefore, there are 99 positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions. The answer is: $99$

Assistant:

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.
We know that the absolute value function $\vert x \vert$ is a piecewise function defined as $x$ if $x \geq 0$ and $-x$ if $x < 0$.
So we can rewrite the equation as two cases:
Case 1: $\vert x-1 -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100} \Rightarrow \vert x-3 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$
Case 2: $\vert x-1 +2 \vert=\frac{m}{100} \Rightarrow \vert x+1 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$
For each case, we can solve the absolute value equations as follows:
Case 1: $\vert x-3 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ gives two equations: $x-3=\frac{m}{100}$ and $-(x-3)=\frac{m}{100}$.
Solving the first equation gives $x=3+\frac{m}{100}$.
Solving the second equation gives $x=3-\frac{m}{100}$.
Case 2: $\vert x+1 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ gives two equations: $x+1=\frac{m}{100}$ and $-(x+1)=\frac{m}{100}$.
Solving the first equation gives $x=\frac{m}{100}-1$.
Solving the second equation gives $x=-\frac{m}{100}-1$.
For the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, we need the following conditions:
1. $3+\frac{m}{100} > 3-\frac{m}{100}$ which simplifies to $\frac{m}{100} > -\frac{m}{100}$. This is true for all $m > 0$.
2. $3+\frac{m}{100} > -\frac{m}{100}-1$ which simplifies to $4 > \frac{m}{50}$. This gives $m < 200$.
3. $3-\frac{m}{100} < -\frac{m}{100}-1$ which simplifies to $-2 < -\frac{m}{50}$. This gives $m > 100$.
4. $\frac{m}{100}-1 > -\frac{m}{100}-1$ which simplifies to $\frac{m}{50} > 0$. This is true for all $m > 0$.
Combining the conditions, we find that $100 < m < 200$. The positive integers in this range are 101, 102, ..., 199, and there are 99 such numbers. Therefore, the value of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 99. The answer is: $1$
