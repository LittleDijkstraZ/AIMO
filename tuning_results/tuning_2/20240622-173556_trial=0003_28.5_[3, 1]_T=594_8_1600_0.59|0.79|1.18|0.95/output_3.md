Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first list the problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge, and thens solve the problem step by step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge are:

1. The equation is equal to zero if and only if both factors are equal to zero.
2. $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ implies $|x+y| = 10$, which means $x+y = \pm 10$.
3. $|x-y| - 10 = 0$ implies $|x-y| = 10$, which means $x-y = \pm 10$.
4. $|x| - 8 = 0$ implies $|x| = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$.
5. $|y| - 8 = 0$ implies $|y| = 8$, which means $y = \pm 8$.
6. The solutions to the system of equations $x+y = \pm 10$ and $x = \pm 8$ are $(8,2)$ and $(8,-2)$, and the solutions to the system of equations $x+y = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 8$ are $(2,8)$ and $(-2,8)$.
7. The points $(8,2)$, $(8,-2)$, $(2,8)$, and $(-2,8)$ form a rectangle.
8. The area of a rectangle is given by the product of its length and width.

To find the length and width of the rectangle, we can calculate the distances between the points:

- The distance between $(8,2)$ and $(8,-2)$ is $4$ (in the $y$-direction).
- The distance between $(8,2)$ and $(2,8)$ is $6$ (in the $x$-direction).

Therefore, the area of the rectangle is $4 \times 6 = 24$. The answer is: $24$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions, and related knowledge are as follows:

1. The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ must be satisfied by the points $(x, y)$ that lie on the boundary of the polygon.
2. The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$ can only be zero if both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies that $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ or $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.
3. The expression $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ can only be zero if both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
4. Combining the above results, we find that the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equation are those that lie on the lines $x + y = 10$, $x - y = 10$, $x - y = -10$, $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.
5. These lines form a square with side length 10.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. From the above analysis, we know that the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equation are those that lie on the lines $x + y = 10$, $x - y = 10$, $x - y = -10$, $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.
2. These lines form a square with side length 10.
3. The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side, so the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units. The answer is: $100$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge are:

1. The equation is equal to zero, which means that either the first term or the second term must be zero.
2. The absolute value function $|x|$ is equal to $x$ if $x \geq 0$ and $-x$ if $x < 0$.
3. The area of a polygon is the sum of the areas of its constituent triangles.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

Step 1: The equation is equal to zero if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

Step 2: If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.

Step 3: If $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.

Step 4: If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.

Step 5: If $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

Step 6: Combining the results from steps 2-5, we have the following cases:

1. $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, which gives $x = 10$ and $y = 0$.
2. $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$, which gives $x = 0$ and $y = 10$.
3. $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$, which gives $x = -10$ and $y = -20$.
4. $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$, which gives $x = -10$ and $y = 0$.
5. $x = 8$ and $y = 8$.
6. $x = 8$ and $y = -8$.
7. $x = -8$ and $y = 8$.
8. $x = -8$ and $y = -8$.

Step 7: The points are $(10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, $(-10, -20)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$. These points form a square with side length $20$.

Step 8: The area of the square is $20 \times 20 = 400$.
The answer is: $400$

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions, and related knowledge are as follows:

1. The equation is given as $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
2. The equation is equal to zero if either of the two factors is zero.
3. For the first factor to be zero, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) = 0$.
4. For the second factor to be zero, either $(\vert x \vert - 8) = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8) = 0$.
5. From these conditions, we can deduce that either $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
6. The absolute value equations can be split into two cases: $x + y = \pm 10$, $x - y = \pm 10$, $x = \pm 8$, or $y = \pm 8$.
7. By analyzing these cases, we can find the vertices of the polygon formed by the points that satisfy the equation.
8. The vertices of the polygon are $(8,0)$, $(0,8)$, $(-8,0)$, $(0,-8)$, $(8,10)$, $(8,-10)$, $(-8,10)$, and $(-8,-10)$.
9. To find the area of the polygon, we can use the Shoelace formula.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. List the vertices of the polygon: $(8,0)$, $(0,8)$, $(-8,0)$, $(0,-8)$, $(8,10)$, $(8,-10)$, $(-8,10)$, and $(-8,-10)$.
2. Apply the Shoelace formula to find the area of the polygon. The Shoelace formula states that if the vertices of a polygon are $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$, ..., $(x_n, y_n)$, then the area of the polygon is given by:

$$\frac{1}{2} \vert (x_1y_2 + x_2y_3 + \cdots + x_ny_1) - (y_1x_2 + y_2x_3 + \cdots + y_nx_1) \vert$$

3. For the given vertices, the Shoelace formula gives:

$$\frac{1}{2} \vert (8*8 + 0*(-8) + 8*10 + (-8)*(-10) + 0*0 + 8*0 + (-8)*0 + 0*8) - (0*0 + 8*8 + 0*(-8) + (-8)*10 + 8*(-10) + 0*0 + 0*8 + 8*0) \vert$$

4. Simplify the expression:

$$\frac{1}{2} \vert (64 + 0 + 80 + 80 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0) - (0 + 64 + 0 - 80 - 80 + 0 + 0 + 0) \vert$$

5. Further simplify:

$$\frac{1}{2} \vert (224) - (-164) \vert = \frac{1}{2} \vert 388 \vert = \frac{388}{2} = 194$$

So, the area of the polygon is 194 square units. The answer is: $194$

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.
The first term is zero when $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$.
These equations simplify to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
The second term is zero when $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.
These equations simplify to $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The solutions to these equations are the points that lie on the lines $x + y = \pm 10$, $x - y = \pm 10$, $x = \pm 8$, and $y = \pm 8$.
These lines form a square with side length 16.
The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
So the area of the convex polygon is 256.
The answer is: $256$

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge are as follows:

1. The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ must be satisfied for all points $(x, y)$ inside the polygon.
2. The equation is equal to zero if either of the two factors is zero.
3. A point $(x, y)$ satisfies $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$.
4. Similarly, a point $(x, y)$ satisfies $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ if and only if $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = \pm 10$.
5. A point $(x, y)$ satisfies $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$.
6. Similarly, a point $(x, y)$ satisfies $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ if and only if $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = \pm 8$.
7. The equations $x + y = \pm 10$, $x - y = \pm 10$, $x = \pm 8$, and $y = \pm 8$ form a set of lines that enclose a convex polygon.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. The lines $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$ form a square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$, because the distance between the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$ (or $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$) is $\sqrt{2} \cdot 10 = 10\sqrt{2}$.
2. The lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$ form a square with side length 16, because the distance between the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$ (or $y = 8$ and $y = -8$) is 16.
3. The intersection of these two squares is a smaller square.
4. The side length of the smaller square is the distance between the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x = 8$, which can be found by solving the system of equations:
   $$
   \begin{cases}
   x + y = 10 \\
   x = 8
   \end{cases}
   $$
   Substituting $x = 8$ into the first equation gives $8 + y = 10$, so $y = 2$. The point $(8, 2)$ lies on both lines, so the distance between the lines is the length of the segment with endpoints $(8, 2)$ and $(8, -2)$, which is 4. Therefore, the side length of the smaller square is 4.
5. The area of the smaller square is $4^2 = 16$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 16. The answer is: $16$

2. The equation is equal to zero if either of the two factors is zero.
3. A product of factors is zero if at least one of the factors is zero.
4. Therefore, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
5. For a square of a real number to be zero, the number itself must be zero.
6. Therefore, either $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.
7. Solving these equations gives the possible values of $x$ and $y$ as $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$ or $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$.
8. These points form a square with side length 16 (since the distance between the points $(8, 8)$ and $(8, -8)$ is 16).
9. The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side.
10. Therefore, the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first list the problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge, and thens solve the problem step by step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions, and related knowledge are as follows:

1. The equation is satisfied if either of the factors is zero.
2. The absolute value function $|x|$ is equal to $x$ if $x \geq 0$, and $-x$ if $x < 0$.
3. The area of a rectangle is given by the product of its length and width.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

The equation is satisfied if either of the factors is zero. So we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. This means $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.

Case 2: $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.

Case 3: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies $\vert x \vert = 8$. This means $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.

Case 4: $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

Combining all these cases, we find that the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equation are those that lie in the rectangle with vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(8, -8)$.

The length of the rectangle is $16$ (from $-8$ to $8$ in the $x$ direction) and the width is $16$ (from $-8$ to $8$ in the $y$ direction). Therefore, the area of the rectangle is $16 \times 16 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$
