Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first list the problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge, and thens solve the problem step by step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints are given by the equation:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$
This equation is equal to zero if and only if at least one of the factors is equal to zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
For the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 2), (8, -2), (-8, 2), (-8, -2)$.
For the second case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$.
The points satisfying the equation are the vertices of two squares. The first square has side length $20$ and the second square has side length $16$. The area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of these two squares. The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side, so the area of the first square is $20^2 = 400$ and the area of the second square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the total area of the convex polygon is $400 + 256 = 656$. The answer is: $656$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two terms, and for this product to be zero, either one of the terms must be zero. So we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. Solving these equations gives us $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$. So we have a square with side length $20$ and area $400$.

2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. Solving these equations gives us $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So we have a square with side length $16$ and area $256$.

The area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares, which is $400 + 256 = 656$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $656$.

The answer is: $656$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The given equation is $ ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

For the product of two numbers to be zero, either one of them must be zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us four equations: $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(8,2)$, $(8,-2)$, $(-8,2)$, and $(-8,-2)$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us four more vertices: $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

Now we have all eight vertices of the polygon: $(8,2)$, $(8,-2)$, $(-8,2)$, $(-8,-2)$, $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

The polygon is a square with side length 16 (since the distance between $(8,2)$ and $(8,-2)$ is 4, and the distance between $(8,2)$ and $(8,8)$ is 16).

The area of a square is the side length squared, so the area of the polygon is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions, and related knowledge are as follows:

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is true if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives $x = y = 5$ or $x = -y = 5$.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

So the points that satisfy the equation are $(5, 5)$, $(-5, -5)$, $(5, -5)$, $(-5, 5)$, $(8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, $(8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$. These points form a square with side length 10.

The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions, and related knowledge are as follows:

1. The equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
2. For the product of two numbers to be zero, one of the numbers must be zero.
3. Therefore, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
4. If a square of a real number is zero, then the number itself must be zero. So, either $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.
5. These equations simplify to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
6. The absolute value equations can be further simplified to $x + y = \pm 10$, $x - y = \pm 10$, $x = \pm 8$, and $y = \pm 8$.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

Step 1: Solve the absolute value equations.
From $x + y = \pm 10$, we get four equations: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.
From $x = \pm 8$, we get two equations: $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.
From $y = \pm 8$, we get two equations: $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

Step 2: Solve the system of equations.
We have 8 equations in total. We can solve them one by one:
- For $x + y = 10$ and $x = 8$, we get $y = 2$.
- For $x + y = 10$ and $y = 8$, we get $x = 2$.
- For $x + y = -10$ and $x = 8$, we get $y = -18$.
- For $x + y = -10$ and $y = 8$, we get $x = -18$.
- For $x - y = 10$ and $x = 8$, we get $y = -2$.
- For $x - y = 10$ and $y = 8$, we get $x = 18$.
- For $x - y = -10$ and $x = 8$, we get $y = 18$.
- For $x - y = -10$ and $y = 8$, we get $x = -2$.

Step 3: Identify the vertices of the polygon.
From the solutions we found, the vertices of the polygon are $(8, 2)$, $(8, -18)$, $(18, 8)$, $(-18, 8)$, $(8, -2)$, $(8, 18)$, $(-2, 8)$, and $(-2, -8)$.

Step 4: Calculate the area of the polygon.
The polygon is a rectangle with length 32 (from $(8, 2)$ to $(8, -18)$) and width 16 (from $(8, 2)$ to $(18, 2)$). The area of the rectangle is length times width, which is $32 \times 16 = 512$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 512. The answer is: $512$

 The problem's constraints, conditions, and related knowledge are as follows:

1. The equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
2. The equation is equal to zero if and only if either of the factors is zero.
3. If $ab = 0$, then $a = 0$ or $b = 0$.
4. Therefore, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
5. If a square of a real number is zero, then the number itself must be zero. So, either $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.
6. Solving the above equations gives the vertices of the polygon.
7. The area of the polygon can be found using the shoelace formula.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. If $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$. Similarly, if $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, then $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = \pm 10$.
2. If $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$. Similarly, if $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, then $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = \pm 8$.
3. Solving the above equations, we get the vertices of the polygon: $(10, 0), (0, 10), (-10, 0), (0, -10), (8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$.
4. The polygon is an octagon with side length 10.
5. The area of the octagon can be found using the shoelace formula. The shoelace formula for a polygon with vertices $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), \ldots, (x_n, y_n)$ is given by $\frac{1}{2} \vert (x_1y_2 + x_2y_3 + \cdots + x_ny_1) - (y_1x_2 + y_2x_3 + \cdots + y_nx_1) \vert$.
6. Applying the shoelace formula to the octagon with vertices $(10, 0), (0, 10), (-10, 0), (0, -10), (8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$, we get the area as $\frac{1}{2} \vert (10*10 + 0*-10 -10*0 + 0*10 + 8*8 + -8*-8 + 8*-8 + -8*8) - (0*10 + 10*0 - 0*-10 + -10*0 + 8*-8 + 8*8 + -8*-8 + -8*-8) \vert = 200$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 200 square units. The answer is: $200$

1. The equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
2. If the product of two numbers is zero, then at least one of the numbers must be zero. So, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
3. If the square of a number is zero, then the number itself must be zero. So, either $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.
4. For $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = \pm 10$.
5. For $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x - y = \pm 10$.
6. For $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$, which implies $x = \pm 8$.
7. For $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, we have $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $y = \pm 8$.
8. These equations represent a square with side length 16.
9. To find the area of the square, we use the formula $A = s^2$, where $s$ is the side length. So, $A = 16^2 = 256$.

The area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$

 The problem's constraints, conditions, and related knowledge are:

1. The equation is given as $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
2. The equation equals zero if either of the two products equals zero.
3. The equation equals zero if $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
4. From the above, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
5. The absolute value equations can be split into two separate equations: $x + y = \pm 10$, $x - y = \pm 10$, $x = \pm 8$, or $y = \pm 8$.
6. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. From $x + y = \pm 10$, we have four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.
2. From $x - y = \pm 10$, we have four more lines: $x - y = 10$, $x - y = -10$, $x + y = 10$, and $x + y = -10$.
3. From $x = \pm 8$, we have two lines: $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.
4. From $y = \pm 8$, we have two more lines: $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.
5. Combining all these lines, we get a square with side length 16.
6. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.
