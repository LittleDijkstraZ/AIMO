The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has exactly 4 distinct solutions.

First, we need to understand the behavior of the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. The function has a piecewise definition:
- If $x < -1$, then $f(x) = \vert -x - 1 - 2 \vert = \vert -x - 3 \vert = x + 3 + 2 = x + 5$.
- If $-1 \leq x < 1$, then $f(x) = \vert x - 1 - 2 \vert = \vert x - 3 \vert = 3 - x$.
- If $x \geq 1$, then $f(x) = \vert x - 1 - 2 \vert = \vert x - 3 \vert = x - 3 + 2 = x - 1$.

So, the function $f(x)$ is a "V" shape with vertices at $x = -1, 1$. The value of the function is $5$ when $x < -1$, decreases to $0$ when $-1 \leq x \leq 1$, and then decreases to $-1$ when $x > 1$.

Now, we want to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $f(x) = m/100$ has exactly 4 distinct solutions. This means we need to find the values of $m$ such that the line $y = m/100$ intersects the graph of $f(x)$ in exactly 4 points.

From the graph of $f(x)$, we can see that this happens when $0 < m/100 < 1$, which gives us $0 < m < 100$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy this condition is just 99.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has exactly 4 distinct solutions is 99. The answer is: $99$

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. The absolute value function is piecewise linear, and it will have a local minimum or maximum at the point where the two segments meet. Therefore, the right side of the equation $\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal to $1$. This gives us $m=100$. To verify that this value of $m$ works, we can substitute it into the equation and solve for $x$. The equation becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{100}{100}$, which simplifies to $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=1$. This equation has four distinct solutions: $x=3, x=1, x=-1, x=-3$. Therefore, the value of $m$ that satisfies the problem's conditions is $100$. The answer is: $1$

 The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

First, let's consider the absolute value function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. This function is a piecewise function with four cases to consider:

1. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 > 0$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \vert x-1 \vert -2$.
2. If $0 \leq \vert x-1 \vert -2 < 1$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \vert x-1 \vert -2$.
3. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 0$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = 0$.
4. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = 2 - \vert x-1 \vert$.

Now, let's consider the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. This equation will have $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ falls into the range $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 1$. This implies that $0 < m < 100$. The only positive integer $m$ in this range is $1$.

Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. The value of $m$ is $1$. The answer is: $1$

Assistant:

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

We first consider the right-hand side of the equation. Since $\frac{m}{100}$ is a positive number, $m$ must be a positive integer. Also, for the equation to have $4$ distinct solutions, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be less than $2$ but greater than $0$, because the absolute value function creates a V-shape graph with the maximum value being $2$. Therefore, we have $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which implies $0 < m < 200$.

Next, we consider the left-hand side of the equation. The function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a piecewise function with $4$ parts, and it creates a "hockey stick" shape graph. The graph reaches its minimum value of $0$ when $x=3$ or $x=-1$, and its maximum value of $2$ when $x=1$ or $x=5$. Therefore, for the equation to have $4$ distinct solutions, $\frac{m}{100}$ must fall into the interval $(0, 2)$.

To find the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy these conditions, we simply count the number of positive integers from $1$ to $199$. There are $199$ positive integers in this range.

However, we need to eliminate the values of $m$ that make the equation have only $2$ or $3$ distinct solutions. 

If the equation has only $2$ distinct solutions, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal to either $0$ or $2$. But as we mentioned earlier, $0 < m < 200$, so there are no such $m$.

If the equation has only $3$ distinct solutions, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal to either the value of the function at $x=3$, which is $0$, or the value of the function at $x=5$, which is $2$. In this case, $m$ would be $0$ or $200$, but both of these values do not fall into the interval $(0, 200)$.

Therefore, all the values of $m$ from $1$ to $199$ make the equation have $4$ distinct solutions. So the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition is $199$. The answer is: $199$

The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. 

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is equivalent to a piecewise function with four cases:

1. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 \geq 0$, then the equation becomes $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$.
2. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0$, then the equation becomes $-( \vert x-1 \vert -2) = \frac{m}{100}$.

Simplifying the first equation gives $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, and the second equation gives $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.

These two equations can be further simplified into four separate equations:

1. $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$,
2. $x-1 = -(2 + \frac{m}{100})$,
3. $-(x-1) = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$,
4. $-(x-1) = -(2 - \frac{m}{100})$.

Solving these equations, we find that the four solutions are:

1. $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$,
2. $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$,
3. $x = -1 + 2 - \frac{m}{100} = 1 - \frac{m}{100}$,
4. $x = 3 - 2 + \frac{m}{100} = 1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

For the equation to have four distinct solutions, the values of $x$ must be different from each other. This gives us the conditions:

1. $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 - \frac{m}{100}$,
2. $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq 1 - \frac{m}{100}$,
3. $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq 1 + \frac{m}{100}$,
4. $-1 - \frac{m}{100} \neq 1 - \frac{m}{100}$,
5. $-1 - \frac{m}{100} \neq 1 + \frac{m}{100}$,
6. $1 - \frac{m}{100} \neq 1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Solving these conditions, we find that $m$ must be equal to $100$. Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ such that the equation has $4$ distinct solutions, and that is $m = 100$. The answer is: $1$

 The problem is asking for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ involves absolute values, which can make it difficult to solve directly. However, we can break it down into cases based on the value of $x$.

Case 1: $x \geq 1$. In this case, the equation becomes $\vert x-1-2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert x-3 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. This equation has two solutions: $x=3+\frac{m}{100}$ and $x=3-\frac{m}{100}$.

Case 2: $0 \leq x < 1$. In this case, the equation becomes $\vert -x+1-2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert -x-1 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert x+1 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. This equation also has two solutions: $x=-1-\frac{m}{100}$ and $x=-1+\frac{m}{100}$.

For the equation to have $4$ distinct solutions, we need the two solutions from case $1$ to be different from the two solutions from case $2$. This means $-1-\frac{m}{100} < 3-\frac{m}{100} < -1+\frac{m}{100} < 3+\frac{m}{100}$. Simplifying these inequalities gives $-100 < m < 200$.

Since $m$ is a positive integer, the only possible values of $m$ are the integers from $1$ to $199$. Therefore, there are $199$ positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. The answer is: $199$

The problem is asking for how many positive integers $m$ does the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have $4$ distinct solutions.

The absolute value function $\vert x \vert$ splits into two cases: $x$ if $x \ge 0$ and $-x$ if $x < 0$. So, we have four cases to consider for the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$:

1. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 \ge 0$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \vert x-1 \vert -2$. So, the equation becomes $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$.

2. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = -( \vert x-1 \vert -2) = 2 - \vert x-1 \vert$. So, the equation becomes $2 - \vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$.

For each of these cases, we solve the resulting equations and count the number of distinct solutions.

For case 1, we have $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$. This simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.

For $x-1 \ge 0$, we have $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.

For $x-1 < 0$, we have $-(x-1) = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

For case 2, we have $2 - \vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$. This simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.

For $x-1 \ge 0$, we have $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.

For $x-1 < 0$, we have $-(x-1) = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

For each of these equations, we want to count the number of distinct solutions. The number of distinct solutions is the number of integer values of $m$ for which each equation has exactly two distinct solutions.

For case 1, the equation $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ has a solution if and only if $\frac{m}{100} \ge 0$, or $m \ge 0$. The equation $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$ has a solution if and only if $\frac{m}{100} \ge -2$, or $m \ge -200$. Therefore, the only values of $m$ for which both equations have solutions are $m \ge 0$. The number of distinct solutions for case 1 is the number of positive integers $m$ for which both equations have exactly one solution. This happens if and only if $0 \le m \le 200$.

For case 2, the equation $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ has a solution if and only if $\frac{m}{100} \le 2$, or $m \le 200$. The equation $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$ has a solution if and only if $\frac{m}{100} \le 0$, or $m \le 0$. Therefore, the only values of $m$ for which both equations have solutions are $m \le 0$. The number of distinct solutions for case 2 is the number of nonpositive integers $m$ for which both equations have exactly one solution. This happens if and only if $-200 \le m \le 0$.

Combining the results for case 1 and case 2, we see that the number of distinct solutions for the original equation is the number of positive integers $m$ for which both case 1 and case 2 have solutions, or $0 \le m \le 200$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $200$. The answer is: $200$

 The problem is asking for how many positive integers $m$ does the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have $4$ distinct solutions.

First, we need to understand the nature of the absolute value function. The expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ will be equal to a non-negative value. Therefore, the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must also be non-negative, which implies that $m$ must be a non-negative integer.

Furthermore, since the absolute value function always returns a non-negative value, the left side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, can take on any value greater than or equal to $0$. This means that the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be greater than or equal to $0$, so $m$ must be a non-negative integer.

Now, let's consider the number of solutions the equation has. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $0$ and $2$. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ oscillates between $0$ and $4$ as $x$ varies over the real numbers, and $\frac{m}{100}$ must fall strictly between these values to allow for $4$ distinct solutions.

So we have $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which implies $0 < m < 200$. Since $m$ must be a positive integer, the possible values of $m$ are the integers from $1$ to $199$. Therefore, there are $199$ positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. The answer is: $199$
