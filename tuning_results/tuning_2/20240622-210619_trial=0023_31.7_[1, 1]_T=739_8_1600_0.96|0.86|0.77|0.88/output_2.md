The equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has $4$ distinct solutions.
This means that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.
We know that the absolute value function has a "V" shape, and it equals $0$ at its vertex.
So, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to the height of the "V" shape of the inner absolute value function.
The inner absolute value function $\vert x-1 \vert -2$ has two "V" shapes, one for $x<1$ and one for $x>1$.
The height of the "V" shape for $x<1$ is $2$, and the height of the "V" shape for $x>1$ is also $2$.
So, for the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ to have $4$ distinct solutions, we must have $\frac{m}{100}=2$.
Solving for $m$, we get $m=200$.
So, there is only $1$ value of $m$ that makes the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have $4$ distinct solutions, and that value is $m=200$. The answer is: $1$

 The equation $||x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions. The absolute value function $|x|$ splits into two cases: $x$ if $x \geq 0$ and $-x$ if $x < 0$. So the equation $||x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ can be rewritten as two cases:

Case 1: $|x-1|-2=\frac{m}{100}$.
Case 2: $-(|x-1|-2)=\frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $|x-1|+2=\frac{m}{100}$.

Now, let's solve these two cases separately.

Case 1: $|x-1|-2=\frac{m}{100}$.
This case can be split into two sub-cases:

Sub-case 1.1: $x-1-2=\frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x-3=\frac{m}{100}$, and further simplifies to $x=3+\frac{m}{100}$.

Sub-case 1.2: $-(x-1)-2=\frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $-x+1-2=\frac{m}{100}$, and further simplifies to $-x-1=\frac{m}{100}$, and then to $x=-1-\frac{m}{100}$.

Case 2: $|x-1|+2=\frac{m}{100}$.
This case can be split into two sub-cases:

Sub-case 2.1: $x-1+2=\frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x+1=\frac{m}{100}$, and further simplifies to $x=\frac{m}{100}-1$.

Sub-case 2.2: $-(x-1)+2=\frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $-x+1+2=\frac{m}{100}$, and further simplifies to $-x+3=\frac{m}{100}$, and then to $x=3-\frac{m}{100}$.

Now we have four solutions: $x=3+\frac{m}{100}$, $x=-1-\frac{m}{100}$, $x=\frac{m}{100}-1$, and $x=3-\frac{m}{100}$.

For these four solutions to be distinct, we need the four values of $m$ to be distinct. This means that $3+\frac{m}{100} \neq -1-\frac{m}{100}$, $3+\frac{m}{100} \neq \frac{m}{100}-1$, $3+\frac{m}{100} \neq 3-\frac{m}{100}$, $-1-\frac{m}{100} \neq \frac{m}{100}-1$, $-1-\frac{m}{100} \neq 3-\frac{m}{100}$, and $\frac{m}{100}-1 \neq 3-\frac{m}{100}$.

After solving these inequalities, we find that $m=150$ is the only value that satisfies all of them. Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions, and that is $m=150$. The answer is: $1$

 The problem states that we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

First, we need to understand that the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be a positive number since it's equal to an absolute value. This means $m$ must be a positive integer.

Next, we need to consider the structure of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. This equation is equivalent to a pair of two-choice questions: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ or $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.

For the first equation, $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two sub-equations: $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 = -(2 + \frac{m}{100})$. Simplifying these gives $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

For the second equation, $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two sub-equations: $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 = -(2 - \frac{m}{100})$. Simplifying these gives $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ or $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

For the equation to have four distinct solutions, the slopes of the lines given by the equations $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$, $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$, and $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$ must be different. This means that $\frac{m}{100}$ cannot be equal to $2$ or $0$. So, $m$ cannot be $200$ or $0$.

Therefore, the possible values of $m$ are the positive integers less than $200$ except $200$ and $0$. The number of such positive integers is $198$.
The answer is: $198$

The problem is asking for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has four distinct solutions.

Firstly, we need to know that the absolute value function $|f(x)|$ is equal to a constant $k$ can have two solutions if $k>0$, one solution if $k=0$, and no solution if $k<0$.

In this case, we have $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, and we want this equation to have four distinct solutions.

The right side of the equation $\frac{m}{100}$ is a positive number, so the absolute value expression on the left side must be equal to two positive numbers. This means that $\vert x-1 \vert -2$ must be equal to two positive numbers, say $a$ and $b$, where $a>b>0$. So we have $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = a$ and $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = b$.

For the equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = a$, we have two cases:

1. If $x-1 \geq 0$, then $x-1 - 2 = a$, which gives $x = a + 3$.
2. If $x-1 < 0$, then $-(x-1) - 2 = a$, which gives $x = 1 - a - 2 = -a - 1$.

Similarly, for the equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = b$, we have two cases:

1. If $x-1 \geq 0$, then $x-1 - 2 = b$, which gives $x = b + 3$.
2. If $x-1 < 0$, then $-(x-1) - 2 = b$, which gives $x = 1 - b - 2 = -b - 1$.

The four distinct solutions are then given by $x = a + 3$, $-a - 1$, $b + 3$, and $-b - 1$.

For these four solutions to be distinct, we must have $a \neq b$, $a + 3 \neq -a - 1$, $a + 3 \neq b + 3$, and $a + 3 \neq -b - 1$.

This implies that $a$ and $b$ are two positive numbers such that $a \neq b$, and $a + b = 4$. The only possible pair of positive numbers that satisfy this condition is $(a, b) = (2, 2)$, which does not work because $a = b$. So there must be some other conditions on $a$ and $b$.

Notice that the absolute value function is symmetric about the vertical line $x = 1$. This means that if $x = a + 3$ is a solution, then $x = 2 - a$ must also be a solution. Similarly, if $x = -a - 1$ is a solution, then $x = -2 + a$ must also be a solution.

Therefore, for the four solutions to be distinct, we must have $a + 3 \neq 2 - a$, $a + 3 \neq -2 + a$, $-a - 1 \neq 2 - a$, and $-a - 1 \neq -2 + a$.

This implies that $a = 1/2$. But $a$ cannot be a half, so we must have made an error in our reasoning. Let's go back and check our work.

Upon reexamination, we realize that we have made an error in our reasoning about the symmetry of the absolute value function. The absolute value function is indeed symmetric about the vertical line $x = 1$, but the symmetry is with respect to the $y$-axis, not the $x$-axis. This means that if $x = a + 3$ is a solution, then $x = -a + 1$ must also be a solution, and if $x = -a - 1$ is a solution, then $x = a - 1$ must also be a solution.

With this corrected reasoning, we can now continue.

For the four solutions to be distinct, we must have $a + 3 \neq -a + 1$, $a + 3 \neq a - 1$, $-a - 1 \neq -a + 1$, and $-a - 1 \neq a - 1$.

This implies that $a \neq -1$ and $a \neq 2$. Since $a$ is a positive number, we can ignore the condition $a \neq -1$. The condition $a \neq 2$ is consistent with our earlier condition $a + b = 4$. Therefore, the only possible value for $a$ is $1$, and the only possible value for $b$ is $3$.

This means that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if $m = 300$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation has four distinct solutions is $1$. The answer is: $1$

Assistant:

 The problem asks for how many positive integers $m$ the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

Firstly, let's consider the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$. This value must be positive, since it's the absolute value of a difference of absolute values, so $m$ must also be positive.

Secondly, let's consider the left side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. This expression is equal to a value between $0$ and $2$. Therefore, the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be a value between $0$ and $2$. This implies $0 \leq \frac{m}{100} \leq 2$, and thus $0 \leq m \leq 200$.

Now let's solve the equation step by step:

1. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, then $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.

2. This implies two cases:

   a) $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, or $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.
   
   b) $-(x-1) = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, or $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

3. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$, then $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.

4. This implies two cases:

   a) $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, or $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
   
   b) $-(x-1) = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, or $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

5. Thus, the four solutions are $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$, $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$, $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, and $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

6. For these four solutions to be distinct, the four fractions $\frac{m}{100}$, $-\frac{m}{100}$, $\frac{m}{100} - 4$, and $-\frac{m}{100} - 4$ must all be distinct.

7. This implies that $m$ cannot be a multiple of $100$, since otherwise two of the fractions would be equal.

8. Also, $m$ cannot be equal to $200$, since then $\frac{m}{100} - 4 = -4$, and two of the fractions would again be equal.

9. Therefore, the only values of $m$ that work are the integers from $1$ to $199$, excluding the multiples of $100$.

10. To count the number of such values of $m$, we count the integers from $1$ to $199$, and subtract the $20$ multiples of $100$.

11. Thus, the number of such values of $m$ is $199 - 20 = 179$.

So the answer is $\boxed{179}$. However, this result contradicts the problem's condition that the equation should have $4$ distinct solutions. We must have made a mistake in our calculations. 

Upon revisiting our calculations, we realized that we made a mistake in the step where we derived the four solutions. The correct solutions should be $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$, $x = 1 + \frac{m}{100}$, $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, and $x = 1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Now let's reconsider the conditions and solve the problem again:

1. The four solutions are $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$, $x = 1 + \frac{m}{100}$, $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, and $x = 1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

2. For these four solutions to be distinct, the four fractions $\frac{m}{100}$, $\frac{m}{100} - 2$, $-\frac{m}{100}$, and $-\frac{m}{100} + 2$ must all be distinct.

3. This implies that $m$ cannot be a multiple of $100$, since otherwise two of the fractions would be equal.

4. Also, $m$ cannot be equal to $0$, since then $\frac{m}{100}$ would be equal to $0$, and two of the fractions would be equal.

5. Therefore, the only values of $m$ that work are the integers from $1$ to $199$, excluding the multiples of $100$.

6. To count the number of such values of $m$, we count the integers from $1$ to $199$, and subtract the $20$ multiples of $100$.

7. Thus, the number of such values of $m$ is $199 - 20 = 179$.

So the answer is still $\boxed{179}$. However, this result contradicts the problem's condition that the equation should have $4$ distinct solutions. We must have made a mistake in our calculations. 

Upon revisiting our calculations, we realized that we made a mistake in the step where we derived the four solutions. The correct solutions should be $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$, $x = 1 + \frac{m}{100}$, $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, and $x = 1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Now let's reconsider the conditions and solve the problem again:

1. The four solutions are $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$, $x = 1 + \frac{m}{100}$, $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, and $x = 1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

2. For these four solutions to be distinct, the four fractions $\frac{m}{100}$, $\frac{m}{100} - 2$, $-\frac{m}{100}$, and $-\frac{m}{100} + 2$ must all be distinct.

3. This implies that $m$ cannot be a multiple of $100$, since otherwise two of the fractions would be equal.

4. Also, $m$ cannot

The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

First, we need to understand the nature of the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. This function has a V-shape with the "bottoms" of the V's at $x = 1 \pm 2$. So $f(x)$ takes the value $0$ at $x = -1$, $x = 1$, and $x = 3$, and takes the value $\frac{m}{100}$ for some positive integer $m$ at $x = 1 \pm (2 + \frac{m}{100})$.

For the equation to have $4$ distinct solutions, the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be such that $1 + (2 + \frac{m}{100}) < 3$. This simplifies to $\frac{m}{100} < 1$, or $m < 100$.

Also, the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be such that $1 - (2 + \frac{m}{100}) > -1$. This simplifies to $\frac{m}{100} > -1$, or $m > -100$. But since $m$ is a positive integer, this condition is always satisfied.

Therefore, the possible values of $m$ are the positive integers less than $100$. The number of such integers is $99$.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $99$. The answer is: $99$

 The problem states that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. We are asked to find the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy this condition.

To solve this problem, we need to understand the properties of the absolute value function and how it affects the number of solutions to the equation. The absolute value function $\vert x \vert$ is defined as:
\[
\vert x \vert = 
\begin{cases}
x & \text{if } x \geq 0, \\
-x & \text{if } x < 0.
\end{cases}
\]

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ involves two levels of absolute value. To simplify it, we can consider the possible cases for the inner absolute value $\vert x-1 \vert$.

1. If $\vert x-1 \vert \geq 2$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \vert x-1 \vert - 2$. The equation becomes $\vert x-1 \vert - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.

2. If $\vert x-1 \vert < 2$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = 2 - \vert x-1 \vert$. The equation becomes $2 - \vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Now, we need to consider the possible solutions for each case:

1. For $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, we have two subcases:

   a. If $2 + \frac{m}{100} \geq 0$, then $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 = -(2 + \frac{m}{100})$. This gives us $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

   b. If $2 + \frac{m}{100} < 0$, then the equation has no solution because the absolute value of a quantity cannot be negative.

2. For $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, we have two subcases:

   a. If $2 - \frac{m}{100} \geq 0$, then $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 = -(2 - \frac{m}{100})$. This gives us $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ or $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

   b. If $2 - \frac{m}{100} < 0$, then the equation has no solution because the absolute value of a quantity cannot be negative.

Now, we need to count the number of distinct solutions for each case. For the first case, we have two solutions $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$. For the second case, we have two solutions $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$. In total, we have 4 distinct solutions.

Therefore, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $0 \leq 2 + \frac{m}{100} < 2$ or $0 \leq 2 - \frac{m}{100} < 2$. This simplifies to $-200 < m \leq 0$ or $0 < m \leq 200$. The only positive integers that satisfy these conditions are the integers from 1 to 200. Therefore, there are 200 possible values of $m$.
The answer is: $200$

 The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be solved by considering the cases for the absolute value expressions.

Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$.
This gives us two sub-cases:
Sub-case 1.1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ with $\vert x-1 \vert -2 \geq 0$.
In this case, $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, and we have two sub-sub-cases:
Sub-sub-case 1.1.1: $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which gives $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.
Sub-sub-case 1.1.2: $-(x-1) = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which gives $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Case 2: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.
This gives us two sub-cases:
Sub-case 2.1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$ with $\vert x-1 \vert -2 \geq 0$.
In this case, $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, and we have two sub-sub-cases:
Sub-sub-case 2.1.1: $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which gives $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
Sub-sub-case 2.1.2: $-(x-1) = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which gives $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

In order for the four solutions to be distinct, the four expressions for $x$ must be distinct. This gives us the following system of inequalities:
\begin{align*}
3 + \frac{m}{100} &\neq -1 + \frac{m}{100}, \\
3 + \frac{m}{100} &\neq 3 - \frac{m}{100}, \\
3 + \frac{m}{100} &\neq -1 - \frac{m}{100}, \\
-1 + \frac{m}{100} &\neq 3 - \frac{m}{100}, \\
-1 + \frac{m}{100} &\neq -1 - \frac{m}{100}, \\
3 - \frac{m}{100} &\neq -1 - \frac{m}{100}.
\end{align*}

Solving this system of inequalities, we find that $1 \leq m \leq 200$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is $200$. The answer is: $200$
