 To solve this problem, let's first try to find the value of $f(1)$.
By setting $n = 1$ in the second equation, we have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.
Then, substituting $f(2)$ into the equation $f(f(f(1))) = 8\cdot 1 - 7 = -1$, we get $f(f(f(1))) = -1$.
Since $f(f(f(1))) = f(f(1))$, we have $f(f(1)) = -1$.
Again, substituting $f(f(1)) = -1$ into the equation $f(f(1)) = 8\cdot 1 - 7 = -1$, we get $f(1) = 1$.
Now let's find the value of $f(2)$.
Using the second equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, we have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2\cdot 1 + 1 = 3$.
Next, let's find the value of $f(3)$.
Using the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, we have $f(f(f(3))) = 8\cdot 3 - 7 = 17$.
Since $f(f(f(3))) = 17$, we have $f(f(3)) = 17$.
Using the second equation again, we have $f(6) = 2f(3) + 1$.
Substituting $f(6)$ into the equation $f(f(f(3))) = 8\cdot 3 - 7 = 17$, we get $f(f(3)) = 17$.
Again, since $f(f(3)) = 17$, we have $f(3) = 3$.
Now let's find the value of $f(4)$.
Using the second equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, we have $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2\cdot 3 + 1 = 7$.
And so on.
By continuing this process, we can find the values of $f(5), f(6), f(7), ...$ successively.
However, this method of finding each value one by one can be very time-consuming.
To simplify the process, let's look for a pattern in the function $f$.
From the given equations, we can see that $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ and $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$.
Notice that for any integer $n$, we have
\[f(f(f(2n))) = f(f(4n - 7)) = f(8n - 15).\]
From the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, we have
\[f(f(f(2n))) = 8(2n) - 7 = 16n - 7.\]
Comparing the two expressions for $f(f(f(2n)))$, we have
\[16n - 7 = 8n - 15.\]
Solving this equation, we get $n = 1$.
So for any integer $n$, we have
\[f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7.\]
Now let's find the value of $f(100)$.
Using the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, we have $f(f(f(100))) = 8\cdot 100 - 7 = 793$.
Since $f(f(f(100))) = 793$, we have $f(f(100)) = 793$.
Using the second equation again, we have $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$.
Substituting $f(200)$ into the equation $f(f(f(100))) = 8\cdot 100 - 7 = 793$, we get $f(f(100)) = 793$.
Again, since $f(f(100)) = 793$, we have $f(100) = 793$.
Therefore, $f(100) = 793$. The answer is: $793$

 This is a complex problem that requires analyzing and understanding the functions given and finding a pattern to solve it. One might try plugging in some simple values to see if a pattern emerges, but it seems that for this specific problem, such an approach is not feasible due to its complexity.

Therefore, it is clear that an algorithmic approach is necessary. For this specific problem, writing a simple recursive function can be quite effective. Let's write a python function that can calculate $f(100)$.

Here is the python code to compute $f(100)$:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def f(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    elif n % 2 == 0:
        return 2 * f(n // 2) + 1
    else:
        return 8 * (n - 1) // 2 + 1

result = f(100)
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 391

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
391
```
Therefore, the value of $f(100)$ is 391. The final numerical answer is: 391.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."

 To solve this problem, we need to use the given conditions and manipulate them to find a general form of the function $f(n)$. Then we can plug in $n=100$ to find the value of $f(100)$.

From the first condition, we have $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. If we set $f(n)=x$, this equation becomes $f(x)=8n-7$. 

We are also given the second condition, $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. 

To simplify the problem, let's try to find a simpler expression for $f(n)$ where $n$ is a power of 2. For example, if $n=2^k$, then from the second condition we have $f(2^{k+1})=2f(2^k)+1$.

Let's try to find a function that satisfies this property:

If we let $f(n)=2n-1$, then we can check that $f(2^{k+1})=2f(2^k)+1$:
\[f(2^{k+1}) = 2(2^{k+1})-1 = 2^{k+2}-1,\]
\[2f(2^k)+1 = 2(2^k-1)+1 = 2^{k+1}-2+1 = 2^{k+2}-1.\]
So $f(n)=2n-1$ satisfies the condition $f(2^{k+1})=2f(2^k)+1$.

Now we need to show that $f(n)=2n-1$ also satisfies the first condition. 

For $f(n)=2n-1$, we have
\[f(f(n)) = f(2n-1) = 2(2n-1) - 1 = 4n-3,\]
\[f(f(f(n))) = f(4n-3) = 2(4n-3) - 1 = 8n-7.\]
So indeed, $f(n)=2n-1$ satisfies the first condition.

Therefore, the function $f(n)$ is given by $f(n)=2n-1$. 

Now we can find $f(100)$ using this function:
\[f(100) = 2(100) - 1 = 200 - 1 = 199.\]

So $f(100) = 199$. The answer is: $199$

To find $f(100)$, we need to use the provided equations and manipulate them to extract the value of $f(100)$ from the expressions given.

We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. From these, we can try to find out the value of $f(n)$ for some specific values of $n$.

Let's start by setting $n = 1$. We get $f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = 1$. Now, if we know the value of $f(1)$, we can find $f(f(1))$ and $f(1)$ using the second equation. Setting $n = 1$ in the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, we get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. Since we know that $f(f(f(1))) = 1$, we can set this equal to $f(f(1))$ and get $f(f(1)) = 1$. Substituting this into the equation $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$, we get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.

Now, if we set $n = 2$ in the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, we get $f(f(f(2))) = 8*2 - 7 = 9$. Now, if we know the value of $f(2)$, we can find $f(f(2))$ and $f(2)$ using the second equation. Setting $n = 2$ in the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, we get $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$. And since we know that $f(f(f(2))) = 9$, we can set this equal to $f(f(2))$ and get $f(f(2)) = 9$. Substituting this into the equation $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$, we get $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$.

This process of substitution can be continued until we reach $f(100)$. However, this process can be quite tedious and time-consuming. Instead, we can try to find a pattern from the equations provided. 

Notice that in the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, the value of $f(f(f(n)))$ depends only on $n$. This suggests that the function $f$ may be periodic. Indeed, from the known values of $f(1)$ and $f(2)$, we can find more values of $f(n)$, such as $f(4) = 2*f(2) + 1 = 2*(2f(1) + 1) + 1 = 2*(2*1 + 1) + 1 = 2*3 + 1 = 7$. Then we find $f(f(4)) = 8*2 - 7 = 9$, $f(f(f(4))) = 8*4 - 7 = 25$, $f(f(f(f(4)))) = 8*8 - 7 = 57$, and so on. It seems that the function $f$ is periodic with a period of 6, i.e., $f(n + 6) = f(n)$ for all $n$. 

Since we are only interested in finding $f(100)$, and $100$ is congruent to $4$ modulo $6$, we know that $f(100) = f(4)$. From our previous computation, we found that $f(4) = 7$. Therefore, the value of $f(100)$ is 7.
The value of $f(100)$ is 7. The answer is: $7$

Assistant:

 Let's first find $f(1)$. Using the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we put $n=1$ to get $f(f(f(1)))=8 \cdot 1 - 7 = 1$. The function $f$ is such that $f(f(f(1)))=1$, so we have $f(f(1))=1$ and hence $f(1)=1$. 

Next, let's compute $f(2)$, $f(4)$, $f(8)$, $f(16)$, $f(32)$, $f(64)$ and $f(128)$. We know that $f(2)=2f(1)+1=3$, $f(4)=2f(2)+1=7$, $f(8)=2f(4)+1=15$, $f(16)=2f(8)+1=31$, $f(32)=2f(16)+1=63$, $f(64)=2f(32)+1=127$, and $f(128)=2f(64)+1=255$.

Finally, let's compute $f(100)$. We note that $100 = 2^2 \cdot 5^2$, so $f(100) = f(2^2 \cdot 5^2)$. Using the second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can iterate this to get
\[f(100) = f(2^2 \cdot 5^2) = 2f(2 \cdot 5^2) + 1 = 2[2f(5^2) + 1] + 1 = 2[2(2f(5) + 1) + 1] + 1 = 2[2(2 \cdot 2f(5/2) + 1) + 1] + 1.\]
Repeating this process using the fact that $5/2 = 2 + 1/2$, and then $2 = 2 \cdot 1$, we can continue the calculation:
\[f(100) = 2[2(2 \cdot 2f(1) + 1) + 1] + 1 = 2[2(2 \cdot 2 + 1) + 1] + 1 = 2[2(5) + 1] + 1 = 2 \cdot 11 + 1 = 23.\]
Hence, $f(100) = 23$. The answer is: $23$.

To solve this problem, we have to apply the given function rules to find $f(100)$. First, we can use the second rule to simplify the expression $f(f(f(100)))$. Since $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we have:

$$f(f(f(100))) = f(2f(f(100)) + 1).$$

From the first rule, we know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, so we can substitute $n=100$ into the first rule:

$$f(f(f(100))) = f(f(f(100))) = 8*100 - 7 = 793.$$

Now we substitute this into the equation we derived from the second rule:

$$f(2f(f(100)) + 1) = 793.$$

Let's denote $f(f(100))$ as $x$. Then the equation becomes:

$$f(2x + 1) = 793.$$

We know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, so we can set up the following equation:

$$2f(x) + 1 = 793.$$

Solving this equation for $f(x)$:

$$2f(x) = 793 - 1 = 792,$$
$$f(x) = \frac{792}{2} = 396.$$

Now, we can find $f(100)$ by solving $f(x)=396$ for $x$. We substitute $x = f(100)$ into the equation derived from the second rule:

$$2f(x) + 1 = 793.$$

$$2*396 + 1 = 793.$$

Solving this for $f(100)$:

$$f(x) = \frac{793 - 1}{2} = 396,$$
$$f(100) = 396.$$

So, $f(100) = 396$. The answer is: $\boxed{396}$.

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 This problem does not have a straightforward algorithmic solution. However, we can deduce some facts about the function $f$ based on the given equations:

1. From $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, it's clear that for $n=1$, $f(f(f(1)))=0$ and $8(1)-7=1$. Thus $f(1) = 1$.
2. From $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, it can be observed that the function $f$ is an increasing function, as $f(2n)$ is always greater than $f(n)$.
3. Also, from $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, it can be inferred that $f(n)$ is an odd number for all positive integer $n$, because $f(2n)$ is odd.

Now let's evaluate $f(100)$ using the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$:

$$f(100) = f(2 \cdot 50) = 2f(50) + 1.$$
To find $f(50)$, we can apply the same formula again:
$$f(50) = f(2 \cdot 25) = 2f(25) + 1.$$
Continuing this way, we eventually get down to $f(1)$:
$$f(25) = f(2 \cdot 12.5) = 2f(12.5) + 1,$$
which is not a valid expression because we can't have a non-integer in the domain of $f$.

However, we can notice that $f(1)=1$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, so $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 3$, and so on. This way we can find $f(50)$:
$$f(50) = 2f(25) + 1 = 2(2f(12.5) + 1) + 1 = 4f(12.5) + 3.$$
By continuing this way, we can eventually find $f(100)$:
$$f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2(4f(25) + 3) + 1 = 8f(25) + 7.$$
And so:
$$f(100) = 8f(25) + 7 = 8(2f(12.5) + 1) + 7 = 16f(12.5) + 15.$$
Again, we hit a non-integer in the domain of $f$.

This method doesn't work because our domain is natural numbers (positive integers), and we can't use non-integer values. Let's try another way:

From $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we can see that for $n=1$, $f(f(f(1)))=0$ and $8(1)-7=1$, and so $f(1) = 1$. Now we know that $f(f(1))=z$ where $z$ is some unknown positive integer. Then from the second given equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can deduce that $f(2) = 3$ and so on. Continuing this way, we find that $f(100) = 191$.

Here is a Python function that calculates $f(100)$ using this method:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def calculate_f_100():
    # Start with f(1) = 1
    f_n = 1

        # Use the equation f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1

However, we must be careful here. The above calculation will not work as this number is too large to be a natural number.

It seems that we may have misunderstood the problem. The function $f(n)$ that fulfills the given conditions is indeed not a well-defined function on the set of natural numbers. This is because the given conditions do not provide a unique value for $f(n)$ for all $n$. 

The problem as given is flawed. If you find an alternative problem statement that does not lead to contradictions when trying to find a function $f(n)$ that fulfills the conditions, please let me know.

Without an amended problem statement, it's not feasible to calculate $f(100)$ using a Python function, as the given conditions for $f(n)$ lead to a function that is not defined for all natural numbers. The Python function would simply return a non-natural number, which doesn't make sense in the context of the problem.

So, as it stands, the problem is unsolvable as presented. If you have a different, valid problem statement that defines a function $f(n)$ that fulfills the given conditions, please feel free to provide it and I'll be happy to help you solve it.

So, based on the flawed problem as presented, we cannot calculate $f(100)$. Therefore, we cannot output a numerical answer to the problem. But keep in mind that the problem might be amended or misinterpreted, and if that's the case and you have a valid alternative problem statement, please share it!

Based on the flawed problem as presented, the answer can't be solved with a Python function, as it would return an incorrect non-natural number.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."

Assistant:


The problem is asking to find the value of the function $f(100)$. The function is defined by two conditions for all positive integers $n$:

1. $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$
2. $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$

To approach this problem, let's first try to simplify $f(100)$ using the second condition. We have $f(2*50) = 2f(50) + 1$. We don't know the value of $f(50)$, but we can continue to apply the second condition to it to see if we can get any further:

$f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$

And applying it again for $f(50)$:

$f(100) = 2(2f(25) + 1) + 1 = 4f(25) + 3$

Now we can try applying the first condition to $f(25)$ to get some hints. If we let $n=25$, the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ becomes $f(f(f(25)))=8*25-7=193$. So we have $f(f(f(25)))=193$. We can also write it as $f(f(25))=f^{-1}(193)$. Let's call this equation (1). 

Now let's look at the second condition again, and set $n=f(25)$:

$f(2f(25)) = 2f(f(25)) + 1$. Substituting $f(f(25))$ with the value from equation (1), we get:

$f(2f(25)) = 2*193 + 1 = 387$.

And we can write it as $f(f(50)) = 387$, which is $f(50)=f^{-1}(387)$. Let's call this equation (2).

Now let's go back to find the value of $f(100)$:

$f(100) = 4f(25) + 3$. We know that $f(25)=f^{-1}(193)$ and $f(50)=f^{-1}(387)$ from equations (1) and (2). Substituting these in, we get:

$f(100) = 4*193 + 3 = 775$.

Therefore, $f(100) = 775$.
The answer is: $775$
