Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first list the problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge, and thens solve the problem step by step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints are given by the equations $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. This implies $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.

From $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.

From $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$. This implies $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.

From $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

Combining these conditions, we can find the vertices of the polygon.

If $x = 8$ and $y = 8$, then the first two conditions give $16 = 10$, which is not possible.

If $x = 8$ and $y = -8$, then the first two conditions give $0 = 10$, which is not possible.

If $x = -8$ and $y = 8$, then the first two conditions give $0 = 10$, which is not possible.

If $x = -8$ and $y = -8$, then the first two conditions give $-16 = 10$, which is not possible.

If $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, then solving these equations simultaneously gives $x = 10$ and $y = 0$.

If $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$, then solving these equations simultaneously gives $x = 0$ and $y = 10$.

If $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$, then solving these equations simultaneously gives $x = -10$ and $y = -20$, but this is not possible because $\vert y \vert = 8$.

If $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$, then solving these equations simultaneously gives $x = -10$ and $y = 0$. But this is the same as the previous case.

So the vertices of the polygon are $(10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, and $(-10, 0)$. This forms an isosceles triangle with base $20$ and height $10$.

The area of this triangle is $\frac{1}{2} \times 20 \times 10 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first list the problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge, and thens solve the problem step by step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions, and related knowledge are as follows:

1. The equation given is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

2. The expression will be equal to zero if either the first term is equal to zero or the second term is equal to zero.

3. The first term being zero implies that either $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which simplifies to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

4. The second term being zero implies that either $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which simplifies to $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

5. From $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, we have $x + y = \pm 10$ or $x + y = -\pm 10$. Similarly, from $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, we have $x - y = \pm 10$ or $x - y = -\pm 10$.

6. From $\vert x \vert = 8$, we have $x = \pm 8$ or $x = -\pm 8$. Similarly, from $\vert y \vert = 8$, we have $y = \pm 8$ or $y = -\pm 8$.

7. The solution to these equations gives us the coordinates of the vertices of the polygon.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. For $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, the possible pairs of $(x, y)$ are $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$.

2. For $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, the possible pairs of $(x, y)$ are $(0, -10)$, $(0, 10)$, $(10, 8)$, $(-10, -8)$, $(-10, 8)$, $(10, -8)$, $(8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$.

3. For $\vert x \vert = 8$, the possible values of $x$ are $8$ and $-8$.

4. For $\vert y \vert = 8$, the possible values of $y$ are $8$ and $-8$.

5. Combining these solutions, we get the vertices of the polygon: $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$.

6. The polygon is a square with side length 10. To find its area, we use the formula $Area = side^2$, giving us $Area = 10^2 = 100$.

The area of the convex polygon is 100.
The answer is: $100$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge are as follows:

The equation given is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. For the product of two numbers to be zero, either the first number must be zero or the second number must be zero. This gives us two cases:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The absolute values imply that $x + y = \pm10$ and $x - y = \pm10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon as $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0)$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The absolute values imply that $x = \pm8$ and $y = \pm8$. So the vertices of the polygon also include $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$.

Now, we can plot these points on a coordinate plane and connect them to form a square with side length 16. The area of the square is the side length squared, which is $16^2 = 256$. So the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The problem states that we need to find the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points that satisfy the equation
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]
This equation is equal to zero if and only if at least one of the factors is zero. Thus, we have two cases to consider:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, or
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first case, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, this implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives the vertices of the square as $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, and $(-10, 0)$.

For the second case, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, this implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives the vertices of the square as $(8, 0)$, $(-8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, and $(0, -8)$.

The vertices of the convex polygon are the intersections of these squares, which form a larger square with side length $10 + 8 = 18$. The area of this square is $18^2 = 324$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $324$. The answer is: $324$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. Therefore, either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. This expression is zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of a square with side length 10: $(5,5), (5,-5), (-5,-5), (-5,5)$.

The second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. This expression is zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of another square with side length 16: $(8,8), (8,-8), (-8,-8), (-8,8)$.

The area of the convex polygon enclosed by these points is the sum of the areas of the two squares. The area of a square with side length $s$ is $s^2$, so the area of the first square is $10^2 = 100$ and the area of the second square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $100 + 256 = 356$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first list the problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge, and thens solve the problem step by step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge are:

1. The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is given.
2. The solution set of the equation forms a convex polygon.
3. We need to find the area of this convex polygon.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step.

Step 1: Break down the equation
The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

Step 2: Analyze the terms
For the first term to be zero, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. 

For the second term to be zero, either $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

Step 3: Interpret the results
The solutions from the first term give the equations $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$, and $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$. The solutions from the second term give the equations $x = 8$ or $x = -8$, and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

Step 4: Find the intersection points
The intersection points of these equations are the vertices of the polygon. By solving these equations, we find the vertices to be $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(2, 8)$, $(-2, 8)$, $(2, -8)$, and $(-2, -8)$.

Step 5: Calculate the area
The polygon formed by these vertices is a square with side length $16$. The area of a square is given by side length squared, so the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints are:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. The absolute value function $\vert x \vert$ is defined as $x$ if $x \geq 0$ and $-x$ if $x < 0$.

From constraint 1, we have the following cases:
Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. This gives us the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.
Case 2: $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us the lines $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.
Case 3: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$. This gives us the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.
Case 4: $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us the lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

The intersections of these lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8),$ and $(-8, -8)$.

The area of this rectangle is given by $(8 - (-8)) \times (8 - (-8)) = 16 \times 16 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first list the problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge, and thens solve the problem step by step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge are:

1. The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ equals to 0.
2. The expression can only be 0 if both terms are 0.
3. The term $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ is 0 if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$.
4. The term $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ is 0 if $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
5. The term $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ is 0 if $\vert x \vert = 8$.
6. The term $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2$ is 0 if $\vert y \vert = 8$.
7. The solutions to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ are the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.
8. The solutions to $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ are the lines $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.
9. The solutions to $\vert x \vert = 8$ are the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.
10. The solutions to $\vert y \vert = 8$ are the lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.
11. The intersection of these lines form a square with side length 10.
12. The area of the square is $10^2 = 100$.

The problem now is to solve the problem step by step.

Step 1: Identify the constraints.
The constraints given in the problem are:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

Step 2: Solve the constraints.
From constraint 1, we have $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

From constraint 2, we have $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

Step 3: Find the intersection of the lines.
The intersection of these lines form a square with side length 10.

Step 4: Calculate the area of the square.
The area of the square is $10^2 = 100$.

The answer is: $100$.
