Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

 To solve this problem, we first need to understand the given equation and the conditions it implies. The equation involves absolute values and squares, so let's break it down:

1. If a product of two terms equals zero, then at least one of the terms must be zero.
2. In this case, the two terms in the product are each squared expressions, so if a term is zero, it implies that the value inside the absolute value is either 0 or ±10, or the value inside the absolute value is 0 or ±8.
3. The absolute value of a number gives the distance of that number from zero on the number line. So the conditions above imply that the values of x and y are constrained to certain distances from zero.

Now let's analyze the solution:

The given equation encloses a convex polygon because the equation is satisfied only when both terms in the product are zero. This means that the points that satisfy the equation are those that make either term in the product zero. 

1. The term $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$. These are the equations of two lines.
2. Similarly, the term $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$. These are also the equations of two lines.
3. The term $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = 8$ or $x = -8$. These are the equations of two lines.
4. The term $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. These are the equations of two lines.

By solving these equations, we find that the vertices of the polygon are the intersections of these lines. This will give us a square with side length 16 units (since the distances from the origin to the lines $x+y=10$, $x-y=10$, $x=8$, and $y=8$ are all 8 units).

Finally, to find the area of the square, we simply square the length of one of its sides: $Area = 16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units.

Assistant:


The expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ is zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$.
The expression $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ is zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. These are the vertices of the square with side length 16.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of a square with side length 16, which is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units.
