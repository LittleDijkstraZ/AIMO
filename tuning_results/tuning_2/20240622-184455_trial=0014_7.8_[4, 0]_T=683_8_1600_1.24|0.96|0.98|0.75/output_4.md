To find $f(100)$, we can start by applying the second condition in the problem statement repeatedly.

First, we have $f(100)$. By the second condition, we have $f(f(100)) = 2f(100) + 1$. Then we can apply the first condition: $f(f(f(100))) = 8 \cdot 100 - 7 = 793$. 

Therefore, substituting $f(100)$ into $f(f(f(100))) = 8 \cdot 100 - 7$, we get $f(f(100)) = 793$.
Then we substitute $f(f(100)) = 2f(100) + 1$: $2f(100) + 1 = 793$.
Solving for $f(100)$, we get $f(100) = \frac{793 - 1}{2} = 396$.

Therefore, $f(100) = 396$. The answer is: $396$.

To solve $f(100)$, we first use the second condition $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to find $f(50)$ and $f(100)$.
Using $n = 25$, we have $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.
And using $n = 50$, we have $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.
Now we need to find $f(25)$ and $f(50)$.
Using the first condition $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, we can find $f(f(1))$ and then $f(1)$.
Setting $n = 1$, we have $f(f(f(1))) = 8(1) - 7 = 1$.
So $f(f(1)) = f(1)$.
Then $f(f(1)) = 1$.
Setting $n = f(1)$, we have $f(f(f(1))) = 8f(1) - 7 = 1$.
This gives $8f(1) - 7 = 1$, or $8f(1) = 8$ and $f(1) = 1$.
Now we can use the second condition to find $f(2)$ and $f(4)$, then use the first condition to find $f(16)$ and $f(32)$.
We have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2(1) + 1 = 3$,
and $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2(3) + 1 = 7$.
Similarly, we find $f(8) = 2f(4) + 1 = 2(7) + 1 = 15$,
and $f(16) = 2f(8) + 1 = 2(15) + 1 = 31$.
Finally, we can use the first condition to find $f(32)$, then $f(16)$ and $f(8)$, then $f(4)$ and $f(2)$, and finally $f(50)$ and $f(100)$.
We have $f(32) = 8(4) - 7 = 24 - 7 = 17$.
Using the first condition with $n = 16$, we have $f(16) = 8(2) - 7 = 16 - 7 = 9$.
Using the first condition with $n = 8$, we have $f(8) = 8(1) - 7 = 8 - 7 = 1$.
Using the second condition with $n = 4$, we have $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2(3) + 1 = 7$.
Using the second condition with $n = 2$, we have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2(1) + 1 = 3$.
Now we can use the second condition to find $f(50)$.
Setting $n = 25$, we have $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.
We know that $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1 = 2(127) + 1 = 255$.
Using the second condition with $n = 50$, we can find $f(100)$.
We have $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2(255) + 1 = 511$.
Therefore, $f(100) = 511$. The answer is: $511$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."

 To solve this problem, we will start by applying the second condition to find the value of $f(100)$.

Given $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, we want to find $f(100)$. We can express $100$ as $2*50$, so we can substitute $n = 50$ into the second condition to find the value of $f(100)$:
\[f(100) = 2f(50) + 1.\]
To find $f(50)$, we need to express $50$ as $2*25$, and substitute $n = 25$ into the second condition:
\[f(50) = 2f(25) + 1.\]
Continuing this process, we can express $25$ as $2*12.5$, but $12.5$ is not an integer, so we cannot directly apply the second condition to find $f(25)$. However, we can use the first condition to help us.

Given $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, we can set $n = 25$ to get:
\[f(f(f(25))) = 8*25 - 7 = 193.\]
From the second condition, we know that $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$, and from the first condition, we know that $f(f(f(25))) = 193$, so we have:
\[f(50) = 2f(25) + 1.\]
To find $f(25)$, we need to express $25$ as $2*12.5$, but $12.5$ is not an integer, so we cannot directly apply the second condition to find $f(25)$. However, we can use the first condition to help us.

Given $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, we can set $n = 12.5$, but $12.5$ is not an integer, so we cannot directly apply the first condition to find $f(25)$. However, we can use a trick. Let's set $m = f(n)$, then we have $f(m) = f(f(n))$. Substitute $n = 12.5$ into the first condition, we get:
\[f(f(f(12.5))) = 8*12.5 - 7 = 97.\]
So we have $f(m) = 97$, and $m = f(12.5)$, so we have:
\[f(f(12.5)) = 97.\]
Now we can substitute $n = 12.5$ into the second condition to find the value of $f(25)$:
\[f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1.\]
But we know that $f(f(12.5)) = 97$, so we have:
\[f(25) = 2*97 + 1 = 195.\]
Now that we have $f(25) = 195$, we can substitute this back into the equation for $f(50)$ to get:
\[f(50) = 2*195 + 1 = 391.\]
Finally, we can substitute $f(50) = 391$ back into the equation for $f(100)$ to get:
\[f(100) = 2*391 + 1 = 783.\]
So, $f(100) = 783$. Therefore, the answer is: $783$.
The answer is: $783$.

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 First, we can notice that the second condition provides us with an important insight: if we plug in $n=1$ into the second condition, we get $f(2) = 2f(1)+1$. This indicates that $f(1)$ is the base case for finding the value of $f(n)$ for any $n$.

Next, we can substitute $n=f(1)$ into the first condition of the problem, we get $f(f(f(f(1)))) = f(8*1-7)$ which simplifies to $f(f(f(1))) = f(1)$. This tells us that the function $f$ cycles at every three iterations.

Since $f(f(f(1))) = f(1)$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can start plugging in values of $n=1$:
$f(1)$ satisfies $f(f(1)) = 1$, thus $f(1) = 1$.
Then we can use the second condition to find $f(2)$:
$f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2*1 + 1 = 3$.
Then $f(3)$ satisfies $f(f(3)) = 3$, thus $f(3) = 3$.
And $f(6)$ satisfies $f(f(6)) = 6$, thus $f(6) = 6$.
Then we can use the second condition to find $f(12)$:
$f(12) = 2f(6) + 1 = 2*6 + 1 = 13$.
And $f(24)$ satisfies $f(f(24)) = 24$, thus $f(24) = 24$.
And $f(48)$ satisfies $f(f(48)) = 48$, thus $f(48) = 48$.
Then we can use the second condition to find $f(96)$:
$f(96) = 2f(48) + 1 = 2*48 + 1 = 97$.
And $f(192)$ satisfies $f(f(192)) = 192$, thus $f(192) = 192$.
And $f(384)$ satisfies $f(f(384)) = 384$, thus $f(384) = 384$.
Finally, we notice that $384$ is very close to $100$, so we can use the first condition of the problem with $n=384$ to find the value of $f(100)$:
$f(100) = \frac{f(384) + 7}{8} = \frac{384 + 7}{8} = 50$.
The value of $f(100)$ is $50$. The answer is: 50. So $f(100) = 50$. The value of $f(100)$ is $\boxed{50}$. The answer is: 50.

 To solve $f(100)$, we first try to find a pattern or simplify $f(n)$ using the given conditions.

From the second condition, we have $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. For $n=1$, we get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. For $n=2$, we get $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$. By substituting $f(2)$ we get $f(4) = 2(2f(1) + 1) + 1 = 4f(1) + 3$.

From the first condition, we have $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. For $n=1$, we get $f(f(f(1))) = 8(1) - 7 = -1$. Since $f(n)$ is a natural number, this is a contradiction. So we need to reexamine the conditions.

By substituting $n=2$ into the second condition, we get $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$. And substituting $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$ into it, we get $f(4) = 2(2f(1) + 1) + 1 = 4f(1) + 3$.

By substituting $n=4$ into the first condition, we get $f(f(f(4))) = 8(4) - 7 = 29$. Substituting $f(4) = 4f(1) + 3$ into it, we get $f(f(f(4))) = f(4f(1) + 3) = 29$. So $f(4f(1) + 3) = 29$.

This means $f(n)$ maps an integer to 29. As $f(n)$ is a function from natural numbers to natural numbers, we try to find a natural number $k$ such that $f(k) = 29$. From the first condition, we know $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, so we set $k = f(n)$, then we have $f(f(f(k))) = 8k - 7 = f(k)$. Since we know $f(k) = 29$, we can substitute it in and get $29 = 8k - 7$, so $8k = 36$, $k = 4.5$, which is a contradiction since $k$ should be a natural number.

Therefore, we need to reexamine the second condition. We know that $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. If we set $n=2$, we get $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$. And if we substitute $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$ into it, we get $f(4) = 2(2f(1) + 1) + 1 = 4f(1) + 3$. This is the same as our previous result.

Let's try setting $n=4$ in the second condition. We get $f(8) = 2f(4) + 1$. And if we substitute $f(4) = 4f(1) + 3$ into it, we get $f(8) = 2(4f(1) + 3) + 1 = 8f(1) + 7$. From the first condition, we know $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, so we set $n = 4$, then we have $f(f(f(4))) = 8(4) - 7 = 29$. Since $f(4) = 4f(1) + 3$, we can substitute it in and get $f(f(f(4))) = f(4f(1) + 3) = 29$. So $f(4f(1) + 3) = 29$. From this we can see that $f(8) = 29$.

Now we want to find $f(100)$. Notice that $100 = 8 * 12 + 4$, so we can write $100 = 2 * (8 * 6 + 2)$. Therefore, if we set $n = 6$ in the second condition, we get $f(12) = 2f(6) + 1$. And if we set $n = 12$ in the second condition, we get $f(24) = 2f(12) + 1$. Repeat this process, we can get $f(100) = 2f(76) + 1$. And if we set $n = 76$ in the second condition, we get $f(152) = 2f(76) + 1$. Finally, if we set $n = 152$ in the second condition, we get $f(304) = 2f(152) + 1$.

We find a pattern that $f(n * 8 + 4) = 2f(n * 8) + 1$. Since $f(8) = 29$, we can get $f(100) = 2f(76) + 1 = 2(2f(60) + 1) + 1 = 4f(60) + 3$. If we set $n = 60$ in the second condition, we get $f(120) = 2f(60) + 1$. And if we set $n = 120$ in the second condition, we get $f(240) = 2f(120) + 1$. Repeat this process, we can get $f(304) = 2f(240) + 1$. We can substitute $f(240) = 2f(120) + 1$ into it, then $f(304) = 2(2f(60) + 1) + 1 = 4f(60) + 3$. Since $f(304) = 304$, we can set $n = 304$ in the second condition, then we have $f(608) = 2f(304) + 1 = 2(304) + 1 = 609$. We see that it doesn't satisfy the first condition $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. The contradiction tells us that the first condition $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$ is invalid, so we reexamine the first condition and find the error.

Back to our original equations, the first equation is $f(f(f(n))) = 8n -

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
To accomplish this, first list the problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge, and thens solve the problem step by step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 First, let's list the problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge:

1. We have two conditions to work with: $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.
2. We want to find $f(100)$.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

Start with $n=1$. From the second equation, we have $f(2)=2f(1)+1$. We need to find $f(1)$ first to solve this equation.

From the first equation, when $n=1$, we have $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$. Because $f(f(f(1)))=1$, we know $f(1)$ must be the number such that when it's fed into the function three times it gives 1. In other words, we need to find $x$ such that $f(f(f(x)))=1$. This can only happen if $f(x)=1$. So, we have $f(1)=1$.

Now we can substitute $f(1)$ into the equation $f(2)=2f(1)+1$ and get $f(2)=2*1+1=3$.

Next, use the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ again to find $f(4)$:
$$f(4)=2f(2)+1=2*3+1=7.$$

Now, we'll use $f(4)=7$ to find $f(8)$:
$$f(8)=2f(4)+1=2*7+1=15.$$

Finally, we'll use $f(8)=15$ to find $f(16)$:
$$f(16)=2f(8)+1=2*15+1=31.$$

Notice that $f(16)=31$. If we replace $n$ with $16$ in the original first equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we get:
$$f(f(f(16)))=8*16-7=123.$$
Because $f(16)=31$, we know $f(f(f(16)))$ means applying the function three times to 16. So we can get $f(f(31))=123$. Now, if we want to find $f(31)$, we need to find the value of $n$ such that $f(n)=31$. We know from above that $f(16)=31$. Now, looking at our second equation, when $n=16$, we have $f(32)=2f(16)+1=2*31+1=63$. Similarly, $f(64)=2f(32)+1=2*63+1=127$. Then $f(128)=2f(64)+1=2*127+1=255$.

We can see that the value of $n$ is doubling and the value of $f(n)$ is also doubling. So we can conclude that $f(256)=511$. Now, if $f(256)=511$, that means $f(512)=1023$. So, $f(n)$ is always one less than the double of its argument, i.e., $f(2n)=2f(n)-1$.

From above, we've figured out that $f(100)=2f(50)-1=2*2f(25)-1=2*2*2f(12.5)-1=2*2*2*2f(6.25)-1=2*2*2*2*2f(3.125)-1=2*2*2*2*2*2f(1.5625)-1=2*2*2*2*2*2*2f(0.78125)-1=2*2*2*2*2*2*2*2f(0.390625)-1=2*2*2*2*2*2*2*2*2f(0.1953125)-1=2*2*2*2*2*2*2*2*2*2f(0.09765625)-1$.

At this point, we know $f(n)$ is always one less than the double of its argument. Therefore, $f(0.09765625)=2*0.09765625-1=-0.8046875$. It doesn't make sense to have a negative value for $f(100)$. It seems we went wrong somewhere.

Going back to our function, let's check another path. If we take $n=2$ in the second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we get $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2*3+1=7$. Now we use the first equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ with $n=4$, we get $f(f(f(4)))=8*4-7=25$. Because $f(4)=7$, we know that $f(f(f(4)))$ means applying the function three times to 4. So, we can say $f(f(7))=25$.

Let's keep going with our path. Now, we use the second equation with $n=7$ to get $f(14)=2f(7)+1=2*25+1=51$. Now, use the first equation with $n=14$, we get $f(f(f(14)))=8*14-7=109$. So, we can say $f(f(51))=109$. Now, let's use the second equation with $n=51$ to get $f(102)=2f(51)+1=2*109+1=219$. Lastly, the first equation with $n=102$ gives us $f(f(f(102)))=8*102-7=807$. But we got that $f(f(51))=109$, so if we want to reach 807, $f(51)$ must be 51 as well. Then we have $f(102)=2f(51)+1=2*51+1=103$. Lastly, we get $f(f(f(102)))=8*102-7=807$. That seems very reasonable. So let's check our values. We want to know $f(100)$. We know $f(200)=401$ from the second

From the first condition, we have $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. Let's set $n=1$, we get $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$. This means $f(f(1))=1$, so $f(1)$ must be a number such that $f(f(1))=f(1)$. The only number that satisfies this condition is 1, because applying the function $f$ twice on 1 gives back 1. So, $f(1)=1$.

Then from the second condition, we have $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. If we substitute $n=1$, we get $f(2)=2f(1)+1=2*1+1=3$.

Next, let's substitute $n=2$ into the second condition, we get $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2*3+1=7$.

Continuing this process, we find $f(8)=15$, $f(16)=31$, $f(32)=63$, and so on. We can see that $f(2^k)=2^{k+2}-3$ for all positive integers $k$.

Now, we want to find $f(100)$. We can express 100 as $2^2*5^2$. We know that $f(2^2*5^2)=f(100)$. By the property of function $f$, we have $f(100)=f(2^2*5^2)=f(2^2)*f(5^2)$.

From the formula we found earlier, we have $f(2^2)=2^{2+2}-3=7$ and $f(5^2)=2^{5+2}-3=61$.

Therefore, $f(100)=f(2^2)*f(5^2)=7*61=427$. So, $f(100)=427$. The answer is:

$\boxed{427}$
