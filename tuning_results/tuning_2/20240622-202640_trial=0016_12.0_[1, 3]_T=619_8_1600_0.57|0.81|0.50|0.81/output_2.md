 The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

First, let's analyze the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.

The expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a double absolute value function. It can take on four different forms depending on the value of $x$:

1. If $x < 1$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \vert -(x-1) - 2 \vert = \vert -x + 1 - 2 \vert = \vert -x - 1 \vert = x + 1 + 2 = x + 3$.
2. If $1 \leq x < 3$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \vert x - 1 - 2 \vert = \vert x - 3 \vert = 3 - x$.
3. If $3 \leq x < 5$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \vert x - 1 - 2 \vert = \vert x - 3 \vert = x - 3$.
4. If $x \geq 5$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \vert x - 1 - 2 \vert = \vert x - 3 \vert = x - 3 - 2 = x - 5$.

So, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be rewritten as:

1. $x + 3 = \frac{m}{100}$, if $x < 1$.
2. $3 - x = \frac{m}{100}$, if $1 \leq x < 3$.
3. $x - 3 = \frac{m}{100}$, if $3 \leq x < 5$.
4. $x - 5 = \frac{m}{100}$, if $x \geq 5$.

For each of these cases, we need to find the number of integer solutions for $x$.

1. For the equation $x + 3 = \frac{m}{100}$, there is one solution $x = \frac{m}{100} - 3$. This solution is valid if $x < 1$, i.e., if $\frac{m}{100} - 3 < 1$, or $m < 130$. So, there are 129 possible values of $m$ in this case.

2. For the equation $3 - x = \frac{m}{100}$, there is one solution $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$. This solution is valid if $1 \leq x < 3$, i.e., if $1 \leq 3 - \frac{m}{100} < 3$, or $0 \leq -\frac{m}{100} < 2$, or $-200 \leq -m < 0$, or $0 < m \leq 200$. So, there are 200 possible values of $m$ in this case.

3. For the equation $x - 3 = \frac{m}{100}$, there is one solution $x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$. This solution is valid if $3 \leq x < 5$, i.e., if $3 \leq \frac{m}{100} + 3 < 5$, or $0 \leq \frac{m}{100} < 2$, or $0 \leq m < 200$. So, there are 199 possible values of $m$ in this case.

4. For the equation $x - 5 = \frac{m}{100}$, there is one solution $x = \frac{m}{100} + 5$. This solution is valid if $x \geq 5$, i.e., if $\frac{m}{100} + 5 \geq 5$, or $\frac{m}{100} \geq 0$, or $m \geq 0$. So, there are infinitely many possible values of $m$ in this case.

However, we are only interested in the cases where the equation has 4 distinct solutions. Comparing the number of possible values of $m$ for each case, we see that the only case where the equation has 4 distinct solutions is when $m$ is in the range $130 \leq m \leq 200$. There are 71 such values of $m$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 71. The answer is: $71$

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

The absolute value function $\vert x \vert$ splits into two cases: $x \ge 0$ and $x < 0$. So, we have four cases to consider for the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$:

1. $x-1 \ge 0$ and $\vert x-1-2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\vert x-3 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two sub-cases:
   a. $x-3 \ge 0$, so $x \ge 3$ and $x-3=\frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x=3+\frac{m}{100}$.
   b. $x-3 < 0$, so $x < 3$ and $-(x-3)=\frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x=3-\frac{m}{100}$.

2. $x-1 < 0$ and $\vert -(x-1)-2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\vert -x-1 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two sub-cases:
   a. $-x-1 \ge 0$, so $x \le -1$ and $-x-1=\frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x=-1-\frac{m}{100}$.
   b. $-x-1 < 0$, so $x > -1$ and $-( -x-1 )=\frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x=-1+\frac{m}{100}$.

For the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, we need to find the values of $m$ such that:

1. $3+\frac{m}{100} > 3-\frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\frac{m}{100} > -\frac{m}{100}$. This implies $m > 0$.
2. $3+\frac{m}{100} > -1+\frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $4 > 0$, which is always true.
3. $3+\frac{m}{100} > -1-\frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $4 > -\frac{2m}{100}$, or $2m < 200$, or $m < 100$.
4. $3-\frac{m}{100} > -1-\frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $4 > -\frac{2m}{100}$, or $2m < 200$, or $m < 100$.
5. $3-\frac{m}{100} < -1+\frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $4 < \frac{2m}{100}$, or $2m > 400$, or $m > 200$.

Combining these conditions, we find that $0 < m < 100$. The natural numbers in this range are the integers from 1 to 99. Therefore, there are 99 possible values of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions. The answer is: $99$

Assistant:

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. This means that the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be equal to a value that creates 4 separate cases for the absolute value equation.

The expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, can take on three values: $-2$, $0$, and $2$. These are the boundaries where the number of solutions changes.

1. If $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, then $m = 200$. In this case, we have four solutions: $x = -1, 1, 3, 5$.

2. If $\frac{m}{100} = 0$, then $m = 0$. However, this would mean that the equation becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=0$, which simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$. This gives us two solutions: $x = -1, 3$.

3. If $\frac{m}{100} = -2$, then $m = -200$. However, the absolute value of $m$ cannot be negative, so this case is not possible.

Therefore, the only value of $m$ that gives us 4 distinct solutions is $m = 200$. So, there is only one positive integer $m$ that satisfies the condition. The answer is: $1$.

 The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be rewritten as $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.

The expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ can take on the values $0$, $1$, $2$, or $3$.

If $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=0$, then $\vert x-1 \vert =2$, which gives $x=3$ or $x=-1$.

If $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=1$, then $\vert x-1 \vert =3$ or $\vert x-1 \vert =1$. The first equation gives $x=4$ or $x=-2$, and the second equation gives $x=2$ or $x=0$.

If $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=2$, then $\vert x-1 \vert =4$ or $\vert x-1 \vert =0$. The first equation gives $x=5$ or $x=-3$, and the second equation gives $x=1$.

If $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=3$, then $\vert x-1 \vert =5$ or $\vert x-1 \vert =-2$. The first equation gives $x=6$ or $x=-4$, and the second equation has no solutions.

So the solutions to the equation are $x=-4, -3, -1, 0, 1, 2, 4, 5$. This gives us $4$ distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}=1$, or $m=100$.

Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. The answer is: $1$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"

Assistant:

 The problem states that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. The right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be positive, so $m$ must be positive.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is equivalent to two cases:

Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$.
This implies $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.
This further implies two sub-cases:

Sub-case 1.1: $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.
This gives $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Sub-case 1.2: $-(x-1) = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.
This gives $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Case 2: $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = \frac{m}{100}$.
This implies $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
This further implies two sub-cases:

Sub-case 2.1: $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
This gives $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Sub-case 2.2: $-(x-1) = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
This gives $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

For the equation to have $4$ distinct solutions, the expressions for $x$ in the sub-cases must be distinct. This implies that:

1. $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 + \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $4 \neq 0$, which is true.
2. $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\frac{m}{100} \neq -\frac{m}{100}$, which implies $m = 0$, but this is a contradiction because $m$ must be positive.
3. $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $4 \neq -2$, which is true.
4. $-1 + \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\frac{m}{100} \neq -\frac{m}{100}$, which implies $m = 0$, but this is a contradiction because $m$ must be positive.
5. $-1 + \frac{m}{100} \neq 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $-4 \neq 4$, which is true.

Therefore, the only way for the equation to have $4$ distinct solutions is if the expressions for $x$ in the sub-cases are distinct. This occurs when $m$ is positive. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is the number of positive integers, which is infinite. However, the problem asks for a specific number of solutions, $4$. This indicates that we have misunderstood the problem or made a mistake in our calculations.

Upon revisiting the problem, we realize that we have misunderstood the problem. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ having $4$ distinct solutions does not imply that the expressions for $x$ in the sub-cases must be distinct. Instead, the $4$ distinct solutions correspond to the $4$ different combinations of the absolute value signs in the equation.

Therefore, for the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ to have $4$ distinct solutions, the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be equal to the absolute value of a quantity that can take on $4$ different values. This implies that $m$ must be an integer in the range $0 < m < 200$ such that $\frac{m}{100}$ can take on the values $0, 1, 2$. This occurs when $m = 100$.

Therefore, the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $m = 100$. The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $1$. The answer is: $1$

Assistant:

 The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions.

First, let's consider the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. The right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, is a positive number since $m$ is a positive integer. The number of solutions of the equation depends on the value of $\frac{m}{100}$.

The expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is equal to a non-negative number. Therefore, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be a non-negative number, which implies that $m$ must be a non-negative integer. However, the problem asks for positive integers $m$, so we only consider positive values of $m$.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $2$. This is because the expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ can take on the value of $2$ four times, corresponding to the four different combinations of absolute value signs.

Therefore, the only positive integer $m$ that satisfies the condition is $m=200$.
The answer is: $1$
