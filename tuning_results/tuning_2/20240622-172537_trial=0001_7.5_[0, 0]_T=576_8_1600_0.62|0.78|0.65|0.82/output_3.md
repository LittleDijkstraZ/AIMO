Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first list the problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge, and thens solve the problem step by step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge are:

1. The equation is satisfied if either of the factors is zero.
2. $|x|$ and $|y|$ are always non-negative.
3. $|x+y|$ and $|x-y|$ are always non-negative.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

Step 1: The first factor is zero if $|x+y| = 10$ or $|x-y| = 10$. These are the equations of two lines in the plane: $x+y = 10$, $x+y = -10$, $x-y = 10$, and $x-y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(10,0)$, $(0,10)$, $(-10,0)$, and $(0,-10)$.

Step 2: The second factor is zero if $|x| = 8$ or $|y| = 8$. These are the equations of two lines in the plane: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(8,0)$, $(0,8)$, $(-8,0)$, and $(0,-8)$.

Step 3: The intersection of the two rectangles is a square with side length 10 (the distance between the lines $x+y = 10$ and $x+y = -10$), so its area is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge are:

1. The equation is given as $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
2. The equation is equal to zero if either of the two factors is zero.
3. The absolute value function $\vert x \vert$ is equal to $x$ if $x \geq 0$ and $-x$ if $x < 0$.
4. The area of a convex polygon can be found using the shoelace formula.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

Step 1: Setting the factors equal to zero

The equation is equal to zero if either of the two factors is zero. Therefore, we have two cases:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, so $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

Step 2: Finding the vertices of the polygon

From case 1, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us four equations:

1. $x + y = 10$
2. $x + y = -10$
3. $x - y = 10$
4. $x - y = -10$

Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon:

1. $(5, 5)$
2. $(-5, -5)$
3. $(5, -5)$
4. $(-5, 5)$

Step 3: Applying the shoelace formula

The shoelace formula states that if the vertices of a polygon are $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), ..., (x_n, y_n)$, then the area of the polygon is given by:

$$\frac{1}{2} \vert (x_1y_2 + x_2y_3 + ... + x_ny_1) - (y_1x_2 + y_2x_3 + ... + y_nx_1) \vert$$

Applying the shoelace formula to the vertices $(5, 5), (-5, -5), (5, -5), (-5, 5)$, we get:

$$\frac{1}{2} \vert (5(-5) + (-5)(-5) + 5(5) + 5(-5)) - (5(-5) + (-5)(5) + 5(-5) + (-5)(5)) \vert = 100$$

So, the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units. The answer is: $100$

## QUESTION 3 - 2

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions, and related knowledge are as follows:

1. The equation is given as $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
2. The equation is equal to zero if and only if either of the two factors is equal to zero.
3. A product of factors is zero if and only if at least one of the factors is zero.
4. Therefore, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
5. The square of a real number is zero if and only if the real number itself is zero.
6. Therefore, either $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.
7. Simplifying these equations gives $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
8. The absolute value equations can be rewritten as $x + y = \pm 10$, $x - y = \pm 10$, $x = \pm 8$, and $y = \pm 8$.
9. Solving these equations gives the coordinates of the vertices of the polygon.
10. The polygon is a square with side length 16 (since the distance between the points $(8, 8)$ and $(8, -8)$ is 16).
11. The area of a square is given by the square of the side length, so the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The problem's constraints, conditions, and related knowledge are as follows:

1. The equation is given as $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
2. The equation is equal to zero if and only if either of the two factors is equal to zero.
3. A product of factors is zero if and only if at least one of the factors is zero.
4. The absolute value function $\vert x \vert$ is equal to $x$ if $x \geq 0$ and $-x$ if $x < 0$.
5. The area of a polygon can be found using the shoelace formula.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

Step 1: Set each factor equal to zero and solve for $x$ and $y$.

For the first factor, we have $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these equations are $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

For the second factor, we have $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

Step 2: Combine the solutions from step 1 to find the points that satisfy the equation.

The points that satisfy the equation are $(10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$.

Step 3: Plot the points and determine the shape of the polygon.

The points form a square with side length 10.

Step 4: Calculate the area of the square.

The area of a square is given by side length squared. Since the side length is 10, the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

Let's consider the two cases separately:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. 
This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$. 
These lines intersect at the points $(5, 5)$ and $(5, -5)$. 

2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. 
This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$. 
These lines intersect at the points $(8, 8)$ and $(-8, 8)$. 

The points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the given equation are the vertices of a square with side length $10$. 
The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. 

So, the area of the convex polygon is $100$. The answer is: $100$
