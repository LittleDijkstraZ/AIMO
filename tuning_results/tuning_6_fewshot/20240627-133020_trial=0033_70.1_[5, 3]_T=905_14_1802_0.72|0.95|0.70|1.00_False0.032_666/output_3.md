**Problem:** 
"Find the number of 10-tuples $(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{10})$ of real numbers such that
\[(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2 = \frac{1}{11}.\]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,
\begin{align*}
&[(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + \dots + 1^2 + 1^2)][(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2] \\
&\ge [(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + (x_2 - x_3) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10}]^2 = 1.
\end{align*}From the given condition, we have equality, so by the equality condition for Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[\frac{1 - x_1}{1} = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{1} = \frac{x_2 - x_3}{1} = \dots = \frac{x_9 - x_{10}}{1} = \frac{x_{10}}{1}.\]Let
\[d = 1 - x_1 = x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_3 = \dots = x_9 - x_{10} = x_{10}.\]Then
\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so
\[(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_{10}) = \left( \frac{10}{11}, \frac{9}{11}, \frac{8}{11}, \dots, \frac{1}{11} \right).\]In particular, there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if at least one of the factors is zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$ form a square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$. The lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$ form a square with side length 16.

The area of the convex polygon formed by the intersection of these squares is the area of the smaller square, which is $(10\sqrt{2})^2 = 200$.
The answer is: $200$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_ 2= (-16,2).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that
\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as
\[\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1.\]Find $h + k + a + b.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. The area of this convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the four triangles formed by the axes and the lines $x + y = 10$, $x - y = 10$, $x = 8$, and $y = 8$.

The area of each triangle is $\frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}$. 

For the triangle formed by $x + y = 10$, $x = 8$, and the x-axis, the base is 2 and the height is 10 - 8 = 2. So its area is $\frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times 2 = 2$.

For the triangle formed by $x - y = 10$, $y = 8$, and the y-axis, the base is 2 and the height is 10 - 8 = 2. So its area is also $\frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times 2 = 2$.

For the triangle formed by $x + y = 10$, $y = 8$, and the y-axis, the base is 10 - 8 = 2 and the height is 8. So its area is $\frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times 8 = 8$.

For the triangle formed by $x - y = 10$, $x = 8$, and the x-axis, the base is 10 - 8 = 2 and the height is 8. So its area is also $\frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times 8 = 8$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $2 + 2 + 8 + 8 = 20$. The answer is: $\boxed{20}$

Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is equal to zero if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This means that either $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The equations $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$ represent four lines in the coordinate plane.
The intersection of these lines is a square with side length 8.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $8^2 = 64$.
The answer is: $64$

Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,
\begin{align*}
&[(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + \dots + 1^2 + 1^2)][(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2] \\
&\ge [(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + (x_2 - x_3) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10}]^2 = 1.
\end{align*}From the given condition, we have equality, so by the equality condition for Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[\frac{1 - x_1}{1} = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{1} = \frac{x_2 - x_3}{1} = \dots = \frac{x_9 - x_{10}}{1} = \frac{x_{10}}{1}.\]Let
\[d = 1 - x_1 = x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_3 = \dots = x_9 - x_{10} = x_{10}.\]Then
\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so
\[(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_{10}) = \left( \frac{10}{11}, \frac{9}{11}, \frac{8}{11}, \dots, \frac{1}{11} \right).\]In particular, there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


The given equation is $$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$

The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to either $$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$$ or $$(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0.$$

For the first equation, we have $$\vert x + y \vert = 10$$ and $$\vert x - y \vert = 10.$$ The only way this can happen is if $x = 0$ and $y = 0$.

For the second equation, we have $$\vert x \vert = 8$$ and $$\vert y \vert = 8.$$ This means $-8 \leq x \leq 8$ and $-8 \leq y \leq 8$.

Therefore, the points satisfying the given equation are either $(0, 0)$ or $(x, y)$ such that $-8 \leq x \leq 8$ and $-8 \leq y \leq 8$. These points form a square with side length $16$, so the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

The answer is: $256$

**Solution:** 


First, we need to understand the problem. The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. Let's analyze each case separately.

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two squares with side length 10 centered at the origin.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two squares with side length 16 centered at the origin.

The intersection of these two sets of points is the set of points that satisfy both conditions. This is the set of points that form the convex polygon we are looking for. To find the area of this polygon, we can simply multiply the areas of the two squares. The area of a square with side length $a$ is $a^2$, so the area of the first square is $10^2 = 100$ and the area of the second square is $8^2 = 64$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $100 \times 64 = 6400$.

The answer is: $6400$

The area of the polygon is not negative, so there must be a mistake in our calculations. Let's reevaluate the distance between the centers of the two circles.

The coordinates of the center of the first circle are (0, 0) and the coordinates of the center of the second circle are (8, 8). The distance between these two points is given by the formula $\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$. So, the distance is $\sqrt{(8 - 0)^2 + (8 - 0)^2} = \sqrt{64 + 64} = \sqrt{128} = 8\sqrt{2}$.

The area of the polygon is not negative, so there must be a mistake in our calculations. Let's reevaluate the distance between the centers of the two circles.

The coordinates of the center of the first circle are (0, 0) and the coordinates of the center of the second circle are (8, 8). The distance between these two points is given by the formula $\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$. So, the distance is $\sqrt{(8 - 0)^2 + (8 - 0)^2} = \sqrt{64 + 64} = \sqrt{128} = 8\sqrt{2}$.

Let's reevaluate the area of the polygon using the correct distance between the centers of the two circles.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Find the number of 10-tuples $(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{10})$ of real numbers such that
\[(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2 = \frac{1}{11}.\]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,
\begin{align*}
&[(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + \dots + 1^2 + 1^2)][(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2] \\
&\ge [(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + (x_2 - x_3) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10}]^2 = 1.
\end{align*}From the given condition, we have equality, so by the equality condition for Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[\frac{1 - x_1}{1} = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{1} = \frac{x_2 - x_3}{1} = \dots = \frac{x_9 - x_{10}}{1} = \frac{x_{10}}{1}.\]Let
\[d = 1 - x_1 = x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_3 = \dots = x_9 - x_{10} = x_{10}.\]Then
\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so
\[(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_{10}) = \left( \frac{10}{11}, \frac{9}{11}, \frac{8}{11}, \dots, \frac{1}{11} \right).\]In particular, there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The equation is a product of two terms, each of which is a square, so the equation is equal to zero if and only if each term is zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
For the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.
For the second case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations, we get four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.
The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

\[d = 1 - x_1 = x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_3 = \dots = x_9 - x_{10} = x_{10}.\]Then
\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so
\[(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_{10}) = \left( \frac{10}{11}, \frac{9}{11}, \frac{8}{11}, \dots, \frac{1}{11} \right).\]In particular, there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The given equation is a product of two terms, which equals to zero. This means that either the first term equals to zero or the second term equals to zero. 

Let's consider the two cases separately:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$: This equation can only be true if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these two equations simultaneously gives us the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length 20.

2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$: This equation can only be true if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these two equations simultaneously gives us the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length 16.

The area of the convex polygon formed by the intersection of these two squares is the area of the larger square minus the area of the smaller square. The area of a square with side length $a$ is $a^2$, so the area of the larger square is $20^2 = 400$ and the area of the smaller square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $400 - 256 = 144$. The answer is: $\boxed{144}$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_ 2= (-16,2).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that
\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as
\[\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1.\]Find $h + k + a + b.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$
