**Problem:** 
"How many distinct solutions are there to the equation $|x-7| = |x+1|$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
If $|x-7| = |x+1|$, then either $x-7 = x+1$ or $x-7 = -(x+1)$.  Simplifying $x-7=x+1$ gives $0=8$, which has no solutions, so no values of $x$ satisfy $x-7 = x+1$.  If $x-7 = -(x+1)$, then $x-7 = -x-1$, so $2x = 6$, which gives $x=3$.  So, there is $\boxed{1}$ solution.

Challenge: See if you can find a quick solution to this problem by simply thinking about the graphs of $y=|x-7|$ and $y=|x+1|$. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


To solve the problem, we first need to find out how many values of $m$ make the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have 4 distinct solutions. We know that the left side of the equation represents a "two-hill" function (a V-shape), and we want the right side to match the height of one of the hills.

Let's import the necessary libraries and define the function.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solve

def count_values_of_m():
    m = symbols('m')
    # The equation | |x-1| - 2 | = m/100 has 4 distinct solutions when m = 200.
    solutions = solve(abs(abs(1 - 1) - 2) - m/100, m)
    return len(solutions)

result = count_values_of_m()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 1

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
1
```
The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $1$. The value of $m$ for which this happens is $200$. Therefore, the only positive integer $m$ that makes the equation have $4$ distinct solutions is $200$. The answer is: $1$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many solutions does the equation \[\frac{(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)\dotsm(x-100)}{(x-1^2)(x-2^2)(x-3^2)\dotsm(x-100^2)} = 0\]have for $x$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Any solution to this equation must make the numerator of the left-hand side zero, while keeping the denominator non-zero. The numerator is zero when $x$ is one of the numbers $1, 2, 3, \dots, 100.$ However, for any value in this list that is a perfect square, the denominator will also be zero, so that value of $x$ will not be a root. Therefore, we want to find the number of integers in the list $1, 2, \dots, 100$ which are not perfect squares. The perfect squares in the list are $1^2, 2^2, \dots, 10^2,$ so there are $10$ perfect squares, and \[100 - 10 = \boxed{90}\]integers which are not perfect squares. The answer is $\boxed{90}$

**Problem:** 
"How many solutions does the equation \[\frac{(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)\dotsm(x-100)}{(x-1^2)(x-2^2)(x-3^2)\dotsm(x-100^2)} = 0\]have for $x$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

Let's think step by step:
Any solution to this equation must make the numerator of the left-hand side zero, while keeping the denominator non-zero. The numerator is zero when $x$ is one of the numbers $1, 2, 3, \dots, 100.$ However, for any value in this list that is a perfect square, the denominator will also be zero, so that value of $x$ will not be a root. Therefore, we want to find the number of integers in the list $1, 2, \dots, 100$ which are not perfect squares. The perfect squares in the list are $1^2, 2^2, \dots, 10^2,$ so there are $10$ perfect squares, and \[100 - 10 = \boxed{90}\]integers which are not perfect squares. The answer is $\boxed{90}$

100
```
The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $100$.
However, the problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation has exactly $4$ distinct solutions. 
It turns out that for $m = 1$ and $m = 2$, the equation has less than $4$ distinct solutions, 
while for $m = 3$, it has exactly $4$ distinct solutions.
For $m > 3$, the equation has more than $4$ distinct solutions.
Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation has exactly $4$ distinct solutions is $1$. The answer is: $1$
