**Problem:** 
"If $x + 2y= 4$ and $xy = -8$, what is the value of $x^2 + 4y^2$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
We see that $(x + 2y)^2 = (x^2 + 4y^2) + 4xy = 4^2 = 16$. We want to find $x^2 + 4y^2$ and are given $xy = -8$. So, $x^2 + 4y^2 + 4xy = x^2 + 4y^2 + 4(-8) = 16$. It follows that $x^2 + 4y^2 = \boxed{48}$. The answer is $\boxed{48}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
**Problem**
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


This problem is a bit complex and requires some mathematical insights and techniques. Here is a solution using python and sympy:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solve, Eq

def min_value():
    """What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"""
    x, y = symbols('x y')
    equation = Eq((x - 2*y) + (y - 2*x), 40)
    solutions = solve(equation, y)

    # Substitute each solution of y into the function and find the minimum value
    min_value = float('inf')
    for sol in solutions:
        expr = 5*x**2 + 5*sol**2 - 8*x*sol
        value = expr.subs(y, sol)
        if value < min_value:
            min_value = value

    return min_value

result = min_value()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 5*x**2 - 8*x*(-x - 40) + 5*(-x - 40)**2

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
5*x**2 - 8*x*(-x - 40) + 5*(-x - 40)**2
```

This function returns an expression with $x$ as a variable. However, it doesn't directly provide the minimum value of the function. To find the minimum value, we need to differentiate the function with respect to $x$ and set the derivative equal to zero, then solve for $x$. Finally, substitute the value of $x$ back into the function to find the minimum value of the function.

Let's complete the function to find the minimum value:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, diff, solve

def min_value():
    """What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"""
    x = symbols('x')
    y = -x - 40
    expr = 5*x**2 + 5*y**2 - 8*x*y

    # Differentiate the function with respect to x
    diff_expr = diff(expr, x)

    # Set the derivative equal to zero and solve for x
    critical_points = solve(diff_expr, x)

    # Substitute each critical point into the function and find the minimum value
    min_value = float('inf')
    for point in critical_points:
        value = expr.subs(x, point)
        if value < min_value:
            min_value = value

    return min_value

result = min_value()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 800

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
800
```

The minimum value of the function $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $800$. The answer is: $800$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"What is the minimum value of the expression $2x^2+3y^2+8x-24y+62$ for real $x$ and $y$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Rearranging the expression, we have  \[2x^2+8x+3y^2-24y+62\]We first complete the square in $x$. Factoring a 2 from the first two terms of the expression, we get  \[2(x^2+4x)+3y^2-24y+62\]In order for the expression inside the parenthesis to be a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(4/2)^2=4$ inside the parenthesis. Doing this, we have \[2(x^2+4x+4-4)+3y^2-24y+62 \Rightarrow 2(x+2)^2+3y^2-24y+54\]Now we complete the square in $y$. Factoring a 3 from the $y$ terms in the expression, we get \[2(x+2)^2+3(y^2-8y)+54\]In order for the expression inside the second parenthesis to be a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(8/2)^2=16$ inside the parenthesis. Doing this, we have \[2(x+2)^2+3(y^2-8y+16-16)+54 \Rightarrow 2(x+2)^2+3(y-4)^2+6\]Since the minimum value of $2(x+2)^2$ and $3(y-4)^2$ is $0$ (perfect squares can never be negative), the minimum value of the entire expression is $\boxed{6}$, and is achieved when $x=-2$ and $y=4$. The answer is $\boxed{6}$

**Problem**
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solve

def minimum_value():
    # Define the variables
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # Define the function and the condition
    f = 5*x**2 + 5*y**2 - 8*x*y
    condition = abs(x - 2*y) + abs(y - 2*x) - 40

    # Solve the condition for y
    y_sol = solve(condition, y)[0]

    # Substitute y in f
    f = f.subs(y, y_sol)

    # Find the derivative of f
    f_prime = f.diff(x)

    # Solve the equation f'(x) = 0 to find the critical points
    critical_points = solve(f_prime, x)

    # Evaluate f at the critical points
    values = [f.subs(x, cp) for cp in critical_points]

    # Return the minimum value
    return min(values)

result = minimum_value()
print(result)
