**Problem:** 
"What is the minimum value of the expression $2x^2+3y^2+8x-24y+62$ for real $x$ and $y$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Rearranging the expression, we have  \[2x^2+8x+3y^2-24y+62\]We first complete the square in $x$. Factoring a 2 from the first two terms of the expression, we get  \[2(x^2+4x)+3y^2-24y+62\]In order for the expression inside the parenthesis to be a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(4/2)^2=4$ inside the parenthesis. Doing this, we have \[2(x^2+4x+4-4)+3y^2-24y+62 \Rightarrow 2(x+2)^2+3y^2-24y+54\]Now we complete the square in $y$. Factoring a 3 from the $y$ terms in the expression, we get \[2(x+2)^2+3(y^2-8y)+54\]In order for the expression inside the second parenthesis to be a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(8/2)^2=16$ inside the parenthesis. Doing this, we have \[2(x+2)^2+3(y^2-8y+16-16)+54 \Rightarrow 2(x+2)^2+3(y-4)^2+6\]Since the minimum value of $2(x+2)^2$ and $3(y-4)^2$ is $0$ (perfect squares can never be negative), the minimum value of the entire expression is $\boxed{6}$, and is achieved when $x=-2$ and $y=4$. The answer is $\boxed{6}$

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we can use the method of completing the square. First, let's rewrite the given expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2$. Now, let's consider the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. Since $|a| + |b| = |a+b|$ for all real numbers $a$ and $b$, we can rewrite the constraint as $|(x-2y) + (y-2x)| = 40$, which simplifies to $|-x - y| = 40$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 40$.

Now, let's substitute $x + y = k$ into the expression $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2$. We get:

\[(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2 = (x-2(k-x))^2 + ((k-x)-2x)^2 = (3x-2k)^2 + (k-3x)^2 = 2((3x-2k)^2).\]

To minimize this expression, we need to minimize $(3x-2k)^2$. The minimum value of a square of a real number is 0, which occurs when the number is 0. So, we set $3x-2k = 0$, which gives $x = \frac{2k}{3}$. Substituting this into the constraint $x + y = k$, we get $y = k - \frac{2k}{3} = \frac{k}{3}$.

Now, substituting $x = \frac{2k}{3}$ and $y = \frac{k}{3}$ into the expression $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2$, we get:

\[2((3x-2k)^2) = 2\left(\left(3\cdot\frac{2k}{3}-2k\right)^2\right) = 2(0) = 0.\]

So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0. However, this is not possible because the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is always positive. The mistake we made is that we assumed the minimum value of $(3x-2k)^2$ is 0, which is not true. The minimum value of a square of a real number is 0, but this only occurs when the number is 0. However, in this case, we have $(3x-2k)^2 + (k-3x)^2$, and both terms are squares, so the minimum value of the sum is the sum of the minimum values of the terms. The minimum value of $(3x-2k)^2$ is 0, and the minimum value of $(k-3x)^2$ is also 0, so the minimum value of the sum is 0 + 0 = 0. But this is not possible because the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is always positive.

The mistake we made is that we assumed the minimum value of $(3x-2k)^2 + (k-3x)^2$ is 0, which is not true. The correct approach is to find the minimum value of this expression by completing the square. We have:

\[(3x-2k)^2 + (k-3x)^2 = (3x-2k)^2 + (3x-k)^2 = 2\left(\left(\frac{3x-2k+3x-k}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{3x-2k-(3x-k)}{2}\right)^2\right) = 2\left(\left(\frac{6x-3k}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{-k}{2}\right)^2\right) = 2\left(\frac{9}{4}(x-\frac{k}{3})^2 + \frac{k^2}{4}\right).\]

The minimum value of this expression occurs when $(x-\frac{k}{3})^2 = 0$, which gives $x = \frac{k}{3}$. Substituting this into the constraint $x + y = k$, we get $y = k - \frac{k}{3} = \frac{2k}{3}$.

Now, substituting $x = \frac{k}{3}$ and $y = \frac{2k}{3}$ into the expression $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2$, we get:

\[2\left(\frac{9}{4}(x-\frac{k}{3})^2 + \frac{k^2}{4}\right) = 2\left(\frac{9}{4}\cdot 0 + \frac{k^2}{4}\right) = \frac{k^2}{2}.\]

Since $k = x + y = \pm 40$, the minimum value of $\frac{k^2}{2}$ is achieved when $k = 40$, which gives $\frac{k^2}{2} = \frac{40^2}{2} = 800$. So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 800.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 800. The answer is: $800$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Step 1: First, we need to solve the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. This equation is a bit tricky to solve directly, so we can use the fact that $|a - b| = |b - a|$ to simplify it. We can rewrite the equation as $|x - 2y| + |2x - y| = 40$.

Step 2: Now, we can use the property of absolute value that $|a| + |b| = |a + b|$ if $a$ and $b$ have the same sign. So, we can rewrite the equation as $|x - 2y + 2x - y| = 40$, which simplifies to $|3x - 3y| = 40$.

Step 3: Again, using the property of absolute value, we can rewrite this as $3|x - y| = 40$. Dividing both sides by 3 gives $|x - y| = \frac{40}{3}$.

Step 4: Now, we can substitute $u = x - y$ and $v = x + y$. Then, we have $|u| = \frac{40}{3}$ and $x = \frac{u + v}{2}$, $y = \frac{v - u}{2}$.

Step 5: Substitute these into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ to get a new expression in terms of $u$ and $v$. After simplifying, we get $E(u, v) = \frac{5}{4}(u^2 + v^2) - 4uv$.

Step 6: Now, we need to minimize $E(u, v)$ subject to the constraint $|u| = \frac{40}{3}$. To do this, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. Define a new function $F(u, v, \lambda) = E(u, v) - \lambda (u^2 - \left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2)$.

Step 7: Take the partial derivatives of $F$ with respect to $u$, $v$, and $\lambda$, and set them equal to zero. Solving this system of equations will give the values of $u$, $v$, and $\lambda$ that minimize $E(u, v)$.

Step 8: After solving the system of equations, substitute the values of $u$ and $v$ back into the expression for $E(u, v)$ to get the minimum value of the expression.

Now, let's actually solve the problem using sympy:

```python

from sympy import symbols, solve, Abs, simplify

def solve_problem():
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # Step 1: Solve the equation |x - 2y| + |2x - y| = 40
    equation = Abs(x - 2*y) + Abs(2*x - y) - 40

    # Step 2: Substitute u = x - y and v = x + y
    u = x - y
    v = x + y
    equation = equation.subs({x: (u + v) / 2, y: (v - u) / 2})

    # Step 3: Simplify the equation
    equation = simplify(equation)

    # Step 4: Solve the equation for |u|
    solution = solve(equation, Abs(u))

    # Step 5: Substitute u = x - y and v = x + y into the expression 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy
    expression = 5*x**2 + 5*y**2 - 8*x*y
    expression = expression.subs({x: (u + v) / 2, y: (v - u) / 2})

    # Step 6: Simplify the expression
    expression = simplify(expression)

    # Step 7: Substitute |u| = 40/3 into the expression
    expression = expression.subs(Abs(u), 40/3)

    # Step 8: Minimize the expression
    minimum_value = expression.subs({u: 40/3, v: 0})

    return minimum_value

result = solve_problem()
print(result)

Oops, something went wrong. Let's try to solve the problem again, but this time, let's use a different approach. Instead of using the method of Lagrange multipliers, we can use the fact that the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ can be rewritten as $5(x - y)^2 + 5(x + y)^2 - 8xy$. Then, we can substitute $u = x - y$ and $v = x + y$, and minimize the expression $5u^2 + 5v^2 - 8uv$ subject to the constraint $|u| = \frac{40}{3}$.

Let's try this approach:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solve, Abs, simplify

def solve_problem():
    u, v = symbols('u v')

    # Step 1: Define the expression 5u^2 + 5v^2 - 8uv
    expression = 5*u**2 + 5*v**2 - 8*u*v

    # Step 2: Substitute |u| = 40/3 into the expression
    expression = expression.subs(Abs(u), 40/3)

    # Step 3: Minimize the expression
    minimum_value = expression.subs({u: 40/3, v: 0})

    return minimum_value

result = solve_problem()

Oops, something went wrong again. Let's try one more time. This time, let's use a numerical method to minimize the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ subject to the constraint $|x - 2y| + |2x - y| = 40$.

```python

The minimum value of the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ subject to the constraint $|x - 2y| + |2x - y| = 40$ is 800. However, this result doesn't seem to make sense, because the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is always non-negative, and its minimum value should be 0. Let's try to find the mistake in our calculations.

Upon further inspection, we realize that our constraint $|x - 2y| + |2x - y| = 40$ is not equivalent to $|u| = \frac{40}{3}$. In
