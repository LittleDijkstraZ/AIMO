Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $A \cdot B = 0$ is true if and only if $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. So, the given equation is satisfied if either $A = (\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $B = (\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $A = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, and $(-10, 0)$.

If $B = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

Now, we can plot these points on a graph and observe that they form a square with side length $20$. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $400$. The answer is: $400$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

The first term is zero when $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x-y| - 10 = 0$. This simplifies to $|x+y| = 10$ and $|x-y| = 10$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x+y = 10$, $x+y = -10$, $x-y = 10$, and $x-y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(10,0)$, $(0,10)$, $(-10,0)$, and $(0,-10)$.

The second term is zero when $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$. This simplifies to $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with vertices at $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

The intersection of the two sets of lines is the polygon formed by the intersection of the rectangle and the square. This polygon is a square with side length 10 (the shorter diagonal of the rectangle). The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side, so the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Find the number of 10-tuples $(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{10})$ of real numbers such that
\[(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2 = \frac{1}{11}.\]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,
\begin{align*}
&[(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + \dots + 1^2 + 1^2)][(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2] \\
&\ge [(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + (x_2 - x_3) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10}]^2 = 1.
\end{align*}From the given condition, we have equality, so by the equality condition for Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[\frac{1 - x_1}{1} = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{1} = \frac{x_2 - x_3}{1} = \dots = \frac{x_9 - x_{10}}{1} = \frac{x_{10}}{1}.\]Let
\[d = 1 - x_1 = x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_3 = \dots = x_9 - x_{10} = x_{10}.\]Then
\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so
\[(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_{10}) = \left( \frac{10}{11}, \frac{9}{11}, \frac{8}{11}, \dots, \frac{1}{11} \right).\]In particular, there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Solution:** 



The problem asks for the area of a polygon formed by the points that satisfy the given equation. The equation is a product of two terms, each of which is a square of a difference. The product is zero if and only if at least one of the terms is zero. Therefore, we need to find the points that satisfy each term being zero separately.

1. For the term $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. This is the equation of a square with side length 20 centered at the origin.
2. For the term $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This is also the equation of a square with side length 20 centered at the origin, but rotated 45 degrees.
3. For the term $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$, which gives $x = 8$ or $x = -8$. This is the equation of a vertical line segment of length 16.
4. For the term $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. This is the equation of a horizontal line segment of length 16.

The intersection of these lines and squares form a polygon. The polygon is a square with side length 16. To find its area, we simply square the side length: $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

**Problem:** 
"Five identical rectangles are arranged to form a larger rectangle $PQRS$, as shown.  The area of $PQRS$ is $4000$.  What is the length, $x$, rounded off to the nearest integer? [asy]
real x = 1; real w = 2/3;

draw(left--right);
label("$x$", (x/2, -0.1), S);

[/asy]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Let $w$ be the width of each of the identical rectangles. Since $PQ=3w$, $RS=2x$ and $PQ=RS$ (because $PQRS$ is a rectangle), then $2x = 3w$, or $$w=\frac{2}{3}x.$$ Therefore, the area of each of the five identical rectangles is $$x\left(\frac{2}{3}x\right)=\frac{2}{3}x^2.$$ Since the area of $PQRS$ is 4000 and it is made up of five of these identical smaller rectangles, then $$5\left(\frac{2}{3}x^2\right)=4000$$ or $$\frac{10}{3}x^2 = 4000$$ or $x^2 = 1200$ or $x \approx 34.6$ which, when rounded off to the nearest integer, is $\boxed{35}.$ The answer is $\boxed{35}$

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.
2. The first term is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, which equals zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(5,5), (5,-5), (-5,5), (-5,-5)$.
3. The second term is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$, which equals zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(8,0), (0,8), (-8,0), (0,-8)$.
4. Combining the vertices from both terms, we get the vertices of the polygon: $(5,5), (5,-5), (-5,5), (-5,-5), (8,0), (0,8), (-8,0), (0,-8)$.
5. To find the area of the polygon, we can divide it into four right triangles and one square. The right triangles have base and height of 10, so their area is $\frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10 = 50$. The square has side length of 8, so its area is $8 \times 8 = 64$.
6. The total area of the polygon is the sum of the areas of the four right triangles and the square: $4 \times 50 + 64 = 200 + 64 = 264$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 264.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    # Area of each right triangle

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many square units are in the area of the triangle whose vertices are the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the curve $y = (x-3)^2 (x+2)$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we need to find where this curve intersects the $x$ and $y$ axes.  If $y=0$, then $(x-3)^2(x+2)=0$, which has solutions of $x=3$ and $x=-2$.  If $x=0$, then $y=(-3)^2(2)=18$.  So, the curve has two $x$-intercepts and one $y$-intercept.  The length of the base along the $x$-axis is $3-(-2)=5$.  The height from this base is equal to the $y$-intercept, 18.  The area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 5\cdot 18=\boxed{45}$. The answer is $\boxed{45}$
