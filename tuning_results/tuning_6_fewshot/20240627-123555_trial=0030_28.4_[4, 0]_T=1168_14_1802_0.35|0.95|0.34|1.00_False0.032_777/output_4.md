**Problem:** 
"The function $f$ is defined on the set of integers and satisfies \[f(n)= \begin{cases}  n-3 & \mbox{if }n\ge 1000 \\  f(f(n+5)) & \mbox{if }n<1000. \end{cases}\]Find $f(84)$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Denote by (1) and (2) the two parts of the definition of $f$, respectively. If we begin to use the definition of $f$ to compute $f(84)$, we use (2) until the argument is at least $1000$: \[f(84) = f(f(89)) = f(f(f(94))) = \dots = f^N(1004)\](where $f^N$ denotes composing $f$ with itself $N$ times, for some $N$). The numbers $84, 89, 94, \dots, 1004$ form an arithmetic sequence with common difference $5$; since $1004 - 84 = 920 = 184 \cdot 5$, this sequence has $184 + 1 = 185$ terms, so $N = 185$.

At this point, (1) and (2) are both used: we compute \[\begin{aligned} f^N(1004) &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-1}(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-1}(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(1000) \\ &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(997) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1002) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(999) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1004). \end{aligned}\]Repeating this process, we see that \[f^N(1004) = f^{N-2}(1004) = f^{N-4}(1004) = \dots = f^3(1004).\](The pattern breaks down for $f^k(1004)$ when $k$ is small, so it is not true that $f^3(1004) = f(1004)$.) Now, we have \[f^3(1004) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^2(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^2(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(1000) \stackrel{(1)}{=} \boxed{997}.\] The answer is $\boxed{997}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we can use a recursive function to calculate $f(100)$.

First, we define the function $f$ with the given conditions:
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

def f(n):
    # f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7
    # f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    elif n % 2 == 0:
        return 2 * f(n // 2) + 1
    else:
        return symbols('x')
        equation = Eq(f(f(f(n))), 8*n - 7)
        solution = solve(equation, x)
        return solution[0]

result = f(100)
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 4*x + 3

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
4*x + 3
```
We got the expression $4x + 3$, but this doesn't seem to be correct. Let's try to simplify the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$ to see if we can get a better understanding of the function $f$.

If we let $f(n) = x$, then $f(f(f(n))) = f(f(x)) = f(2f(x) + 1) = f(2x + 1)$. So the equation becomes $f(2x + 1) = 8n - 7$.

Now, let's substitute $n = f(n)$ into the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$:
$$f(2f(n)) = 2f(n) + 1.$$
Since $2f(n) + 1 = f(f(f(n)))$, we have
$$f(2f(n)) = f(f(f(n))).$$
This equation tells us that applying the function $f$ twice to $n$ is the same as applying the function $f$ once to $f(f(n))$.

Now let's try to solve the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. If we substitute $n = f(n)$ into this equation, we get
$$f(f(f(f(n)))) = 8f(n) - 7.$$
Since $f(f(f(n))) = f(2f(n) + 1)$, we have
$$f(f(2f(n) + 1)) = 8f(n) - 7.$$
Now, let's substitute $2f(n) + 1 = f(f(f(n)))$ into this equation, we get
$$f(f(f(f(f(n))))) = 8f(n) - 7.$$
This equation tells us that applying the function $f$ five times to $n$ is equal to $8n - 7$.

Now let's try to find the value of $f(100)$. Since $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, we can find $f(100)$ by solving the equation $f(f(f(100))) = 8*100 - 7 = 793$.

Let's substitute $n = 100$ into the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, we get
$$f(f(f(100))) = 8*100 - 7 = 793.$$
Now, let's substitute $n = f(100)$ into the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 793$, we get
$$f(f(f(f(100)))) = 793.$$
Since $f(f(f(f(100)))) = 8f(100) - 7$, we have
$$8f(100) - 7 = 793.$$
Solving this equation for $f(100)$, we get
$$8f(100) = 793 + 7 = 800,$$
$$f(100) = \frac{800}{8} = 100.$$
So the value of $f(100)$ is 100.

Now let's modify the function $f$ to calculate $f(100)$ correctly:
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def f(n):
    # f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7
    # f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    elif n % 2 == 0:
        return 2 * f(n // 2) + 1
    else:
        for x in range(1, 1000):
            if f(f(f(x))) == 8*x - 7:
                return x

result = f(100)
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 7

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
7
```
The value of $f(100)$ is 7. However, this doesn't seem to be correct either. Let's try to find the value of $f(7)$. Since $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, we can find $f(7)$ by solving the equation $f(f(f(7))) = 8*7 - 7 = 56 - 7 = 49$.

Let's substitute $n = 7$ into the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, we get
$$f(f(f(7))) = 8*7 - 7 = 56 - 7 = 49.$$
Now, let's substitute $n = f(7)$ into the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 49$, we get
$$f(f(f(f(7)))) = 49.$$
Since $f(f(f(f(7)))) = 8f(7) - 7$, we have
$$8f(7) - 7 = 49.$$
Solving this equation for $f(7)$, we get
$$8f(7) = 49 + 7 = 56,$$
$$f(7) = \frac{56}{8} = 7.$$
So the value of $f(7)$ is 7.

Now let's modify the function $f$ to calculate $f(7)$ correctly:
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def f(n):
    # f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7
    # f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    elif n % 2 == 0:
        return 2 * f(n // 2) + 1
    else:
        for x in range(1, 1000):
            if f(f(f(x))) == 8*x - 7:
                return x

result = f(7)
print(result)
``````output

CODE RESULTS 1

INTERMEDIATE OUT :

```
The value of $f(7)$ is 1. However, this doesn't seem to be correct either. Let's try to find the value of $f(1)$. Since $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, we can find $f(1)$ by solving the equation $f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = 8 - 7 = 1$.

Let's substitute $n = 1$ into the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$,

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"We define a function $f(x)$ such that $f(14)=7$, and if there exists an integer $a$ such that $f(a)=b$, then $f(b)$ is defined and

$f(b)=3b+1$ if $b$ is odd

$f(b)=\frac{b}{2}$ if $b$ is even.

What is the smallest possible number of integers in the domain of $f$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Since $f(14)=7$, we know that $f(7)$ is defined, and it must equal $22$.  Similarly, we know that $f(22)$ is defined, and it must equal $11$.  Continuing on this way,  \begin{align*}
f(11)&=34\\
f(34)&=17\\
f(17)&=52\\
f(52)&=26\\
f(26)&=13\\
f(13)&=40\\
f(40)&=20\\
f(20)&=10\\
f(10)&=5\\
f(5)&=16\\
f(16)&=8\\
f(8)&=4\\
f(4)&=2\\
f(2)&=1\\
f(1)&=4
\end{align*}We are now in a cycle $1$, $4$, $2$, $1$, and so on.  Thus there are no more values which need to be defined, as there is no $a$ currently defined for which $f(a)$ is a $b$ not already defined.  Thus the minimum number of integers we can define is the number we have already defined, which is $\boxed{18}$. The answer is $\boxed{18}$

**Problem**
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


We can solve this problem by using the second condition and then the first condition.

First, let's find $f(100)$ using the second condition: $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. So, $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$.

Then, we can use the first condition: $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. So, $f(f(f(100))) = 8*100 - 7 = 793$.

Now, we know that $f(f(f(100))) = f(f(200)) = 793$.

Using the second condition again, we have $f(f(200)) = 2f(f(100)) + 1 = 793$. So, $2f(f(100)) + 1 = 793$, which gives $2f(f(100)) = 792$, and therefore $f(f(100)) = 396$.

Again, using the second condition, we have $f(f(100)) = 2f(100) + 1 = 396$. So, $2f(100) + 1 = 396$, which gives $2f(100) = 395$, and therefore $f(100) = 197.5$.

However, the function $f$ is defined to map from $\mathbb N$ to $\mathbb N$, so $f(100)$ cannot be a half integer. There must be a mistake in our reasoning.

Let's go back and check our work. We noticed that we used the first condition $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$ without considering the base case. Let's check the base case:

For $n = 1$, we have $f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = 1$. So, $f(f(1)) = 1$.

Using the second condition, we have $f(f(1)) = 2f(1) + 1 = 1$. So, $2f(1) + 1 = 1$, which gives $2f(1) = 0$, and therefore $f(1) = 0$.

Now, let's use the second condition again: $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2*0 + 1 = 1$.

And using the first condition: $f(f(f(2))) = 8*2 - 7 = 9$. But we know that $f(f(f(2))) = f(f(1)) = 1$. So, there must be a mistake in our reasoning.

Let's try a different approach. We know that $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. If we let $n = 1$, we get $f(f(f(1))) = 1$. Since $f(f(1)) = 1$, we have $f(1) = 1$.

Using the second condition, we have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2*1 + 1 = 3$.

And using the first condition: $f(f(f(2))) = 8*2 - 7 = 9$. But we know that $f(f(f(2))) = f(f(3)) = 9$.

Now, let's use the second condition again: $f(6) = 2f(3) + 1 = 2*9 + 1 = 19$.

And using the first condition: $f(f(f(6))) = 8*6 - 7 = 45$. But we know that $f(f(f(6))) = f(f(19)) = 45$.

Now, let's use the second condition again: $f(38) = 2f(19) + 1 = 2*45 + 1 = 91$.

And using the first condition: $f(f(f(38))) = 8*38 - 7 = 301$. But we know that $f(f(f(38))) = f(f(91)) = 301$.

Now, let's use the second condition again: $f(182) = 2f(91) + 1 = 2*301 + 1 = 603$.

And using the first condition: $f(f(f(182))) = 8*182 - 7 = 1453$. But we know that $f(f(f(182))) = f(f(603)) = 1453$.

Now, let's use the second condition again: $f(1206) = 2f(603) + 1 = 2*1453 + 1 = 2907$.

And using the first condition: $f(f(f(1206))) = 8*1206 - 7 = 9645$. But we know that $f(f(f(1206))) = f(f(2907)) = 9645$.

Now, let's use the second condition again: $f(5814) = 2f(2907) + 1 = 2*9645 + 1 = 19291$.

And using the first condition: $f(f(f(5814))) = 8*5814 - 7 = 46507$. But we know that $f(f(f(5814))) = f(f(19291)) = 46507$.

Now, let's use the second condition again: $f(38582) = 2f(19291) + 1 = 2*46507 + 1 = 93015$.

And using the first condition: $f(f(f(38582))) = 8*38582 - 7 = 308653$. But we know that $f(f(f(38582))) = f(f(93015)) = 308653$.

Now, let's use the second condition again: $f(186030) = 2f(93015) + 1 = 2*308653 + 1 = 617307$.

And using the first condition: $f(f(f(186030))) = 8*186030 - 7 = 1488233$. But we know that $f(f(f(186030))) = f(f(617307)) = 1488233$.

Now, let's use the second condition again: $f(1234614) = 2f(617307) + 1 = 2*1488233 + 1 = 2976467$.

And using the first condition: $f(f(f(1234614))) = 8*1234614 - 7 = 9876907$. But we know that $f(f(f(123461

**Problem:** 
"The function $f(n)$ is defined on the positive integers such that $f(f(n)) = 2n$ and $f(4n + 1) = 4n + 3$ for all positive integers $n.$  Find $f(1000).$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Consider the expression $f(f(f(a))).$  Since $f(f(a)) = 2a,$ this is equal to $f(2a).$  But taking $n = f(a)$ in $f(f(n)) = 2n,$ we get
\[f(f(f(a))) = 2f(a).\]Hence,
\[f(2a) = 2f(a)\]for all positive integers $a.$

Then
\[f(1000) = 2f(500) = 4f(250) = 8f(125).\]Taking $n = 31$ in $f(4n + 1) = 4n + 3,$ we get

**Solution:** 



We will use the second condition to find $f(100)$. We know that $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. So if we can express $100$ in the form of $2n$, we can use this equation to find $f(100)$.

We have $100 = 2 \times 50$, so we can use the second condition to find $f(100)$:
\[f(100) = 2f(50) + 1.\]

Now we need to find $f(50)$. We can use the same method: $50 = 2 \times 25$, so
\[f(50) = 2f(25) + 1.\]

Next, we need to find $f(25)$. We can use the same method again: $25 = 2 \times 12 + 1$, so
\[f(25) = 2f(12) + 1.\]

Now we need to find $f(12)$. We can use the same method: $12 = 2 \times 6$, so
\[f(12) = 2f(6).\]

Next, we need to find $f(6)$. We can use the same method: $6 = 2 \times 3$, so
\[f(6) = 2f(3).\]

Finally, we need to find $f(3)$. We can use the first condition: $f(f(f(3))) = 8 \times 3 - 7 = 19$, so $f(f(3)) = 19$, and then $f(3) = f(19)$.

But we don't know $f(19)$ yet. We can use the first condition again: $f(f(f(19))) = 8 \times 19 - 7 = 145$, so $f(f(19)) = 145$, and then $f(19) = f(145)$.

But we don't know $f(145)$ yet. We can use the first condition again: $f(f(f(145))) = 8 \times 145 - 7 = 1153$, so $f(f(145)) = 1153$, and then $f(145) = f(1153)$.

But we don't know $f(1153)$ yet. We can use the first condition again: $f(f(f(1153))) = 8 \times 1153 - 7 = 9219$, so $f(f(1153)) = 9219$, and then $f(1153) = f(9219)$.

But we don't know $f(9219)$ yet. We can use the first condition again: $f(f(f(9219))) = 8 \times 9219 - 7 = 73745$, so $f(f(9219)) = 73745$, and then $f(9219) = f(73745)$.

But we don't know $f(73745)$ yet. We can use the first condition again: $f(f(f(73745))) = 8 \times 73745 - 7 = 589953$, so $f(f(73745)) = 589953$, and then $f(73745) = f(589953)$.

But we don't know $f(589953)$ yet. We can use the first condition again: $f(f(f(589953))) = 8 \times 589953 - 7 = 4719619$, so $f(f(589953)) = 4719619$, and then $f(589953) = f(4719619)$.

But we don't know $f(4719619)$ yet. We can use the first condition again: $f(f(f(4719619))) = 8 \times 4719619 - 7 = 37756945$, so $f(f(4719619)) = 37756945$, and then $f(4719619) = f(37756945)$.

But we don't know $f(37756945)$ yet. We can use the first condition again: $f(f(f(37756945))) = 8 \times 37756945 - 7 = 302055553$, so $f(f(37756945)) = 302055553$, and then $f(37756945) = f(302055553)$.

But we don't know $f(302055553)$ yet. We can use the first condition again: $f(f(f(302055553))) = 8 \times 302055553 - 7 = 2416444419$, so $f(f(302055553)) = 2416444419$, and then $f(302055553) = f(2416444419)$.

\[f(2a) = 2f(a)\]for all positive integers $a.$

Then
\[f(1000) = 2f(500) = 4f(250) = 8f(125).\]Taking $n = 31$ in $f(4n + 1) = 4n + 3,$ we get
\[f(125) = 127,\]so $f(1000) = \boxed{1016}.$ The answer is $\boxed{1016}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



To find $f(100)$, we can use the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to find $f(50)$ and $f(25)$, and then use the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to find $f(100)$.

First, we can use the second condition to find $f(50)$:
\[f(50) = 2f(25) + 1.\]
Next, we can use the second condition again to find $f(25)$:
\[f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1.\]
But $12.5$ is not a positive integer, so we cannot use the second condition directly to find $f(25)$. However, we can use the first condition to find $f(25)$:
\[f(f(f(12.5))) = 8(12.5) - 7 = 100.\]
So, $f(f(12.5)) = 50$ and $f(12.5) = 25$.

Now we can substitute $f(25)$ into the equation for $f(50)$:
\[f(50) = 2(25) + 1 = 51.\]

Finally, we can use the second condition to find $f(100)$:
\[f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2(51) + 1 = 103.\]

So, $f(100) = 103$. The answer is $\boxed{103}$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"The function $f$ is defined on the set of integers and satisfies \[f(n)= \begin{cases}  n-3 & \mbox{if }n\ge 1000 \\  f(f(n+5)) & \mbox{if }n<1000. \end{cases}\]Find $f(84)$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Denote by (1) and (2) the two parts of the definition of $f$, respectively. If we begin to use the definition of $f$ to compute $f(84)$, we use (2) until the argument is at least $1000$: \[f(84) = f(f(89)) = f(f(f(94))) = \dots = f^N(1004)\](where $f^N$ denotes composing $f$ with itself $N$ times, for some $N$). The numbers $84, 89, 94, \dots, 1004$ form an arithmetic sequence with common difference $5$; since $1004 - 84 = 920 = 184 \cdot 5$, this sequence has $184 + 1 = 185$ terms, so $N = 185$.

At this point, (1) and (2) are both used: we compute \[\begin{aligned} f^N(1004) &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-1}(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-1}(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(1000) \\ &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(997) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1002) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(999) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1004). \end{aligned}\]Repeating this process, we see that \[f^N(1004) = f^{N-2}(1004) = f^{N-4}(1004) = \dots = f^3(1004).\](The pattern breaks down for $f^k(1004)$ when $k$ is small, so it is not true that $f^3(1004) = f(1004)$.) Now, we have \[f^3(1004) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^2(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^2(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(1000) \stackrel{(1)}{=} \boxed{997}.\] The answer is $\boxed{997}$

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



To solve this problem, we will first set $n = 1$ in the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$ to get $f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = 1$. Since $f(f(f(1))) = 1$, we have $f(1) = k$ for some $k$ such that $f(k) = 1$.

Now, let's substitute $n = k$ into the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to get $f(2k) = 2f(k) + 1 = 2*1 + 1 = 3$. Since $f(2k) = 3$, we have $f(k) = 1$, which is consistent with our previous finding.

Now, let's substitute $n = 2$ into the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to get $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$. We know that $f(f(f(2))) = 8*2 - 7 = 9$, so $f(f(2)) = 9$. Since $f(f(2)) = 9$, we have $f(2) = m$ for some $m$ such that $f(m) = 9$.

Now, let's substitute $n = m$ into the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to get $f(2m) = 2f(m) + 1 = 2*9 + 1 = 19$. Since $f(2m) = 19$, we have $f(m) = 9$, which is consistent with our previous finding.

Now, we can substitute $n = 100$ into the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to get $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$. We know that $f(f(f(100))) = 8*100 - 7 = 793$, so $f(f(100)) = 793$. Since $f(f(100)) = 793$, we have $f(100) = p$ for some $p$ such that $f(p) = 793$.

However, we don't have enough information to directly find the value of $f(100)$ from the given equations. We need to find a pattern or a relationship between $f(n)$ and $f(2n)$ that can help us find $f(100)$.

Let's try to find a relationship between $f(n)$ and $f(2n)$ by substituting $n = f(n)$ into the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to get $f(2f(n)) = 2f(n) + 1$. Since $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, we have $f(f(f(n))) = 8f(n) - 7$.

Now, let's substitute $n = f(n)$ into the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$ to get $f(f(f(f(n)))) = 8f(f(n)) - 7$. Since $f(f(f(n))) = 8f(n) - 7$, we have $f(f(f(f(n)))) = 8(8f(n) - 7) - 7 = 64f(n) - 56 - 7 = 64f(n) - 63$.

Now, we have $f(f(f(f(n)))) = 64f(n) - 63$. Since $f(f(f(f(n)))) = f(2f(f(n))) = f(2f(n)) = 2f(2f(n)) + 1 = 2(2f(n) + 1) + 1 = 4f(n) + 3$, we have $4f(n) + 3 = 64f(n) - 63$.

Solving this equation for $f(n)$, we get $60f(n) = 66$, so $f(n) = \frac{66}{60} = \frac{11}{10}$. However, this is not a valid function value since function values must be integers.

Let's try another approach. We know that $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, so $f(f(f(n))) - 8n + 7 = 0$. Let's call this equation (1).

Now, let's substitute $n = f(n)$ into equation (1) to get $f(f(f(f(n)))) - 8f(n) + 7 = 0$. Since $f(f(f(f(n)))) = 64f(n) - 63$, we have $64f(n) - 63 - 8f(n) + 7 = 0$, which simplifies to $64f(n) - 8f(n) = 56$, or $60f(n) = 56$.

Solving this equation for $f(n)$, we get $f(n) = \frac{56}{60} = \frac{14}{15}$. Again, this is not a valid function value.

Let's try another approach. We know that $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, so $f(f(f(n))) - 8n + 7 = 0$. Let's call this equation (1).

Now, let's substitute $n = 2n$ into equation (1) to get $f(f(f(2n))) - 8(2n) + 7 = 0$. Since $f(f(f(2n))) = f(f(4n)) = f(8n - 7)$, we have $f(8n - 7) - 16n + 7 = 0$.

Now, let's substitute $n = 100$ into this equation to get $f(8*100 - 7) - 16*100 + 7 = 0$, or $f(793) - 1600 + 7 = 0$.

Solving this equation for $f(793)$, we get $f(793) = 1600 - 7 = 1593$.

Now, let's substitute $n = 793$ into the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to get $f(1586) = 2f(793) + 1 = 2*1593 + 1 = 3187$.

Now, let's substitute $n = 1586$ into the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to get $f(3172) = 2f(1586) + 1 = 2*3187 + 1 = 6375$.

Now, let's substitute $n = 3172$ into the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to get $f(6344) = 2f(3172) + 1 = 2*6375 + 1 =

**Solution:**


To find $f(100)$, we can use the second condition repeatedly to simplify the expression $f(100)$.

First, we have $f(100)$. Using the second condition, we can replace $f(100)$ with $f(2 \cdot 50)$:
\[f(100) = f(2 \cdot 50) = 2f(50) + 1.\]

Next, we can replace $f(50)$ with $f(2 \cdot 25)$:
\[f(100) = 2(2f(25) + 1) + 1 = 4f(25) + 3.\]

Continuing this process, we can replace $f(25)$ with $f(2 \cdot 12.5)$:
\[f(100) = 4(2f(12.5) + 1) + 3 = 8f(12.5) + 7.\]

Finally, we can use the first condition to find $f(12.5)$:
\[f(12.5) = f(f(f(12.5))) = 8 \cdot 12.5 - 7 = 93.\]

Substituting this back into the equation for $f(100)$, we get:
\[f(100) = 8 \cdot 93 + 7 = 744 + 7 = 751.\]

So, $f(100) = 751$. The answer is: $751$

**Solution:** 



To find the value of $f(100)$, we need to use the given functional equations to transform the argument 100 into the desired form.

First, we can see that $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. This implies that $f(f(n)) = 2n - 1$. Then, we can use this result to find $f(n)$. We have:

\[f(f(f(f(n)))) = f(2n - 1) = 2(2n - 1) - 1 = 4n - 3.\]

So, $f(f(n)) = 2n - 1$. Then,

\[f(f(f(f(f(n))))) = f(4n - 3) = 2(4n - 3) - 1 = 8n - 7.\]

So, $f(f(n)) = 2n - 1$. Then,

\[f(f(f(f(f(f(n)))))) = f(8n - 7) = 8n - 7.\]

This means that $f(n) = 2n - 1$. Therefore, we can find $f(100)$ by substituting $n = 100$ into $f(n) = 2n - 1$:

\[f(100) = 2 \cdot 100 - 1 = 199.\]

So, the value of $f(100)$ is 199. The answer is: $199$

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Denote by (1) and (2) the two parts of the definition of $f$, respectively.

**Problem**
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


To solve this problem, we need to find the value of $f(100)$ given the two conditions.

Let's start by substituting $n=1$ into the second condition: $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.

Now, let's substitute $n=2$ into the second condition: $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$.

We can substitute the expression for $f(2)$ from the previous step into this equation to get: $f(4) = 2(2f(1) + 1) + 1 = 4f(1) + 3$.

Now, let's substitute $n=4$ into the first condition: $f(f(f(4))) = 8*4 - 7 = 24 - 7 = 17$.

Since $f(f(f(4))) = 17$, we can substitute the expression for $f(4)$ from the previous step into this equation to get: $f(f(4f(1) + 3)) = 17$.

Now, let's substitute $n=f(1)$ into the second condition: $f(2f(1)) = 2f(f(1)) + 1$.

Since $2f(1)$ is equal to $f(4) + 3$, we can substitute this into the previous equation to get: $f(f(4f(1) + 3)) = f(2f(4) + 3) = 2f(f(4)) + 1$.

Now, we can substitute the expression for $f(4)$ from the previous step into this equation to get: $f(2(4f(1) + 3) + 3) = 2(4f(1) + 3) + 1 = 8f(1) + 7$.

Setting this equal to $17$, we get: $8f(1) + 7 = 17$, so $8f(1) = 10$, and $f(1) = \frac{5}{4}$.

However, $f(1)$ must be a natural number, so there must be an error in our calculations. Let's go back and check our work.

After re-examining our work, we realize that we made a mistake in the step where we substituted $n=4$ into the first condition. The correct equation should be $f(f(f(4))) = 8*4 - 7 = 32 - 7 = 25$.

Now, let's substitute $n=4$ into the first condition again: $f(f(f(4))) = 25$.

Since $f(f(f(4))) = 25$, we can substitute the expression for $f(4)$ from the previous step into this equation to get: $f(f(4f(1) + 3)) = 25$.

Now, let's substitute $n=f(1)$ into the second condition again: $f(2f(1)) = 2f(f(1)) + 1$.

Since $2f(1)$ is equal to $f(4) + 3$, we can substitute this into the previous equation to get: $f(f(4f(1) + 3)) = f(2f(4) + 3) = 2f(f(4)) + 1$.

Now, we can substitute the expression for $f(4)$ from the previous step into this equation to get: $f(2(4f(1) + 3) + 3) = 2(4f(1) + 3) + 1 = 8f(1) + 7$.

Setting this equal to $25$, we get: $8f(1) + 7 = 25$, so $8f(1) = 18$, and $f(1) = \frac{9}{4}$.

Again, $f(1)$ must be a natural number, so there must be another error in our calculations. Let's go back and check our work again.

After re-examining our work, we realize that we made a mistake in the step where we substituted $n=1$ into the second condition. The correct equation should be $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.

Now, let's substitute $n=1$ into the second condition again: $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.

Since $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$, we can substitute the value of $f(1)$ from the previous step into this equation to get: $f(2) = 2*\frac{9}{4} + 1 = \frac{9}{2} + 1 = \frac{11}{2}$.

However, $f(2)$ must be a natural number, so there must be another error in our calculations. Let's go back and check our work again.

After re-examining our work, we realize that we made a mistake in the step where we substituted $n=2$ into the second condition. The correct equation should be $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$.

Now, let's substitute $n=2$ into the second condition again: $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$.

Since $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$, we can substitute the value of $f(2)$ from the previous step into this equation to get: $f(4) = 2*\frac{11}{2} + 1 = 11 + 1 = 12$.

Now, let's substitute $n=4$ into the first condition again: $f(f(f(4))) = 8*4 - 7 = 32 - 7 = 25$.

Since $f(f(f(4))) = 25$, we can substitute the expression for $f(4)$ from the previous step into this equation to get: $f(f(12)) = 25$.

Now, let's substitute $n=12$ into the second condition again: $f(24) = 2f(12) + 1$.

Since $f(24) = 2f(12) + 1$, we can substitute the value of $f(12)$ from the previous step into this equation to get: $f(24) = 2*12 + 1 = 25$.

Now, let's substitute $n=24$ into the first condition again: $f(f(f(24))) = 8*24 - 7 = 192 - 7 = 185$.

Since $f(f(f(24))) = 185$, we can substitute the value of $f(24)$ from the previous step into this equation to get: $f(25) = 185$.

Now, let's substitute $n=25$ into the second condition again: $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.

Since $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$, we can substitute the value of $f(25)$ from the previous step into this equation to get: $f(50) = 2*185 + 1 = 371$.

Now, let's substitute $n=50$ into the first condition again: $f(f(f(50))) = 8*50 - 7 = 400 - 7 = 393$.

Since $f(f(f(50))) = 393$, we can substitute the value of $

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"The function $f$ is defined on the set of integers and satisfies \[f(n)= \begin{cases}  n-3 & \mbox{if }n\ge 1000 \\  f(f(n+5)) & \mbox{if }n<1000. \end{cases}\]Find $f(84)$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Denote by (1) and (2) the two parts of the definition of $f$, respectively. If we begin to use the definition of $f$ to compute $f(84)$, we use (2) until the argument is at least $1000$: \[f(84) = f(f(89)) = f(f(f(94))) = \dots = f^N(1004)\](where $f^N$ denotes composing $f$ with itself $N$ times, for some $N$). The numbers $84, 89, 94, \dots, 1004$ form an arithmetic sequence with common difference $5$; since $1004 - 84 = 920 = 184 \cdot 5$, this sequence has $184 + 1 = 185$ terms, so $N = 185$.

At this point, (1) and (2) are both used: we compute \[\begin{aligned} f^N(1004) &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-1}(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-1}(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(1000) \\ &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(997) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1002) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(999) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1004). \end{aligned}\]Repeating this process, we see that \[f^N(1004) = f^{N-2}(1004) = f^{N-4}(1004) = \dots = f^3(1004).\](The pattern breaks down for $f^k(1004)$ when $k$ is small, so it is not true that $f^3(1004) = f(1004)$.) Now, we have \[f^3(1004) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^2(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^2(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(1000) \stackrel{(1)}{=} \boxed{997}.\] The answer is $\boxed{997}$

**Problem**
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


To solve this problem, we can start by plugging in $n=1$ into the second equation to get $f(2)=2f(1)+1$. Then we can plug in $f(1)$ into the first equation of the first condition to get $f(f(f(1)))=8f(1)-7$. Since $f(f(f(1)))=f(f(2))$, we can substitute $f(2)$ from the second equation into this equation to get $f(f(2))=8f(1)-7$. Then we can substitute $f(2)$ from the second equation into this equation to get $f(2f(1)+1)=8f(1)-7$.

Now we have a system of equations:
1. $f(2f(1)+1)=8f(1)-7$
2. $f(2)=2f(1)+1$

We can solve this system of equations to find the value of $f(1)$. By trying different values for $f(1)$, we find that $f(1)=3$ satisfies both equations.

Now that we know $f(1)=3$, we can use the second equation to find $f(2)=2f(1)+1=2*3+1=7$. Then we can use the first equation to find $f(f(f(1)))=f(f(3))=f(8)=8f(1)-7=8*3-7=17$. Since $f(f(f(1)))=f(f(3))$, we can substitute $f(3)$ from the second equation into this equation to get $f(f(3))=17$. Then we can substitute $f(3)$ from the second equation into this equation to get $f(2f(1)+1)=17$.

Now we have another system of equations:
1. $f(2f(1)+1)=17$
2. $f(3)=2f(1)+1=2*3+1=7$

We can solve this system of equations to find the value of $f(3)$. By trying different values for $f(3)$, we find that $f(3)=7$ satisfies both equations.

Now that we know $f(3)=7$, we can use the second equation to find $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2*7+1=15$. Then we can use the first equation to find $f(f(f(2)))=f(f(7))=f(15)=8f(2)-7=8*7-7=51$. Since $f(f(f(2)))=f(f(7))$, we can substitute $f(7)$ from the second equation into this equation to get $f(f(7))=51$. Then we can substitute $f(7)$ from the second equation into this equation to get $f(2f(2)+1)=51$.

Now we have another system of equations:
1. $f(2f(2)+1)=51$
2. $f(7)=2f(2)+1=2*7+1=15$

We can solve this system of equations to find the value of $f(7)$. By trying different values for $f(7)$, we find that $f(7)=15$ satisfies both equations.

Now that we know $f(7)=15$, we can use the second equation to find $f(8)=2f(4)+1=2*15+1=31$. Then we can use the first equation to find $f(f(f(4)))=f(f(15))=f(31)=8f(4)-7=8*15-7=113$. Since $f(f(f(4)))=f(f(15))$, we can substitute $f(15)$ from the second equation into this equation to get $f(f(15))=113$. Then we can substitute $f(15)$ from the second equation into this equation to get $f(2f(4)+1)=113$.

Now we have another system of equations:
1. $f(2f(4)+1)=113$
2. $f(15)=2f(4)+1=2*15+1=31$

We can solve this system of equations to find the value of $f(15)$. By trying different values for $f(15)$, we find that $f(15)=31$ satisfies both equations.

Now that we know $f(15)=31$, we can use the second equation to find $f(16)=2f(8)+1=2*31+1=63$. Then we can use the first equation to find $f(f(f(8)))=f(f(31))=f(63)=8f(8)-7=8*31-7=241$. Since $f(f(f(8)))=f(f(31))$, we can substitute $f(31)$ from the second equation into this equation to get $f(f(31))=241$. Then we can substitute $f(31)$ from the second equation into this equation to get $f(2f(8)+1)=241$.

Now we have another system of equations:
1. $f(2f(8)+1)=241$
2. $f(31)=2f(8)+1=2*31+1=63$

We can solve this system of equations to find the value of $f(31)$. By trying different values for $f(31)$, we find that $f(31)=63$ satisfies both equations.

Now that we know $f(31)=63$, we can use the second equation to find $f(32)=2f(16)+1=2*63+1=127$. Then we can use the first equation to find $f(f(f(16)))=f(f(63))=f(127)=8f(16)-7=8*63-7=503$. Since $f(f(f(16)))=f(f(63))$, we can substitute $f(63)$ from the second equation into this equation to get $f(f(63))=503$. Then we can substitute $f(63)$ from the second equation into this equation to get $f(2f(16)+1)=503$.

Now we have another system of equations:
1. $f(2f(16)+1)=503$
2. $f(63)=2f(16)+1=2*63+1=127$

We can solve this system of equations to find the value of $f(63)$. By trying different values for $f(63)$, we find that $f(63)=127$ satisfies both equations.

Now that we know $f(63)=127$, we can use the second equation to find $f(64)=2f(32)+1=2*127+1=255$. Then we can use the first equation to find $f(f(f(32)))=f(f(127))=f(255)=8f(32)-7=8*127-7=1013$. Since $f(f(f(32)))=f(f(127))$, we can substitute $f(127)$ from the second equation into this equation to get $f(f(127))=1013$. Then we can substitute $f(127)$ from the second equation into this equation to get $f(2f(32)+1)=1013$.

Now we have another system of equations:
1. $f(2f

**Problem:** 
"The function $f(n)$ is defined on the positive integers such that $f(f(n)) = 2n$ and $f(4n + 1) = 4n + 3$ for all positive integers $n.$  Find $f(1000).$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Consider the expression $f(f(f(a))).$  Since $f(f(a)) = 2a,$ this is equal to $f(2a).$  But taking $n = f(a)$ in $f(f(n)) = 2n,$ we get
\[f(f(f(a))) = 2f(a).\]Hence,
\[f(2a) = 2f(a)\]for all positive integers $a.$

Then
\[f(1000) = 2f(500) = 4f(250) = 8f(125).\]Taking $n = 31$ in $f(4n + 1) = 4n + 3,$ we get
\[f(125) = 127,\]so $f(1000) = \boxed{1016}.$ The answer is $\boxed{1016}$

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


We can start by applying the function $f$ to both sides of the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. This gives us $f(f(n)) = f(8n-7)$. Now, we can apply the function $f$ again to both sides of this equation to get $f(n) = f(f(8n-7))$.

We also know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Let's substitute $n = f(n)$ into this equation to get $f(2f(n)) = 2f(f(n)) + 1$.

Now, we can substitute $f(f(8n-7))$ for $n$ in this equation to get $f(2f(f(8n-7))) = 2f(f(f(8n-7))) + 1$.

We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, so we can substitute this into the equation to get $f(2f(f(8n-7))) = 2(8n-7) + 1$.

We also know that $f(f(n)) = f(8n-7)$, so we can substitute this into the equation to get $f(2f(f(8n-7))) = 2f(f(8n-7)) + 1$.

Now, we can substitute $f(f(8n-7))$ with $f(n)$ to get $f(2f(n)) = 2f(n) + 1$.

This equation is the same as the original equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, so we have shown that the function $f$ satisfies the equation $f(2f(n)) = 2f(n) + 1$ for all positive integers $n$.

Now, let's calculate $f(100)$. We know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, so we can substitute $n = 50$ to get $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.

Again, we can substitute $n = 25$ into the equation to get $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.

Continuing this process, we can find that $f(100) = 2(2(2(2f(5) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1$.

We know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, so we can substitute $n = 5$ to get $f(10) = 2f(5) + 1$.

Again, we can substitute $n = 5$ into the equation to get $f(10) = 2f(5) + 1$.

Finally, we can substitute $n = 5$ into the equation to get $f(10) = 2f(5) + 1$.

We know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, so we can substitute $n = 2$ to get $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$.

Again, we can substitute $n = 2$ into the equation to get $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$.

Finally, we can substitute $n = 2$ into the equation to get $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$.

We know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, so we can substitute $n = 1$ to get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.

Again, we can substitute $n = 1$ into the equation to get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.

Finally, we can substitute $n = 1$ into the equation to get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.

We know that $f(1) = 1$, so we can substitute this into the equation to get $f(2) = 2(1) + 1 = 3$.

We can substitute $f(2) = 3$ into the equation $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$ to get $f(4) = 2(3) + 1 = 7$.

We can substitute $f(4) = 7$ into the equation $f(10) = 2f(5) + 1$ to get $f(10) = 2(7) + 1 = 15$.

We can substitute $f(10) = 15$ into the equation $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$ to get $f(50) = 2(15) + 1 = 31$.

Finally, we can substitute $f(50) = 31$ into the equation $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$ to get $f(100) = 2(31) + 1 = 63$.

So, the value of $f(100)$ is 63. The answer is: $63$

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


To solve this problem, we can use the second condition to simplify the first one.

From the second condition, we have $f(f(f(n)))=f(2f(f(n)) + 1)$. Comparing this with the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we can see that $2f(f(n)) + 1 = 8n - 7$.

Rearranging the equation gives $2f(f(n)) = 8n - 8$, and further simplification gives $f(f(n)) = 4n - 4$.

Now, we can substitute $f(f(n)) = 4n - 4$ into the second condition to get $f(2n) = 2(4n - 4) + 1 = 8n - 7$.

This means that the function $f(n) = 4n - 3$ satisfies both conditions. Now we can calculate $f(100)$ by substituting $n = 100$ into the function:

To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. Let's set $n=1$, then we have $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$. So $f(f(1))=1$, and then $f(1)=1$.

2. We also know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Let's set $n=1$, then we have $f(2)=2f(1)+1=2*1+1=3$.

3. Now let's find $f(100)$. We know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, so we can find $f(50)$ first, then $f(25)$, $f(12.5)$ (but $12.5$ is not a positive integer, so we stop here).

4. We can't find $f(100)$ directly from the given equations. But we know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, and we've found that $f(1)=1$. So we can set $n=50$, then we have $f(f(f(50)))=8*50-7=393$. So $f(f(50))=393$, and then $f(50)=393$.

5. Similarly, we can set $n=25$, then we have $f(f(f(25)))=8*25-7=193$. So $f(f(25))=193$, and then $f(25)=193$.

6. Finally, we set $n=12.5$, then we have $f(f(f(12.5)))=8*12.5-7=93$. So $f(f(12.5))=93$, and then $f(12.5)=93$. But $12.5$ is not a positive integer, so we stop here.

7. Now we have $f(1)=1$, $f(2)=3$, $f(50)=393$, and $f(25)=193$. We can use these values to find $f(100)$. From $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we have $f(100)=2f(50)+1=2*393+1=787$.

So the value of $f(100)$ is $787$.

```python

\[f(f(f(a))) = 2f(a).\]Hence,
\[f(2a) = 2f(a)\]for all positive integers $a.$

Then
\[f(1000) = 2f(500) = 4f(250) = 8f(125).\]Taking $n = 31$ in $f(4n + 1) = 4n + 3,$ we get
\[f(125) = 127,\]so $f(1000) = \boxed{1016}.$ The answer is $\boxed{1016}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



To find $f(100)$, we can use the second condition $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. We can repeatedly apply this condition to get $f(100)$ in terms of $f(50)$, $f(25)$, and so on.

First, we have $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.
Then, $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.
Continuing, $f(25) = 2f(12.5)$.
But $f(12.5)$ is not a valid input for the function $f$, since it is not a positive integer. So we need to use the first condition $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$.

Setting $n = 12.5$, we get $f(f(f(12.5))) = 8(12.5) - 7 = 93.5$, which is not an integer. So we must have made a mistake in our reasoning.

Let's go back and retrace our steps. We know that $f(25) = 2f(12.5)$. But we also know that $f(f(f(12.5))) = 8(12.5) - 7 = 93.5$. So we must have $f(12.5) = \frac{93.5}{8} = 11.6875$, which is not an integer. This means we must have made a mistake in our reasoning.

Let's try a different approach. We know that $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$. We can substitute $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$ into this equation to get $f(100) = 2(2f(25) + 1) + 1 = 4f(25) + 3$.

Now, we can substitute $f(25) = 2f(12.5)$ into this equation to get $f(100) = 4(2f(12.5)) + 3 = 8f(12.5) + 3$.

But we know that $f(f(f(12.5))) = 8(12.5) - 7 = 93.5$, so $f(12.5) = \frac{93.5}{8} = 11.6875$, which is not an integer. This means we must have made a mistake in our reasoning.
