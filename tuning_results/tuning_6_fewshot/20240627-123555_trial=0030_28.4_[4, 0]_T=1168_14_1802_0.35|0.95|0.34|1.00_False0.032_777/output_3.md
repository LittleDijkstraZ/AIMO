**Problem:** 
"Five identical rectangles are arranged to form a larger rectangle $PQRS$, as shown.  The area of $PQRS$ is $4000$.  What is the length, $x$, rounded off to the nearest integer? [asy]
real x = 1; real w = 2/3;

// Draw outer square and labels

draw(left--right);
label("$x$", (x/2, -0.1), S);

[/asy]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Let $w$ be the width of each of the identical rectangles. Since $PQ=3w$, $RS=2x$ and $PQ=RS$ (because $PQRS$ is a rectangle), then $2x = 3w$, or $$w=\frac{2}{3}x.$$ Therefore, the area of each of the five identical rectangles is $$x\left(\frac{2}{3}x\right)=\frac{2}{3}x^2.$$ Since the area of $PQRS$ is 4000 and it is made up of five of these identical smaller rectangles, then $$5\left(\frac{2}{3}x^2\right)=4000$$ or $$\frac{10}{3}x^2 = 4000$$ or $x^2 = 1200$ or $x \approx 34.6$ which, when rounded off to the nearest integer, is $\boxed{35}.$ The answer is $\boxed{35}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

**Solution:** 



The problem is asking for the area of a polygon formed by the points that satisfy the given equation. The equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either of the expressions must be zero for the product to be zero. This gives us two sets of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first set of equations, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$. This gives us four equations:

1. $x + y = 10$ and $x = 8$.
2. $x + y = -10$ and $x = 8$.
3. $-x - y = 10$ and $x = 8$.
4. $-x - y = -10$ and $x = 8$.

Solving these equations, we get the points $(8, 2)$, $(8, -20)$, $(8, 18)$, and $(8, -8)$.

For the second set of equations, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us four more equations:

1. $x - y = 10$ and $y = 8$.
2. $x - y = -10$ and $y = 8$.
3. $-x + y = 10$ and $y = 8$.
4. $-x + y = -10$ and $y = 8$.

Solving these equations, we get the points $(18, 8)$, $(-2, 8)$, $(2, 8)$, and $(-18, 8)$.

Now we have the vertices of the polygon: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -20)$, $(8, 18)$, $(8, -8)$, $(18, 8)$, $(-2, 8)$, $(2, 8)$, and $(-18, 8)$. We can plot these points on a coordinate plane to visualize the polygon.

The polygon is a square with side length 16. To find its area, we simply square the length of one of its sides: $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many square units are in the area of the triangle whose vertices are the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the curve $y = (x-3)^2 (x+2)$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we need to find where this curve intersects the $x$ and $y$ axes.  If $y=0$, then $(x-3)^2(x+2)=0$, which has solutions of $x=3$ and $x=-2$.  If $x=0$, then $y=(-3)^2(2)=18$.  So, the curve has two $x$-intercepts and one $y$-intercept.  The length of the base along the $x$-axis is $3-(-2)=5$.  The height from this base is equal to the $y$-intercept, 18.  The area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 5\cdot 18=\boxed{45}$. The answer is $\boxed{45}$

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

2. Similarly, the expression $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

3. The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 10 (since the distance between the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$ is 10, and similarly for the other two pairs of lines).

4. The area of this square is side length squared, which is $10^2 = 100$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_ 2= (-16,2).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that
\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as
\[\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1.\]Find $h + k + a + b.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

The error in the code is due to the fact that the `solveset` function does not support equations with absolute values. To solve this problem, we can first solve the equations without absolute values and then consider the cases with absolute values separately.

Let's rewrite the equations without absolute values:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ becomes $((x + y) - 10)^2 + ((x - y) - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ becomes $(x - 8)^2 + (y - 8)^2 = 0$.

Now, let's solve these equations:

1. $((x + y) - 10)^2 + ((x - y) - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ or $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$. The first case gives $x = 10$ and $y = 0$, and the second case gives $x = 0$ and $y = 10$.
2. $(x - 8)^2 + (y - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $x = 8$ and $y = 8$.

Now, we consider the cases with absolute values:

1. For the first equation with absolute values, we have four cases:
   a. $x + y \geq 0$ and $x - y \geq 0$, which gives $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$. This case gives $x = 10$ and $y = 0$.
   b. $x + y \geq 0$ and $x - y \leq 0$, which gives $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$. This case gives $x = 0$ and $y = 10$.
   c. $x + y \leq 0$ and $x - y \geq 0$, which gives $-x - y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$. This case gives $x = -10$ and $y = 0$.
   d. $x + y \leq 0$ and $x - y \leq 0$, which gives $-x - y = 10$ and $-x + y = -10$. This case gives $x = 0$ and $y = -10$.

2. For the second equation with absolute values, we have four cases:
   a. $x \geq 0$ and $y \geq 0$, which gives $x = 8$ and $y = 8$.
   b. $x \geq 0$ and $y \leq 0$, which gives $x = 8$ and $-y = 8$, or $x = 8$ and $y = -8$.
   c. $x \leq 0$ and $y \geq 0$, which gives $-x = 8$ and $y = 8$, or $x = -8$ and $y = 8$.
   d. $x \leq 0$ and $y \leq 0$, which gives $-x = 8$ and $-y = 8$, or $x = -8$ and $y = -8$.

Combining all the cases, we find that the points that satisfy the original equations are $(10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$. These points form a square with side length 16. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

"Find the number of 10-tuples $(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{10})$ of real numbers such that
\[(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2 = \frac{1}{11}.\]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,
\begin{align*}
&[(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + \dots + 1^2 + 1^2)][(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2] \\
&\ge [(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + (x_2 - x_3) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10}]^2 = 1.
\end{align*}From the given condition, we have equality, so by the equality condition for Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[\frac{1 - x_1}{1} = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{1} = \frac{x_2 - x_3}{1} = \dots = \frac{x_9 - x_{10}}{1} = \frac{x_{10}}{1}.\]Let
\[d = 1 - x_1 = x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_3 = \dots = x_9 - x_{10} = x_{10}.\]Then
\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so
\[(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_{10}) = \left( \frac{10}{11}, \frac{9}{11}, \frac{8}{11}, \dots, \frac{1}{11} \right).\]In particular, there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, -2)$, and $(-8, 2)$.

Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$.

The intersection of these two squares is a smaller square with side length $8$. The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$.

"How many square units are in the area of the triangle whose vertices are the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the curve $y = (x-3)^2 (x+2)$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we need to find where this curve intersects the $x$ and $y$ axes.  If $y=0$, then $(x-3)^2(x+2)=0$, which has solutions of $x=3$ and $x=-2$.  If $x=0$, then $y=(-3)^2(2)=18$.  So, the curve has two $x$-intercepts and one $y$-intercept.  The length of the base along the $x$-axis is $3-(-2)=5$.  The height from this base is equal to the $y$-intercept, 18.  The area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 5\cdot 18=\boxed{45}$. The answer is $\boxed{45}$

\end{align*}From the given condition, we have equality, so by the equality condition for Cauchy-Schwarz,

\[d = 1 - x_1 = x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_3 = \dots = x_9 - x_{10} = x_{10}.\]Then
\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. Therefore, either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. This gives us two sets of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first set of equations, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$. This implies $-10 \leq x + y \leq 10$ and $-8 \leq x \leq 8$. Similarly, for the second set of equations, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies $-10 \leq x - y \leq 10$ and $-8 \leq y \leq 8$.

The intersection of these four inequalities gives us the vertices of the convex polygon. The polygon is a square with side length 16 (since the maximum value of $x$ is 8 and the maximum value of $y$ is 8). The area of the square is therefore $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

\[d = 1 - x_1 = x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_3 = \dots = x_9 - x_{10} = x_{10}.\]Then
\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



To solve this problem, we first need to understand the given equation and the conditions it imposes on $x$ and $y$. The equation is of the form $AB = 0$, which implies that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us the equations $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. These are the equations of the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

For the second case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us the equations $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. These are the equations of the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersection points of these lines form a rectangle with side lengths $20$ and $16$. The area of this rectangle is $20 \times 16 = 320$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $320$.

The answer is: $320$

label("$x$", (x/2, -0.1), S);

[/asy]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Let $w$ be the width of each of the identical rectangles. Since $PQ=3w$, $RS=2x$ and $PQ=RS$ (because $PQRS$ is a rectangle), then $2x = 3w$, or $$w=\frac{2}{3}x.$$ Therefore, the area of each of the five identical rectangles is $$x\left(\frac{2}{3}x\right)=\frac{2}{3}x^2.$$ Since the area of $PQRS$ is 4000 and it is made up of five of these identical smaller rectangles, then $$5\left(\frac{2}{3}x^2\right)=4000$$ or $$\frac{10}{3}x^2 = 4000$$ or $x^2 = 1200$ or $x \approx 34.6$ which, when rounded off to the nearest integer, is $\boxed{35}.$ The answer is $\boxed{35}$

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


This problem is a bit tricky to solve directly. However, we can use the fact that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to the following system of equations:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From equations 3 and 4, we get that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that $-8 \leq x, y \leq 8$.

From equations 1 and 2, we get that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that either $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$, and either $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$. Solving these systems of equations, we find that the possible combinations for $(x, y)$ are:

- $(5, 5)$
- $(-5, -5)$
- $(5, -5)$
- $(-5, 5)$
- $(8, 2)$
- $(-8, -2)$
- $(8, -2)$
- $(-8, 2)$
- $(2, 8)$
- $(-2, -8)$
- $(2, -8)$
- $(-2, 8)$

Plotting these points in the coordinate plane, we see that they form a square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$. The area of this square is $(10\sqrt{2})^2 = 200$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $200$.

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

The first term is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, and this equals zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, and their reflections across the coordinate axes. These lines form a square with side length 10.

The second term is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$, and this equals zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$, and their reflections across the coordinate axes, as well as the lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$, and their reflections across the coordinate axes. These lines form a square with side length 16.

The area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points satisfying the given equation is the area of the smaller square. The side length of this square is 10, so its area is $10^2 = 100$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So, the given equation is equivalent to the following two equations:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From equation 1, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us four lines in the coordinate plane: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

From equation 2, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us four lines in the coordinate plane: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersection points of these lines form a square with side length 10 (the distance between the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$, or between the lines $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$). The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 100.

    # The side length of the square is the distance between the lines x + y = 10 and x + y = -10, or between the lines x - y = 10 and x - y = -10.
    side_length = 10
