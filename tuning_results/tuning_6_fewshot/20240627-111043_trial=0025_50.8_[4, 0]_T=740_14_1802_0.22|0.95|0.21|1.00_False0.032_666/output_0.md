CODE RESULTS 68 + 32/k**2

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
68 + 32/k**2
```
The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $\boxed{68 + \frac{32}{k^2}}$. However, we know that $k, l > 0$, so $k^2 > 0$. Therefore, the term $\frac{32}{k^2}$ is positive. Hence, the sum of the squares of the distances is always greater than $68$.

However, we are missing an important piece of information: the relationship between $k$ and $l$. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$ that are distance 6 apart. This means that the discriminant of the quadratic equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$ should be positive, and the distance between the roots should be 6.

The discriminant of the quadratic equation is $(2k)^2 - 4k(l - 4) = 4k^2 - 4kl + 16k$. The distance between the roots is given by $\sqrt{D/k}$, where $D$ is the discriminant. So we have $\sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}/k = 6$. Squaring both sides gives $4k^2 - 4kl + 16k = 36k^2$. Rearranging terms gives $32k^2 + 4kl = 0$. Since $k$ and $l$ are both positive, we can divide by $4k$ to get $8k + l = 0$. So $l = -8k$.

Substituting $l = -8k$ into the expression for the sum of the squares of the distances gives $68 + \frac{32}{k^2} = 68 + \frac{32}{-8} = 68 - 4 = 64$.

So the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $64$. The answer is: $64$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"The smallest distance between the origin and a point on the parabola $y=x^2-5$ can be expressed as $\sqrt{a}/b$, where $a$ and $b$ are positive integers, and $a$ is not divisible by the square of any prime.  Find $a+b$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the distance formula, we are trying to minimize $\sqrt{x^2+y^2}=\sqrt{x^2+x^4-10x^2+25}$. In general minimization problems like this require calculus, but one elementary optimization method that sometimes works is completing the square.  We have $$\sqrt{x^2+x^4-10x^2+25}=\sqrt{(x^2-9/2)^2+(25-81/4)}.$$This expression is minimized when the square equals $0$, i.e. when $x=\pm 3/\sqrt{2}.$ For this value of $x$, the distance is $$\sqrt{25-\frac{81}{4}}=\frac{\sqrt{19}}{2}.$$Hence the desired answer is $\boxed{21}$. The answer is $\boxed{21}$

The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $32 + \frac{(k - \sqrt{k(k - l + 4)})^2}{k^2} + \frac{(k + \sqrt{k(k - l + 4)})^2}{k^2}$. However, we know that the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, which gives us the equation $ (x_2 - x_1)^2 = 36$, where $x_1$ and $x_2$ are the roots of the parabola. From this equation, we can derive that $k(k - l + 4) = 9$. Substituting this into the expression for the sum of squares of distances, we get:

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $\mathcal{P}$ be the parabola in the plane determined by the equation $y = x^2.$  Suppose a circle $\mathcal{C}$ intersects $\mathcal{P}$ at four distinct points.  If three of these points are $(-28,784),$ $(-2,4),$ and $(13,169),$ find the sum of the distances from the focus of $\mathcal{P}$ to all four of the intersection points."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Let the four intersection points be $(a,a^2),$ $(b,b^2),$ $(c,c^2),$ and $(d,d^2).$  Let the equation of the circle be
\[(x - k)^2 + (y - h)^2 = r^2.\]Substituting $y = x^2,$ we get
\[(x - k)^2 + (x^2 - h)^2 = r^2.\]Expanding this equation, we get a fourth degree polynomial whose roots are $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ and $d.$  Furthermore, the coefficient of $x^3$ is 0, so by Vieta's formulas, $a + b + c + d = 0.$

We are given that three intersection points are $(-28,784),$ $(-2,4),$ and $(13,196),$ so the fourth root is $-((-28) + (-2) + 13) = 17.$

The distance from the focus to a point on the parabola is equal to the distance from the point to the directrix, which is $y = -\frac{1}{4}.$  Thus, the sum of the distances is
\[784 + \frac{1}{4} + 4 + \frac{1}{4} + 169 + \frac{1}{4} + 17^2 + \frac{1}{4} = \boxed{1247}.\] The answer is $\boxed{1247}$

The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $\boxed{\frac{45}{2}}$. However, this is not a valid answer as it is not a positive integer. Let's reevaluate the problem and correct the steps.

The problem states that the points $A$ and $B$ are distance 6 apart. This means that the difference of the $x$-coordinates of the points is 6. Let's denote the $x$-coordinates of the points $A$ and $B$ as $x_1$ and $x_2$, respectively. Then we have $x_2 - x_1 = 6$.

Now, let's find the $x$-coordinates of the points $A$ and $B$. We know that the points of intersection of the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ and the line $y = 4$ are the solutions of the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$. By the quadratic formula, the solutions are given by
$$x = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{(2k)^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k} = 1 \pm \sqrt{1 - (l - 4)}.$$
So, the $x$-coordinates of the points $A$ and $B$ are $x_1 = 1 - \sqrt{1 - (l - 4)}$ and $x_2 = 1 + \sqrt{1 - (l - 4)}$.

Now, we have $x_2 - x_1 = 2\sqrt{1 - (l - 4)} = 6$. Squaring both sides, we get $4(1 - (l - 4)) = 36$, which simplifies to $4(5 - l) = 36$, or $20 - 4l = 36$. Solving for $l$, we get $l = -\frac{16}{4} = -4$. However, this is not possible because $l > 0$.

$$x = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{(2k)^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k} = 1 \pm \sqrt{1 - (l - 4)}.$$
So, the $x$-coordinates of the points $A$ and $B$ are $x_1 = 1 - \sqrt{1 - (l - 4)}$ and $x_2 = 1 + \sqrt{1 - (l - 4)}$.

Now, we have $x_2 - x_1 = 2\sqrt{1 - (l - 4)} = 6$. Squaring both sides, we get $4(1 - (l - 4)) = 36$, which simplifies to $4(5 - l) = 36$, or $20 - 4l = 36$. Solving for $l$, we get $l = -\frac{16}{4} = -4$. However, this is not possible because $l > 0$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $\mathcal{P}$ be the parabola in the plane determined by the equation $y = x^2.$  Suppose a circle $\mathcal{C}$ intersects $\mathcal{P}$ at four distinct points.  If three of these points are $(-28,784),$ $(-2,4),$ and $(13,169),$ find the sum of the distances from the focus of $\mathcal{P}$ to all four of the intersection points."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Let the four intersection points be $(a,a^2),$ $(b,b^2),$ $(c,c^2),$ and $(d,d^2).$  Let the equation of the circle be
\[(x - k)^2 + (y - h)^2 = r^2.\]Substituting $y = x^2,$ we get
\[(x - k)^2 + (x^2 - h)^2 = r^2.\]Expanding this equation, we get a fourth degree polynomial whose roots are $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ and $d.$  Furthermore, the coefficient of $x^3$ is 0, so by Vieta's formulas, $a + b + c + d = 0.$

We are given that three intersection points are $(-28,784),$ $(-2,4),$ and $(13,196),$ so the fourth root is $-((-28) + (-2) + 13) = 17.$

The distance from the focus to a point on the parabola is equal to the distance from the point to the directrix, which is $y = -\frac{1}{4}.$  Thus, the sum of the distances is
\[784 + \frac{1}{4} + 4 + \frac{1}{4} + 169 + \frac{1}{4} + 17^2 + \frac{1}{4} = \boxed{1247}.\] The answer is $\boxed{1247}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



```python
