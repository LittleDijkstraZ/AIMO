Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So the equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ must be true for points $(x, y)$ to be inside the polygon.

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives the vertices of the polygon as $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

So the vertices of the polygon are the points where the absolute value equations are satisfied. These points form a square with side length 16.

The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side, so the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Rational, simplify

def calculate_area():
    # The side length of the square is 16
    side_length = 16

    # The area of the square is side_length^2
    area = side_length**2

    return area

result = calculate_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is $\boxed{256}$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.

The first term is zero when either $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x-y| - 10 = 0$. This simplifies to $|x+y| = 10$ or $|x-y| = 10$. These are the equations of two lines in the plane.

The second term is zero when either $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$. This simplifies to $|x| = 8$ or $|y| = 8$. These are the equations of two lines in the plane.

The intersection of these lines form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So the area of the convex polygon is 256.

Here is a Python function to calculate the area of the square:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_square():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = area_of_square()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$
