**Problem:** 
"Find the minimum value of $2x^2 + 2y^2 + 5z^2 - 2xy - 4yz - 4x - 2z + 15$ over all real numbers $x,$ $y,$ $z.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
We can write the given expression as
\begin{align*}
&(x^2 - 4x + 4) + (x^2 - 2xy + y^2) + (y^2 - 4yz + 4z^2) + (z^2 - 2z + 1) + 10 \\
&= (x - 2)^2 + (x - y)^2 + (y - 2z)^2 + (z - 1)^2 + 10
\end{align*}The minimum value is then $\boxed{10},$ which occurs when $x = 2,$ $y = 2,$ and $z = 1.$ The answer is $\boxed{10}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
**Problem**
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


We can use the identity $a^2 + b^2 = \frac{1}{2} [(a+b)^2 + (a-b)^2]$ to simplify the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.

First, let's rewrite $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy = 5\left[\frac{1}{2}\left((x+y)^2 + (x-y)^2\right)\right] - 8xy = \frac{5}{2}\left[(x+y)^2 + (x-y)^2\right] - 8xy$.

Now, let's denote $a = x+y$ and $b = x-y$. Then we have $x = \frac{a+b}{2}$ and $y = \frac{a-b}{2}$. The condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten in terms of $a$ and $b$ as $|\frac{a-b}{2} - 2\frac{a+b}{2}| + |\frac{a+b}{2} - 2\frac{a-b}{2}| = 40$, which simplifies to $|a-b| + |a+b| = 40$.

Now we can rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ in terms of $a$ and $b$:

\[
\frac{5}{2}\left[(x+y)^2 + (x-y)^2\right] - 8xy = \frac{5}{2}\left[a^2 + b^2\right] - 8\left(\frac{a^2 - b^2}{4}\right) = \frac{5}{2}a^2 + \frac{5}{2}b^2 - 2a^2 + 2b^2 = \frac{1}{2}a^2 + \frac{1}{2}b^2 = \frac{1}{2}\left[\frac{1}{2}\left((x+y)^2 + (x-y)^2\right)\right] = \frac{1}{4}\left((x+y)^2 + (x-y)^2\right).
\]

Now, using the condition $|a-b| + |a+b| = 40$, we know that $(a-b)^2 + (a+b)^2 = 40^2 = 1600$. Expanding this gives $2a^2 + 2b^2 = 1600$, so $\frac{1}{2}\left((x+y)^2 + (x-y)^2\right) = \frac{1}{2}\cdot 800 = 400$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 400.

The answer is: $400$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"What is the minimum value of the expression $x^2+y^2-6x+4y+18$ for real $x$ and $y$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Rearranging the expression, we have  \[x^2-6x+y^2+4y+18\]Completing the square in $x$, we need to add and subtract $(6/2)^2=9$. Completing the square in $y$, we need to add and subtract $(4/2)^2=4$. Thus, we have \[(x^2-6x+9)-9+(y^2+4y+4)-4+18 \Rightarrow (x-3)^2+(y+2)^2+5\]Since the minimum value of $(x-3)^2$ and $(y+2)^2$ is $0$ (perfect squares can never be negative), the minimum value of the entire expression is $\boxed{5}$, and is achieved when $x=3$ and $y=-2$. The answer is $\boxed{5}$

**Problem**
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


This problem is a bit more complex than the previous one, so we will need to use a bit of algebraic manipulation and some tricks to solve it.

First, let's rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2$. Now, let's use the given condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. 

By the triangle inequality, we know that $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$, so $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |(x-2y) + (y-2x)| = |-x - y| = |-(x+y)| = |x+y| = 40$.

Now, let's substitute $a = x-2y$ and $b = y-2x$ into the equation $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2 = a^2 + b^2$.

We know that $a^2 + b^2 \geq \frac{(a+b)^2}{2}$ by the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. So, we have:

$$(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2 \geq \frac{(40)^2}{2} = 800.$$

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $800$. The answer is: $800$

**Problem:** 
"If $x + 2y= 4$ and $xy = -8$, what is the value of $x^2 + 4y^2$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
We see that $(x + 2y)^2 = (x^2 + 4y^2) + 4xy = 4^2 = 16$. We want to find $x^2 + 4y^2$ and are given $xy = -8$. So, $x^2 + 4y^2 + 4xy = x^2 + 4y^2 + 4(-8) = 16$. It follows that $x^2 + 4y^2 = \boxed{48}$. The answer is $\boxed{48}$

The above code is incorrect because we are not using the correct method to solve the equation for y. The equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is not easily solvable using standard algebraic methods. Instead, we can use the fact that the sum of absolute values is minimized when the arguments have the same magnitude but opposite signs. This gives us the system of equations:
\[x - 2y = \pm (2x - y).\]
Solving this system gives us $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \mp 5$. Substituting these values into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ gives us the minimum value.

Let's correct the code:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solve, simplify

def solve_problem():
    # Define the variables
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # Set up the system of equations
    equation1 = x - 2*y - (2*x - y)
    equation2 = x - 2*y - -(2*x - y)

    # Solve the system of equations
    solutions = solve((equation1, equation2), (x, y))

    # Substitute the solutions into the expression
    expression = 5*x**2 + 5*y**2 - 8*x*y
    values = [expression.subs({x: sol[0], y: sol[1]}) for sol in solutions]

    # Find the minimum value
    min_value = min(values)

    return min_value

result = solve_problem()
print(result)
```

The above code still gives us an error because we are trying to substitute the solutions into the expression directly without using the correct values of x and y. The solutions are given in terms of x and y, but we need to find the values of x and y that make the expression minimum. The correct approach is to substitute the values of x and y that we found from the system of equations into the expression and then find the minimum value.

Let's correct the code again:

    x, y = symbols('x y')
