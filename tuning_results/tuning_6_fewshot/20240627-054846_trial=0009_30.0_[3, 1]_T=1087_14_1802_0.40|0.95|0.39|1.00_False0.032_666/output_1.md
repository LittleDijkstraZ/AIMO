**Problem:** 
"If $x + 2y= 4$ and $xy = -8$, what is the value of $x^2 + 4y^2$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
We see that $(x + 2y)^2 = (x^2 + 4y^2) + 4xy = 4^2 = 16$. We want to find $x^2 + 4y^2$ and are given $xy = -8$. So, $x^2 + 4y^2 + 4xy = x^2 + 4y^2 + 4(-8) = 16$. It follows that $x^2 + 4y^2 = \boxed{48}$. The answer is $\boxed{48}$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, we need to solve the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. This equation is a bit tricky to solve directly, but we can use the fact that $|a - b| = |b - a|$ to simplify it. We can rewrite the equation as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$, and then use the property $|a| + |b| = |a+b|$ if $a$ and $b$ have the same sign or one of them is zero. So we have $|(x-2y) + (2y-x)| = 40$, which simplifies to $|0| = 40$, a contradiction. 

2. However, we can notice that the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is equivalent to $|x-2y| = |2x-y|$. This equation is true if and only if $x-2y = 2x-y$ or $x-2y = y-2x$. Solving these two equations, we get $x=y$ or $x=3y$.

3. Now, we substitute $x=y$ or $x=3y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ and simplify. If $x=y$, we get $5x^2+5x^2-8x^2 = 2x^2$. If $x=3y$, we get $5(3y)^2+5y^2-8(3y)(y) = 5*9y^2+5y^2-24y^2 = 20y^2$.

4. To find the minimum value of $2x^2$ and $20y^2$, we know that the minimum value of $x^2$ (or $y^2$) is 0, so the minimum value of $2x^2$ (or $20y^2$) is 0.

5. However, we need to check if the value of the expression under the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is actually 0. If we substitute $x=y$ into the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we get $|0| + |0| = 40$, which is not true. If we substitute $x=3y$ into the equation, we get $|2y| + |y| = 40$, which simplifies to $3|y| = 40$, and then $|y| = \frac{40}{3}$, which is not a real number.

6. So, we need to find another way to minimize the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have $(1+4)(x^2+y^2) \geq (x+2y)^2$, which simplifies to $5(x^2+y^2) \geq (x+2y)^2$. Similarly, we have $5(x^2+y^2) \geq (2x+y)^2$. Adding these two inequalities, we get $10(x^2+y^2) \geq (x+2y)^2 + (2x+y)^2$. Expanding the right side, we get $10(x^2+y^2) \geq 5x^2+10xy+5y^2$, which simplifies to $5x^2+5y^2 \geq 10xy$. So, $5x^2+5y^2-8xy \geq 0$.

7. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 0.

So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0.
The answer is: $0$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, we need to express the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ in a more convenient form. We can rewrite this equation as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$.
2. Notice that $|a| = |-a|$ for any real number $a$. So, we can replace $|2y-x|$ with $|x-2y|$ in the equation above, yielding $2|x-2y| = 40$.
3. Simplify the equation to get $|x-2y| = 20$.
4. Now, let's express the function $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ in terms of $x-2y$. Let $u = x-2y$, then $x = u + 2y$. We can substitute this into the function to get $5(u+2y)^2 + 5y^2 - 8(u+2y)y$.
5. Expand and simplify the equation to get $5u^2 + 20uy + 20y^2 + 5y^2 - 8uy - 16y^2 = 5u^2 + 12uy - y^2$.
6. Now, we want to minimize the function $5u^2 + 12uy - y^2$ subject to the constraint $|u| = 20$.
7. To minimize a function subject to a constraint, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. Define a new function $L(u, y, \lambda) = 5u^2 + 12uy - y^2 + \lambda (u^2 - 400)$.
8. Take the partial derivatives of $L$ with respect to $u$, $y$, and $\lambda$, and set them equal to zero:
   - $\frac{\partial L}{\partial u} = 10u + 12y + 2u\lambda = 0$
   - $\frac{\partial L}{\partial y} = 12u - 2y + \lambda = 0$
   - $\frac{\partial L}{\partial \lambda} = u^2 - 400 = 0$
9. From the third equation, we get $u = \pm 20$. We will consider both cases.
10. If $u = 20$, then from the first equation, we get $200 + 12y + 40\lambda = 0$. From the second equation, we get $240 - 2y + \lambda = 0$. Solving these two equations simultaneously, we get $y = 10$ and $\lambda = -10$.
11. If $u = -20$, then from the first equation, we get $-200 + 12y - 40\lambda = 0$. From the second equation, we get $-240 - 2y + \lambda = 0$. Solving these two equations simultaneously, we get $y = -10$ and $\lambda = 10$.
12. Substitute the values of $u$ and $y$ into the function $5u^2 + 12uy - y^2$ to get the minimum value. For $u = 20$ and $y = 10$, the minimum value is $5(20)^2 + 12(20)(10) - (10)^2 = 2000 + 2400 - 100 = 4300$. For $u = -20$ and $y = -10$, the minimum value is $5(-20)^2 + 12(-20)(-10) - (-10)^2 = 2000 + 2400 - 100 = 4300$.
13. Therefore, the minimum value of the function $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 4300.

So, the minimum value of the function $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 4300. The answer is: $4300$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"What is the minimum value of the expression $2x^2+3y^2+8x-24y+62$ for real $x$ and $y$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Rearranging the expression, we have  \[2x^2+8x+3y^2-24y+62\]We first complete the square in $x$. Factoring a 2 from the first two terms of the expression, we get  \[2(x^2+4x)+3y^2-24y+62\]In order for the expression inside the parenthesis to be a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(4/2)^2=4$ inside the parenthesis. Doing this, we have \[2(x^2+4x+4-4)+3y^2-24y+62 \Rightarrow 2(x+2)^2+3y^2-24y+54\]Now we complete the square in $y$. Factoring a 3 from the $y$ terms in the expression, we get \[2(x+2)^2+3(y^2-8y)+54\]In order for the expression inside the second parenthesis to be a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(8/2)^2=16$ inside the parenthesis. Doing this, we have \[2(x+2)^2+3(y^2-8y+16-16)+54 \Rightarrow 2(x+2)^2+3(y-4)^2+6\]Since the minimum value of $2(x+2)^2$ and $3(y-4)^2$ is $0$ (perfect squares can never be negative), the minimum value of the entire expression is $\boxed{6}$, and is achieved when $x=-2$ and $y=4$. The answer is $\boxed{6}$
