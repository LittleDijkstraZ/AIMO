Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Let $w$ be the width of each of the identical rectangles. Since $PQ=3w$, $RS=2x$ and $PQ=RS$ (because $PQRS$ is a rectangle), then $2x = 3w$, or $$w=\frac{2}{3}x.$$ Therefore, the area of each of the five identical rectangles is $$x\left(\frac{2}{3}x\right)=\frac{2}{3}x^2.$$ Since the area of $PQRS$ is 4000 and it is made up of five of these identical smaller rectangles, then $$5\left(\frac{2}{3}x^2\right)=4000$$ or $$\frac{10}{3}x^2 = 4000$$ or $x^2 = 1200$ or $x \approx 34.6$ which, when rounded off to the nearest integer, is $\boxed{35}.$ The answer is $\boxed{35}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.

The first expression is zero when either $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x - y| - 10 = 0$, which simplifies to $|x + y| = 10$ or $|x - y| = 10$. These equations represent two pairs of parallel lines, so they form a rectangle.

The second expression is zero when either $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$, which simplifies to $|x| = 8$ or $|y| = 8$. These equations also represent two pairs of parallel lines, so they form a square.

The intersection of the rectangle and the square is the convex polygon. The side length of the square is 16 (since $|x| = 8$ means $-8 \leq x \leq 8$), and the length and width of the rectangle are 20 (since $|x + y| = 10$ means $-10 \leq x + y \leq 10$, and $|x - y| = 10$ means $-10 \leq x - y \leq 10$).

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of the square minus the area of the rectangle. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$, and the area of the rectangle is $20 \times 20 = 400$. So the area of the convex polygon is $256 - 400 = -144$.

However, the area cannot be negative, so there must be a mistake in our reasoning. Let's re-examine the problem.

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $-10 \leq x + y \leq 10$ and $-10 \leq x - y \leq 10$. Adding these two inequalities, we get $-20 \leq 2x \leq 20$, or $-10 \leq x \leq 10$. Similarly, subtracting the second inequality from the first, we get $-20 \leq 2y \leq 20$, or $-10 \leq y \leq 10$. So the rectangle is actually a square with side length 20.

The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $-8 \leq x \leq 8$ and $-8 \leq y \leq 8$. So the square is actually a square with side length 16.

The intersection of the two squares is the convex polygon. The side length of the larger square is 20, and the side length of the smaller square is 16. So the area of the convex polygon is the area of the larger square minus the area of the smaller square. The area of the larger square is $20^2 = 400$, and the area of the smaller square is $16^2 = 256$. So the area of the convex polygon is $400 - 256 = 144$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 144. The answer is: $144$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many square units are in the area of the triangle whose vertices are the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the curve $y = (x-3)^2 (x+2)$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we need to find where this curve intersects the $x$ and $y$ axes.  If $y=0$, then $(x-3)^2(x+2)=0$, which has solutions of $x=3$ and $x=-2$.  If $x=0$, then $y=(-3)^2(2)=18$.  So, the curve has two $x$-intercepts and one $y$-intercept.  The length of the base along the $x$-axis is $3-(-2)=5$.  The height from this base is equal to the $y$-intercept, 18.  The area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 5\cdot 18=\boxed{45}$. The answer is $\boxed{45}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


This problem is a bit tricky because it involves absolute value and piecewise functions. But we can solve it step by step.

First, we notice that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So, we have two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these equations are all the points in the square with vertices at $( \pm 10, 0), (0, \pm 10)$.

2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This means $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are all the points in the square with vertices at $( \pm 8, 0), (0, \pm 8)$.

The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for. The side length of the smaller square is 16 (from $-8$ to $8$), and the side length of the larger square is 20 (from $-10$ to $10$). The area of the convex polygon is the area of the larger square minus the area of the smaller square.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    """Calculate the area of the convex polygon formed by the intersection of the squares with side lengths 16 and 20."""
    larger_square_side = 20
    smaller_square_side = 16
    larger_square_area = larger_square_side ** 2
    smaller_square_area = smaller_square_side ** 2
    polygon_area = larger_square_area - smaller_square_area
    return polygon_area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 144

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
144
```
The area of the convex polygon is 144 square units. The answer is: $144$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



The problem involves absolute value functions and product of terms equals to zero, which is a classic case of using Python's sympy library.

1. We start by importing the necessary functions and modules from sympy.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Abs, solve, simplify
from sympy.core.relational import Equality
```

2. Then, we define the variables x and y.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

x, y = symbols('x y')
```

3. We set up the equation using the absolute value functions and the product of terms equals to zero.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

equation = ((Abs(x + y) - 10)**2 + (Abs(x - y) - 10)**2) * ((Abs(x) - 8)**2 + (Abs(y) - 8)**2)
```

CODE RESULTS Traceback: line 5, in <module>
    equation = ((Abs(x + y) - 10)**2 + (Abs(x - y) - 10)**2) * ((Abs(x) - 8)**2 + (Abs(y) - 8)**2)
NameError: name 'x' is not defined

FAIL

Try checking the formatting and imports

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
Traceback: line 5, in <module>
    equation = ((Abs(x + y) - 10)**2 + (Abs(x - y) - 10)**2) * ((Abs(x) - 8)**2 + (Abs(y) - 8)**2)
NameError: name 'x' is not defined

FAIL

Try checking the formatting and imports
```

4. We solve the equation for x and y.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

solution = solve(equation, (x, y))
```

5. The solution is a list of pairs of values for x and y that satisfy the equation. This forms the vertices of the polygon.

6. To find the area of the polygon, we can use the Shoelace formula. The Shoelace formula is used to find the area of a polygon given the coordinates of its vertices.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def shoelace_formula(vertices):
    n = len(vertices)
    area = 0
    for i in range(n):
        j = (i + 1) % n
        area += vertices[i][0] * vertices[j][1] - vertices[i][1] * vertices[j][0]
    return abs(area / 2)

vertices = [solution[i] for i in range(len(solution))]
area = shoelace_formula(vertices)
print(area)
```

CODE RESULTS Traceback: line 13, in <module>
    vertices = [solution[i] for i in range(len(solution))]
NameError: name 'solution' is not defined

FAIL

Try checking the formatting and imports

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
Traceback: line 13, in <module>
    vertices = [solution[i] for i in range(len(solution))]
NameError: name 'solution' is not defined

FAIL

Try checking the formatting and imports
```

7. However, we need to simplify the area before printing it.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

area = simplify(area)
print(area)
```

CODE RESULTS Traceback: line 5, in <module>
    area = simplify(area)
NameError: name 'area' is not defined

FAIL

Try checking the formatting and imports

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
Traceback: line 5, in <module>
    area = simplify(area)
NameError: name 'area' is not defined

FAIL

Try checking the formatting and imports
```

8. Finally, we print the simplified area.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

print(area)
```

CODE RESULTS Traceback: line 5, in <module>
    print(area)
NameError: name 'area' is not defined

FAIL

Try checking the formatting and imports

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
Traceback: line 5, in <module>
    print(area)
NameError: name 'area' is not defined

FAIL

Try checking the formatting and imports
```

9. We have made a mistake in the previous step. The area should be a positive integer, not an algebraic expression. Let's try again.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Abs, solve, simplify
from sympy.core.relational import Equality

def calculate_area():
    # Define the variables
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # Set up the equation
    equation = ((Abs(x + y) - 10)**2 + (Abs(x - y) - 10)**2) * ((Abs(x) - 8)**2 + (Abs(y) - 8)**2)

    # Solve the equation
    solution = solve(equation, (x, y))

    # The solution is a list of pairs of values for x and y that satisfy the equation. This forms the vertices of the polygon.
    vertices = [solution[i] for i in range(len(solution))]

    # Use the shoelace formula to find the area of the polygon
    area = shoelace_formula(vertices)

    # Simplify the area
    area = simplify(area)

    return area

result = calculate_area()
print(result)
```

Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we need to find where this curve intersects the $x$ and $y$ axes.  If $y=0$, then $(x-3)^2(x+2)=0$, which has solutions of $x=3$ and $x=-2$.  If $x=0$, then $y=(-3)^2(2)=18$.  So, the curve has two $x$-intercepts and one $y$-intercept.  The length of the base along the $x$-axis is $3-(-2)=5$.  The height from this base is equal to the $y$-intercept, 18.

Since $PQ=3w$, $RS=2x$ and $PQ=RS$ (because $PQRS$ is a rectangle), then $2x = 3w$, or $$w=\frac{2}{3}x.$$ Therefore, the area of each of the five identical rectangles is $$x\left(\frac{2}{3}x\right)=\frac{2}{3}x^2.$$ Since the area of $PQRS$ is 4000 and it is made up of five of these identical smaller rectangles, then $$5\left(\frac{2}{3}x^2\right)=4000$$ or $$\frac{10}{3}x^2 = 4000$$ or $x^2 = 1200$ or $x \approx 34.6$ which, when rounded off to the nearest integer, is $\boxed{35}.$ The answer is $\boxed{35}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


The problem is asking for the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points that satisfy the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

To solve this problem, we need to find the points that satisfy the equation and then calculate the area of the convex polygon they enclose.

1. First, we can see that the product of two terms equals zero if and only if at least one of the terms equals zero. So, we have two cases to consider:
   a) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
   b) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

2. For case (a), we have $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these equations are pairs of points that are equidistant from the origin in the $x-y$ plane. This forms a square with side length $20$ centered at the origin.

3. For case (b), we have $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are points that are at a distance of $8$ from the x-axis and y-axis. This forms a square with side length $16$ centered at the origin.

4. The intersection of the two cases is the intersection of the two squares, which is a smaller square with side length $16$ that is entirely contained within the larger square.

5. To find the area of the convex polygon, we simply need to find the area of the larger square and subtract the area of the smaller square. The area of a square is given by the square of the side length, so the area of the larger square is $20^2 = 400$ and the area of the smaller square is $16^2 = 256$.

6. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $400 - 256 = 144$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 144.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def calculate_area():
    # Side length of the larger square
    side_large = 20
    # Side length of the smaller square
    side_small = 16

    # Area of the larger square
    area_large = side_large**2
    # Area of the smaller square
    area_small = side_small**2

    # Area of the convex polygon
    area = area_large - area_small

    return area

result = calculate_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 144

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
144
```
The area of the convex polygon is $144$. The answer is $\boxed{144}$.
