**Problem:** 
"We define a function $f(x)$ such that $f(14)=7$, and if there exists an integer $a$ such that $f(a)=b$, then $f(b)$ is defined and

$f(b)=3b+1$ if $b$ is odd

$f(b)=\frac{b}{2}$ if $b$ is even.

What is the smallest possible number of integers in the domain of $f$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Since $f(14)=7$, we know that $f(7)$ is defined, and it must equal $22$.  Similarly, we know that $f(22)$ is defined, and it must equal $11$.  Continuing on this way,  \begin{align*}

f(4)&=2\\
f(2)&=1\\
f(1)&=4
\end{align*}We are now in a cycle $1$, $4$, $2$, $1$, and so on.  Thus there are no more values which need to be defined, as there is no $a$ currently defined for which $f(a)$ is a $b$ not already defined.  Thus the minimum number of integers we can define is the number we have already defined, which is $\boxed{18}$. The answer is $\boxed{18}$

**Problem**
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


To solve this problem, we need to find the value of $f(100)$ using the given conditions. We can start by applying the second condition $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ repeatedly to simplify the expression for $f(100)$.

We know that $100 = 2^2 * 5^2$. So we can write $f(100)$ as $f(2^2 * 5^2)$. Using the second condition, we have:

\[f(2^2 * 5^2) = f(2 * 2 * 5 * 5) = 2f(2 * 5 * 5) + 1 = 2f(2 * 25) + 1 = 2f(50) + 1.\]

Again using the second condition, we have:

\[2f(50) + 1 = 2(2f(25) + 1) + 1 = 4f(25) + 3.\]

And again using the second condition:

\[4f(25) + 3 = 4(2f(5) + 1) + 3 = 8f(5) + 7.\]

Finally, using the second condition one more time:

\[8f(5) + 7 = 8(2f(2.5) + 1) + 7 = 16f(2.5) + 15.\]

Now, we need to find the value of $f(2.5)$. We know that $2.5 = \frac{5}{2}$, so we can use the first condition $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$:

\[f(f(f(2.5))) = 8(2.5) - 7 = 10 - 7 = 3.\]

So, we have:

\[16f(2.5) + 15 = 16 * 3 + 15 = 48 + 15 = 63.\]

Therefore, $f(100) = 63$.

The value of $f(100)$ is $63$. The answer is: $63$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $
f(n) =
\begin{cases}
n^2+1 & \text{if }n\text{ is odd} \\
\dfrac{n}{2} & \text{if }n\text{ is even}
\end{cases}.
$

For how many integers $n$ from 1 to 100, inclusive, does $f ( f (\dotsb f (n) \dotsb )) = 1$ for some number of applications of $f$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we note that if $n$ is a positive integer, then $f(n)$ is also a positive integer.  We claim that $f ( f (\dotsb f (n) \dotsb )) = 1$ for some number of applications of $f$ only for $n = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32,$ and $64.$  (In other words, $n$ must be a power of 2.)

Note that $f(1) = 2,$ so $f(f(1)) = f(2) = 1.$  If $n > 1$ is a power of 2, it is easy to see that repeated applications of $f$ on $n$ eventually reach 1.

Suppose $n$ is an odd positive integer, where $n > 1.$  Write $n = 2k + 1,$ where $k$ is a positive integer.  Since $n$ is odd,
\[f(n) = n^2 + 1 = (2k + 1)^2 + 1 = 4k^2 + 4k + 2 = 2(2k^2 + 2k + 1).\]Since $2k^2 + 2k$ is always even, $2k^2 + 2k + 1$ is always odd (and greater than 1), so $f(n)$ can never be a power of 2 when $n$ is odd and greater than 1.

Now, suppose $n$ is even.  For example, if $n = 2^3 \cdot 11,$ then
\[f(2^3 \cdot 11) = f(2^2 \cdot 11) = f(2 \cdot 11) = f(11),\]which we know is not a power of 2.

More generally, suppose $n = 2^e \cdot m,$ where $e$ is nonnegative and $m$ is odd.  Then
\[f(2^e \cdot m) = f(2^{e - 1} \cdot m) = f(2^{e - 2} \cdot m) = \dots = f(m).\]If $m = 1,$ then $n$ is a power of 2, and the sequence eventually reaches 1.  Otherwise, $f(m)$ is not a power of 2.  We also know that $f(m)$ is odd and greater than 1, $f(f(m))$ is not a power of 2 either, and so on.  Thus, the sequence can never reach 1.

Therefore, $n$ must be one of the $\boxed{7}$ values 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, or 64. The answer is $\boxed{7}$

**Problem**
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



To solve this problem, we can start by substituting $n = 1$ into the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$ to find the value of $f(1)$. We get $f(f(f(1))) = 1$, so $f(f(1)) = 1$. Again substituting $n = 1$ into the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, we get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. Since $f(1)$ is 1, we have $f(2) = 2*1 + 1 = 3$.

Now we can use the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to find $f(4)$, $f(8)$, and so on, until we find a pattern. We have $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2*3 + 1 = 7$, $f(8) = 2f(4) + 1 = 2*7 + 1 = 15$, and so on. It seems that $f(2^k) = 2^k + 2^{k-1} - 1$ for all positive integers $k$.

Now we can use this pattern to find $f(100)$, since $100 = 2^2 * 5^2$. We have $f(100) = f(2^2 * 5^2) = f(2^2) * f(5^2)$. Using the pattern we found, we have $f(2^2) = 2^2 + 2^{2-1} - 1 = 4 + 2 - 1 = 5$ and $f(5^2) = 5^2 + 5^{2-1} - 1 = 25 + 5 - 1 = 31$. Therefore, $f(100) = f(2^2) * f(5^2) = 5 * 31 = 155$.

So, $f(100) = 155$. The answer is $\boxed{155}$.

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


To solve this problem, we can start by evaluating the function for some small values of $n$ using the given conditions. We can use Python to do this:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def f(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    elif n == 2:
        return 3
    elif n == 3:
        return 5
    else:
        return 2 * f(n // 2) + 1

def f_of_f_of_f(n):
    return 8 * n - 7

def calculate_f_of_100():
    return f_of_f_of_f(100)

result = calculate_f_of_100()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 793

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
793
```

However, this result doesn't seem to match the pattern we've observed for small values of $n$. Let's try to find a pattern in the function $f(n)$.

We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. Let's set $f(n)=x$. Then we have $f(x)=8n-7$. But we also know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Let's substitute $x$ for $f(n)$: $f(2x)=2x+1$. Now we have two equations:

1. $f(x)=8n-7$
2. $f(2x)=2x+1$

We can substitute the first equation into the second to get $f(2(8n-7))=2(8n-7)+1$. Simplifying this gives $f(16n-14)=16n-13$. But we know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, so we can substitute $f(n)$ for $n$ to get $f(f(f(f(n))))=8f(n)-7$. Comparing this to $f(16n-14)=16n-13$, we can see that $f(n)=16n-14$.

Now we can check if this function satisfies the given conditions:

1. $f(f(f(n)))=f(f(16n-14))=f(256n-222)=8n-7$, which is true.
2. $f(2n)=f(32n-28)=2(16n-14)+1=32n-28+1=32n-27=2f(n)+1$, which is also true.

So the function $f(n)=16n-14$ satisfies the given conditions. Now we can calculate $f(100)$:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def calculate_f_of_100():
    return 16 * 100 - 14

result = calculate_f_of_100()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 1586

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
1586
```

This result still doesn't match the one we got from the first attempt. Let's try another approach.

We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. Let's set $f(n)=x$. Then we have $f(x)=8n-7$. But we also know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Let's substitute $x$ for $f(n)$: $f(2x)=2x+1$. Now we have two equations:

1. $f(x)=8n-7$
2. $f(2x)=2x+1$

We can substitute the first equation into the second to get $f(2(8n-7))=2(8n-7)+1$. Simplifying this gives $f(16n-14)=16n-13$. But we know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, so we can substitute $f(n)$ for $n$ to get $f(f(f(f(n))))=8f(n)-7$. Comparing this to $f(16n-14)=16n-13$, we can see that $f(n)=16n-14$.

Now we can check if this function satisfies the given conditions:

1. $f(f(f(n)))=f(f(16n-14))=f(256n-222)=8n-7$, which is true.
2. $f(2n)=f(32n-28)=2(16n-14)+1=32n-28+1=32n-27=2f(n)+1$, which is also true.

So the function $f(n)=16n-14$ satisfies the given conditions. Now we can calculate $f(100)$:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def calculate_f_of_100():
    return 16 * 100 - 14

result = calculate_f_of_100()
print(result)
``````output

1. $f(x)=8n-7$
2. $f(2x)=2x+1$

We can substitute the first equation into the second to get $f(2(8n-7))=2(8n-7)+1$. Simplifying this gives $f(16n-14)=16n-13$. But we know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, so we can substitute $f(n)$ for $n$ to get $f(f(f(f(n))))=8f(n)-7$. Comparing this to $f(16n-14)=16n-13$, we can see that $f(n)=16n-14$.

Now we can check if this function satisfies the given conditions:

1. $f(f(f(n)))=f(f(16n-14))=f(256n-222)=8n-7$, which is true.
2. $f(2n)=f(32n-28)=2(16n-14)+1=32n-28+1=32n-27=2f(n)+1$, which is also true.

So the function $f(n)=16n-14$ satisfies the given conditions. Now we can calculate $f(100)$:

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"The function $f$ is defined on the set of integers and satisfies \[f(n)= \begin{cases}  n-3 & \mbox{if }n\ge 1000 \\  f(f(n+5)) & \mbox{if }n<1000. \end{cases}\]Find $f(84)$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Denote by (1) and (2) the two parts of the definition of $f$, respectively. If we begin to use the definition of $f$ to compute $f(84)$, we use (2) until the argument is at least $1000$: \[f(84) = f(f(89)) = f(f(f(94))) = \dots = f^N(1004)\](where $f^N$ denotes composing $f$ with itself $N$ times, for some $N$). The numbers $84, 89, 94, \dots, 1004$ form an arithmetic sequence with common difference $5$; since $1004 - 84 = 920 = 184 \cdot 5$, this sequence has $184 + 1 = 185$ terms, so $N = 185$.

At this point, (1) and (2) are both used: we compute \[\begin{aligned} f^N(1004) &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-1}(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-1}(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(1000) \\ &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(997) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1002) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(999) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1004). \end{aligned}\]Repeating this process, we see that \[f^N(1004) = f^{N-2}(1004) = f^{N-4}(1004) = \dots = f^3(1004).\](The pattern breaks down for $f^k(1004)$ when $k$ is small, so it is not true that $f^3(1004) = f(1004)$.) Now, we have \[f^3(1004) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^2(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^2(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(1000) \stackrel{(1)}{=} \boxed{997}.\] The answer is $\boxed{997}$

**Solution:** 



This problem requires a bit of clever manipulation to simplify the expression $f(f(f(n)))$ into a form that allows us to solve for $f(n)$.

We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. If we let $m = f(n)$, then we have $f(f(m)) = 8n - 7$. Again letting $k = f(m)$, we have $f(k) = 8n - 7$. We also know that $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, so we can replace $n$ with $m$ to get $f(2m) = 2f(m) + 1$, or $f(2m) - 1 = 2f(m)$.

Now we know that $f(k) = 8n - 7$, and we want to express $n$ in terms of $k$. From the equation $f(2m) - 1 = 2f(m)$, we can express $m$ in terms of $k$:

$$k = 2m - 1 \implies m = \frac{k+1}{2}.$$

Substituting $m = \frac{k+1}{2}$ into $f(k) = 8n - 7$, we get:

$$f(k) = 8\left(\frac{k+1}{2}\right) - 7 = 4(k+1) - 7 = 4k + 4 - 7 = 4k - 3.$$

So we have $f(k) = 4k - 3$. Now we want to find $f(100)$. We substitute $k = 100$ into the equation to get $f(100) = 4*100 - 3 = 400 - 3 = 397$.

So $f(100) = 397$. The answer is: $397$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"The function $f$ is defined on the set of integers and satisfies \[f(n)= \begin{cases}  n-3 & \mbox{if }n\ge 1000 \\  f(f(n+5)) & \mbox{if }n<1000. \end{cases}\]Find $f(84)$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Denote by (1) and (2) the two parts of the definition of $f$, respectively. If we begin to use the definition of $f$ to compute $f(84)$, we use (2) until the argument is at least $1000$: \[f(84) = f(f(89)) = f(f(f(94))) = \dots = f^N(1004)\](where $f^N$ denotes composing $f$ with itself $N$ times, for some $N$). The numbers $84, 89, 94, \dots, 1004$ form an arithmetic sequence with common difference $5$; since $1004 - 84 = 920 = 184 \cdot 5$, this sequence has $184 + 1 = 185$ terms, so $N = 185$.

At this point, (1) and (2) are both used: we compute \[\begin{aligned} f^N(1004) &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-1}(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-1}(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(1000) \\ &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(997) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1002) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(999) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1004). \end{aligned}\]Repeating this process, we see that \[f^N(1004) = f^{N-2}(1004) = f^{N-4}(1004) = \dots = f^3(1004).\](The pattern breaks down for $f^k(1004)$ when $k$ is small, so it is not true that $f^3(1004) = f(1004)$.) Now, we have \[f^3(1004) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^2(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^2(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(1000) \stackrel{(1)}{=} \boxed{997}.\] The answer is $\boxed{997}$

**Problem**
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


We can solve this problem by substituting $n = 1$ into the first equation to find $f(1)$, then substitute $f(1)$ into the second equation to find $f(2)$, and so on. After finding $f(1)$ to $f(6)$, we can observe a pattern and guess the general form of $f(n)$. Then we can prove the general form by induction.

Let's start by finding $f(1)$:
From $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, let $n=1$, we get $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$. So $f(f(1))$ is the only number such that its image under $f$ gives 1. Since $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, let $n=1$, we get $f(2)=2f(1)+1$. If we substitute $f(1)$ into this equation, we get $f(2)=2f(1)+1$. But we know $f(f(1))=1$, so $f(2)=2*1+1=3$.

Now let's find $f(3)$:
From $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, let $n=3$, we get $f(6)=2f(3)+1$. But we know $f(f(f(3)))=8*3-7=19$, so $f(6)=19$. From $f(6)=2f(3)+1$, we can solve for $f(3)$ and get $f(3)=(f(6)-1)/2=(19-1)/2=9$.

Similarly, we can find $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2*3+1=7$, $f(5)=(f(10)-1)/2=(2f(5)+1-1)/2=2f(5)/2=f(5)$, so $f(5)=5$.

Now we can observe a pattern: $f(n)=n$ for $n=1,2,3,4,5$. We guess the general form of $f(n)$ is $f(n)=n$.

To prove the general form by induction, we need to prove that if $f(k)=k$ for $k=1,2,...,n$, then $f(n+1)=n+1$.

From $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, let $n=n+1$, we get $f(2(n+1))=2f(n+1)+1$. But we know $f(2(n+1))=f(2n+2)=2f(n+1)+1$, and $f(2n+2)=2f(n+1)+1$. So if $f(k)=k$ for $k=1,2,...,n$, then $f(n+1)=n+1$.

So by induction, the general form of $f(n)$ is $f(n)=n$. Now we can find $f(100)=100$.

So the final answer is: $f(100) = 100$. The answer is: $100$

## QUESTION 4 - 6 
- TIME_SPENT : 1015 secs

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $
f(n) =
\begin{cases}
n^2+1 & \text{if }n\text{ is odd} \\
\dfrac{n}{2} & \text{if }n\text{ is even}
\end{cases}.
$

For how many integers $n$ from 1 to 100, inclusive, does $f ( f (\dotsb f (n) \dotsb )) = 1$ for some number of applications of $f$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we note that if $n$ is a positive integer, then $f(n)$ is also a positive integer.  We claim that $f ( f (\dotsb f (n) \dotsb )) = 1$ for some number of applications of $f$ only for $n = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32,$ and $64.$  (In other words, $n$ must be a power of 2.)

Note that $f(1) = 2,$ so $f(f(1)) = f(2) = 1.$  If $n > 1$ is a power of 2, it is easy to see that repeated applications of $f$ on $n$ eventually reach 1.

Suppose $n$ is an odd positive integer, where $n > 1.$  Write $n = 2k + 1,$ where $k$ is a positive integer.  Since $n$ is odd,
\[f(n) = n^2 + 1 = (2k + 1)^2 + 1 = 4k^2 + 4k + 2 = 2(2k^2 + 2k + 1).\]Since $2k^2 + 2k$ is always even, $2k^2 + 2k + 1$ is always odd (and greater than 1), so $f(n)$ can never be a power of 2 when $n$ is odd and greater than 1.

Now, suppose $n$ is even.  For example, if $n = 2^3 \cdot 11,$ then
\[f(2^3 \cdot 11) = f(2^2 \cdot 11) = f(2 \cdot 11) = f(11),\]which we know is not a power of 2.

More generally, suppose $n = 2^e \cdot m,$ where $e$ is nonnegative and $m$ is odd.  Then
\[f(2^e \cdot m) = f(2^{e - 1} \cdot m) = f(2^{e - 2} \cdot m) = \dots = f(m).\]If $m = 1,$ then $n$ is a power of 2, and the sequence eventually reaches 1.  Otherwise, $f(m)$ is not a power of 2.  We also know that $f(m)$ is odd and greater than 1, $f(f(m))$ is not a power of 2 either, and so on.  Thus, the sequence can never reach 1.

Therefore, $n$ must be one of the $\boxed{7}$ values 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, or 64. The answer is $\boxed{7}$

The above code is incorrect because it tries to solve two different equations for the same function $f(n)$. The first equation $f(f(f(n)))=2n+1$ is not used in the second equation $f(2n)=8n-7$.

Let's correct this by solving the second equation for $f(n)$ and then substituting $n=100$ into the resulting expression.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"We define a function $f(x)$ such that $f(14)=7$, and if there exists an integer $a$ such that $f(a)=b$, then $f(b)$ is defined and

$f(b)=3b+1$ if $b$ is odd

$f(b)=\frac{b}{2}$ if $b$ is even.

What is the smallest possible number of integers in the domain of $f$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Since $f(14)=7$, we know that $f(7)$ is defined, and it must equal $22$.  Similarly, we know that $f(22)$ is defined, and it must equal $11$.  Continuing on this way,  \begin{align*}
f(11)&=34\\

f(4)&=2\\
f(2)&=1\\
f(1)&=4
\end{align*}We are now in a cycle $1$, $4$, $2$, $1$, and so on.  Thus there are no more values which need to be defined, as there is no $a$ currently defined for which $f(a)$ is a $b$ not already defined.  Thus the minimum number of integers we can define is the number we have already defined, which is $\boxed{18}$. The answer is $\boxed{18}$

**Solution:** 


We can start by calculating the value of $f(1)$ using the second condition of the function $f$. Since $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, we can substitute $n = 1$ to get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. But we don't know the value of $f(1)$ yet. However, we can use the first condition of the function $f$ to find it. Substituting $n = 1$ in $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, we get $f(f(f(1))) = 1$. Since $f(f(f(1))) = 1$, we have $f(1) = 1$.
Now we can substitute $f(1) = 1$ into the equation $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$ to get $f(2) = 2*1 + 1 = 3$.
Continuing this process, we can find $f(3)$, $f(4)$, and so on. We can observe a pattern that $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ and $f(2n - 1) = 4f(n) - 1$. Using this pattern, we can calculate $f(100)$ as follows:

```python

            f_i = 2 * f_1 + 1

            f_i = 4 * f_1 - 1
        f_1 = f_i

"The function $f(n)$ is defined on the positive integers such that $f(f(n)) = 2n$ and $f(4n + 1) = 4n + 3$ for all positive integers $n.$  Find $f(1000).$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Consider the expression $f(f(f(a))).$  Since $f(f(a)) = 2a,$ this is equal to $f(2a).$  But taking $n = f(a)$ in $f(f(n)) = 2n,$ we get
\[f(f(f(a))) = 2f(a).\]Hence,
\[f(2a) = 2f(a)\]for all positive integers $a.$

Then
\[f(1000) = 2f(500) = 4f(250) = 8f(125).\]Taking $n = 31$ in $f(4n + 1) = 4n + 3,$ we get
\[f(125) = 127,\]so $f(1000) = \boxed{1016}.$ The answer is $\boxed{1016}$

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


This problem is a bit tricky because it involves nested functions. However, by analyzing the first equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we can see that if we plug in $f(n)$ into the function, we get $f(f(f(n)))=f(8n-7)$. Setting this equal to the first equation gives us $f(8n-7)=8n-7$. This implies that $f(n)=n$ for all $n$.

Now, we can verify that this function satisfies the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Since $f(n)=n$, we have $f(2n)=2n$ and $2f(n)+1=2n+1$. Thus, $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ holds true for all $n$.

Therefore, the function $f(n)=n$ satisfies both conditions. Now we can easily calculate $f(100)$, which is simply 100.

**Solution:** 


First, we can use the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to find $f(100)$. Since $100 = 2 \times 50$, we have $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.
Next, we can use the second condition again to find $f(50)$. Since $50 = 2 \times 25$, we have $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.
Continuing this process, we find that $f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1$, but $12.5$ is not an integer, so we cannot continue this process.
However, we can use the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to find $f(12.5)$. If we let $f(12.5) = x$, then $f(f(f(12.5))) = f(f(x)) = 8 \times 12.5 - 7 = 93$.
Now we need to find $x$ such that $f(f(x)) = 93$. From the second condition, we have $f(f(x)) = 2f(x) + 1$. So we need to solve the equation $2f(x) + 1 = 93$.
Let's solve this equation:
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

def find_x():
    x = symbols('x')
    equation = Eq(2 * x + 1, 93)
    solution = solve(equation, x)
    return solution[0]

x = find_x()
print(x)
```

CODE RESULTS 46

INTERMEDIATE OUT :

```
So $x = 46$, which means $f(12.5) = 46$.
Now we can go back to find $f(25)$: $f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1 = 2 \times 46 + 1 = 93$.
Then we can find $f(50)$: $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1 = 2 \times 93 + 1 = 187$.
Finally, we can find $f(100)$: $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2 \times 187 + 1 = 375$.
So $f(100) = 375$. The answer is: $375$

First, we note that if $n$ is a positive integer, then $f(n)$ is also a positive integer.  We claim that $f ( f (\dotsb f (n) \dotsb )) = 1$ for some number of applications of $f$ only for $n = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32,$ and $64.$  (In other words, $n$ must be a power of 2.)

Note that $f(1) = 2,$ so $f(f(1)) = f(2) = 1.$  If $n > 1$ is a power of 2, it is easy to see that repeated applications of $f$ on $n$ eventually reach 1.

Suppose $n$ is an odd positive integer, where $n > 1.$  Write $n = 2k + 1,$ where $k$ is a positive integer.  Since $n$ is odd,
\[f(n) = n^2 + 1 = (2k + 1)^2 + 1 = 4k^2 + 4k + 2 = 2(2k^2 + 2k + 1).\]Since $2k^2 + 2k$ is always even, $2k^2 + 2k + 1$ is always odd (and greater than 1), so $f(n)$ can never be a power of 2 when $n$ is odd and greater than 1.

Now, suppose $n$ is even.  For example, if $n = 2^3 \cdot 11,$ then
\[f(2^3 \cdot 11) = f(2^2 \cdot 11) = f(2 \cdot 11) = f(11),\]which we know is not a power of 2.

More generally, suppose $n = 2^e \cdot m,$ where $e$ is nonnegative and $m$ is odd.  Then
\[f(2^e \cdot m) = f(2^{e - 1} \cdot m) = f(2^{e - 2} \cdot m) = \dots = f(m).\]If $m = 1,$ then $n$ is a power of 2, and the sequence eventually reaches 1.  Otherwise, $f(m)$ is not a power of 2.  We also know that $f(m)$ is odd and greater than 1, $f(f(m))$ is not a power of 2 either, and so on.  Thus, the sequence can never reach 1.

Therefore, $n$ must be one of the $\boxed{7}$ values 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, or 64. The answer is $\boxed{7}$

**Solution:**


To find $f(100)$, we need to evaluate the function $f$ at 100. We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Let's start by evaluating $f(f(f(100)))$.

```python

    n = 100
    f_of_n = (8 * n - 7) / 7
    return f_of_n

The result is not an integer, which is not possible for a function from natural numbers to natural numbers. Let's try another approach.

We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. Let's set $n=1$ to get $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$. Since $f(f(f(1)))=1$, we have $f(1)=1$.

Now we can use the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Let's set $n=1$ to get $f(2)=2f(1)+1=2*1+1=3$.

Now we can find $f(f(f(2)))$. Using the first condition, we have $f(f(f(2)))=8*2-7=9$. Since $f(f(f(2)))=9$, we have $f(2)=9$.

Now we can check if our results are consistent with the second condition. For $n=2$, we have $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2*9+1=19$. Now we can find $f(f(f(4)))$. Using the first condition, we have $f(f(f(4)))=8*4-7=27$. But this is not equal to 19, so our results are not consistent.

Now we can find $f(f(f(4)))$. Using the first condition, we have $f(f(f(4)))=8*4-7=27$. Since $f(f(f(4)))=27$, we have $f(4)=27$.

Now we can check if our results are consistent with the second condition. For $n=4$, we have $f(8)=2f(4)+1=2*27+1=55$. Now we can find $f(f(f(8)))$. Using the first condition, we have $f(f(f(8)))=8*8-7=55$. This is equal to 55, so our results are consistent.

Now we can find $f(100)$. We know that $f(200)=2f(100)+1$. We also know that $f(200)=f(f(f(100)))$. Using the first condition, we have $f(f(f(100)))=8*100-7=793$. So $f(200)=793$.

Now we can solve the equation $f(200)=2f(100)+1$ to find $f(100)$. We have $793=2f(100)+1$, so $2f(100)=792$ and $f(100)=396$.

So the value of $f(100)$ is 396.
