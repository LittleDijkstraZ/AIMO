**Problem:** 
"Let $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_ 2= (-16,2).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that
\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as
\[\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1.\]Find $h + k + a + b.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The equation is satisfied if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The first two equations imply $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which are the equations of two lines. The third and fourth equations imply $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which are the equations of two more lines.
The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 8. The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 64.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"An ellipse is defined parametrically by
\[(x,y) = \left( \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t}, \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t} \right).\]Then the equation of the ellipse can be written in the form
\[Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0,\]where $A,$ $B,$ $C,$ $D,$ $E,$ and $F$ are integers, and $\gcd(|A|,|B|,|C|,|D|,|E|,|F|) = 1.$  Find $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F|.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
In the equation $y = \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\cos t$ to get
\[\cos t = \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3}.\]In the equation $x = \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\sin t$ to get
\[\sin t = \frac{1}{2} x (2 - \cos t) + 1 = \frac{1}{2} x \left( 2 - \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right) + 1 = 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)}.\]Since $\cos^2 t + \sin^2 t = 1,$
\[\left( \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right)^2 + \left( 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)} \right)^2 = 1.\]Multiplying both sides by $(2(y + 3))^2$ and expanding, it will simplify to
\[81x^2 - 36xy + 16y^2 - 108x + 240y + 900 = 0.\]Therefore, $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F| = 81 + 36 + 16 + 108 + 240 + 900 = \boxed{1381}.$ The answer is $\boxed{1381}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


The problem involves absolute value functions and the need to find the area of a polygon. We can solve this problem by using a combination of sympy's `Piecewise` function and the `polygon_area` function from the `sympy.geometry` module.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import Piecewise, symbols, Eq, solve, polygon_area

def polygon_area_problem():
    # Define the symbols
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # Define the equation
    eq = (abs(x + y) - 10)**2 + (abs(x - y) - 10)**2 * (abs(x) - 8)**2 + (abs(y) - 8)**2

    # Solve the equation to find the vertices of the polygon
    vertices = solve(eq, (x, y))

    # Create a polygon from the vertices
    polygon = polygon_area(vertices)

    # Calculate the area of the polygon
    area = polygon_area(polygon)

    return area

result = polygon_area_problem()
print(result)
```

The code above failed because we are trying to import the `polygon_area` function from the `sympy.geometry` module, but we need to install the `sympy-geometry` package separately. Let's correct this and try again.

```python

The code above failed because we are trying to import the `polygon_area` function from the `sympy` module, but the `sympy` module does not have a function called `polygon_area`. This function is actually part of the `sympy.geometry` module. Let's correct this and try again.

## QUESTION 3 - 5 
- TIME_SPENT : 653 secs

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Find the number of 10-tuples $(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{10})$ of real numbers such that
\[(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2 = \frac{1}{11}.\]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,
\begin{align*}
&[(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + \dots + 1^2 + 1^2)][(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2] \\
&\ge [(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + (x_2 - x_3) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10}]^2 = 1.
\end{align*}From the given condition, we have equality, so by the equality condition for Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[\frac{1 - x_1}{1} = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{1} = \frac{x_2 - x_3}{1} = \dots = \frac{x_9 - x_{10}}{1} = \frac{x_{10}}{1}.\]Let
\[d = 1 - x_1 = x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_3 = \dots = x_9 - x_{10} = x_{10}.\]Then
\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so
\[(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_{10}) = \left( \frac{10}{11}, \frac{9}{11}, \frac{8}{11}, \dots, \frac{1}{11} \right).\]In particular, there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



The given equation is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

The product of two factors is zero if and only if one or both of the factors are zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $-8 \leq x, y \leq 8$. The points that satisfy these conditions form a square with side length 16.

For the second case, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $-8 \leq x, y \leq 8$. The points that satisfy these conditions also form a square with side length 16.

The union of these two cases forms a square with side length 16. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"An ellipse is defined parametrically by
\[(x,y) = \left( \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t}, \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t} \right).\]Then the equation of the ellipse can be written in the form
\[Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0,\]where $A,$ $B,$ $C,$ $D,$ $E,$ and $F$ are integers, and $\gcd(|A|,|B|,|C|,|D|,|E|,|F|) = 1.$  Find $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F|.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
In the equation $y = \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\cos t$ to get
\[\cos t = \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3}.\]In the equation $x = \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\sin t$ to get
\[\sin t = \frac{1}{2} x (2 - \cos t) + 1 = \frac{1}{2} x \left( 2 - \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right) + 1 = 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)}.\]Since $\cos^2 t + \sin^2 t = 1,$
\[\left( \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right)^2 + \left( 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)} \right)^2 = 1.\]Multiplying both sides by $(2(y + 3))^2$ and expanding, it will simplify to
\[81x^2 - 36xy + 16y^2 - 108x + 240y + 900 = 0.\]Therefore, $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F| = 81 + 36 + 16 + 108 + 240 + 900 = \boxed{1381}.$ The answer is $\boxed{1381}$

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if and only if at least one of the factors is zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. 

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives the vertices of the square as $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, and $(-5,-5)$.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives the vertices of the square as $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

The convex polygon enclosed by these points is a 8 by 10 rectangle. The area of this rectangle is $8 \times 10 = 80$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 80. The answer is: $80$

**Solution:** 



This problem can be solved by examining the conditions given in the equation. If the product of two numbers is zero, then at least one of the numbers must be zero. Therefore, we can set each factor equal to zero and solve for the possible values of $(x, y)$.

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$: This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$: This implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$: This implies $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$: This implies $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

By solving these systems of equations, we can find the vertices of the polygon. The polygon is a square with side length 16, so its area is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

\[\cos t = \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3}.\]In the equation $x = \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\sin t$ to get
\[\sin t = \frac{1}{2} x (2 - \cos t) + 1 = \frac{1}{2} x \left( 2 - \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right) + 1 = 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)}.\]Since $\cos^2 t + \sin^2 t = 1,$
\[\left( \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right)^2 + \left( 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)} \right)^2 = 1.\]Multiplying both sides by $(2(y + 3))^2$ and expanding, it will simplify to
\[81x^2 - 36xy + 16y^2 - 108x + 240y + 900 = 0.\]Therefore, $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F| = 81 + 36 + 16 + 108 + 240 + 900 = \boxed{1381}.$ The answer is $\boxed{1381}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

Let's consider the first term $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This term is zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These conditions are satisfied only when $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$. So the first term gives us the vertices of a square with side length 20.

Now let's consider the second term $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This term is zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These conditions are satisfied only when $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So the second term gives us the vertices of a square with side length 16.

The two squares intersect at the origin (0,0), and the larger square contains the smaller square. Therefore, the convex polygon formed by the intersection of the two squares is also a square. The side length of this square is the distance from the origin to the vertices of the larger square, which is 10. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Five identical rectangles are arranged to form a larger rectangle $PQRS$, as shown.  The area of $PQRS$ is $4000$.  What is the length, $x$, rounded off to the nearest integer? [asy]
real x = 1; real w = 2/3;

// Draw outer square and labels
pair s = (0, 0); pair r = (2 * x, 0); pair q = (3 * w, x + w); pair p = (0, x + w);
draw(s--r--q--p--cycle);
label("$S$", s, SW); label("$R$", r, SE); label("$Q$", q, NE); label("$P$", p, NW);

// Draw other segments
draw((x, 0)--(x, w));
draw((0, w)--(2 * x, w));
draw((w, x + w)--(w, w)); draw((2 * w, x + w)--(2 * w, w));

// length labels
pair upper = (-0.1, x + w);
pair lower = (-0.1, w);
draw(lower--upper);
draw((-0.1 - 0.03, x + w)--(-0.1 + 0.03, x + w));
draw((-0.1 - 0.03, w)--(-0.1 + 0.03, w));
label("$x$", midpoint((-0.1, w)--(-0.1, x + w)), W);

pair left = (0, -0.1); pair right = (x, -0.1);
draw((0, -0.1 + 0.03)--(0, -0.1 - 0.03));
draw((x, -0.1 - 0.03)--(x, -0.1 + 0.03));
draw(left--right);
label("$x$", (x/2, -0.1), S);

[/asy]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Let $w$ be the width of each of the identical rectangles. Since $PQ=3w$, $RS=2x$ and $PQ=RS$ (because $PQRS$ is a rectangle), then $2x = 3w$, or $$w=\frac{2}{3}x.$$ Therefore, the area of each of the five identical rectangles is $$x\left(\frac{2}{3}x\right)=\frac{2}{3}x^2.$$ Since the area of $PQRS$ is 4000 and it is made up of five of these identical smaller rectangles, then $$5\left(\frac{2}{3}x^2\right)=4000$$ or $$\frac{10}{3}x^2 = 4000$$ or $x^2 = 1200$ or $x \approx 34.6$ which, when rounded off to the nearest integer, is $\boxed{35}.$ The answer is $\boxed{35}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The equation is satisfied if and only if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, or both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The first set of equations implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.
The second set of equations implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
The solutions to the first set of equations are the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.
The solutions to the second set of equations are the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.
The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 16.
The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
