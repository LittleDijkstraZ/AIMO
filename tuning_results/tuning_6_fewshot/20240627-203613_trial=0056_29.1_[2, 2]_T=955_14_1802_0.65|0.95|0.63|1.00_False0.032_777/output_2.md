**Problem:** 
"Let \[f(x) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
-x + 3 & \text{if } x \le 0, \\
2x - 5 & \text{if } x > 0.
\end{array}
\right.\]How many solutions does the equation $f(f(x)) = 4$ have?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
To solve the equation $f(f(x)) = 4,$ we first find the values $x$ such that $f(x) = 4.$

Either $f(x) = -x + 3$ (for $x \le 0$) or $f(x) = 2x - 5$ (for $x > 0$). If $-x + 3 = 4,$ then $x = -1.$ Note that this value satisfies $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = 4,$ then $x = 9/2.$ Note that this value satisfies $x > 0.$ Therefore, the solutions to $f(x) = 4$ are $x = -1$ and $x = 9/2.$

Next, we solve for the values $x$ such that $f(x) = -1.$ If $-x + 3 = -1,$ then $x = 4.$ This value does not satisfy $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = -1,$ then $x = 2.$ This value satisfies $x > 0.$

Finally, we solve for the values $x$ such that $f(x) = 9/2.$ If $-x + 3 = 9/2,$ then $x = -3/2.$ This value satisfies $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = 9/2,$ then $x = 19/4.$ This value satisfies $x > 0.$

Therefore, the equation $f(f(x)) = 4$ has the solutions $x = 2,$ $-3/2,$ and $19/4,$ for a total of $\boxed{3}$ solutions. The answer is $\boxed{3}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



To solve the problem, we need to find the value of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. We can start by considering the possible values of $\vert x-1 \vert -2$.

1. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, then $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two cases:
   a. If $x \geq 1$, then $x - 1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.
   b. If $x < 1$, then $1 - x = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

2. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$, then $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two cases:
   a. If $x \geq 1$, then $x - 1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
   b. If $x < 1$, then $1 - x = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

For the equation to have $4$ distinct solutions, we need the following conditions to hold:

- The equation $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ must have a solution for $x < 1$. This is not possible because $3 + \frac{m}{100} > 1$ for all $m > 0$.
- The equation $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$ must have a solution for $x < 1$. This is possible if $-1 - \frac{m}{100} < 1$, which implies $m < 100$.
- The equation $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ must have a solution for $x \geq 1$. This is not possible because $3 - \frac{m}{100} < 1$ for all $m > 0$.
- The equation $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$ must have a solution for $x \geq 1$. This is possible if $-1 + \frac{m}{100} \geq 1$, which implies $m \geq 100$.

Therefore, the only possible values for $m$ are those in the range $100 \leq m < 100$, i.e., $m = 100$. To confirm that this value indeed gives us $4$ distinct solutions, we can substitute $m = 100$ into the equations and solve for $x$:

- For $x = -1 - \frac{100}{100}$, we get $x = -2$.
- For $x = -1 + \frac{100}{100}$, we get $x = 0$.

So the solutions are $x = -2$, $x = 0$, and the two solutions from the original equation $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{100}{100}$, which simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = 3$. The solutions to this equation are $x = -2$ and $x = 4$. Thus, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{100}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

The value of $m$ that satisfies the conditions is $m = 100$. The answer is: $100$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"For certain ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ of real numbers, the system of equations
\[\begin{aligned} ax+by&=1 \\ x^2 + y^2 &= 50  \end{aligned}\]has at least one solution, and each solution is an ordered pair $(x,y)\,$ of integers. How many such ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ are there?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The graph of $ax+by=1$ is a line, while the graph of $x^2+y^2=50$ is a circle centered at the origin. Therefore, $(a, b)$ satisfies the conditions if and only if the line and circle intersect at least once, and they intersect only at lattice points (points with integer coordinates).

Knowing this, it makes sense to look for lattice points on the circle whose equation is $x^2+y^2=50$. Testing cases, we find that there are twelve lattice points on the circle: $(\pm 1, \pm 7)$, $(\pm 7, \pm 1)$, and $(\pm 5, \pm 5)$ (where the two $\pm$ signs in each pair are independent of each other).

There are $\tbinom{12}{2} = 66$ pairs of these points, and each pair determines a line. However, the graph of $ax+by=1$ can never pass through the origin $(0, 0)$, since if $x=y=0$, then $ax+by=0 \neq 1$. Therefore, the six pairs which consist of diametrically opposed points are invalid, since the line through them passes through the origin. This corrects our count to $66 - 6 = 60$.

In addition, for each of the twelve points, there is a line tangent to the circle at that point, so that the only solution to the system is that one point. This brings the final total to $60 + 12 = \boxed{72}$. The answer is $\boxed{72}$

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we need to find the value of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

Let's break down the steps to solve this problem:

1. First, we need to find the values of $x$ for which the equation is true. To do this, we can start by analyzing the absolute value expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$.
2. This expression can be equal to $\frac{m}{100}$ in four ways:
   - Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$
   - Case 2: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$
   - Case 3: $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = \frac{m}{100}$
   - Case 4: $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = -\frac{m}{100}$
3. For each of these cases, we need to solve the resulting equations to find the values of $x$.
4. Then, we need to count the number of distinct solutions for each value of $m$.

Let's write a Python script to solve this problem:

```python

        eq1 = abs(x - 1) - 2 - i/100
        solutions1 = solve(eq1, x)

        # Case 2
        eq2 = abs(x - 1) - 2 + i/100
        solutions2 = solve(eq2, x)

        # Case 3
        eq3 = -abs(x - 1) + 2 - i/100
        solutions3 = solve(eq3, x)

        # Case 4
        eq4 = -abs(x - 1) + 2 + i/100
        solutions4 = solve(eq4, x)

        # Combine all solutions
        solutions.extend(solutions1 + solutions2 + solutions3 + solutions4)

    # Count the number of distinct solutions
    distinct_solutions = len(set(solutions))

    return distinct_solutions

result = count_solutions()
print(result)
```

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many solutions does the equation \[\frac{(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)\dotsm(x-100)}{(x-1^2)(x-2^2)(x-3^2)\dotsm(x-100^2)} = 0\]have for $x$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Any solution to this equation must make the numerator of the left-hand side zero, while keeping the denominator non-zero. The numerator is zero when $x$ is one of the numbers $1, 2, 3, \dots, 100.$ However, for any value in this list that is a perfect square, the denominator will also be zero, so that value of $x$ will not be a root. Therefore, we want to find the number of integers in the list $1, 2, \dots, 100$ which are not perfect squares. The perfect squares in the list are $1^2, 2^2, \dots, 10^2,$ so there are $10$ perfect squares, and \[100 - 10 = \boxed{90}\]integers which are not perfect squares. The answer is $\boxed{90}$

The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $100$. However, we are asked to find for how many of these $m$ values the equation has exactly $4$ distinct solutions. This means we have to exclude the cases where the equation has less than $4$ solutions. 

We know that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has at most $4$ solutions because the left-hand side is a piecewise function with $4$ pieces. When $m=0$, the equation simplifies to $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=0$, which has only $2$ solutions. When $0<m\leq 2$, the equation has $4$ distinct solutions. When $2<m\leq 100$, the equation has $2$ distinct solutions.

So, the only $m$ values for which the equation has exactly $4$ distinct solutions are those in the range $0<m\leq 2$. There are $2$ such values, namely $1$ and $2$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly $4$ distinct solutions is $2$. The answer is $\boxed{2}$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many distinct solutions are there to the equation $|x-7| = |x+1|$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
If $|x-7| = |x+1|$, then either $x-7 = x+1$ or $x-7 = -(x+1)$.  Simplifying $x-7=x+1$ gives $0=8$, which has no solutions, so no values of $x$ satisfy $x-7 = x+1$.  If $x-7 = -(x+1)$, then $x-7 = -x-1$, so $2x = 6$, which gives $x=3$.  So, there is $\boxed{1}$ solution.

Challenge: See if you can find a quick solution to this problem by simply thinking about the graphs of $y=|x-7|$ and $y=|x+1|$. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


For the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ to have $4$ distinct solutions, the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be $1$. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a shape of a "V" with the "bottom" of the "V" at $1$, and the "height" of the "V" is $2$. So for the function to have $4$ distinct solutions, the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be exactly $1$. Therefore, $m=100$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def find_m():
    """For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"""
