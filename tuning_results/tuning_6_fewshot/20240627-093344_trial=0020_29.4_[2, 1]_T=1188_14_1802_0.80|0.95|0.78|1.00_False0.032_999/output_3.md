**Problem:** 
"Five identical rectangles are arranged to form a larger rectangle $PQRS$, as shown.  The area of $PQRS$ is $4000$.  What is the length, $x$, rounded off to the nearest integer? [asy]
real x = 1; real w = 2/3;

// Draw outer square and labels
pair s = (0, 0); pair r = (2 * x, 0); pair q = (3 * w, x + w); pair p = (0, x + w);
draw(s--r--q--p--cycle);

// Draw other segments

draw((0, w)--(2 * x, w));
draw((w, x + w)--(w, w)); draw((2 * w, x + w)--(2 * w, w));

// length labels
pair upper = (-0.1, x + w);
pair lower = (-0.1, w);
draw(lower--upper);
draw((-0.1 - 0.03, x + w)--(-0.1 + 0.03, x + w));
draw((-0.1 - 0.03, w)--(-0.1 + 0.03, w));
label("$x$", midpoint((-0.1, w)--(-0.1, x + w)), W);

pair left = (0, -0.1); pair right = (x, -0.1);
draw((0, -0.1 + 0.03)--(0, -0.1 - 0.03));
draw((x, -0.1 - 0.03)--(x, -0.1 + 0.03));
draw(left--right);
label("$x$", (x/2, -0.1), S);

[/asy]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Let $w$ be the width of each of the identical rectangles. Since $PQ=3w$, $RS=2x$ and $PQ=RS$ (because $PQRS$ is a rectangle), then $2x = 3w$, or $$w=\frac{2}{3}x.$$ Therefore, the area of each of the five identical rectangles is $$x\left(\frac{2}{3}x\right)=\frac{2}{3}x^2.$$ Since the area of $PQRS$ is 4000 and it is made up of five of these identical smaller rectangles, then $$5\left(\frac{2}{3}x^2\right)=4000$$ or $$\frac{10}{3}x^2 = 4000$$ or $x^2 = 1200$ or $x \approx 34.6$ which, when rounded off to the nearest integer, is $\boxed{35}.$ The answer is $\boxed{35}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This means that either $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The equations $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$ define a square with side length 16.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$.

The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, notice that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So, we have two cases to consider: 
   1.1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, or
   1.2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

2. For case 1.1, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon.

3. For case 1.2, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon.

4. The vertices of the polygon are the intersection points of the lines given by the equations from steps 2.2 and 2.1.

5. Calculate the area of the polygon using standard polygon area formulas.

Now, let's implement this in Python using sympy:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solve, Abs

def polygon_area():
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # Case 1.1
    eq1 = Abs(x + y) - 10
    eq2 = Abs(x - y) - 10
    solution1 = solve([eq1, eq2], (x, y))

    # Case 1.2
    eq3 = Abs(x) - 8
    eq4 = Abs(y) - 8
    solution2 = solve([eq3, eq4], (x, y))

    # Combine solutions
    solutions = solution1 + solution2

    # Calculate the area
    # The polygon is a square with side length 16 (from case 1.2),
    # and it contains a smaller square with side length 20 (from case 1.1)
    area = (16**2) - (20**2)

    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS -144

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
-144
```
The area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{144}$ square units. However, the area cannot be negative, so we must have made a mistake in our calculations. Let's retrace our steps and find the mistake.

Upon reexamination, we realized that the solution for case 1.1 did not give us the vertices of the polygon. Instead, it gave us the conditions under which the polygon vertices would be reached. Let's correct this:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solve, Abs

def polygon_area():
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # Case 1.1
    eq1 = Abs(x + y) - 10
    eq2 = Abs(x - y) - 10
    solution1 = solve([eq1, eq2], (x, y))

    # Case 1.2
    eq3 = Abs(x) - 8
    eq4 = Abs(y) - 8
    solution2 = solve([eq3, eq4], (x, y))

    # Combine solutions
    solutions = solution1 + solution2

    # Calculate the area
    # The polygon is a square with side length 16 (from case 1.2),
    # and it contains a smaller square with side length 20 (from case 1.1)
    # However, the side length of the smaller square is incorrect.
    # The side length should be 10 (from case 1.1), not 20.
    area = (16**2) - (10**2)

    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 156

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
156
```
The area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{156}$ square units. However, this is not the correct answer either. The mistake was in the calculation of the area of the polygon. The polygon is a square with side length 16 (from case 1.2), and it contains a smaller square with side length 10 (from case 1.1). The area of the polygon is the difference between the areas of these two squares:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    # Side lengths of the squares
    side_large = 16
    side_small = 10

    # Calculate the area
    area = (side_large**2) - (side_small**2)

    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
``````output

CODE RESULTS 156

INTERMEDIATE OUT :

156
```
The area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{156}$ square units. This is the correct answer. So, the area of the convex polygon is $156$ square units.
The answer is $\boxed{156}$.

Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Let $w$ be the width of each of the identical rectangles. Since $PQ=3w$, $RS=2x$ and $PQ=RS$ (because $PQRS$ is a rectangle), then $2x = 3w$, or $$w=\frac{2}{3}x.$$ Therefore, the area of each of the five identical rectangles is $$x\left(\frac{2}{3}x\right)=\frac{2}{3}x^2.$$ Since the area of $PQRS$ is 4000 and it is made up of five of these identical smaller rectangles, then $$5\left(\frac{2}{3}x^2\right)=4000$$ or $$\frac{10}{3}x^2 = 4000$$ or $x^2 = 1200$ or $x \approx 34.6$ which, when rounded off to the nearest integer, is $\boxed{35}.$ The answer is $\boxed{35}$

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


First, we need to understand the given equation and the conditions it imposes on the points $(x, y)$. The equation is of the form $A \cdot B = 0$, which means either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. So, either $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$ or $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

If $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$, then both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these absolute value equations are all the points $(x, y)$ that are at a distance of 10 from the origin (0, 0) in the $x + y$ and $x - y$ directions respectively. These solutions form two squares with side length of 20 units, one square in the first and third quadrants and the other in the second and fourth quadrants.

If $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$, then both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these absolute value equations are all the points $(x, y)$ that are at a distance of 8 from the origin (0, 0) in the x and y directions respectively. These solutions form a square with side length of 16 units.

The area of the polygon formed by the intersection of these two squares is the area of the smaller square (with side length 16 units), because it is entirely contained within the larger squares (with side length 20 units). The area of a square is given by the square of its side length, so the area of the polygon is $16^2 = 256$ square units. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: 256

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We start with the given equation: $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

2. This equation equals zero if either of the two factors equals zero. So we have two separate cases to consider:

   a) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

   b) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

3. In case (a), we have four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length 10 and diagonals of length 10√2.

4. In case (b), we have four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length 16.

5. The intersection of the two cases forms a smaller square inside the larger square. The side length of the smaller square is 8 (the smaller of the two side lengths).

6. To find the area of the convex polygon, we calculate the area of the larger square and subtract the area of the smaller square.

7. The area of the larger square is $(16)^2 = 256$, and the area of the smaller square is $(8)^2 = 64$.

8. So the area of the convex polygon is $256 - 64 = 192$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def calculate_area():
    # Calculate the area of the larger square
    larger_square_area = 16**2

    # Calculate the area of the smaller square
    smaller_square_area = 8**2

    # Calculate the area of the convex polygon
    convex_polygon_area = larger_square_area - smaller_square_area

    return convex_polygon_area

result = calculate_area()
print(result)
```

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. Notice that the expression is equal to zero if either of the two products is zero. This gives us two sets of equations to solve: $|x + y| - 10 = 0$, $|x - y| - 10 = 0$, $|x| - 8 = 0$, and $|y| - 8 = 0$.

2. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

3. Now, we can calculate the area of the rectangle formed by these points. The length of the rectangle is $16$ (difference between the x-coordinates) and the width is $16$ (difference between the y-coordinates).

4. The area of the rectangle is length times width, so $16 \times 16 = 256$.

Now let's code this in Python using sympy:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    # The vertices of the polygon
    vertices = [(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)]

    # Calculate the length and width of the rectangle
    length = abs(vertices[0][0] - vertices[2][0])
    width = abs(vertices[0][1] - vertices[1][1])

    # Calculate the area of the rectangle
    area = length * width

    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$
