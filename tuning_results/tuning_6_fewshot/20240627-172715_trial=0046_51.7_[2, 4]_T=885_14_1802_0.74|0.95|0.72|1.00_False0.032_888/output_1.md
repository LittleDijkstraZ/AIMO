**Problem:** 
"What is the minimum value of the expression $2x^2+3y^2+8x-24y+62$ for real $x$ and $y$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Rearranging the expression, we have  \[2x^2+8x+3y^2-24y+62\]We first complete the square in $x$. Factoring a 2 from the first two terms of the expression, we get  \[2(x^2+4x)+3y^2-24y+62\]In order for the expression inside the parenthesis to be a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(4/2)^2=4$ inside the parenthesis. Doing this, we have \[2(x^2+4x+4-4)+3y^2-24y+62 \Rightarrow 2(x+2)^2+3y^2-24y+54\]Now we complete the square in $y$. Factoring a 3 from the $y$ terms in the expression, we get \[2(x+2)^2+3(y^2-8y)+54\]In order for the expression inside the second parenthesis to be a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(8/2)^2=16$ inside the parenthesis. Doing this, we have \[2(x+2)^2+3(y^2-8y+16-16)+54 \Rightarrow 2(x+2)^2+3(y-4)^2+6\]Since the minimum value of $2(x+2)^2$ and $3(y-4)^2$ is $0$ (perfect squares can never be negative), the minimum value of the entire expression is $\boxed{6}$, and is achieved when $x=-2$ and $y=4$. The answer is $\boxed{6}$

**Problem**
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


This problem is a bit complex and requires a deep understanding of the given conditions and mathematical properties. However, we can solve it using the following steps:

1. First, we can rewrite the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ as $|x-2y| = |2x-y|$. This is because $|a| = |-a|$ for all real numbers $a$.
2. Now, we know that $|x-2y|$ and $|2x-y|$ are always non-negative. Therefore, we can square both sides of the equation without changing the solution set.
3. Squaring the equation gives us $(x-2y)^2 = (2x-y)^2$. Expanding both sides, we get $x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2 = 4x^2 - 4xy + y^2$.
4. Simplifying this equation gives us $3x^2 - 3y^2 = 0$, or $x^2 - y^2 = 0$.
5. This equation can be factored as $(x+y)(x-y) = 0$. Therefore, $x+y = 0$ or $x-y = 0$.
6. If $x+y = 0$, then $y = -x$. Substituting this into the original equation gives us $|x+2x| + |-x+2(-x)| = 40$, or $3|x| + 3|x| = 40$, or $6|x| = 40$. Therefore, $|x| = \frac{40}{6} = \frac{20}{3}$.
7. If $x-y = 0$, then $y = x$. Substituting this into the original equation gives us $|x-2x| + |-x+2x| = 40$, or $0 + 0 = 40$, which is not possible.
8. Therefore, we must have $y = -x$. Substituting this into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ gives us $5x^2+5(-x)^2-8x(-x) = 5x^2+5x^2+8x^2 = 18x^2$.
9. Since $x = -\frac{20}{3}$, we have $18x^2 = 18\left(-\frac{20}{3}\right)^2 = 18\cdot\frac{400}{9} = \frac{7200}{9} = 800$.

So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 800 under the given conditions.

The Python code to solve this problem would look like this:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, simplify

def minimum_value():
    x = symbols('x')
    y = -x
    expr = 5*x**2 + 5*y**2 - 8*x*y
    value = expr.subs(x, -20/3)
    return simplify(value)

result = minimum_value()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 800.000000000000

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
800.000000000000
```
The minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 800 under the given conditions. The answer is $\boxed{800}$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"What is the minimum value of the expression $x^2+y^2+2x-4y+8$ for real $x$ and $y$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Rearranging the expression, we have  \[x^2+2x+y^2-4y+8\]Completing the square in $x$, we need to add and subtract $(2/2)^2=1$. Completing the square in $y$, we need to add and subtract $(4/2)^2=4$. Thus, we have \[(x^2+2x+1)-1+(y^2-4y+4)-4+8 \Rightarrow (x+1)^2+(y-2)^2+3\]Since the minimum value of $(x+1)^2$ and $(y-2)^2$ is $0$ (perfect squares can never be negative), the minimum value of the entire expression is $\boxed{3}$, and is achieved when $x=-1$ and $y=2$. The answer is $\boxed{3}$

**Problem**
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import minimize

def func_to_minimize(variables):
    x, y = variables
    return 5*x**2 + 5*y**2 - 8*x*y

def constraint_func(variables):
    x, y = variables
    return abs(x - 2*y) + abs(y - 2*x) - 40

constraints = ({'type': 'eq', 'fun': constraint_func})

result = minimize(func_to_minimize, x0=np.array([0, 0]), constraints=constraints, method='SLSQP')

minimum_value = result.fun
print(minimum_value)
```
