**Problem:** 
"How many square units are in the area of the triangle whose vertices are the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the curve $y = (x-3)^2 (x+2)$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we need to find where this curve intersects the $x$ and $y$ axes.  If $y=0$, then $(x-3)^2(x+2)=0$, which has solutions of $x=3$ and $x=-2$.  If $x=0$, then $y=(-3)^2(2)=18$.  So, the curve has two $x$-intercepts and one $y$-intercept.  The length of the base along the $x$-axis is $3-(-2)=5$.  The height from this base is equal to the $y$-intercept, 18.  The area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 5\cdot 18=\boxed{45}$. The answer is $\boxed{45}$

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


This problem requires a deep understanding of absolute value functions and the properties of absolute values. The equation given is a product of two terms, each of which must be equal to zero in order for the product to be zero. Therefore, we have two sets of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first set of equations, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $-8 \le x, y \le 8$, and $x + y = \pm 10$. The solutions are the points $(8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, $(-8, 0)$, $(0, -8)$, $(8, 10)$, and $(8, -10)$.

For the second set of equations, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $-8 \le x, y \le 8$, and $x - y = \pm 10$. The solutions are the points $(8, -2)$, $(8, 2)$, $(2, -8)$, and $(-2, 8)$.

The points from both sets form a rectangle with side lengths 10 and 8. Therefore, the area of the polygon is $10 \times 8 = 80$. The answer is: $80$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_ 2= (-16,2).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that
\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as
\[\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1.\]Find $h + k + a + b.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


First, we can see that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So we can break the equation into two parts:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first equation, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solution set of these two equations forms a square with side length 20. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.

For the second equation, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solution set of these two equations forms a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

However, the intersection of the solution sets of the two equations is empty, so the two squares do not overlap. Therefore, the convex polygon formed by the union of the two squares is a rectangle with length 20 and width 16. The area of this rectangle is $20 \times 16 = 320$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 320.
The answer is: $320$

\[\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1.\]Find $h + k + a + b.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. Hence, either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. 

The first expression is zero when $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. This simplifies to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these equations form a square with side length $20$.

The second expression is zero when $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which simplifies to $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us a square with side length $16$.

Therefore, the points that satisfy the given equation are those that lie either inside the square of side length $20$ or inside the square of side length $16$. The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon that encloses the points that satisfy the given equation.

The area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares minus the area of their intersection. The area of a square with side length $a$ is $a^2$.

The area of the square of side length $20$ is $20^2 = 400$. The area of the square of side length $16$ is $16^2 = 256$.

The intersection of the two squares is another square. The side length of this square is the difference in the side lengths of the two original squares divided by 2, which is $(20 - 16)/2 = 2$. So, the area of the intersection is $2^2 = 4$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $400 + 256 - 4 = 652$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $652$. The answer is: $652$

**Solution:** 



1. To solve this problem, we first need to understand that the product of two terms equals zero if and only if at least one of the terms equals zero. Therefore, we can set each term in the product equal to zero and solve the resulting equations.
2. We have two equations to solve: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
3. For the first equation, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
4. For the second equation, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $x = 8$ or $x = -8$ and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.
5. The intersection of these solutions gives us the vertices of the polygon. By plotting these points, we can determine the shape of the polygon.
6. The polygon is a square with side length 10 units. To find the area of the square, we use the formula $A = s^2$, where $s$ is the side length. So, $A = 10^2 = 100$.

The area of the convex polygon is 100 square units. The answer is: $100$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

**Solution:** 


This problem involves the concept of absolute value and inequalities. The absolute value function $|x|$ equals $x$ if $x \geq 0$ and $-x$ if $x < 0$. The equation is satisfied if either of the two factors in the product equals zero. Therefore, we need to solve four separate systems of inequalities:

1. $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x| - 8 = 0$ and $|y| - 8 = 0$.
2. $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x| - 8 = 0$ and $|y| - 8 \neq 0$.
3. $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x| - 8 \neq 0$ and $|y| - 8 = 0$.
4. $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x| - 8 \neq 0$ and $|y| - 8 \neq 0$.

The first factor equals zero when $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. This implies $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. The points are $(\pm 8, 8)$ and $(\pm 8, -8)$.

The second factor equals zero when $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x| = 8$ and $|y| \neq 8$. This implies $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm (8 - 10) = \pm 2$. The points are $(\pm 8, 2)$ and $(\pm 8, -2)$.

The third factor equals zero when $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x| \neq 8$ and $|y| = 8$. This implies $x = \pm (8 - 10) = \pm 2$ and $y = \pm 8$. The points are $(\pm 2, 8)$ and $(\pm 2, -8)$.

The fourth factor equals zero when $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x| \neq 8$ and $|y| \neq 8$. This implies $x = \pm (8 - 10) = \pm 2$ and $y = \pm (8 - 10) = \pm 2$. The points are $(\pm 2, 2)$ and $(\pm 2, -2)$.

The eight points form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

**Solution:** 



To solve this problem, we first need to understand the given equation and the conditions under which it equals to zero. The equation is a product of two terms, so it equals to zero when either of the terms equals to zero. Let's analyze each term separately:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$: This term equals to zero when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$: This term equals to zero when $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$: This term equals to zero when $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$: This term equals to zero when $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

By analyzing the above conditions, we can conclude that the points that satisfy the given equation lie on the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, $x - y = -10$, $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(8, 2)$, $(8, -6)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -6)$. The area of this rectangle is $(8 - (-8)) \times (2 - (-6)) = 16 \times 8 = 128$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 128.

The area of the convex polygon is 128. However, it seems that there was a mistake in the calculation. Let's reevaluate the problem.

The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. This polygon is a rectangle with vertices at $(8, 2)$, $(8, -6)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -6)$. 

The length of the rectangle is the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates, which is $8 - (-8) = 16$.
The width of the rectangle is the difference between the maximum and minimum y-coordinates, which is $2 - (-6) = 8$.

The area of the rectangle is the product of its length and width, which is $16 \times 8 = 128$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 128.

The mistake in the previous calculation was due to misunderstanding the conditions given by the absolute value equations. The correct solution is as follows:

The points that satisfy the given equation lie on the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, $x - y = -10$, $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(8, 2)$, $(8, -6)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -6)$. The area of this rectangle is $(8 - (-8)) \times (2 - (-6)) = 16 \times 8 = 128$.

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**

    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # The given equation is satisfied only when both terms in the product are zero
    # Each term is a square, so each term must be individually zero
    equation1 = Eq((Abs(x + y) - 10)**2, 0)
    equation2 = Eq((Abs(x - y) - 10)**2, 0)
    equation3 = Eq((Abs(x) - 8)**2, 0)
    equation4 = Eq((Abs(y) - 8)**2, 0)

    # Solve each equation
    solutions1 = solve(equation1)
    solutions2 = solve(equation2)
    solutions3 = solve(equation3)
    solutions4 = solve(equation4)

    # Combine the solutions
    solutions = solutions1 + solutions2 + solutions3 + solutions4

    # The polygon is a square with side length 16
    area = 16**2

    return simplify(area)

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_ 2= (-16,2).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that
\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as
\[\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1.\]Find $h + k + a + b.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, which means that either one of the expressions is zero. Therefore, we have two sets of equations:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From the first set of equations, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0), (8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$.

From the second set of equations, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations, we get the same vertices as before.

Now, let's plot these vertices on a graph and visualize the polygon. The polygon is a square with side length 16. The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

```python

def area_of_polygon():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    # The side length of the square
    side_length = 16

    # The area of the square
    area = side_length**2

    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```
