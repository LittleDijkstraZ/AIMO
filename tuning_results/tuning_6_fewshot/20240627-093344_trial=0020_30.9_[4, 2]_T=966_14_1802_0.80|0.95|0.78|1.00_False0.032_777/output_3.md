Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, which means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.
The first term is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, and it equals to zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us a square with side length 10.
The second term is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$, and it equals to zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us a square with side length 16.
The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for.
To find the area of the convex polygon, we just need to subtract the area of the smaller square from the area of the larger square.
The area of a square with side length $a$ is $a^2$, so the area of the larger square is $10^2 = 100$, and the area of the smaller square is $8^2 = 64$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $100 - 64 = 36$.
```python

def polygon_area():
    """Calculate the area of the convex polygon"""
    larger_square_side = 10
    smaller_square_side = 8

    larger_square_area = larger_square_side ** 2
    smaller_square_area = smaller_square_side ** 2

    polygon_area = larger_square_area - smaller_square_area
    return polygon_area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 36

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output

```
The area of the convex polygon is 36.
The answer is $\boxed{36}$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Five identical rectangles are arranged to form a larger rectangle $PQRS$, as shown.  The area of $PQRS$ is $4000$.  What is the length, $x$, rounded off to the nearest integer? [asy]
real x = 1; real w = 2/3;

[/asy]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Let $w$ be the width of each of the identical rectangles. Since $PQ=3w$, $RS=2x$ and $PQ=RS$ (because $PQRS$ is a rectangle), then $2x = 3w$, or $$w=\frac{2}{3}x.$$ Therefore, the area of each of the five identical rectangles is $$x\left(\frac{2}{3}x\right)=\frac{2}{3}x^2.$$ Since the area of $PQRS$ is 4000 and it is made up of five of these identical smaller rectangles, then $$5\left(\frac{2}{3}x^2\right)=4000$$ or $$\frac{10}{3}x^2 = 4000$$ or $x^2 = 1200$ or $x \approx 34.6$ which, when rounded off to the nearest integer, is $\boxed{35}.$ The answer is $\boxed{35}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

The first term is zero when either $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x-y| - 10 = 0$. These simplify to $|x+y| = 10$ and $|x-y| = 10$.

The second term is zero when either $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$. These simplify to $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$.

The solutions to these equations are the lines $x+y = \pm 10$, $x-y = \pm 10$, $x = \pm 8$, and $y = \pm 8$. These lines form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, we need to understand the given equation: $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

This equation is equal to zero when either of the two terms in the product is zero. This gives us two systems of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first system, the first equation implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, and the second equation implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x, y \in [-8, 8]$. The intersection of these two conditions is a square with side length $10$ (from $-10$ to $10$ for both $x$ and $y$), so the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

For the second system, the first equation implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, and the second equation implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x, y \in [-8, 8]$. The intersection of these two conditions is also a square with side length $10$ (from $-10$ to $10$ for both $x$ and $y$), so the area of this square is also $10^2 = 100$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon formed by the points satisfying the given equation is $100 + 100 = 200$.

However, this result doesn't make sense, because the area of a square with side length 10 should be $10^2 = 100$, not $200$. Let's re-examine the problem.

The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ implies that either $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$ or $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

For the first case, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two lines, so they form a square with side length $10$ and area $10^2 = 100$.

For the second case, either $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $x, y \in [-8, 8]$, so they also form a square with side length $16$ (from $-8$ to $8$ for both $x$ and $y$), but this square is entirely contained in the first square, so it doesn't contribute to the area of the convex polygon.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon formed by the points satisfying the given equation is $100$.

So the answer is $\boxed{100}$.

Let $w$ be the width of each of the identical rectangles. Since $PQ=3w$, $RS=2x$ and $PQ=RS$ (because $PQRS$ is a rectangle), then $2x = 3w$, or $$w=\frac{2}{3}x.$$ Therefore, the area of each of the five identical rectangles is $$x\left(\frac{2}{3}x\right)=\frac{2}{3}x^2.$$ Since the area of $PQRS$ is 4000 and it is made up of five of these identical smaller rectangles, then $$5\left(\frac{2}{3}x^2\right)=4000$$ or $$\frac{10}{3}x^2 = 4000$$ or $x^2 = 1200$ or $x \approx 34.6$ which, when rounded off to the nearest integer, is $\boxed{35}.$ The answer is $\boxed{35}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ equals to 0 if and only if both factors are 0. This happens if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The equations $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ represent two pairs of parallel lines in the coordinate plane, namely $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle.

The equations $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ represent two pairs of parallel lines in the coordinate plane, namely $x = 8$ and $x = -8$, $y = 8$ and $y = -8$. These lines form a square.

Therefore, the points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying the given equation enclose a convex polygon which is the intersection of a rectangle and a square. This intersection is a smaller rectangle.

The side lengths of the rectangle are $20$ and $16$, so its area is $20 \times 16 = 320$.
The answer is $\boxed{320}$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many square units are in the area of the triangle whose vertices are the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the curve $y = (x-3)^2 (x+2)$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we need to find where this curve intersects the $x$ and $y$ axes.  If $y=0$, then $(x-3)^2(x+2)=0$, which has solutions of $x=3$ and $x=-2$.  If $x=0$, then $y=(-3)^2(2)=18$.  So, the curve has two $x$-intercepts and one $y$-intercept.  The length of the base along the $x$-axis is $3-(-2)=5$.  The height from this base is equal to the $y$-intercept, 18.  The area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 5\cdot 18=\boxed{45}$. The answer is $\boxed{45}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if either of the two factors is zero. 

For the first factor to be zero, we must have $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

For the second factor to be zero, we must have $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersection of these lines form a square with side length $16$. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $256$.

Here is a Python function to calculate the area of the square:

```python

    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

area = square_area()
