Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, notice that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So, we have two cases to consider:

    a. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
    b. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

2. For case a, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

3. For case b, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

4. The intersection points of these lines are the vertices of the polygon. By plotting these lines on a coordinate plane, we can find the vertices of the polygon. They are $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(2, 8)$, $(-2, 8)$, $(2, -8)$, and $(-2, -8)$.

5. To find the area of the polygon, we can use the Shoelace formula. The Shoelace formula is a way to find the area of a polygon given the coordinates of its vertices. If the vertices of the polygon are $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$, ..., $(x_n, y_n)$, the formula is:

   Area = $\frac{1}{2} \vert (x_1y_2 + x_2y_3 + ... + x_ny_1) - (y_1x_2 + y_2x_3 + ... + y_nx_1) \vert$.

6. Applying the Shoelace formula to the vertices $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(2, 8)$, $(-2, 8)$, $(2, -8)$, and $(-2, -8)$, we get:

   Area = $\frac{1}{2} \vert (8 \cdot 2 + 8 \cdot (-2) + (-8) \cdot 2 + (-8) \cdot (-2) + 2 \cdot 8 + (-2) \cdot 8 + 2 \cdot (-8) + (-2) \cdot (-8)) - (2 \cdot 8 + (-2) \cdot (-8) + 8 \cdot 2 + (-8) \cdot (-2) + (-2) \cdot 8 + 2 \cdot (-8) + (-2) \cdot 2 + 8 \cdot (-2)) \vert$

   Area = $\frac{1}{2} \vert (16 - 16 - 16 + 16 + 16 - 16 - 16 + 16) - (16 + 16 + 16 - 16 - 16 + 16 - 4 - 16) \vert$

   Area = $\frac{1}{2} \vert 0 - 0 \vert = 0$.

However, the area of the polygon cannot be zero. We must have made a mistake in our calculations. Let's retrace our steps and check our work.

After reexamining our calculations, we realize that we made a mistake in the application of the Shoelace formula. The formula is supposed to be:

   Area = $\frac{1}{2} \vert (x_1y_2 + x_2y_3 + ... + x_ny_1) - (y_1x_2 + y_2x_3 + ... + y_nx_1) \vert$.

But we used the wrong order of subtraction in our calculations. The correct formula should be:

   Area = $\frac{1}{2} \vert (x_1y_2 + x_2y_3 + ... + x_ny_1) + (y_1x_2 + y_2x_3 + ... + y_nx_1) \vert$.

Let's apply the correct formula again:

   Area = $\frac{1}{2} \vert (8 \cdot 2 + 8 \cdot (-2) + (-8) \cdot 2 + (-8) \cdot (-2) + 2 \cdot 8 + (-2) \cdot 8 + 2 \cdot (-8) + (-2) \cdot (-8)) + (2 \cdot 8 + (-2) \cdot (-8) + 8 \cdot 2 + (-8) \cdot (-2) + (-2) \cdot 8 + 2 \cdot (-8) + (-2) \cdot 2 + 8 \cdot (-2)) \vert$

   Area = $\frac{1}{2} \vert (16 - 16 - 16 + 16 + 16 - 16 - 16 + 16) + (16 + 16 + 16 - 16 - 16 + 16 - 4 - 16) \vert$

   Area = $\frac{1}{2} \vert 0 + 0 \vert = 0$.

Again, the area of the polygon cannot be zero. We must have made another mistake. Let's retrace our steps one more time and look for the mistake.

After reexamining our calculations again, we realize that we made another mistake in the application of the Shoelace formula. The formula is supposed to be:

   Area = $\frac{1}{2} \vert (x_1y_2 + x_2y_3 + ... + x_ny_1) + (y_1x_2 + y_2x_3 + ... + y_nx_1) \vert$.

But we used the wrong order of addition in our calculations. The correct formula should be:

   Area = $\frac{1}{2} \vert (x_1y_2 - x_2y_3 + ... + x_ny_1) - (y_1x_2 - y_2x_3 + ... + y_nx_1) \vert$.

Let's apply the correct formula once more:

   Area = $\frac{1}{2} \vert (8 \cdot 2 - 8 \cdot (-2) + (-8) \cdot 2 - (-8) \cdot (-2) + 2 \cdot 8 - (-2) \cdot 8 + 2 \cdot (-8) - (-2) \cdot (-8)) - (2 \cdot 8 - (-2) \cdot (-8) + 8 \cdot 2 - (-8) \cdot (-2) - (-2) \cdot 8 + 2 \cdot (-8) - (-2) \cdot 2 + 8 \cdot (-2)) \vert$

   Area = $\frac{1}{2} \vert (16 + 16 - 16 - 16 + 16 + 16 - 16 - 16) - (16 - 16 + 16 + 16 - 16 + 16 - 4 - 16) \vert$

   Area = $\frac{1}{2} \vert 0 - 0 \vert =

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_ 2= (-16,2).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that
\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as
\[\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1.\]Find $h + k + a + b.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

**Solution:** 



First, let's understand the problem. The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either one of the expressions is zero, or both are zero. We need to find the region where these expressions are zero, which will form a polygon.

We can start by analyzing each expression separately:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$: This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which gives two lines: $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.

2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$: This implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which gives two lines: $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.

3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$: This implies $\vert x \vert = 8$, which gives two lines: $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.

4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$: This implies $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives two lines: $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

Now, let's find the intersection points of these lines:

1. Intersection of $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$: Solving this system of equations gives $x = 10$ and $y = 0$. So, we have point $(10, 0)$.

2. Intersection of $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$: Solving this system of equations gives $x = 0$ and $y = 10$. So, we have point $(0, 10)$.

3. Intersection of $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$: Solving this system of equations gives $x = -10$ and $y = -20$. So, we have point $(-10, -20)$.

4. Intersection of $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$: Solving this system of equations gives $x = -10$ and $y = 0$. So, we have point $(-10, 0)$.

5. Intersection of $x + y = 10$ and $x = 8$: Solving this system of equations gives $x = 8$ and $y = 2$. So, we have point $(8, 2)$.

6. Intersection of $x + y = 10$ and $x = -8$: Solving this system of equations gives $x = -8$ and $y = 18$. So, we have point $(-8, 18)$.

7. Intersection of $x + y = -10$ and $x = 8$: Solving this system of equations gives $x = 8$ and $y = -18$. So, we have point $(8, -18)$.

8. Intersection of $x + y = -10$ and $x = -8$: Solving this system of equations gives $x = -8$ and $y = -2$. So, we have point $(-8, -2)$.

9. Intersection of $x - y = 10$ and $y = 8$: Solving this system of equations gives $x = 18$ and $y = 8$. So, we have point $(18, 8)$.

10. Intersection of $x - y = 10$ and $y = -8$: Solving this system of equations gives $x = 2$ and $y = -8$. So, we have point $(2, -8)$.

11. Intersection of $x - y = -10$ and $y = 8$: Solving this system of equations gives $x = -2$ and $y = 8$. So, we have point $(-2, 8)$.

12. Intersection of $x - y = -10$ and $y = -8$: Solving this system of equations gives $x = -18$ and $y = -8$. So, we have point $(-18, -8)$.

Now, we plot these points on the coordinate plane and connect them to form the polygon. The polygon formed is a square with side length 20 units. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$ square units.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 400 square units. The answer is: $400$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Find the number of 10-tuples $(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{10})$ of real numbers such that
\[(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2 = \frac{1}{11}.\]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,
\begin{align*}
&[(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + \dots + 1^2 + 1^2)][(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2] \\
&\ge [(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + (x_2 - x_3) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10}]^2 = 1.
\end{align*}From the given condition, we have equality, so by the equality condition for Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[\frac{1 - x_1}{1} = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{1} = \frac{x_2 - x_3}{1} = \dots = \frac{x_9 - x_{10}}{1} = \frac{x_{10}}{1}.\]Let
\[d = 1 - x_1 = x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_3 = \dots = x_9 - x_{10} = x_{10}.\]Then
\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so
\[(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_{10}) = \left( \frac{10}{11}, \frac{9}{11}, \frac{8}{11}, \dots, \frac{1}{11} \right).\]In particular, there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ is equal to zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These equations represent two perpendicular lines $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.

Similarly, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which represent a square with side length 16 centered at the origin.

The intersection of these two sets of points is a square with side length 10 centered at the origin. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $10^2 = 100$.

The answer is: 100.

**Solution:** 



This problem requires understanding of absolute value function and properties of square root. The equation involves absolute value function, so we need to consider different cases for the absolute value expressions. The equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.

1. Solve the equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ for $x$ and $y$.
2. Solve the equation $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ for $x$ and $y$.
3. Solve the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ for $x$.
4. Solve the equation $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ for $y$.
5. The solutions from steps 1 to 4 form the vertices of the polygon.
6. Calculate the area of the polygon formed by these vertices.

Now, let's solve each step:

1. From $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which gives us two cases: $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.
2. From $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which gives us two cases: $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.
3. From $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$, which gives us two cases: $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.
4. From $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us two cases: $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.
5. By combining the cases from steps 1 to 4, we can find the vertices of the polygon.
6. To calculate the area of the polygon, we can use the formula for the area of a polygon given its vertices. For a square, the area is simply the side length squared. In this case, the side length is 16 (since the distance between the points (8,8) and (8,-8) or (-8,8) and (-8,-8) is 16), so the area of the polygon is $16^2 = 256$.

The final answer is:

The area of the polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $\boxed{256}$

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we need to understand the properties of absolute value and the conditions under which the product of two expressions can be zero.

The equation given is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

This equation is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first equation, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, the only way this can be true is if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

For the second equation, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, the only way this can be true is if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon formed by the points $(x, y)$ satisfying the given equation is 256.

Here is the python code to calculate the area:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_ 2= (-16,2).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that
\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as
\[\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1.\]Find $h + k + a + b.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. The area of this polygon can be determined by analyzing the equations.

The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This results in four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length 10.

The equation $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This results in four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length 16.

The intersection of the two squares is the convex polygon we are interested in. The side length of the smaller square is 10, so its area is $10^2 = 100$. The area of the larger square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the difference of the areas of the two squares, which is $256 - 100 = 156$.

However, this result seems incorrect. Let's reevaluate the problem. The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This results in four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length 10.

The equation $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This results in four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length 16.

However, the intersection of the two squares is not the convex polygon we are interested in. The intersection of the two squares is a smaller square with side length 10, which is the smaller square formed by the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. The area of this square is indeed $10^2 = 100$. But this is not the convex polygon we are interested in.

The convex polygon we are interested in is the union of the two squares, which is the larger square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$.
