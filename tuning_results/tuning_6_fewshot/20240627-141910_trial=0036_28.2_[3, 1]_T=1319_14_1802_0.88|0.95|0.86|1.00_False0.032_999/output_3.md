Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Let $w$ be the width of each of the identical rectangles. Since $PQ=3w$, $RS=2x$ and $PQ=RS$ (because $PQRS$ is a rectangle), then $2x = 3w$, or $$w=\frac{2}{3}x.$$ Therefore, the area of each of the five identical rectangles is $$x\left(\frac{2}{3}x\right)=\frac{2}{3}x^2.$$ Since the area of $PQRS$ is 4000 and it is made up of five of these identical smaller rectangles, then $$5\left(\frac{2}{3}x^2\right)=4000$$ or $$\frac{10}{3}x^2 = 4000$$ or $x^2 = 1200$ or $x \approx 34.6$ which, when rounded off to the nearest integer, is $\boxed{35}.$ The answer is $\boxed{35}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


The problem involves absolute value functions, which can be challenging to work with directly in sympy. However, we can simplify the problem by noting that the expression $(\vert x \vert - a)^2 + (\vert y \vert - b)^2 = 0$ is true only when $x = \pm a$ and $y = \pm b$. So we can solve the problem by finding the intersection points of the four equations given by setting each absolute value term to zero.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solve

def calculate_area():
    x, y = symbols('x y')
    
    # Solve the absolute value equations
    solutions_x_pos_y_pos = solve([(x + y - 10), (x - y - 10), (x - 8), (y - 8)], (x, y))
    solutions_x_neg_y_neg = solve([(-x - y + 10), (-x + y + 10), (-x + 8), (-y + 8)], (x, y))
    solutions_x_pos_y_neg = solve([(x + y - 10), (-x + y + 10), (x - 8), (-y + 8)], (x, y))
    solutions_x_neg_y_pos = solve([(-x - y + 10), (x - y - 10), (-x + 8), (y - 8)], (x, y))
    
    # Combine all the solutions
    solutions = solutions_x_pos_y_pos + solutions_x_neg_y_neg + solutions_x_pos_y_neg + solutions_x_neg_y_pos
    
    # Calculate the area of the polygon formed by the solutions
    area = abs(0.5 * sum([solutions[i][0]*solutions[i+1][1] - solutions[i+1][0]*solutions[i][1] for i in range(len(solutions) - 1)]))
    
    return area

result = calculate_area()
print(result)
```

The area of the polygon is 0. This is because the points that satisfy the given equation are all the same point $(10, 10)$, so the polygon degenerates into a single point with an area of 0.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many square units are in the area of the triangle whose vertices are the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the curve $y = (x-3)^2 (x+2)$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we need to find where this curve intersects the $x$ and $y$ axes.  If $y=0$, then $(x-3)^2(x+2)=0$, which has solutions of $x=3$ and $x=-2$.  If $x=0$, then $y=(-3)^2(2)=18$.  So, the curve has two $x$-intercepts and one $y$-intercept.  The length of the base along the $x$-axis is $3-(-2)=5$.  The height from this base is equal to the $y$-intercept, 18.  The area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 5\cdot 18=\boxed{45}$. The answer is $\boxed{45}$

To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step.

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we first need to understand the given equation and the conditions that make it equal to zero. The equation is:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$
For this equation to be equal to zero, either one of the two factors must be zero. This gives us two cases:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
For the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies $-10 \leq x + y \leq 10$, $-8 \leq x \leq 8$, and $-8 \leq y \leq 8$. The intersection of these inequalities forms a square with side length 8, so the area of this square is $8^2 = 64$.
For the second case, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies $-10 \leq x - y \leq 10$, $-8 \leq x \leq 8$, and $-8 \leq y \leq 8$. The intersection of these inequalities also forms a square with side length 8, so the area of this square is also $64$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon formed by the points satisfying the given equation is the sum of the areas of the two squares, which is $64 + 64 = 128$. The answer is: $\boxed{128}$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many square units are in the area of the triangle whose vertices are the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the curve $y = (x-3)^2 (x+2)$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we need to find where this curve intersects the $x$ and $y$ axes.  If $y=0$, then $(x-3)^2(x+2)=0$, which has solutions of $x=3$ and $x=-2$.  If $x=0$, then $y=(-3)^2(2)=18$.  So, the curve has two $x$-intercepts and one $y$-intercept.  The length of the base along the $x$-axis is $3-(-2)=5$.  The height from this base is equal to the $y$-intercept, 18.  The area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 5\cdot 18=\boxed{45}$. The answer is $\boxed{45}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The given equation is satisfied if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
From $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
From $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
From $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$, which implies $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
From $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.
The solutions to these equations are the vertices of a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    """Calculate the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points satisfying the given equation."""
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)

The area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{256}$.
