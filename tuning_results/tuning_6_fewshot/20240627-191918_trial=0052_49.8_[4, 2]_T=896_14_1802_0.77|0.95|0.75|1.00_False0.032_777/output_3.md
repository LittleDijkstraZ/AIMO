**Problem:** 
"How many square units are in the area of the triangle whose vertices are the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the curve $y = (x-3)^2 (x+2)$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we need to find where this curve intersects the $x$ and $y$ axes.  If $y=0$, then $(x-3)^2(x+2)=0$, which has solutions of $x=3$ and $x=-2$.  If $x=0$, then $y=(-3)^2(2)=18$.  So, the curve has two $x$-intercepts and one $y$-intercept.  The length of the base along the $x$-axis is $3-(-2)=5$.  The height from this base is equal to the $y$-intercept, 18.  The area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 5\cdot 18=\boxed{45}$. The answer is $\boxed{45}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The given equation is of the form $A \cdot B = 0$, which means that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the points that satisfy this equation are either the set of points that satisfy $A = 0$ or the set of points that satisfy $B = 0$. The equation $A = 0$ gives us the conditions $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$, which represent two pairs of parallel lines, and the equation $B = 0$ gives us the conditions $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$, which also represent two pairs of parallel lines. The intersection of these lines form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

The Python code to calculate the area of the square is:

```python

Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Let $w$ be the width of each of the identical rectangles. Since $PQ=3w$, $RS=2x$ and $PQ=RS$ (because $PQRS$ is a rectangle), then $2x = 3w$, or $$w=\frac{2}{3}x.$$ Therefore, the area of each of the five identical rectangles is $$x\left(\frac{2}{3}x\right)=\frac{2}{3}x^2.$$ Since the area of $PQRS$ is 4000 and it is made up of five of these identical smaller rectangles, then $$5\left(\frac{2}{3}x^2\right)=4000$$ or $$\frac{10}{3}x^2 = 4000$$ or $x^2 = 1200$ or $x \approx 34.6$ which, when rounded off to the nearest integer, is $\boxed{35}.$ The answer is $\boxed{35}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


This problem is a mathematical problem that requires an analytical approach and not a programming one. However, if you still want to write a program to solve it, you can use Python to calculate the area of the polygon. The area of a polygon can be found using various methods, but for this specific problem, it can be found using the shoelace formula.

The shoelace formula states that if the vertices of a polygon are $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), \ldots, (x_n, y_n)$ in clockwise order, then the area of the polygon is given by:

$$\frac{1}{2} \left| \sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i) \right|,$$

where $x_{n+1} = x_1$ and $y_{n+1} = y_1$.

To apply the shoelace formula to this problem, we need to find the vertices of the polygon formed by the points that satisfy the given equation. The vertices will be the points where the equation equals zero, which means either $|x + y| - 10 = 0$, $|x - y| - 10 = 0$, $|x| - 8 = 0$, or $|y| - 8 = 0$.

By solving these equations, we find the vertices to be:

- $(8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, $(-8, 0)$, and $(0, -8)$ from $|x| - 8 = 0$.
- $(0, 10)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(0, -10)$, and $(10, 0)$ from $|x + y| - 10 = 0$.
- $(10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, $(-10, 0)$, and $(0, -10)$ from $|x - y| - 10 = 0$.

So the vertices of the polygon are $(8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, $(-8, 0)$, $(0, -8)$, $(0, 10)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(0, -10)$, and $(10, 0)$.

We can now apply the shoelace formula to find the area of the polygon:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def shoelace_formula(vertices):
    n = len(vertices)
    area = 0
    for i in range(n):
        area += vertices[i][0] * vertices[(i + 1) % n][1] - vertices[i][1] * vertices[(i + 1) % n][0]
    return abs(area / 2)

vertices = [(8, 0), (0, 8), (-8, 0), (0, -8), (0, 10), (-10, 0), (0, -10), (10, 0)]
area = shoelace_formula(vertices)
print(area)
```

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The equation is satisfied if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This means that either $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The first two equations represent a square with side length 20 centered at the origin, and the last two equations represent a square with side length 16 centered at the origin.
The intersection of these squares is a square with side length 8 centered at the origin.
The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$.
So the area of the convex polygon is 64.
The answer is: 64

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


This problem seems to be a bit complicated, and it might be more efficient to solve it manually rather than using code. However, if you want to solve it using code, you can set up the following conditions:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$: This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$: This implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon:

- $(\pm 8, 0)$, $(0, \pm 8)$, $(\pm 10, \pm 0)$, $(\pm 0, \pm 10)$.

The polygon is a square with side length $16$, so its area is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


This problem is a bit complicated to solve directly, but we can simplify it by understanding the properties of absolute value and zero products.

First, let's consider the equation $AB=0$. This equation is true if and only if $A=0$ or $B=0$. So, we can break down the given equation into two separate cases:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first case, $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ are on a square with side length 10.

For the second case, $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ are on a square with side length 16.

The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for. The side length of this polygon is the smaller of the two squares, which is 10. The area of a square is given by the square of its side length, so the area of the convex polygon is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 100.

Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Let $w$ be the width of each of the identical rectangles. Since $PQ=3w$, $RS=2x$ and $PQ=RS$ (because $PQRS$ is a rectangle), then $2x = 3w$, or $$w=\frac{2}{3}x.$$ Therefore, the area of each of the five identical rectangles is $$x\left(\frac{2}{3}x\right)=\frac{2}{3}x^2.$$ Since the area of $PQRS$ is 4000 and it is made up of five of these identical smaller rectangles, then $$5\left(\frac{2}{3}x^2\right)=4000$$ or $$\frac{10}{3}x^2 = 4000$$ or $x^2 = 1200$ or $x \approx 34.6$ which, when rounded off to the nearest integer, is $\boxed{35}.$ The answer is $\boxed{35}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


The problem is asking for the area of a polygon enclosed by the points that satisfy the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. 

First, let's analyze the equation. The product of two terms is zero if and only if at least one of the terms is zero. So, we have two cases to consider:
1. $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$
2. $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$

For the first case, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these equations are all the points $(x, y)$ that lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$. These lines intersect at the point $(5, 5)$.

For the second case, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are all the points $(x, y)$ that lie on the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$. These lines intersect at the point $(8, 8)$.

So, the points that satisfy the equation are the points $(5, 5)$ and $(8, 8)$. These two points form a line segment, which is the convex polygon we are looking for. The length of the line segment is the distance between the points $(5, 5)$ and $(8, 8)$, which can be found using the distance formula: $\sqrt{(8 - 5)^2 + (8 - 5)^2} = \sqrt{9 + 9} = \sqrt{18} = 3\sqrt{2}$. The height of the polygon is also $3\sqrt{2}$, so the area of the polygon is $\frac{1}{2} \times (\text{base}) \times (\text{height}) = \frac{1}{2} \times 3\sqrt{2} \times 3\sqrt{2} = 18$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 18. The answer is: $18$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"An ellipse is defined parametrically by
\[(x,y) = \left( \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t}, \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t} \right).\]Then the equation of the ellipse can be written in the form
\[Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0,\]where $A,$ $B,$ $C,$ $D,$ $E,$ and $F$ are integers, and $\gcd(|A|,|B|,|C|,|D|,|E|,|F|) = 1.$  Find $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F|.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
In the equation $y = \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\cos t$ to get
\[\cos t = \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3}.\]In the equation $x = \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\sin t$ to get
\[\sin t = \frac{1}{2} x (2 - \cos t) + 1 = \frac{1}{2} x \left( 2 - \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right) + 1 = 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)}.\]Since $\cos^2 t + \sin^2 t = 1,$
\[\left( \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right)^2 + \left( 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)} \right)^2 = 1.\]Multiplying both sides by $(2(y + 3))^2$ and expanding, it will simplify to
\[81x^2 - 36xy + 16y^2 - 108x + 240y + 900 = 0.\]Therefore, $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F| = 81 + 36 + 16 + 108 + 240 + 900 = \boxed{1381}.$ The answer is $\boxed{1381}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The given equation is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The solutions of $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ are the points on the line $x + y = 10$.
The solutions of $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ are the points on the line $x - y = 10$.
The solutions of $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ are the points on the line $x = 8$.
The solutions of $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ are the points on the line $y = 8$.
So the points that satisfy the equation are the points that lie on any of these four lines.
The four lines form a rectangle with sides of length 16 and 20.
The area of the rectangle is $16 \times 20 = 320$.
The answer is $\boxed{320}$.

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so one of the terms must be zero. This gives us two separate cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, or $x - y = -10$.

For the second case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, or $y = -8$.

The intersection points of these lines are the vertices of the polygon. By drawing these lines on a graph, we can see that the polygon is a square with side length 16.

The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So the area of the convex polygon is 256.
The answer is: $\boxed{256}$.
