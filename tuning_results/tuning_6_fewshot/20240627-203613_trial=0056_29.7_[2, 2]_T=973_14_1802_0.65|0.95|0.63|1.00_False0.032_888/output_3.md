**Problem:** 
"An ellipse is defined parametrically by
\[(x,y) = \left( \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t}, \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t} \right).\]Then the equation of the ellipse can be written in the form
\[Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0,\]where $A,$ $B,$ $C,$ $D,$ $E,$ and $F$ are integers, and $\gcd(|A|,|B|,|C|,|D|,|E|,|F|) = 1.$  Find $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F|.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
In the equation $y = \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\cos t$ to get
\[\cos t = \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3}.\]In the equation $x = \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\sin t$ to get
\[\sin t = \frac{1}{2} x (2 - \cos t) + 1 = \frac{1}{2} x \left( 2 - \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right) + 1 = 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)}.\]Since $\cos^2 t + \sin^2 t = 1,$
\[\left( \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right)^2 + \left( 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)} \right)^2 = 1.\]Multiplying both sides by $(2(y + 3))^2$ and expanding, it will simplify to
\[81x^2 - 36xy + 16y^2 - 108x + 240y + 900 = 0.\]Therefore, $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F| = 81 + 36 + 16 + 108 + 240 + 900 = \boxed{1381}.$ The answer is $\boxed{1381}$

"Let $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_ 2= (-16,2).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that
\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as

The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

**Solution:** 


The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. 

Let's consider the first expression:
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0.\]
The square of a real number is zero if and only if the number itself is zero. Therefore, we have:
\[\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad \vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0.\]
This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these absolute value equations are:
\[x + y = \pm 10 \quad \text{and} \quad x - y = \pm 10.\]
These four equations represent the sides of a square.

Now let's consider the second expression:
\[((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]
Again, the square of a real number is zero if and only if the number itself is zero. Therefore, we have:
\[\vert x \vert - 8 = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad \vert y \vert - 8 = 0.\]
This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these absolute value equations are:
\[x = \pm 8 \quad \text{and} \quad y = \pm 8.\]
These four equations represent the sides of a square.

The overall solution set is the intersection of the solutions to the two expressions. This means that the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the given equation are the points that lie on the intersection of the two squares. The intersection of the two squares is a smaller square. The side length of this smaller square is the difference between the side length of the larger square and the side length of the smaller square.

The side length of the larger square is 10 (from $\vert x + y \vert = 10$), and the side length of the smaller square is 8 (from $\vert x \vert = 8$). Therefore, the side length of the smaller square is $10 - 8 = 2$.

The area of a square is given by the square of the side length. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $2^2 = 4$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 4. The answer is: $4$

[/asy]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Let $w$ be the width of each of the identical rectangles. Since $PQ=3w$, $RS=2x$ and $PQ=RS$ (because $PQRS$ is a rectangle), then $2x = 3w$, or $$w=\frac{2}{3}x.$$ Therefore, the area of each of the five identical rectangles is $$x\left(\frac{2}{3}x\right)=\frac{2}{3}x^2.$$ Since the area of $PQRS$ is 4000 and it is made up of five of these identical smaller rectangles, then $$5\left(\frac{2}{3}x^2\right)=4000$$ or $$\frac{10}{3}x^2 = 4000$$ or $x^2 = 1200$ or $x \approx 34.6$ which, when rounded off to the nearest integer, is $\boxed{35}.$ The answer is $\boxed{35}$

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we first need to understand the given equation and the conditions it imposes on the points $(x, y)$. The equation is 
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$
The product of two factors is zero if and only if at least one of the factors is zero. Therefore, the equation is satisfied if either of the following two conditions is met:
1. $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$
2. $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$
For the first condition to be true, both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. These lines form a square with side length 20.
For the second condition to be true, both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. These lines form a square with side length 16.
The intersection of the two squares is the convex polygon that encloses the points $(x, y)$ satisfying the given equation. The area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares, which is $20^2 + 16^2 = 400 + 256 = 656$. The answer is $\boxed{656}$.

Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Let $w$ be the width of each of the identical rectangles. Since $PQ=3w$, $RS=2x$ and $PQ=RS$ (because $PQRS$ is a rectangle), then $2x = 3w$, or $$w=\frac{2}{3}x.$$ Therefore, the area of each of the five identical rectangles is $$x\left(\frac{2}{3}x\right)=\frac{2}{3}x^2.$$ Since the area of $PQRS$ is 4000 and it is made up of five of these identical smaller rectangles, then $$5\left(\frac{2}{3}x^2\right)=4000$$ or $$\frac{10}{3}x^2 = 4000$$ or $x^2 = 1200$ or $x \approx 34.6$ which, when rounded off to the nearest integer, is $\boxed{35}.$ The answer is $\boxed{35}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


The area of the convex polygon can be found by counting the number of lattice points (points with integer coordinates) inside the polygon and using Pick's theorem. Pick's theorem states that the area of a polygon with vertices at lattice points is $I + \frac{B}{2} - 1$, where $I$ is the number of lattice points inside the polygon and $B$ is the number of lattice points on the boundary of the polygon.

First, we need to find the vertices of the polygon. The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if either of the two factors is zero. Therefore, we have four cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 \neq 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 \neq 0$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 \neq 0$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 \neq 0$.

For each case, we can find the vertices of the polygon by solving the equations. After finding the vertices, we can count the number of lattice points inside the polygon and on its boundary using Pick's theorem.

The area of the polygon is then $I + \frac{B}{2} - 1$.

```

The error in the code is due to the use of `solveset` with the domain `S.Integers`. The `solveset` function in sympy is used to find the solutions of an equation or a system of equations in one or more variables. However, it does not support the domain `S.Integers` for multivariate equations.

To find the vertices of the polygon, we can solve each case separately.

For case 1, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which gives us two equations: $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$. Similarly, for case 2, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which gives us two equations: $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$. For case 3, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$, which gives us two equations: $x = 8$ and $x = -8$. And for case 4, we have $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us two equations: $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

Solving these equations, we find the vertices of the polygon:

- For case 1: $(x, y) = \{(10 - y, y) \mid -10 \leq y \leq 10\}$, which gives us the vertices $(0, 10), (10, 0), (0, -10), (-10, 0)$.
- For case 2: $(x, y) = \{(x, 10 - x) \mid -10 \leq x \leq 10\}$, which gives us the vertices $(10, 0), (0, 10), (-10, 0), (0, -10)$.
- For case 3: $(x, y) = \{(8, y) \mid -8 \leq y \leq 8\}$, which gives us the vertices $(8, 8), (8, -8)$.
- For case 4: $(x, y) = \{(x, 8) \mid -8 \leq x \leq 8\}$, which gives us the vertices $(8, 8), (-8, 8)$.

Combining all vertices, we get the vertices of the polygon: $(8, 8), (8, -8), (0, 10), (10, 0), (0, -10), (-10, 0)$.

Now, we can count the number of lattice points inside the polygon and on its boundary using Pick's theorem. The number of lattice points inside the polygon is 24, and the number of lattice points on the boundary of the polygon is 12.

Finally, using Pick's theorem, the area of the polygon is $I + \frac{B}{2} - 1 = 24 + \frac{12}{2} - 1 = 24 + 6 - 1 = 29$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 29.
The answer is: 29

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many square units are in the area of the triangle whose vertices are the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the curve $y = (x-3)^2 (x+2)$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we need to find where this curve intersects the $x$ and $y$ axes.  If $y=0$, then $(x-3)^2(x+2)=0$, which has solutions of $x=3$ and $x=-2$.  If $x=0$, then $y=(-3)^2(2)=18$.  So, the curve has two $x$-intercepts and one $y$-intercept.  The length of the base along the $x$-axis is $3-(-2)=5$.  The height from this base is equal to the $y$-intercept, 18.  The area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 5\cdot 18=\boxed{45}$. The answer is $\boxed{45}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The first equation is satisfied if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x = 0$ and $y = 0$.
The second equation is satisfied if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $-8 \leq x \leq 8$ and $-8 \leq y \leq 8$.
Therefore, the points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying the equation are those in the square with vertices at $\left(8, 8\right)$, $\left(8, -8\right)$, $\left(-8, -8\right)$, and $\left(-8, 8\right)$.
The side length of this square is $16$, so its area is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_ 2= (-16,2).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that
\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as
\[\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1.\]Find $h + k + a + b.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This can only happen if $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

Similarly, the expression $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 10 (the distance between the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$, or equivalently the distance between the lines $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$). The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is $\boxed{100}$.

**Problem:** 
"Five identical rectangles are arranged to form a larger rectangle $PQRS$, as shown.  The area of $PQRS$ is $4000$.  What is the length, $x$, rounded off to the nearest integer? [asy]

draw(left--right);
label("$x$", (x/2, -0.1), S);

[/asy]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Let $w$ be the width of each of the identical rectangles. Since $PQ=3w$, $RS=2x$ and $PQ=RS$ (because $PQRS$ is a rectangle), then $2x = 3w$, or $$w=\frac{2}{3}x.$$ Therefore, the area of each of the five identical rectangles is $$x\left(\frac{2}{3}x\right)=\frac{2}{3}x^2.$$ Since the area of $PQRS$ is 4000 and it is made up of five of these identical smaller rectangles, then $$5\left(\frac{2}{3}x^2\right)=4000$$ or $$\frac{10}{3}x^2 = 4000$$ or $x^2 = 1200$ or $x \approx 34.6$ which, when rounded off to the nearest integer, is $\boxed{35}.$ The answer is $\boxed{35}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


This problem is a challenge in understanding the properties of absolute values and how they relate to the geometry of the problem. The equation given is a product of two terms equal to zero, which means that either of the terms must be zero. This gives us four cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
4. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

In case 1, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $-10 \leq x + y \leq 10$, $-8 \leq x \leq 8$, and $-8 \leq y \leq 8$. This forms a square with side length 16.

In case 2, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on a line with slope 1 or -1 passing through the point $(0, 0)$.

In case 3, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $-8 \leq x \leq 8$ and $-8 \leq y \leq 8$. This forms a square with side length 16.

In case 4, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on a line with slope 1 or -1 passing through the point $(0, 0)$.

The only case that gives a non-empty intersection is case 1, which forms a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$
