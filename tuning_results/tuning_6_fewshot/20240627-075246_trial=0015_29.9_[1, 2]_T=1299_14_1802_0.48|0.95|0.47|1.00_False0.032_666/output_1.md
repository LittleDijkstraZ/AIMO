**Problem:** 
"What is the minimum value of the expression $2x^2+3y^2+8x-24y+62$ for real $x$ and $y$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Rearranging the expression, we have  \[2x^2+8x+3y^2-24y+62\]We first complete the square in $x$. Factoring a 2 from the first two terms of the expression, we get  \[2(x^2+4x)+3y^2-24y+62\]In order for the expression inside the parenthesis to be a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(4/2)^2=4$ inside the parenthesis. Doing this, we have \[2(x^2+4x+4-4)+3y^2-24y+62 \Rightarrow 2(x+2)^2+3y^2-24y+54\]Now we complete the square in $y$. Factoring a 3 from the $y$ terms in the expression, we get \[2(x+2)^2+3(y^2-8y)+54\]In order for the expression inside the second parenthesis to be a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(8/2)^2=16$ inside the parenthesis. Doing this, we have \[2(x+2)^2+3(y^2-8y+16-16)+54 \Rightarrow 2(x+2)^2+3(y-4)^2+6\]Since the minimum value of $2(x+2)^2$ and $3(y-4)^2$ is $0$ (perfect squares can never be negative), the minimum value of the entire expression is $\boxed{6}$, and is achieved when $x=-2$ and $y=4$. The answer is $\boxed{6}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
**Problem**
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


To solve this problem, we first need to express $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ in a form that allows us to find its minimum value. We can rewrite the expression as follows:
\[5x^2+5y^2-8xy = \frac{1}{2}((x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2)\]
Now, we are given the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. This condition implies that $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2 = 40^2 = 1600$.

Substituting this into the expression we want to minimize, we get:
\[5x^2+5y^2-8xy = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 1600 = 800\]

So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 800.

    return 800

result = min_value()
print(result)

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solve

def minimum_value():
    # Define the variables
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # Given expression
    expr = 5*x**2 + 5*y**2 - 8*x*y

    # Given equation
    eq = abs(x - 2*y) + abs(y - 2*x) - 40

    # Solve the equation for y
    y_sol = solve(eq, y)[0]

    # Substitute y in the expression
    expr = expr.subs(y, y_sol)

    # Find the derivative of the expression
    expr_diff = expr.diff(x)

    # Solve the derivative equal to zero to find the minimum
    x_sol = solve(expr_diff, x)[0]

    # Substitute x in the expression to find the minimum value
    min_value = expr.subs(x, x_sol)

    return min_value

result = minimum_value()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 800

The minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $\boxed{800}$. The answer is $\boxed{800}$.
