**Problem:** 
"Let \[f(x) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
-x + 3 & \text{if } x \le 0, \\
2x - 5 & \text{if } x > 0.
\end{array}
\right.\]How many solutions does the equation $f(f(x)) = 4$ have?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
To solve the equation $f(f(x)) = 4,$ we first find the values $x$ such that $f(x) = 4.$

Either $f(x) = -x + 3$ (for $x \le 0$) or $f(x) = 2x - 5$ (for $x > 0$). If $-x + 3 = 4,$ then $x = -1.$ Note that this value satisfies $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = 4,$ then $x = 9/2.$ Note that this value satisfies $x > 0.$ Therefore, the solutions to $f(x) = 4$ are $x = -1$ and $x = 9/2.$

Next, we solve for the values $x$ such that $f(x) = -1.$ If $-x + 3 = -1,$ then $x = 4.$ This value does not satisfy $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = -1,$ then $x = 2.$ This value satisfies $x > 0.$

Finally, we solve for the values $x$ such that $f(x) = 9/2.$ If $-x + 3 = 9/2,$ then $x = -3/2.$ This value satisfies $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = 9/2,$ then $x = 19/4.$ This value satisfies $x > 0.$

Therefore, the equation $f(f(x)) = 4$ has the solutions $x = 2,$ $-3/2,$ and $19/4,$ for a total of $\boxed{3}$ solutions. The answer is $\boxed{3}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if the number $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 1 and 2. This is because the function $| |x - 1| - 2 |$ has a graph that consists of two 'V's, each with a width of 1 unit, one above the x-axis and one below. The number of distinct solutions to the equation is equal to the number of times these 'V's intersect the line $y = \frac{m}{100}$. Since the 'V's are 1 unit apart, the line $y = \frac{m}{100}$ must be strictly between the two 'V's to intersect the graph four times. This means that $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, or equivalently, $100 < m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from 101 to 199, inclusive. The number of such integers is $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 99. The answer is: $\boxed{99}$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many solutions does the equation \[\frac{(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)\dotsm(x-100)}{(x-1^2)(x-2^2)(x-3^2)\dotsm(x-100^2)} = 0\]have for $x$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Any solution to this equation must make the numerator of the left-hand side zero, while keeping the denominator non-zero. The numerator is zero when $x$ is one of the numbers $1, 2, 3, \dots, 100.$ However, for any value in this list that is a perfect square, the denominator will also be zero, so that value of $x$ will not be a root. Therefore, we want to find the number of integers in the list $1, 2, \dots, 100$ which are not perfect squares. The perfect squares in the list are $1^2, 2^2, \dots, 10^2,$ so there are $10$ perfect squares, and \[100 - 10 = \boxed{90}\]integers which are not perfect squares. The answer is $\boxed{90}$

**Problem:** 
"How many integers are solutions to the equation $$(x-2)^{(25-x^2)}=1?$$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
We need some basic facts from number theory: $a^0 = 1$ for any $a,$ $1^b = 1$ for any $b,$ and $(-1)^c = 1$ if $c$ is an even integer. Unless the base is a complex number (which is excluded since we are looking for integer solutions), there are no other ways to get an RHS of $1.$ Thus, either the exponent is zero $($giving the equation $25 - x^2 = 0),$ the base is $1$ $($giving $x -2 = 1),$ or the base is $-1$ and the exponent is even $($giving the simultaneous equations $x - 2 = -1$ and $25 - x^2 = 2n$ for some integer $n).$ Solving the first equation gives $x = \pm 5,$ and solving the second gives $x = 3.$ The third equation implies that $x = 1,$ in which case $25 - x^2 = 24$ is indeed even, so $x = 1$ is a valid solution. In all, there are $\boxed{4}$ integer solutions. The answer is $\boxed{4}$

**Solution:** 



The problem involves the absolute value function and the equation with four distinct solutions. Sympy does not have an out-of-the-box function to directly solve this problem. However, we can solve this problem by using some mathematical insights.

First, let's solve the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] for $m$ values that result in four distinct solutions. 

1. We know that the absolute value function $|x|$ is a piecewise function defined as $x$ if $x \geq 0$ and $-x$ if $x < 0$. Therefore, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be broken down into two cases:

   Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$.

   Case 2: $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = \frac{m}{100}$.

2. Now, we need to solve these two cases separately:

   Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$. Adding $2$ to both sides gives $\vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100} + 2$. This equation has two sub-cases:

      Case 1.1: $x-1 = \frac{m}{100} + 2$. Solving for $x$ gives $x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$.

      Case 1.2: $-(x-1) = \frac{m}{100} + 2$. Solving for $x$ gives $x = 1 - \frac{m}{100} - 2 = - \frac{m}{100} - 1$.

   Case 2: $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = \frac{m}{100}$. Adding $-\frac{m}{100}$ to both sides gives $-\vert x-1 \vert = - \frac{m}{100} + 2$. Multiplying through by $-1$ gives $\vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100} - 2$. This equation also has two sub-cases:

      Case 2.1: $x-1 = \frac{m}{100} - 2$. Solving for $x$ gives $x = \frac{m}{100} - 1$.

      Case 2.2: $-(x-1) = \frac{m}{100} - 2$. Solving for $x$ gives $x = 1 - \frac{m}{100} + 2 = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.

3. Now, we need to find the values of $m$ for which these four equations result in four distinct solutions. 

4. By analyzing these four equations, we can see that for $m = 200$, the solutions of Case 1.1 and Case 2.1 are the same, and for $m = 50$, the solutions of Case 1.2 and Case 2.2 are the same. Therefore, the only value of $m$ that results in four distinct solutions is $m = 200$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has $4$ distinct solutions is $1$.

The answer is: $1$

**Solution:** 


The problem asks us to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

To solve this problem, we can use the property of absolute value function that if $f(x) = |g(x)|$, then the equation $f(x) = k$ has the same number of solutions as the equation $g(x) = k$ or $g(x) = -k$.

So, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is equivalent to the following two equations:
1. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, and
2. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.

Solving these two equations gives us the values of $x$ that satisfy the original equation. The number of distinct solutions for each $m$ is then determined by counting the number of solutions for each $m$.

The number of solutions to these equations will be equal to the number of times that $\frac{m}{100}$ or $-\frac{m}{100}$ crosses the graph of $y = |x - 1| - 2$. This will occur whenever $\frac{m}{100}$ or $-\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to the minimum or maximum of $|x - 1| - 2$.

The minimum of $|x - 1| - 2$ is $-2$, and the maximum is $1$. Thus, for the first equation to have solutions, we need $0 \leq \frac{m}{100} \leq 1$, which gives $0 \leq m \leq 100$. Similarly, for the second equation to have solutions, we need $-1 \leq -\frac{m}{100} \leq 0$, which gives $0 \leq m \leq 100$. So, $m$ can be any integer from $0$ to $100$.

The number of positive integers from $0$ to $100$ is $101$. However, we need to subtract $1$ because $m$ cannot be $0$. So, there are $100$ possible values of $m$.

To find the number of values of $m$ for which the original equation has $4$ distinct solutions, we need to count the number of values of $m$ for which the graph of $y = |x - 1| - 2$ crosses the graph of $y = \frac{m}{100}$ or $y = -\frac{m}{100}$ exactly $4$ times.

This is a difficult problem to solve analytically, so we will resort to numerical methods. We can use a loop to check each value of $m$ from $1$ to $100$ and count the number of distinct solutions for each $m$. If the count is $4$, we add $1$ to our counter.

The following Python code implements this approach:

```python

def count_values_of_m():
    counter = 0
    for m in range(1, 101):
        # Solve the equations for each m
        num_solutions = 0
        for x in range(-1000, 1000):
            if abs(x - 1) - 2 == m / 100 or abs(x - 1) - 2 == -m / 100:
                num_solutions += 1
        # If the number of solutions is 4, add 1 to the counter
        if num_solutions == 4:
            counter += 1
    return counter

result = count_values_of_m()

The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $1$. Therefore, the answer is $1$. However, this contradicts our assumption that $m$ cannot be $0$. So, we must have made a mistake in our calculation. Let's retrace our steps and see where we went wrong.

Upon closer inspection, we realized that our code was incorrect because it only checked for solutions when $m$ was positive. However, we also need to check for solutions when $m$ is negative. We can easily modify our code to do this.

Here's the correct code:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def count_values_of_m():
    counter = 0
    for m in range(-100, 101):
        # Solve the equations for each m
        num_solutions = 0
        for x in range(-1000, 1000):
            if abs(x - 1) - 2 == m / 100 or abs(x - 1) - 2 == -m / 100:
                num_solutions += 1
        # If the number of solutions is 4, add 1 to the counter
        if num_solutions == 4:
            counter += 1
    return counter

result = count_values_of_m()
print(result)

The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $2$. However, this still contradicts our assumption that $m$ cannot be $0$. So, we must have made another mistake in our calculation.

Upon further inspection, we realized that we misunderstood the problem. The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions, not for the number of values of $m$ that make the equation true. We made an error in interpreting the problem.

The correct interpretation of the problem is: for how many positive integers $m$ does the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have $4$ distinct solutions?

To solve this problem, we need to find the values of $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions. We can do this by analyzing the graph of $y = |x - 1| - 2$ and the graphs of $y = \frac{m}{100}$ and $y = -\frac{m}{100}$.

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $2$. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a graph that is a series of "steps" of height $1$ unit. So for $\frac{m}{100}$ to have $4$ distinct solutions, it must be that $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. This implies $100 < m < 200$. The number of positive integers $m$ in this range is $200 - 100 - 1 = 99$. Therefore, the value of $m$ is $99$.

Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
If $|x-7| = |x+1|$, then either $x-7 = x+1$ or $x-7 = -(x+1)$.  Simplifying $x-7=x+1$ gives $0=8$, which has no solutions, so no values of $x$ satisfy $x-7 = x+1$.  If $x-7 = -(x+1)$, then $x-7 = -x-1$, so $2x = 6$, which gives $x=3$.  So, there is $\boxed{1}$ solution.

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

First, we need to find the range of $m$ for which the right-hand side of the equation is between $0$ and $2$. This is because the absolute value function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ varies between $0$ and $2$. We can set up the following inequalities:

\[0 \leq \frac{m}{100} \leq 2.\]

Multiplying all sides of the inequalities by $100$, we get

\[0 \leq m \leq 200.\]

Now, we need to find the number of integer values of $m$ in this range for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

We can start by noting that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have $4$ distinct solutions if and only if the right-hand side is strictly greater than $1$ (so that the absolute value function can vary between $1$ and $3$). This gives us the inequality

\[1 < \frac{m}{100} \leq 2.\]

Multiplying all sides of the inequalities by $100$, we get

\[100 < m \leq 200.\]

The positive integers $m$ in this range are the integers from $101$ to $200$, inclusive. To find the number of these integers, we can subtract the smallest integer in the range from the largest integer in the range and then add $1$ (because both ends of the range are inclusive). This gives us the number of integers

\[200 - 101 + 1 = 99.\]

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $99$.
The answer is: $1$
