**Problem:** 
"How many distinct solutions are there to the equation $|x-7| = |x+1|$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
If $|x-7| = |x+1|$, then either $x-7 = x+1$ or $x-7 = -(x+1)$.  Simplifying $x-7=x+1$ gives $0=8$, which has no solutions, so no values of $x$ satisfy $x-7 = x+1$.  If $x-7 = -(x+1)$, then $x-7 = -x-1$, so $2x = 6$, which gives $x=3$.  So, there is $\boxed{1}$ solution.

Challenge: See if you can find a quick solution to this problem by simply thinking about the graphs of $y=|x-7|$ and $y=|x+1|$. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



To solve this problem, we need to find the value of $m$ such that the equation $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. 

First, let's consider the equation $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$. This equation is equivalent to the following two equations: $|x-1| - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $|x-1| - 2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.

For each of these equations, we can solve for $|x-1|$ and then for $x$.

For $|x-1| - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$, we have $|x-1| = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two equations: $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x-1 = -(2 + \frac{m}{100})$. Solving these equations gives us two solutions: $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

For $|x-1| - 2 = -\frac{m}{100}$, we have $|x-1| = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two equations: $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x-1 = -(2 - \frac{m}{100})$. Solving these equations gives us two solutions: $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

So, the four distinct solutions are $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$, $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$, and $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

For these four solutions to be distinct, the expressions $\frac{m}{100}$ and $-\frac{m}{100}$ must be different from 1 and 3. This implies that $m$ cannot be 100 or 300. 

Also, for the solutions to be real, the expressions $3 \pm \frac{m}{100}$ and $-1 \pm \frac{m}{100}$ must be non-negative. This implies that $\frac{m}{100}$ must be less than or equal to 3 and greater than or equal to 1. Therefore, $100 \leq m \leq 300$.

The only value of $m$ in this range that does not violate any of the conditions is $m = 200$. 

So, the value of $m$ for which the equation $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is $m = 200$. The answer is: $200$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many integers are solutions to the equation $$(x-2)^{(25-x^2)}=1?$$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
We need some basic facts from number theory: $a^0 = 1$ for any $a,$ $1^b = 1$ for any $b,$ and $(-1)^c = 1$ if $c$ is an even integer. Unless the base is a complex number (which is excluded since we are looking for integer solutions), there are no other ways to get an RHS of $1.$ Thus, either the exponent is zero $($giving the equation $25 - x^2 = 0),$ the base is $1$ $($giving $x -2 = 1),$ or the base is $-1$ and the exponent is even $($giving the simultaneous equations $x - 2 = -1$ and $25 - x^2 = 2n$ for some integer $n).$ Solving the first equation gives $x = \pm 5,$ and solving the second gives $x = 3.$ The third equation implies that $x = 1,$ in which case $25 - x^2 = 24$ is indeed even, so $x = 1$ is a valid solution. In all, there are $\boxed{4}$ integer solutions. The answer is $\boxed{4}$

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $2$. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a graph that is a series of "steps" of height $1$ unit, so for the equation to have $4$ solutions, the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be strictly between $1$ and $2$.

So we have $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Multiplying all sides of the inequalities by $100$ gives $100 < m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from $101$ to $199$, inclusive. To find the number of these integers, we subtract the smallest integer from the largest and add $1$: $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$.

So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $99$.

```python

def count_m():
    """For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"""

The numerator is zero when $x$ is one of the numbers $1, 2, 3, \dots, 100.$ However, for any value in this list that is a perfect square, the denominator will also be zero, so that value of $x$ will not be a root. Therefore, we want to find the number of integers in the list $1, 2, \dots, 100$ which are not perfect squares. The perfect squares in the list are $1^2, 2^2, \dots, 10^2,$ so there are $10$ perfect squares, and \[100 - 10 = \boxed{90}\]integers which are not perfect squares. The answer is $\boxed{90}$

**Solution:** 



The problem asks for how many positive integers $m$ the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. 

To solve this problem, we can use the fact that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $0$ and $2$. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a graph that is a series of "V"s, with the $x$-axis intercepts occurring at $x = 1 \pm 2$, and the maximum value of the function being $2$. 

So we need to find the values of $m$ such that $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Multiplying all sides of the inequalities by $100$ gives $0 < m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ in this range are $1, 2, \dots, 199$, so there are $199$ such integers.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $199$.

The answer is: $199$

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is a positive number less than $2$. This is because the expression on the left side of the equation is a "V" shape with a maximum value of $2$ and a minimum value of $0$. Therefore, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be a number in the interval $(0, 2)$. The only positive integer $m$ in this interval is $100$. Therefore, there is only $1$ positive integer $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions. The answer is: $1$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many distinct solutions are there to the equation $|x-7| = |x+1|$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
If $|x-7| = |x+1|$, then either $x-7 = x+1$ or $x-7 = -(x+1)$.  Simplifying $x-7=x+1$ gives $0=8$, which has no solutions, so no values of $x$ satisfy $x-7 = x+1$.  If $x-7 = -(x+1)$, then $x-7 = -x-1$, so $2x = 6$, which gives $x=3$.  So, there is $\boxed{1}$ solution.

Challenge: See if you can find a quick solution to this problem by simply thinking about the graphs of $y=|x-7|$ and $y=|x+1|$. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solve, Eq, Abs

def find_m():
    # Define the variable
    x = symbols('x')

    # Define the equation
    equation = Eq(Abs(Abs(x - 1) - 2), m / 100)

    # Initialize the count of distinct solutions
    count = 0

    # Loop over possible values of m
    for m in range(1, 101):
        # Solve the equation for each value of m
        solutions = solve(equation.subs(m, m), x)
        # Count the number of distinct solutions
        count = len(set(solutions))
        # If the count is 4, return the value of m
        if count == 4:
            return m

# Call the function and print the result
result = find_m()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS Traceback: line 12, in find_m
    equation = Eq(Abs(Abs(x - 1) - 2), m / 100)
UnboundLocalError: local variable 'm' referenced before assignment

```

The above code is not working because we are trying to use a value of m before it is assigned. Let's correct this and try again.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solve, Eq, Abs

def find_m():
    # Define the variable
    x, m = symbols('x m')

    # Define the equation
    equation = Eq(Abs(Abs(x - 1) - 2), m / 100)

    # Initialize the count of distinct solutions
    count = 0

    # Loop over possible values of m
    for m in range(1, 101):
        # Solve the equation for each value of m
        solutions = solve(equation.subs(m, m), x)
        # Count the number of distinct solutions
        count = len(set(solutions))
        # If the count is 4, return the value of m
        if count == 4:
            return m

# Call the function and print the result
result = find_m()
print(result)

The value of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $1$. However, this does not seem correct. Let's try a different approach.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions when the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, is equal to $1$. This is because the absolute value function "flattens" the graph, so the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=1$ will have $4$ distinct solutions. Therefore, we need to solve the equation $1=\frac{m}{100}$ for $m$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solve

def find_m():
    # Define the variable
    m = symbols('m')

    # Define the equation
    equation = Eq(1, m / 100)

    # Solve the equation for m
    solution = solve(equation, m)[0]

    return solution

result = find_m()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 100

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
100
```
The value of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $100$. This seems correct, as when $m=100$, the right side of the equation is $1$, and the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=1$ does indeed have $4$ distinct solutions. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{100}$.

The value of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $100$.
The answer is: $100$
