Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation has four distinct solutions, which implies that the right hand side $\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal to $2$ (which gives three solutions) or $1$ (which gives four solutions).

So we need to solve the equation $\frac{m}{100} = 1$ for $m$. Multiply both sides by $100$ to get $m = 100$.

We can use Python to check if this value of $m$ gives four distinct solutions to the equation.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve, Abs

def find_m():
    x = symbols('x')
    m = 100

    # Set up the equation
    equation = Eq(Abs(Abs(x - 1) - 2), m/100)

    # Find the solutions
    solutions = solve(equation, x)

    # Check if there are four distinct solutions
    if len(set(solutions)) == 4:
        return m

result = find_m()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 100

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
100
```
The value of $m$ that gives four distinct solutions to the equation is $100$. So the number of positive integers $m$ is $1$. The answer is: $1$

1_
**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many solutions does the equation \[\frac{(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)\dotsm(x-100)}{(x-1^2)(x-2^2)(x-3^2)\dotsm(x-100^2)} = 0\]have for $x$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Any solution to this equation must make the numerator of the left-hand side zero, while keeping the denominator non-zero. The numerator is zero when $x$ is one of the numbers $1, 2, 3, \dots, 100.$ However, for any value in this list that is a perfect square, the denominator will also be zero, so that value of $x$ will not be a root. Therefore, we want to find the number of integers in the list $1, 2, \dots, 100$ which are not perfect squares. The perfect squares in the list are $1^2, 2^2, \dots, 10^2,$ so there are $10$ perfect squares, and \[100 - 10 = \boxed{90}\]integers which are not perfect squares. The answer is $\boxed{90}$

**Solution:**


The number of distinct solutions to the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] is equal to $4$ if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $2$. Therefore, $m=200$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let \[f(x) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
-x + 3 & \text{if } x \le 0, \\
2x - 5 & \text{if } x > 0.
\end{array}
\right.\]How many solutions does the equation $f(f(x)) = 4$ have?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
To solve the equation $f(f(x)) = 4,$ we first find the values $x$ such that $f(x) = 4.$

Either $f(x) = -x + 3$ (for $x \le 0$) or $f(x) = 2x - 5$ (for $x > 0$). If $-x + 3 = 4,$ then $x = -1.$ Note that this value satisfies $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = 4,$ then $x = 9/2.$ Note that this value satisfies $x > 0.$ Therefore, the solutions to $f(x) = 4$ are $x = -1$ and $x = 9/2.$

Next, we solve for the values $x$ such that $f(x) = -1.$ If $-x + 3 = -1,$ then $x = 4.$ This value does not satisfy $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = -1,$ then $x = 2.$ This value satisfies $x > 0.$

Finally, we solve for the values $x$ such that $f(x) = 9/2.$ If $-x + 3 = 9/2,$ then $x = -3/2.$ This value satisfies $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = 9/2,$ then $x = 19/4.$ This value satisfies $x > 0.$

Therefore, the equation $f(f(x)) = 4$ has the solutions $x = 2,$ $-3/2,$ and $19/4,$ for a total of $\boxed{3}$ solutions. The answer is $\boxed{3}$

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

    x = symbols('x')
    m = 100
    count = 0

    while m >= 0:
        equation = Eq(abs(abs(x - 1) - 2), m / 100)
        solutions = solve(equation)

        if len(solutions) == 4:

Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
To solve the equation $f(f(x)) = 4,$ we first find the values $x$ such that $f(x) = 4.$

Next, we solve for the values $x$ such that $f(x) = -1.$ If $-x + 3 = -1,$ then $x = 4.$ This value does not satisfy $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = -1,$ then $x = 2.$ This value satisfies $x > 0.$

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The problem asks for how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions. This equation is a piecewise function with $4$ cases to consider. We can rewrite the equation as \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100} \implies \vert x-1 \vert -2 = \pm \frac{m}{100} \implies \vert x-1 \vert = 2 \pm \frac{m}{100}.\]
We can analyze each case separately and count the number of distinct solutions for each case.

    x, m = symbols('x m')
    count = 0
    for m_val in range(1, 101):
        # Case 1: |x - 1| = 2 + m/100
        eq1 = solveset(abs(x - 1) - (2 + m_val/100), x, domain=S.Reals)
        # Case 2: |x - 1| = 2 - m/100
        eq2 = solveset(abs(x - 1) - (2 - m_val/100), x, domain=S.Reals)
        # Total number of distinct solutions
        total_solutions = len(eq1.union(eq2))
