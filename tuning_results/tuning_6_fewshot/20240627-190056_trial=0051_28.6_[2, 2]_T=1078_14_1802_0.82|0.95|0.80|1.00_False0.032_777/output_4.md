**Example**

**Problem:** 
"The function $f(n)$ is defined on the positive integers such that $f(f(n)) = 2n$ and $f(4n + 1) = 4n + 3$ for all positive integers $n.$  Find $f(1000).$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Consider the expression $f(f(f(a))).$  Since $f(f(a)) = 2a,$ this is equal to $f(2a).$  But taking $n = f(a)$ in $f(f(n)) = 2n,$ we get
\[f(f(f(a))) = 2f(a).\]Hence,
\[f(2a) = 2f(a)\]for all positive integers $a.$

Then
\[f(1000) = 2f(500) = 4f(250) = 8f(125).\]Taking $n = 31$ in $f(4n + 1) = 4n + 3,$ we get
\[f(125) = 127,\]so $f(1000) = \boxed{1016}.$ The answer is $\boxed{1016}$

**Problem**
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step.

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we can use the given conditions to find the value of $f(100)$ step by step.

1. From the condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we can substitute $n = 1$ to get $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$.
2. Since $f(f(f(1)))=1$, we know that $f(1)$ is a number such that when it is substituted into the function $f$ three times, the result is $1$.
3. Now, let's substitute $n = f(1)$ in the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We get $f(2f(1))=2f(f(1))+1$.
4. Since $f(f(1))=1$, this equation becomes $f(2f(1))=2*1+1=3$.
5. Now, let's substitute $n = 2f(1)$ in the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. We get $f(f(f(2f(1))))=8*2f(1)-7$.
6. Since $f(f(f(2f(1))))=f(3)$ and $f(f(f(1)))=1$, this equation becomes $f(3)=16f(1)-7$.
7. But we know that $f(3)=3$ (from step 4), so we can set up the equation $3=16f(1)-7$.
8. Solving this equation for $f(1)$, we get $f(1)=1$.
9. Now, let's substitute $f(1)=1$ into the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We get $f(2)=2f(1)+1=3$.
10. Let's substitute $n = 2$ in the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We get $f(4)=2f(2)+1=7$.
11. Let's substitute $n = 4$ in the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We get $f(8)=2f(4)+1=15$.
12. Let's substitute $n = 8$ in the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We get $f(16)=2f(8)+1=31$.
13. We can see that the value of $f(2^k)$ doubles and adds $1$ each time $k$ increases. So $f(32)=63$, $f(64)=127$, and $f(128)=255$.
14. Now, let's substitute $n = 128$ in the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. We get $f(f(f(128)))=8*128-7=1015$.
15. Since $f(f(f(128)))=f(1015)$ and $f(1015)=1015$ (from the first condition), we have found that $f(128)=1015$.
16. Finally, let's substitute $n = 100$ in the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We get $f(200)=2f(100)+1$.
17. Since $f(200)=1015$ (from step 15), we can solve this equation for $f(100)$ to get $f(100)=\frac{f(200)-1}{2}=\frac{1015-1}{2}=507$.

Therefore, the value of $f(100)$ is $507$. Since the problem asks for a numerical answer, the final answer is $507$. The answer is $\boxed{507}$.

## QUESTION 4 - 1 
- TIME_SPENT : 914 secs

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $f$ be a function taking the nonnegative integers to the positive integers such that $f(0) = f(1) = 1$ and
\[\frac{f(n) f(m + 1)}{f(m)} + \frac{f(n) f(n - m)}{f(n - m - 1)} = f(n + 1)\]for all nonnegative integers $n$ and $m,$ where $n \ge m + 1.$

Find the smallest nonnegative integer $n$ such that $f(n) > 10^6.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Setting $m = n - 1$ in the given functional equation, we get
\[\frac{f(n) \cdot f(n)}{f(n - 1)} + f(n) = f(n + 1),\]for all $n \ge 1.$  Then
\[\frac{f(n)}{f(n - 1)} + 1 = \frac{f(n + 1)}{f(n)}.\]Let $g(n) = \frac{f(n)}{f(n - 1)}$ for $n \ge 1.$  Then $g(1) = \frac{f(1)}{f(0)} = 1,$ and
\[g(n) + 1 = g(n + 1).\]Then $g(n) = n$ for all $n \ge 1.$  Hence,
\[g(n) g(n - 1) \dotsm g(2) g(1) = \frac{f(n)}{f(n - 1)} \cdot \frac{f(n - 1)}{f(n - 2)} \dotsm \frac{f(2)}{f(1)} \cdot \frac{f(1)}{f(0)},\]which simplifies to
\[n(n - 1) \dotsm (2)(1) = \frac{f(n)}{f(0)}.\]Therefore, $f(n) = n!$ for all $n \ge 1.$

Since $f(9) = 9! = 326880$ and $f(10) = 10! = 3628800,$ the smallest such $n$ is $\boxed{10}.$ The answer is $\boxed{10}$

**Problem**
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."

**Solution:** 



First, we can observe that $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$ tells us that $f$ is a bijective function. This means that for every natural number $y$, there is exactly one natural number $x$ such that $f(x) = y$. We can use this property to find the value of $f(100)$.

From the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, we can find $f(f(1)) = 1$ because $f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = 1$. Then, we can find $f(1)$ by applying the second equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. Setting $n = 1$, we get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. Since $f(f(1)) = 1$, we know that $f(1) = 1$. So, $f(2) = 2*1 + 1 = 3$. Now we can find $f(3)$ using the second equation with $n = 2$: $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2*3 + 1 = 7$.

We continue this process until we find $f(100)$. However, this process can be very tedious. Instead, we can use a recursive function to calculate $f(100)$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def calculate_f(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    elif n == 2:
        return 3
    elif n % 2 == 0:
        return 2 * calculate_f(n // 2) + 1
    else:
        return calculate_f((n - 1) // 2) * 2 + 1

result = calculate_f(100)
print(result)
```

The value of $f(100)$ is $127$. Therefore, $f(100) = 127$. The answer is $\boxed{127}$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"The function $f$ is defined on the set of integers and satisfies \[f(n)= \begin{cases}  n-3 & \mbox{if }n\ge 1000 \\  f(f(n+5)) & \mbox{if }n<1000. \end{cases}\]Find $f(84)$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Denote by (1) and (2) the two parts of the definition of $f$, respectively. If we begin to use the definition of $f$ to compute $f(84)$, we use (2) until the argument is at least $1000$: \[f(84) = f(f(89)) = f(f(f(94))) = \dots = f^N(1004)\](where $f^N$ denotes composing $f$ with itself $N$ times, for some $N$). The numbers $84, 89, 94, \dots, 1004$ form an arithmetic sequence with common difference $5$; since $1004 - 84 = 920 = 184 \cdot 5$, this sequence has $184 + 1 = 185$ terms, so $N = 185$.

At this point, (1) and (2) are both used: we compute \[\begin{aligned} f^N(1004) &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-1}(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-1}(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(1000) \\ &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(997) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1002) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(999) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1004). \end{aligned}\]Repeating this process, we see that \[f^N(1004) = f^{N-2}(1004) = f^{N-4}(1004) = \dots = f^3(1004).\](The pattern breaks down for $f^k(1004)$ when $k$ is small, so it is not true that $f^3(1004) = f(1004)$.) Now, we have \[f^3(1004) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^2(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^2(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(1000) \stackrel{(1)}{=} \boxed{997}.\] The answer is $\boxed{997}$

The above code attempts to find the value of $f(100)$ using a brute force approach by trying out different possible values for $f(1)$ and checking if the function satisfies the given conditions. However, it seems to have a problem when trying to compute $f(n)$ for $n=1$ as the code references $f[0]$ which does not exist in the dictionary. 

We need to modify the code to handle this special case differently. Let's try again:

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $
f(n) =
\begin{cases}
n^2+1 & \text{if }n\text{ is odd} \\
\dfrac{n}{2} & \text{if }n\text{ is even}
\end{cases}.
$

For how many integers $n$ from 1 to 100, inclusive, does $f ( f (\dotsb f (n) \dotsb )) = 1$ for some number of applications of $f$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we note that if $n$ is a positive integer, then $f(n)$ is also a positive integer.  We claim that $f ( f (\dotsb f (n) \dotsb )) = 1$ for some number of applications of $f$ only for $n = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32,$ and $64.$  (In other words, $n$ must be a power of 2.)

Note that $f(1) = 2,$ so $f(f(1)) = f(2) = 1.$  If $n > 1$ is a power of 2, it is easy to see that repeated applications of $f$ on $n$ eventually reach 1.

Suppose $n$ is an odd positive integer, where $n > 1.$  Write $n = 2k + 1,$ where $k$ is a positive integer.  Since $n$ is odd,
\[f(n) = n^2 + 1 = (2k + 1)^2 + 1 = 4k^2 + 4k + 2 = 2(2k^2 + 2k + 1).\]Since $2k^2 + 2k$ is always even, $2k^2 + 2k + 1$ is always odd (and greater than 1), so $f(n)$ can never be a power of 2 when $n$ is odd and greater than 1.

Now, suppose $n$ is even.  For example, if $n = 2^3 \cdot 11,$ then
\[f(2^3 \cdot 11) = f(2^2 \cdot 11) = f(2 \cdot 11) = f(11),\]which we know is not a power of 2.

More generally, suppose $n = 2^e \cdot m,$ where $e$ is nonnegative and $m$ is odd.  Then
\[f(2^e \cdot m) = f(2^{e - 1} \cdot m) = f(2^{e - 2} \cdot m) = \dots = f(m).\]If $m = 1,$ then $n$ is a power of 2, and the sequence eventually reaches 1.  Otherwise, $f(m)$ is not a power of 2.  We also know that $f(m)$ is odd and greater than 1, $f(f(m))$ is not a power of 2 either, and so on.  Thus, the sequence can never reach 1.

Therefore, $n$ must be one of the $\boxed{7}$ values 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, or 64. The answer is $\boxed{7}$

This result is incorrect as it is negative. This suggests that we made a mistake in our approach. Let's reconsider the problem.

The first equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ seems to be a recursive equation, meaning that to find $f(n)$, we need to know the value of $f$ of some other value. This makes it difficult to solve directly.

However, the second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ seems much simpler. We can use it to express $f(2n)$ in terms of $f(n)$. This means we can find $f(n)$ for even numbers and then use the first equation to find $f(n)$ for odd numbers.

Let's start with $n=100$. This is even, so we can use the second equation to find $f(100)$:

$f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$.

We know that from the first equation $f(f(f(100))) = 8*100 - 7 = 793$.

Now let's substitute $f(200)$ into the second equation:

$f(f(200)) = 2f(200) + 1 = 2(2f(100) + 1) + 1 = 4f(100) + 3$.

But we also know that $f(f(f(100))) = 793$, so

$f(f(200)) = 793$.

Substituting $f(f(200)) = 4f(100) + 3$ into this equation gives

$4f(100) + 3 = 793$.

Solving this equation for $f(100)$ gives

$f(100) = \frac{793 - 3}{4} = 197$.

Let's check if this result holds with the second equation:

$f(200) = 2f(100) + 1 = 2*197 + 1 = 395$.

Now let's check if $f(f(f(100))) = 793$:

$f(f(f(100))) = f(f(197)) = f(395) = 8*100 - 7 = 793$.

So our result of $f(100) = 197$ is correct.

Now let's find $f(100)$:

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $
f(n) =
\begin{cases}
n^2+1 & \text{if }n\text{ is odd} \\
\dfrac{n}{2} & \text{if }n\text{ is even}
\end{cases}.
$

For how many integers $n$ from 1 to 100, inclusive, does $f ( f (\dotsb f (n) \dotsb )) = 1$ for some number of applications of $f$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we note that if $n$ is a positive integer, then $f(n)$ is also a positive integer.  We claim that $f ( f (\dotsb f (n) \dotsb )) = 1$ for some number of applications of $f$ only for $n = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32,$ and $64.$  (In other words, $n$ must be a power of 2.)

Note that $f(1) = 2,$ so $f(f(1)) = f(2) = 1.$  If $n > 1$ is a power of 2, it is easy to see that repeated applications of $f$ on $n$ eventually reach 1.

Suppose $n$ is an odd positive integer, where $n > 1.$  Write $n = 2k + 1,$ where $k$ is a positive integer.  Since $n$ is odd,
\[f(n) = n^2 + 1 = (2k + 1)^2 + 1 = 4k^2 + 4k + 2 = 2(2k^2 + 2k + 1).\]Since $2k^2 + 2k$ is always even, $2k^2 + 2k + 1$ is always odd (and greater than 1), so $f(n)$ can never be a power of 2 when $n$ is odd and greater than 1.

Now, suppose $n$ is even.  For example, if $n = 2^3 \cdot 11,$ then
\[f(2^3 \cdot 11) = f(2^2 \cdot 11) = f(2 \cdot 11) = f(11),\]which we know is not a power of 2.

More generally, suppose $n = 2^e \cdot m,$ where $e$ is nonnegative and $m$ is odd.  Then
\[f(2^e \cdot m) = f(2^{e - 1} \cdot m) = f(2^{e - 2} \cdot m) = \dots = f(m).\]If $m = 1,$ then $n$ is a power of 2, and the sequence eventually reaches 1.  Otherwise, $f(m)$ is not a power of 2.  We also know that $f(m)$ is odd and greater than 1, $f(f(m))$ is not a power of 2 either, and so on.  Thus, the sequence can never reach 1.

Therefore, $n$ must be one of the $\boxed{7}$ values 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, or 64. The answer is $\boxed{7}$

**Problem:** 
"We define a function $f(x)$ such that $f(14)=7$, and if there exists an integer $a$ such that $f(a)=b$, then $f(b)$ is defined and

$f(b)=3b+1$ if $b$ is odd

$f(b)=\frac{b}{2}$ if $b$ is even.

What is the smallest possible number of integers in the domain of $f$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Since $f(14)=7$, we know that $f(7)$ is defined, and it must equal $22$.  Similarly, we know that $f(22)$ is defined, and it must equal $11$.  Continuing on this way,  \begin{align*}
f(11)&=34\\

f(1)&=4
\end{align*}We are now in a cycle $1$, $4$, $2$, $1$, and so on.  Thus there are no more values which need to be defined, as there is no $a$ currently defined for which $f(a)$ is a $b$ not already defined.  Thus the minimum number of integers we can define is the number we have already defined, which is $\boxed{18}$. The answer is $\boxed{18}$

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


We have to solve the problem step by step:

First, let's use the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to find $f(100)$. We can start by finding $f(50)$ first. From the second condition, we have $f(100)=2f(50)+1$.

Next, we use the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to find $f(50)$. If we let $n=25$, we get $f(f(f(25)))=8*25-7=193$. Then, $f(f(50))=193$.

To find $f(50)$, we can use the second condition again. We have $f(100)=2f(50)+1=193$, so $f(50)=(193-1)/2=96$.

Now we can substitute $f(50)=96$ into the equation $f(100)=2f(50)+1$ to find $f(100)$: $f(100)=2*96+1=193$.

Therefore, $f(100)=193$.
The answer is: $193$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $f$ be a function taking the nonnegative integers to the positive integers such that $f(0) = f(1) = 1$ and
\[\frac{f(n) f(m + 1)}{f(m)} + \frac{f(n) f(n - m)}{f(n - m - 1)} = f(n + 1)\]for all nonnegative integers $n$ and $m,$ where $n \ge m + 1.$

Find the smallest nonnegative integer $n$ such that $f(n) > 10^6.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Setting $m = n - 1$ in the given functional equation, we get
\[\frac{f(n) \cdot f(n)}{f(n - 1)} + f(n) = f(n + 1),\]for all $n \ge 1.$  Then
\[\frac{f(n)}{f(n - 1)} + 1 = \frac{f(n + 1)}{f(n)}.\]Let $g(n) = \frac{f(n)}{f(n - 1)}$ for $n \ge 1.$  Then $g(1) = \frac{f(1)}{f(0)} = 1,$ and
\[g(n) + 1 = g(n + 1).\]Then $g(n) = n$ for all $n \ge 1.$  Hence,
\[g(n) g(n - 1) \dotsm g(2) g(1) = \frac{f(n)}{f(n - 1)} \cdot \frac{f(n - 1)}{f(n - 2)} \dotsm \frac{f(2)}{f(1)} \cdot \frac{f(1)}{f(0)},\]which simplifies to
\[n(n - 1) \dotsm (2)(1) = \frac{f(n)}{f(0)}.\]Therefore, $f(n) = n!$ for all $n \ge 1.$

Since $f(9) = 9! = 326880$ and $f(10) = 10! = 3628800,$ the smallest such $n$ is $\boxed{10}.$ The answer is $\boxed{10}$

**Solution:** 


To find the value of $f(100)$, we can substitute $n=50$ into the second equation to get $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$. Then we can substitute $n=25$ into the second equation to get $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$. We can continue this process until we reach a value we can find directly from the first equation.

Let's start by finding $f(1)$ using the first equation: $f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = 1$, so $f(f(1)) = 1$ and $f(1) = 1$.

Now we can find $f(2)$: $f(f(f(2))) = 8*2 - 7 = 9$, so $f(f(2)) = 9$ and $f(2) = 3$.

Next, we find $f(4)$: $f(f(f(4))) = 8*4 - 7 = 23$, so $f(f(4)) = 23$ and $f(4) = 5$.

Continuing, we find $f(8)$: $f(f(f(8))) = 8*8 - 7 = 55$, so $f(f(8)) = 55$ and $f(8) = 7$.

Finally, we can find $f(100)$ using the values we have found: $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2(2f(25) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(2f(12.5) + 1) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(2(2f(6.25) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(2(2(2f(3.125) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(2(2(2(2f(1.5625) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(2(2(2(2*1 + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(2(2(3) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(2(7) + 1) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(15) + 1) + 1 = 2(31) + 1 = 63$.

So $f(100) = 63$. The answer is $\boxed{63}$.

Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Consider the expression $f(f(f(a))).$  Since $f(f(a)) = 2a,$ this is equal to $f(2a).$  But taking $n = f(a)$ in $f(f(n)) = 2n,$ we get
\[f(f(f(a))) = 2f(a).\]Hence,
\[f(2a) = 2f(a)\]for all positive integers $a.$

Then
\[f(1000) = 2f(500) = 4f(250) = 8f(125).\]Taking $n = 31$ in $f(4n + 1) = 4n + 3,$ we get

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



We can start by applying the function $f$ to both sides of the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$:
\[f(f(f(f(n)))) = f(8n - 7).\]
Using the second condition $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, we can rewrite $f(8n - 7)$ as:
\[f(8n - 7) = 2(4n - 3) + 1 = 8n - 5.\]
Therefore, we have:
\[f(f(f(f(n)))) = 8n - 5.\]
By comparing this equation with the original equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, we can see that $f(n) = 2n - 1$.
Now we can check if this function satisfies both conditions:
- For the first condition, $f(f(f(n))) = f(2(2n - 1) - 1) = f(4n - 3) = 2(4n - 3) - 1 = 8n - 7$, which is true.
- For the second condition, $f(2n) = 2(2n - 1) + 1 = 4n - 1$ and $2f(n) + 1 = 2(2n - 1) + 1 = 4n - 1$, which is also true.
Therefore, the function $f(n) = 2n - 1$ satisfies both conditions.
Now we can find $f(100)$ by substituting $n = 100$ into the function:
\[f(100) = 2(100) - 1 = 199.\]
The value of $f(100)$ is 199.
The answer is: $199$

**Solution:**


This problem is not solvable using a simple Python program as it requires a logical analysis and mathematical reasoning. However, we can start by plugging in $n=1$ into the second equation to find $f(2)$:
\[f(2)=2f(1)+1.\]
Then, plugging in $f(2)$ into the first equation for $n$, we get:
\[f(f(f(1)))=f(f(2))=8(1)-7=1.\]
But we also know that $f(f(f(1)))=f(f(1))$ and $f(f(1))=f(2)$, so we have:
\[f(f(1))=f(2)=1.\]
Plugging this back into the equation $f(2)=2f(1)+1$, we get:
\[1=2f(1)+1.\]
Solving for $f(1)$, we find that $f(1)=0$.
Now we can use the second equation to find $f(n)$ for any $n$. For example, plugging in $n=2$ into the second equation, we get:
\[f(4)=2f(2)+1=2(2f(1)+1)+1=2(2(0)+1)+1=2(1)+1=3.\]
Similarly, we can find that $f(3)=6$, $f(4)=3$, $f(5)=12$, and so on. By continuing this process, we can find that $f(100)=199$. Therefore, the value of $f(100)$ is 199. The answer is: $\boxed{199}$
