**Problem:** 
"Let $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_ 2= (-16,2).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that
\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as
\[\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1.\]Find $h + k + a + b.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. The equation is satisfied if either of the two factors is equal to zero.

For the first factor to be zero, we need either $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. This gives us the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, or $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length 20.

For the second factor to be zero, we need either $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. This gives us the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$, or $y = 8$ and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length 16.

The intersection of the two squares is a smaller square with side length 8. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of the larger square minus the area of the smaller square. The area of a square is given by side length squared, so the area of the larger square is $20^2 = 400$, and the area of the smaller square is $8^2 = 64$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $400 - 64 = 336$. The answer is: 336

draw(left--right);
label("$x$", (x/2, -0.1), S);

[/asy]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Let $w$ be the width of each of the identical rectangles. Since $PQ=3w$, $RS=2x$ and $PQ=RS$ (because $PQRS$ is a rectangle), then $2x = 3w$, or $$w=\frac{2}{3}x.$$ Therefore, the area of each of the five identical rectangles is $$x\left(\frac{2}{3}x\right)=\frac{2}{3}x^2.$$ Since the area of $PQRS$ is 4000 and it is made up of five of these identical smaller rectangles, then $$5\left(\frac{2}{3}x^2\right)=4000$$ or $$\frac{10}{3}x^2 = 4000$$ or $x^2 = 1200$ or $x \approx 34.6$ which, when rounded off to the nearest integer, is $\boxed{35}.$ The answer is $\boxed{35}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step.

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


The given equation is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. 

The product of two factors equals zero if and only if at least one of the factors is zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
In this case, both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. Solving these equations gives $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these equations form a square with side length 20.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
In this case, both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. Solving these equations gives $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations form a square with side length 16.

The intersection of the solutions to Case 1 and Case 2 is a square with side length 8 (the smaller square is completely inside the larger square). The area of the convex polygon formed by the points satisfying the given equation is the area of the larger square minus the area of the smaller square.

The area of a square is given by the square of the side length. Therefore, the area of the larger square is $20^2 = 400$ and the area of the smaller square is $8^2 = 64$. The area of the convex polygon is $400 - 64 = 336$.
The answer is: $336$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many square units are in the area of the triangle whose vertices are the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the curve $y = (x-3)^2 (x+2)$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we need to find where this curve intersects the $x$ and $y$ axes.  If $y=0$, then $(x-3)^2(x+2)=0$, which has solutions of $x=3$ and $x=-2$.  If $x=0$, then $y=(-3)^2(2)=18$.  So, the curve has two $x$-intercepts and one $y$-intercept.  The length of the base along the $x$-axis is $3-(-2)=5$.  The height from this base is equal to the $y$-intercept, 18.  The area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 5\cdot 18=\boxed{45}$. The answer is $\boxed{45}$

Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,
\begin{align*}
&[(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + \dots + 1^2 + 1^2)][(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2] \\

\end{align*}From the given condition, we have equality, so by the equality condition for Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[\frac{1 - x_1}{1} = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{1} = \frac{x_2 - x_3}{1} = \dots = \frac{x_9 - x_{10}}{1} = \frac{x_{10}}{1}.\]Let
\[d = 1 - x_1 = x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_3 = \dots = x_9 - x_{10} = x_{10}.\]Then
\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so
\[(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_{10}) = \left( \frac{10}{11}, \frac{9}{11}, \frac{8}{11}, \dots, \frac{1}{11} \right).\]In particular, there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Solution:** 



The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. This equation is satisfied if either of the two factors is zero. 

The first factor is zero when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two circles in the $xy$-plane. The second factor is zero when $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$, which are the equations of two more circles. 

The intersection of the four circles form a square with side length 16 (since the distance between the centers of the two circles $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ is $10\sqrt{2}$, and the distance between the centers of the two circles $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ is 16). Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of the square, which is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

\[(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_{10}) = \left( \frac{10}{11}, \frac{9}{11}, \frac{8}{11}, \dots, \frac{1}{11} \right).\]In particular, there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



To solve this problem, we can first observe that the equation given is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either one of the terms must be zero. This gives us two separate cases to consider.

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. In this case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This describes a square with side length 20.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. In this case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. This describes a square with side length 16.

The intersection of the two squares is another square with side length 8.

The area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares minus the area of the smaller square. The area of a square with side length $a$ is $a^2$, so the area of the larger square is $20^2 = 400$, the area of the smaller square is $16^2 = 256$, and the area of the smaller square in the intersection is $8^2 = 64$.

The area of the convex polygon is then $400 + 256 - 64 = 592$.

```python

def calculate_area():
    # Area of the larger square

    area_intersection = 8**2

    # Area of the convex polygon
    area = area_large_square + area_small_square - area_intersection

    return area

result = calculate_area()
print(result)
```

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The expression equals zero if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

This gives us the following four conditions:
1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$
2. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$
3. $\vert x \vert = 8$
4. $\vert y \vert = 8$

The solutions to these equations are the vertices of the polygon. 

The vertices are $(8, 0)$, $(8, -16)$, $(-8, 0)$, $(-8, 16)$, $(0, 8)$, $(16, 8)$, $(0, -8)$, and $(-16, -8)$.

To find the area of the polygon, we can use the shoelace formula. The coordinates of the vertices, in clockwise order starting from $(8, 0)$, are $(8, 0)$, $(8, -16)$, $(-8, -16)$, $(-8, 16)$, $(0, 16)$, $(0, 8)$, $(0, -8)$, and $(0, -8)$.

Applying the shoelace formula, the area of the polygon is:

$$\frac{1}{2} \vert (8 \cdot -16 + 8 \cdot 16 + (-8) \cdot 16 + 0 \cdot 8 + 0 \cdot (-8) + (-8) \cdot (-16) + 0 \cdot 0 + 0 \cdot 0) \vert$$
$$= \frac{1}{2} \vert (-128 + 128 - 128 + 0 + 0 + 128 + 0 + 0) \vert$$
$$= \frac{1}{2} \vert 0 \vert$$
$$= 0$$

But this result is incorrect because the shoelace formula gives the area of a polygon with vertices in clockwise order. The vertices of the polygon are not in clockwise order. We need to reverse the order of the vertices before applying the shoelace formula.

The coordinates of the vertices in counterclockwise order starting from $(8, 0)$ are $(8, 0)$, $(8, -16)$, $(0, -8)$, $(0, 8)$, $(16, 8)$, $(-8, 16)$, $(-8, -16)$, and $(0, 0)$.

Applying the shoelace formula again, the area of the polygon is:

$$\frac{1}{2} \vert (8 \cdot -16 + 8 \cdot (-8) + 0 \cdot 8 + 16 \cdot 8 + (-8) \cdot 16 + (-8) \cdot (-8) + 0 \cdot 0 + 0 \cdot 0) \vert$$
$$= \frac{1}{2} \vert (-128 - 64 + 0 + 128 - 128 + 64 + 0 + 0) \vert$$
$$= \frac{1}{2} \vert 0 \vert$$
$$= 0$$

Again, this result is incorrect. It seems we have made a mistake in calculating the coordinates of the vertices. Let's go back and check our work.

The first equation $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ gives two possibilities: $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$. The second equation $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ gives two possibilities: $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$. The third equation $\vert x \vert = 8$ gives two possibilities: $x = 8$ and $x = -8$. The fourth equation $\vert y \vert = 8$ gives two possibilities: $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

By solving these equations, we find the vertices of the polygon: $(8, 0)$, $(8, -16)$, $(-8, 0)$, $(-8, 16)$, $(0, 8)$, $(16, 8)$, $(0, -8)$, and $(-16, -8)$.

Now we apply the shoelace formula correctly:

$$\frac{1}{2} \vert (8 \cdot -16 + 8 \cdot (-8) + (-8) \cdot 0 + 16 \cdot 8 + 0 \cdot 16 + (-8) \cdot (-8) + 0 \cdot 0 + 0 \cdot 0) \vert$$
$$= \frac{1}{2} \vert (-128 - 64 + 0 + 128 + 0 + 64 + 0 + 0) \vert$$
$$= \frac{1}{2} \vert 0 \vert$$
$$= 0$$

Again, this result is incorrect. It seems we have made a mistake in the shoelace formula. Let's use another method to find the area of the polygon.

The polygon is a square with side length 16. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

However, this result is incorrect because the vertices of the polygon are not on integer coordinates. The vertices of the polygon are on the lines $x + y = 10$, $x - y = 10$, $x = 8$, and $y = 8$. The vertices of the polygon are not on the integer lattice.

The actual vertices of the polygon are $(8, 2)$, $(8, -18)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, 18)$, $(2, 8)$, $(18, 8)$, $(-2, -8)$, and $(-18, -8)$. These vertices are on the integer lattice and form a square with side length 16. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    # The vertices of the polygon are
    # (8, 2), (8, -18), (-8, 2), (-8, 18), (2, 8), (18, 8), (-2, -8), and (-18, -8)
    # These vertices form a square with side length 16
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_ 2= (-16,2).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that
\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as
\[\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1.\]Find $h + k + a + b.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

**Solution:** 


The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. The area of this convex polygon can be found by analyzing the equations. 

The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length 10.

The equation $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length 16.

The intersection of the two squares is a smaller square with side length 8. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $8^2 = 64$. The answer is $\boxed{64}$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many square units are in the area of the triangle whose vertices are the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the curve $y = (x-3)^2 (x+2)$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we need to find where this curve intersects the $x$ and $y$ axes.  If $y=0$, then $(x-3)^2(x+2)=0$, which has solutions of $x=3$ and $x=-2$.  If $x=0$, then $y=(-3)^2(2)=18$.  So, the curve has two $x$-intercepts and one $y$-intercept.  The length of the base along the $x$-axis is $3-(-2)=5$.  The height from this base is equal to the $y$-intercept, 18.  The area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 5\cdot 18=\boxed{45}$. The answer is $\boxed{45}$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we can start by understanding the given equation. The equation is equal to zero, which means that either the first term or the second term is zero. This gives us two conditions:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From the first condition, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us four lines: $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. From the second condition, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us four lines: $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

The intersection points of these lines are the vertices of the polygon. By plotting these lines on a coordinate plane, we can see that the polygon is a square with side length 16. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. So the area of the convex polygon is 256.

Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Let $w$ be the width of each of the identical rectangles. Since $PQ=3w$, $RS=2x$ and $PQ=RS$ (because $PQRS$ is a rectangle), then $2x = 3w$, or $$w=\frac{2}{3}x.$$ Therefore, the area of each of the five identical rectangles is $$x\left(\frac{2}{3}x\right)=\frac{2}{3}x^2.$$ Since the area of $PQRS$ is 4000 and it is made up of five of these identical smaller rectangles, then $$5\left(\frac{2}{3}x^2\right)=4000$$ or $$\frac{10}{3}x^2 = 4000$$ or $x^2 = 1200$ or $x \approx 34.6$ which, when rounded off to the nearest integer, is $\boxed{35}.$ The answer is $\boxed{35}$
