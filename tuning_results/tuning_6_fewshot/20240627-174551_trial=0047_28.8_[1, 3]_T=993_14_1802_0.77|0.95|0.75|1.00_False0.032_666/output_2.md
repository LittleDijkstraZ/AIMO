**Problem:** 
"How many distinct solutions are there to the equation $|x-7| = |x+1|$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
If $|x-7| = |x+1|$, then either $x-7 = x+1$ or $x-7 = -(x+1)$.  Simplifying $x-7=x+1$ gives $0=8$, which has no solutions, so no values of $x$ satisfy $x-7 = x+1$.  If $x-7 = -(x+1)$, then $x-7 = -x-1$, so $2x = 6$, which gives $x=3$.  So, there is $\boxed{1}$ solution.

Challenge: See if you can find a quick solution to this problem by simply thinking about the graphs of $y=|x-7|$ and $y=|x+1|$. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we will use a sympy-based approach to find the value of $m$ such that the equation $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

1. We know that the expression $| |x-1| - 2 |$ can take a value from $0$ to $3$ only, because $|x|$ is always non-negative and hence $||x-1| - 2|$ can be at most $2$. So, $\frac{m}{100}$ should be $1, 2,$ or $3$.

2. We can set up the equation $| |x-1| - 2 | = 1, 2,$ or $3$ and solve it to find the corresponding values of $m$.

3. For each of these equations, we will find the number of distinct solutions and add up the values of $m$ for which we get exactly $4$ solutions.

        equation = Abs(Abs(x - 1) - 2) - target / 100
        solutions = solveset(equation, x, domain=S.Reals)
        num_solutions = len(solutions)

        # If the number of solutions is 4, add the value of m to the list
        if num_solutions == 4:

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many solutions does the equation \[\frac{(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)\dotsm(x-100)}{(x-1^2)(x-2^2)(x-3^2)\dotsm(x-100^2)} = 0\]have for $x$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Any solution to this equation must make the numerator of the left-hand side zero, while keeping the denominator non-zero. The numerator is zero when $x$ is one of the numbers $1, 2, 3, \dots, 100.$ However, for any value in this list that is a perfect square, the denominator will also be zero, so that value of $x$ will not be a root. Therefore, we want to find the number of integers in the list $1, 2, \dots, 100$ which are not perfect squares. The perfect squares in the list are $1^2, 2^2, \dots, 10^2,$ so there are $10$ perfect squares, and \[100 - 10 = \boxed{90}\]integers which are not perfect squares. The answer is $\boxed{90}$

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The problem asks for how many positive integers $m$ the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

The number of distinct solutions of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is determined by the value of $\frac{m}{100}$. Specifically, the equation has $4$ distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $2$, inclusive. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a graph that consists of four line segments, and the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly four solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is in the interval $(0, 2]$. Therefore, we need to find how many positive integers $m$ satisfy $1 \leq \frac{m}{100} \leq 2$. Multiplying all sides of the inequalities by $100$ gives $100 \leq m \leq 200$. The number of integers in the interval $[100, 200]$ is $101$. Therefore, there are $101$ positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. The answer is: $101$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let \[f(x) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
-x + 3 & \text{if } x \le 0, \\
2x - 5 & \text{if } x > 0.
\end{array}

Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
To solve the equation $f(f(x)) = 4,$ we first find the values $x$ such that $f(x) = 4.$

Either $f(x) = -x + 3$ (for $x \le 0$) or $f(x) = 2x - 5$ (for $x > 0$). If $-x + 3 = 4,$ then $x = -1.$ Note that this value satisfies $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = 4,$ then $x = 9/2.$ Note that this value satisfies $x > 0.$ Therefore, the solutions to $f(x) = 4$ are $x = -1$ and $x = 9/2.$

Next, we solve for the values $x$ such that $f(x) = -1.$ If $-x + 3 = -1,$ then $x = 4.$ This value does not satisfy $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = -1,$ then $x = 2.$ This value satisfies $x > 0.$

Finally, we solve for the values $x$ such that $f(x) = 9/2.$ If $-x + 3 = 9/2,$ then $x = -3/2.$ This value satisfies $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = 9/2,$ then $x = 19/4.$ This value satisfies $x > 0.$

Therefore, the equation $f(f(x)) = 4$ has the solutions $x = 2,$ $-3/2,$ and $19/4,$ for a total of $\boxed{3}$ solutions. The answer is $\boxed{3}$

**Solution:** 



To solve this problem, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. 

We can start by setting $\frac{m}{100}$ to a variable, say $k$. Then we have the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=k$. 

This equation can be solved by considering two cases: 

1. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = k$: We first solve $\vert x-1 \vert = k+2$. This gives us two sub-cases:
   a. $x-1 = k+2$: Solving this we get $x = k+3$.
   b. $-(x-1) = k+2$: Solving this we get $x = 1 - k - 2 = -k - 1$.
   
2. $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = k$: We first solve $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - k$. This gives us two sub-cases:
   a. $x-1 = 2 - k$: Solving this we get $x = 3 - k$.
   b. $-(x-1) = 2 - k$: Solving this we get $x = -1 + k$.

For each value of $k$, we get four values of $x$: $k+3$, $-k - 1$, $3 - k$, and $-1 + k$. To have four distinct solutions, these four values must be distinct. 

We can set up an inequality to check when these values are distinct. The values must be distinct in the following order: $-k - 1 < -1 + k < k+3 < 3 - k$. 

Solving this inequality, we get $k < 1$, which means $k = 0$. However, $k$ cannot be $0$ because $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=k$ would become $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=0$, which simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$, and then to two separate equations: $x-1 = 2$ and $-(x-1) = 2$. The first equation gives $x = 3$ and the second gives $x = -1$. So, $k$ must be a positive integer.

Now we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $\frac{m}{100} = k$. Since $k = 1$, we have $m = 100$. Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. The value of $m$ is $100$.

However, this value of $m$ corresponds to the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=1$. We need to check if this equation has $4$ distinct solutions.

For $k = 1$, the four distinct solutions are: $k+3 = 4$, $-k - 1 = -2$, $3 - k = 2$, and $-1 + k = 0$. So, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=1$ indeed has $4$ distinct solutions.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $1$. The value of $m$ is $100$. The answer is $\boxed{1}$.

However, this value of $m$ corresponds to the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=1$. We need to check if this equation has $4$ distinct solutions.

For $k = 1$, the four distinct solutions are: $k+3 = 4$, $-k - 1 = -2$, $3 - k = 2$, and $-1 + k = 0$. So, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=1$ indeed has $4$ distinct solutions.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $1$. The value of $m$ is $100$. The answer is $\boxed{100}$.

## QUESTION 2 - 6

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"For certain ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ of real numbers, the system of equations
\[\begin{aligned} ax+by&=1 \\ x^2 + y^2 &= 50  \end{aligned}\]has at least one solution, and each solution is an ordered pair $(x,y)\,$ of integers. How many such ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ are there?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The graph of $ax+by=1$ is a line, while the graph of $x^2+y^2=50$ is a circle centered at the origin. Therefore, $(a, b)$ satisfies the conditions if and only if the line and circle intersect at least once, and they intersect only at lattice points (points with integer coordinates).

Knowing this, it makes sense to look for lattice points on the circle whose equation is $x^2+y^2=50$. Testing cases, we find that there are twelve lattice points on the circle: $(\pm 1, \pm 7)$, $(\pm 7, \pm 1)$, and $(\pm 5, \pm 5)$ (where the two $\pm$ signs in each pair are independent of each other).

There are $\tbinom{12}{2} = 66$ pairs of these points, and each pair determines a line. However, the graph of $ax+by=1$ can never pass through the origin $(0, 0)$, since if $x=y=0$, then $ax+by=0 \neq 1$. Therefore, the six pairs which consist of diametrically opposed points are invalid, since the line through them passes through the origin. This corrects our count to $66 - 6 = 60$.

In addition, for each of the twelve points, there is a line tangent to the circle at that point, so that the only solution to the system is that one point. This brings the final total to $60 + 12 = \boxed{72}$. The answer is $\boxed{72}$

We can start by setting $\frac{m}{100}$ to a variable, say $k$. Then we have the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=k$. 

This equation can be solved by considering two cases: 

1. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = k$: We first solve $\vert x-1 \vert = k+2$. This gives us two sub-cases:
   a. $x-1 = k+2$: Solving this we get $x = k+3$.
   b. $-(x-1) = k+2$: Solving this we get $x = 1 - k - 2 = -k - 1$.
   
2. $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = k$: We first solve $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - k$. This gives us two sub-cases:
   a. $x-1 = 2 - k$: Solving this we get $x = 3 - k$.
   b. $-(x-1) = 2 - k$: Solving this we get $x = -1 + k$.

For each value of $k$, we get four values of $x$: $k+3$, $-k - 1$, $3 - k$, and $-1 + k$. To have four distinct solutions, these four values must be distinct. 

We can set up an inequality to check when these values are distinct. The values must be distinct in the following order: $-k - 1 < -1 + k < k+3 < 3 - k$. 

Solving this inequality, we get $k < 1$, which means $k = 0$. However, $k$ cannot be $0$ because $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=k$ would become $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=0$, which simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$, and then to two separate equations: $x-1 = 2$ and $-(x-1) = 2$. The first equation gives $x = 3$ and the second gives $x = -1$. So, $k$ must be a positive integer.

Now we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $\frac{m}{100} = k$. Since $k = 1$, we have $m = 100$. Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. The value of $m$ is $100$.

However, this value of $m$ corresponds to the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=1$. We need to check if this equation has $4$ distinct solutions.

For $k = 1$, the four distinct solutions are: $k+3 = 4$, $-k - 1 = -2$, $3 - k = 2$, and $-1 + k = 0$. So, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=1$ indeed has $4$ distinct solutions.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $1$. The value of $m$ is $100$. The answer is $\boxed{1}$.

However, this value of $m$ corresponds to the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=1$. We need to check if this equation has $4$ distinct solutions.

For $k = 1$, the four distinct solutions are: $k+3 = 4$, $-k - 1 = -2$, $3 - k = 2$, and $-1 + k = 0$. So, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=1$ indeed has $4$ distinct solutions.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $1$. The value of $m$ is $100$. The answer is $\boxed{100}$.
