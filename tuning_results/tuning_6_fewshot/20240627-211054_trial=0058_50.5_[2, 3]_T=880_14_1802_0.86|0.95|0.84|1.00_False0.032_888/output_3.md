Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Let $w$ be the width of each of the identical rectangles. Since $PQ=3w$, $RS=2x$ and $PQ=RS$ (because $PQRS$ is a rectangle), then $2x = 3w$, or $$w=\frac{2}{3}x.$$ Therefore, the area of each of the five identical rectangles is $$x\left(\frac{2}{3}x\right)=\frac{2}{3}x^2.$$ Since the area of $PQRS$ is 4000 and it is made up of five of these identical smaller rectangles, then $$5\left(\frac{2}{3}x^2\right)=4000$$ or $$\frac{10}{3}x^2 = 4000$$ or $x^2 = 1200$ or $x \approx 34.6$ which, when rounded off to the nearest integer, is $\boxed{35}.$ The answer is $\boxed{35}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


The given equation is a product of two terms, each of which must be equal to zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. Either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, and either $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first case, we have:
- $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = \pm 10$ or $x + y = 0$.
- $\vert x \vert = 8$, which implies $x = \pm 8$ or $x = 0$.
- $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x - y = \pm 10$ or $x - y = 0$.
- $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $y = \pm 8$ or $y = 0$.

For the second case, we have:
- $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = \pm 10$ or $x + y = 0$.
- $\vert x \vert = 8$, which implies $x = \pm 8$ or $x = 0$.
- $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x - y = \pm 10$ or $x - y = 0$.
- $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $y = \pm 8$ or $y = 0$.

These cases give us a total of 16 possible combinations of $(x, y)$. The area of the convex polygon formed by these points is the sum of the areas of the four right triangles with vertices at $(0, 0)$, $(8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, and $(8, 8)$. Each of these triangles has an area of $\frac{1}{2} \times 8 \times 8 = 32$, so the total area of the convex polygon is $4 \times 32 = 128$.

The answer is: $128$.

## QUESTION 3 - 1 
- TIME_SPENT : 525 secs

1_
**Example**

**Problem:** 
"An ellipse is defined parametrically by
\[(x,y) = \left( \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t}, \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t} \right).\]Then the equation of the ellipse can be written in the form
\[Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0,\]where $A,$ $B,$ $C,$ $D,$ $E,$ and $F$ are integers, and $\gcd(|A|,|B|,|C|,|D|,|E|,|F|) = 1.$  Find $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F|.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
In the equation $y = \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\cos t$ to get
\[\cos t = \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3}.\]In the equation $x = \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\sin t$ to get
\[\sin t = \frac{1}{2} x (2 - \cos t) + 1 = \frac{1}{2} x \left( 2 - \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right) + 1 = 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)}.\]Since $\cos^2 t + \sin^2 t = 1,$
\[\left( \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right)^2 + \left( 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)} \right)^2 = 1.\]Multiplying both sides by $(2(y + 3))^2$ and expanding, it will simplify to
\[81x^2 - 36xy + 16y^2 - 108x + 240y + 900 = 0.\]Therefore, $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F| = 81 + 36 + 16 + 108 + 240 + 900 = \boxed{1381}.$ The answer is $\boxed{1381}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.
Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8,2)$, $(8,-2)$, $(-8,2)$, and $(-8,-2)$.
If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.
The union of these two squares is the convex polygon.
To find the area of the convex polygon, we find the area of each square and add them together.
Each square has side length 16, so its area is $16^2 = 256$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $2 \cdot 256 = 512$.
The answer is: $512$

Since $PQ=3w$, $RS=2x$ and $PQ=RS$ (because $PQRS$ is a rectangle), then $2x = 3w$, or $$w=\frac{2}{3}x.$$ Therefore, the area of each of the five identical rectangles is $$x\left(\frac{2}{3}x\right)=\frac{2}{3}x^2.$$ Since the area of $PQRS$ is 4000 and it is made up of five of these identical smaller rectangles, then $$5\left(\frac{2}{3}x^2\right)=4000$$ or $$\frac{10}{3}x^2 = 4000$$ or $x^2 = 1200$ or $x \approx 34.6$ which, when rounded off to the nearest integer, is $\boxed{35}.$ The answer is $\boxed{35}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The expression equals zero if either of the factors equals zero. This gives us four cases to consider:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
4. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

In the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $-8 \leq x, y \leq 8$ and $-18 \leq x + y \leq 18$. The points satisfying these conditions form a square with side length 16.

In the second case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us four points: $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, and $(-10, 0)$. The points form a square with side length 20.

In the third case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. The points form a square with side length 16.

In the fourth case, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us the same square as in the third case.

The convex polygon is the union of the squares from the first and second cases. The side length of the larger square is 20, and the side length of the smaller square is 16. The area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of these two squares: $20^2 + 16^2 = 400 + 256 = 656$. The answer is: $656$

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We are asked to solve the equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ to find the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy it.
2. This equation is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
3. Each of these equations simplifies to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
4. Solving these equations, we get the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy these conditions.
5. These points enclose a convex polygon, and we are asked to find its area.
6. The points $(x, y)$ satisfying $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ form a square with side length $20$, and its area is $20^2 = 400$.
7. The points $(x, y)$ satisfying $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ also form a square with side length $20$, and its area is also $400$.
8. The points $(x, y)$ satisfying $\vert x \vert = 8$ form a square with side length $16$, and its area is $16^2 = 256$.
9. The points $(x, y)$ satisfying $\vert y \vert = 8$ also form a square with side length $16$, and its area is also $256$.
10. The total area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of these four squares, which is $400 + 400 + 256 + 256 = 1312$.

However, we have made a mistake. The points $(x, y)$ satisfying $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ do not form squares, but rather a diamond shape. The area of a diamond with side length $10$ is $(10 \times 10) / 2 = 50$. So the correct total area of the convex polygon is $50 + 50 + 256 + 256 = 612$.

So the area of the convex polygon is $612$.
The answer is: $612$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"An ellipse is defined parametrically by
\[(x,y) = \left( \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t}, \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t} \right).\]Then the equation of the ellipse can be written in the form
\[Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0,\]where $A,$ $B,$ $C,$ $D,$ $E,$ and $F$ are integers, and $\gcd(|A|,|B|,|C|,|D|,|E|,|F|) = 1.$  Find $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F|.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
In the equation $y = \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\cos t$ to get
\[\cos t = \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3}.\]In the equation $x = \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\sin t$ to get
\[\sin t = \frac{1}{2} x (2 - \cos t) + 1 = \frac{1}{2} x \left( 2 - \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right) + 1 = 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)}.\]Since $\cos^2 t + \sin^2 t = 1,$
\[\left( \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right)^2 + \left( 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)} \right)^2 = 1.\]Multiplying both sides by $(2(y + 3))^2$ and expanding, it will simplify to
\[81x^2 - 36xy + 16y^2 - 108x + 240y + 900 = 0.\]Therefore, $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F| = 81 + 36 + 16 + 108 + 240 + 900 = \boxed{1381}.$ The answer is $\boxed{1381}$

Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Let $w$ be the width of each of the identical rectangles. Since $PQ=3w$, $RS=2x$ and $PQ=RS$ (because $PQRS$ is a rectangle), then $2x = 3w$, or $$w=\frac{2}{3}x.$$ Therefore, the area of each of the five identical rectangles is $$x\left(\frac{2}{3}x\right)=\frac{2}{3}x^2.$$ Since the area of $PQRS$ is 4000 and it is made up of five of these identical smaller rectangles, then $$5\left(\frac{2}{3}x^2\right)=4000$$ or $$\frac{10}{3}x^2 = 4000$$ or $x^2 = 1200$ or $x \approx 34.6$ which, when rounded off to the nearest integer, is $\boxed{35}.$ The answer is $\boxed{35}$

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



This problem involves understanding the properties of absolute value functions and how they interact with multiplication. The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ equals to zero if and only if both of the factors equal to zero. 

The factor $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This is only possible when both $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$. Solving these systems of equations gives us the vertices of a square with side length 10: $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, and $(-5,-5)$.

The factor $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This is only possible when both $x = 8$ and $y = 8$ or $x = -8$ and $y = -8$. Solving these systems of equations gives us the vertices of a square with side length 16: $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

The intersection of the two squares forms a larger square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $\boxed{100}$

**Problem:** 
"How many square units are in the area of the triangle whose vertices are the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the curve $y = (x-3)^2 (x+2)$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we need to find where this curve intersects the $x$ and $y$ axes.  If $y=0$, then $(x-3)^2(x+2)=0$, which has solutions of $x=3$ and $x=-2$.  If $x=0$, then $y=(-3)^2(2)=18$.  So, the curve has two $x$-intercepts and one $y$-intercept.  The length of the base along the $x$-axis is $3-(-2)=5$.  The height from this base is equal to the $y$-intercept, 18.  The area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 5\cdot 18=\boxed{45}$. The answer is $\boxed{45}$

**Solution:** 


This problem is a bit out of the ordinary for a simple computational solution. However, by understanding the conditions given, we can deduce that the points enclosed by the polygon are simply the set of all points where at least one of the two conditions holds:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first condition to hold, both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies that $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ or $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$. Solving these systems of equations, we find that the points that satisfy the first condition are $(5,5)$ and $(10,-5)$.

For the second condition to hold, both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies that $x = 8$ and $y = 8$. So the only point that satisfies the second condition is $(8,8)$.

So the points that enclose the polygon are $(5,5)$, $(10,-5)$, and $(8,8)$. These three points form a triangle. The length of the base of the triangle is $10 - (-5) = 15$ and the height of the triangle is $8 - 5 = 3$. The area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot 15 \cdot 3 = 22.5$. However, the area should be a positive integer, so there must be a mistake.

Upon reexamination, we realize that the absolute value functions make the given equations non-linear. This means that we cannot simply solve the equations as if they were linear. Instead, we need to consider the cases separately.

For the first condition, there are four cases to consider:
1. $x + y \geq 10$ and $x - y \geq 10$. In this case, the only solution is $(x, y) = (10, 0)$.
2. $x + y \geq 10$ and $x - y \leq -10$. In this case, the only solution is $(x, y) = (0, -10)$.
3. $x + y \leq 10$ and $x - y \geq 10$. In this case, the only solution is $(x, y) = (5, 5)$.
4. $x + y \leq 10$ and $x - y \leq -10$. In this case, the only solution is $(x, y) = (10, -5)$.

For the second condition, there are again four cases to consider:
1. $x \geq 8$ and $y \geq 8$. In this case, the only solution is $(x, y) = (8, 8)$.
2. $x \geq 8$ and $y \leq -8$. This case has no solution, as $y$ cannot be negative and greater than $8$ at the same time.
3. $x \leq -8$ and $y \geq 8$. This case has no solution, as $x$ cannot be negative and greater than $8$ at the same time.
4. $x \leq -8$ and $y \leq -8$. This case has no solution, as $y$ cannot be negative and greater than $8$ at the same time.

So the points that enclose the polygon are $(5,5)$, $(10,-5)$, and $(8,8)$. These three points form a triangle. The length of the base of the triangle is $10 - (-5) = 15$ and the height of the triangle is $8 - 5 = 3$. The area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot 15 \cdot 3 = 22.5$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"An ellipse is defined parametrically by
\[(x,y) = \left( \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t}, \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t} \right).\]Then the equation of the ellipse can be written in the form
\[Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0,\]where $A,$ $B,$ $C,$ $D,$ $E,$ and $F$ are integers, and $\gcd(|A|,|B|,|C|,|D|,|E|,|F|) = 1.$  Find $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F|.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
In the equation $y = \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\cos t$ to get
\[\cos t = \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3}.\]In the equation $x = \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\sin t$ to get
\[\sin t = \frac{1}{2} x (2 - \cos t) + 1 = \frac{1}{2} x \left( 2 - \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right) + 1 = 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)}.\]Since $\cos^2 t + \sin^2 t = 1,$
\[\left( \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right)^2 + \left( 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)} \right)^2 = 1.\]Multiplying both sides by $(2(y + 3))^2$ and expanding, it will simplify to
\[81x^2 - 36xy + 16y^2 - 108x + 240y + 900 = 0.\]Therefore, $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F| = 81 + 36 + 16 + 108 + 240 + 900 = \boxed{1381}.$ The answer is $\boxed{1381}$

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. For the product of two factors to be zero, either one of the factors must be zero. Therefore, we have two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which simplifies to $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. This gives us a square with side length 20, so its area is $20^2 = 400$.

From the second case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which simplifies to $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us a square with side length 16, so its area is $16^2 = 256$.

However, the area of the polygon formed by the intersection of these two squares is the sum of their areas minus twice the area of the intersection. The intersection of the two squares is another square with side length 8, so its area is $8^2 = 64$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $400 + 256 - 2 \cdot 64 = 536$.

The answer is: $536$

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:

Since $PQ=3w$, $RS=2x$ and $PQ=RS$ (because $PQRS$ is a rectangle), then $2x = 3w$, or $$w=\frac{2}{3}x.$$ Therefore, the area of each of the five identical rectangles is $$x\left(\frac{2}{3}x\right)=\frac{2}{3}x^2.$$ Since the area of $PQRS$ is 4000 and it is made up of five of these identical smaller rectangles, then $$5\left(\frac{2}{3}x^2\right)=4000$$ or $$\frac{10}{3}x^2 = 4000$$ or $x^2 = 1200$ or $x \approx 34.6$ which, when rounded off to the nearest integer, is $\boxed{35}.$ The answer is $\boxed{35}$

**Solution:**


This problem involves understanding the properties of absolute value and how they affect the behavior of the expressions in the given equation. 

The equation is defined as:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$

This equation will be equal to zero if and only if either both of the factors are equal to zero. 

The first factor is equal to zero if either $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. These equations simplify to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. 

The second factor is equal to zero if either $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. These equations simplify to $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The solutions to these equations are the points that lie on the square with vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(8, -8)$, and the points that lie on the square with vertices at $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, and $(0, -10)$. 

The intersection of these two squares is a square with side length 8 (the smaller square), so the area of the convex polygon is $8^2 = 64$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 64 square units.

**Solution:**


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the given equation is satisfied if either of the following two conditions holds:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first condition to hold, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us four equations:

1. $x + y = 10$.
2. $x + y = -10$.
3. $x - y = 10$.
4. $x - y = -10$.

Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon: $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, and $(-5,-5)$.

For the second condition to hold, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us four more vertices: $(8,0)$, $(-8,0)$, $(0,8)$, and $(0,-8)$.

Plotting these points, we see that they form a square with side length $10$. The area of the square is therefore $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is $\boxed{100}$.

## QUESTION 3 - 11

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"An ellipse is defined parametrically by
\[(x,y) = \left( \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t}, \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t} \right).\]Then the equation of the ellipse can be written in the form
\[Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0,\]where $A,$ $B,$ $C,$ $D,$ $E,$ and $F$ are integers, and $\gcd(|A|,|B|,|C|,|D|,|E|,|F|) = 1.$  Find $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F|.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
In the equation $y = \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\cos t$ to get
\[\cos t = \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3}.\]In the equation $x = \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\sin t$ to get
\[\sin t = \frac{1}{2} x (2 - \cos t) + 1 = \frac{1}{2} x \left( 2 - \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right) + 1 = 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)}.\]Since $\cos^2 t + \sin^2 t = 1,$
\[\left( \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right)^2 + \left( 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)} \right)^2 = 1.\]Multiplying both sides by $(2(y + 3))^2$ and expanding, it will simplify to
\[81x^2 - 36xy + 16y^2 - 108x + 240y + 900 = 0.\]Therefore, $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F| = 81 + 36 + 16 + 108 + 240 + 900 = \boxed{1381}.$ The answer is $\boxed{1381}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve, Abs

def polygon_area():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # The equation defines the vertices of the polygon
    vertices = solve([
        (Abs(x + y) - 10)**2 + (Abs(x - y) - 10)**2,
        (Abs(x) - 8)**2 + (Abs(y) - 8)**2
    ], (x, y), dict=True)

    # There are 8 vertices, including the origin (0, 0).
    # The polygon is a square with side length 16, so its area is 16^2 = 256.
    # Since the origin is not included in the polygon, we subtract its area.
    area = 256 - 0

    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is $\boxed{256}$.
