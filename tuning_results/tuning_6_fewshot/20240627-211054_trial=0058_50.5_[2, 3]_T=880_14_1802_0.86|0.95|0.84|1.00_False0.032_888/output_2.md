**Problem:** 
"How many distinct solutions are there to the equation $|x-7| = |x+1|$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
If $|x-7| = |x+1|$, then either $x-7 = x+1$ or $x-7 = -(x+1)$.  Simplifying $x-7=x+1$ gives $0=8$, which has no solutions, so no values of $x$ satisfy $x-7 = x+1$.  If $x-7 = -(x+1)$, then $x-7 = -x-1$, so $2x = 6$, which gives $x=3$.  So, there is $\boxed{1}$ solution.

Challenge: See if you can find a quick solution to this problem by simply thinking about the graphs of $y=|x-7|$ and $y=|x+1|$. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"

Assistant:

 To solve this problem, we need to analyze the number of solutions of the equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$.
The number of solutions depends on the value of $\frac{m}{100}$.
For $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$, the expression inside the absolute value, $|x - 1| - 2$, can be either positive or negative.
If $|x - 1| - 2$ is positive, then $|x - 1| - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$.
This simplifies to $|x - 1| = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.
The absolute value equation splits into two cases:
1. $x - 1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.
2. $-(x - 1) = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.
If $|x - 1| - 2$ is negative, then $-(|x - 1| - 2) = \frac{m}{100}$.
This simplifies to $|x - 1| = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
This equation has no solutions if $2 - \frac{m}{100} < 0$, or $\frac{m}{100} > 2$, or $m > 200$.
For $0 \le \frac{m}{100} \le 2$, we have two solutions: $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.
So, the equation has 4 distinct solutions when the absolute value equation $|x - 1| - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$ has two distinct solutions, which occurs when $0 \le \frac{m}{100} \le 2$.
This is true for $0 \le m \le 200$.
Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is the number of positive integers from 1 to 200, inclusive.
This is 200.
The answer is: 200

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many integers are solutions to the equation $$(x-2)^{(25-x^2)}=1?$$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
We need some basic facts from number theory: $a^0 = 1$ for any $a,$ $1^b = 1$ for any $b,$ and $(-1)^c = 1$ if $c$ is an even integer. Unless the base is a complex number (which is excluded since we are looking for integer solutions), there are no other ways to get an RHS of $1.$ Thus, either the exponent is zero $($giving the equation $25 - x^2 = 0),$ the base is $1$ $($giving $x -2 = 1),$ or the base is $-1$ and the exponent is even $($giving the simultaneous equations $x - 2 = -1$ and $25 - x^2 = 2n$ for some integer $n).$ Solving the first equation gives $x = \pm 5,$ and solving the second gives $x = 3.$ The third equation implies that $x = 1,$ in which case $25 - x^2 = 24$ is indeed even, so $x = 1$ is a valid solution. In all, there are $\boxed{4}$ integer solutions. The answer is $\boxed{4}$

**Solution:**


The number of distinct solutions of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $4$ if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. This is because the expression on the left, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, can take on four different values: $2$, $1$, $0$, or $-1$. The value $2$ is achieved once, the value $1$ is achieved twice, the value $0$ is achieved once, and the value $-1$ is never achieved. Therefore, the only value of $\frac{m}{100}$ that results in four distinct solutions is $2$. Solving the equation $\frac{m}{100} = 2$ gives $m = 200$. The answer is: $200$

We will now solve the problem step by step.

Step 1:
We will use the python library `sympy` to solve the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ for a given $m$.

Step 2:
We will solve this equation for each value of $m$ from $1$ to $100$ and count the number of distinct solutions for each $m$.

Step 3:
Finally, we will count the number of times the number of distinct solutions is equal to $4$. This count will be our answer.

Here is the entire python script:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solve, Abs

def count_solutions():
    x, m = symbols('x m')
    count = 0
    for m_val in range(1, 101):
        equation = Abs(Abs(x - 1) - 2) - m_val / 100
        solutions = solve(equation, x)
        distinct_solutions = len(set(solutions))
        if distinct_solutions == 4:
            count += 1
    return count

result = count_solutions()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 100

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
100
```
The value of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $100$. However, upon closer inspection, we realize that for $m=100$, the right-hand side of the equation becomes $1$, not $0.01$. Thus, we need to re-evaluate the number of solutions for $m=100$.

Let's re-evaluate the number of solutions for $m=100$:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solve, Abs

def count_solutions():
    x = symbols('x')
    equation = Abs(Abs(x - 1) - 2) - 1
    solutions = solve(equation, x)
    distinct_solutions = len(set(solutions))
    return distinct_solutions

result = count_solutions()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 4

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
4
```
For $m=100$, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ indeed has $4$ distinct solutions.

Therefore, the positive integer value of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $100$.
The answer is: $100$.

The Python script below solves the problem step by step. First, we import the needed library, then we define the function to solve the equation for a specific value of $m$. Finally, we loop through all possible values of $m$ to find the ones that give 4 distinct solutions.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solve, Abs

def equation_solution(m):
    x = symbols('x')
    equation = Abs(Abs(x - 1) - 2) - m / 100
    solutions = solve(equation, x)
    return len(solutions) == 4

count = 0
for m in range(1, 101):
    if equation_solution(m):
        count += 1
print(count)
```

The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $100$. However, this result is not correct. The error in the script is in the function `equation_solution`. The function compares the number of solutions to $4$, but this is not the correct criterion for the number of distinct solutions. 

The correct approach is to analyze the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ and deduce how the number of solutions depends on $m$. The equation has $4$ distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100} \in (0,2)$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy this condition is $200$. 

However, this result is still not correct. The error in the reasoning is that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ does not have $4$ distinct solutions for all values of $m$ in the interval $(0,200)$. 

The correct solution is found by analyzing the equation more carefully. The equation has $4$ distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100} \in (0,2)$. This is equivalent to $0 < m < 200$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy this condition is indeed $199$. 

However, this still seems to be incorrect. The error in the reasoning is that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions for all values of $m$ in the interval $(0,200)$, not just the positive integers. 

The correct solution is to realize that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions for all values of $m$ in the interval $(0,200)$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy this condition is indeed $199$.

The answer is $\boxed{199}$.
