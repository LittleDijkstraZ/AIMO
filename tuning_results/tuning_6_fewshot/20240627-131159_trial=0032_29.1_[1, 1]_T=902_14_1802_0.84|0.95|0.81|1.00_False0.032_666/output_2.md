**Problem:** 
"How many solutions does the equation \[\frac{(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)\dotsm(x-100)}{(x-1^2)(x-2^2)(x-3^2)\dotsm(x-100^2)} = 0\]have for $x$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Any solution to this equation must make the numerator of the left-hand side zero, while keeping the denominator non-zero. The numerator is zero when $x$ is one of the numbers $1, 2, 3, \dots, 100.$ However, for any value in this list that is a perfect square, the denominator will also be zero, so that value of $x$ will not be a root. Therefore, we want to find the number of integers in the list $1, 2, \dots, 100$ which are not perfect squares. The perfect squares in the list are $1^2, 2^2, \dots, 10^2,$ so there are $10$ perfect squares, and \[100 - 10 = \boxed{90}\]integers which are not perfect squares. The answer is $\boxed{90}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $| |x-1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

Let's denote $f(x) = |x - 1| - 2$. The equation $| |x-1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ can be rewritten as $f(f(x)) = \frac{m}{100}$.

To find the number of distinct solutions, we need to find the number of times the function $f(x)$ intersects the line $y = \frac{m}{100}$.

The function $f(x)$ is a piecewise function, defined as:
\[ f(x) = \begin{cases} 
      -(x-1) - 2 = -x + 1 - 2 = -x - 1 & \text{if } x < 1 \\
      (x-1) - 2 = x - 1 - 2 = x - 3 & \text{if } 1 \leq x < 3 \\
      -(x-1) - 2 = -x + 1 - 2 = -x - 1 & \text{if } x \geq 3
   \end{cases}
\]

So, $f(x)$ is a piecewise function with two parts: $f(x) = -x - 1$ if $x < 1$ or $x \geq 3$, and $f(x) = x - 3$ if $1 \leq x < 3$.

The function $f(x)$ intersects the line $y = \frac{m}{100}$ at $x = 1 - \frac{m}{100}$ for $f(x) = -x - 1$, and at $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ for $f(x) = x - 3$.

We want these two intersections to be distinct, which means $1 - \frac{m}{100} \neq 3 + \frac{m}{100}$. This simplifies to $m \neq 100$.

So, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $0 < m < 100$. The answer is the number of positive integers from 1 to 99, which is 99.

However, we need to check if the solutions for $x$ in the intervals $x < 1$, $1 \leq x < 3$, and $x \geq 3$ are all distinct.

For $x < 1$, we have $f(x) = -x - 1$, so $f(f(x)) = f(-x - 1) = -( -x - 1) - 1 = x + 1 - 1 = x$.

For $1 \leq x < 3$, we have $f(x) = x - 3$, so $f(f(x)) = f(x - 3) = (x - 3) - 3 = x - 6$.

For $x \geq 3$, we have $f(x) = -x - 1$, so $f(f(x)) = f(-x - 1) = -( -x - 1) - 1 = x + 1 - 1 = x$.

The solutions for $x$ in the intervals $x < 1$ and $x \geq 3$ are the same, but the solution for $x$ in the interval $1 \leq x < 3$ is different. Therefore, the 4 distinct solutions are the solutions to the equations $x = \frac{m}{100}$, $x - 6 = \frac{m}{100}$, with $x$ in the intervals $x < 1$ and $x \geq 3$.

This means that we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $0 < m < 100$ and $6\frac{m}{100} < 3$. This simplifies to $0 < m < 150$.

So, we need to find the number of positive integers from 1 to 149, which is 149.

However, we have double-counted the case $m = 100$, so we need to subtract 1 from 149.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $| |x-1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 148.

So, the positive integer value of $m$ is 148.
The answer is: $148$

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The problem asks for how many positive integers $m$ the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

The number of distinct solutions of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is determined by the value of $\frac{m}{100}$. Specifically, the equation has $4$ distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $2$, inclusive. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a graph that consists of four line segments, and the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly four solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is in the interval $(0, 2]$. Therefore, we need to find how many positive integers $m$ satisfy $1 \leq \frac{m}{100} \leq 2$. Multiplying all sides of the inequalities by $100$ gives $100 \leq m \leq 200$. The number of integers in the interval $[100, 200]$ is $101$. Therefore, there are $101$ positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. The answer is: $101$

To solve this problem, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $| |x-1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

Let's denote $f(x) = |x - 1| - 2$. The equation $| |x-1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ can be rewritten as $f(f(x)) = \frac{m}{100}$.

To find the number of distinct solutions, we need to find the number of times the function $f(x)$ intersects the line $y = \frac{m}{100}$.

The function $f(x)$ is a piecewise function, defined as:
\[ f(x) = \begin{cases} 
      -(x-1) - 2 = -x + 1 - 2 = -x - 1 & \text{if } x < 1 \\
      (x-1) - 2 = x - 1 - 2 = x - 3 & \text{if } 1 \leq x < 3 \\
      -(x-1) - 2 = -x + 1 - 2 = -x - 1 & \text{if } x \geq 3
   \end{cases}
\]

So, $f(x)$ is a piecewise function with two parts: $f(x) = -x - 1$ if $x < 1$ or $x \geq 3$, and $f(x) = x - 3$ if $1 \leq x < 3$.

The function $f(x)$ intersects the line $y = \frac{m}{100}$ at $x = 1 - \frac{m}{100}$ for $f(x) = -x - 1$, and at $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ for $f(x) = x - 3$.

We want these two intersections to be distinct, which means $1 - \frac{m}{100} \neq 3 + \frac{m}{100}$. This simplifies to $m \neq 100$.

So, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $0 < m < 100$. The answer is the number of positive integers from 1 to 99, which is 99.

However, we need to check if the solutions for $x$ in the intervals $x < 1$, $1 \leq x < 3$, and $x \geq 3$ are all distinct.

For $x < 1$, we have $f(x) = -x - 1$, so $f(f(x)) = f(-x - 1) = -( -x - 1) - 1 = x + 1 - 1 = x$.

For $1 \leq x < 3$, we have $f(x) = x - 3$, so $f(f(x)) = f(x - 3) = (x - 3) - 3 = x - 6$.

For $x \geq 3$, we have $f(x) = -x - 1$, so $f(f(x)) = f(-x - 1) = -( -x - 1) - 1 = x + 1 - 1 = x$.

The solutions for $x$ in the intervals $x < 1$ and $x \geq 3$ are the same, but the solution for $x$ in the interval $1 \leq x < 3$ is different. Therefore, the 4 distinct solutions are the solutions to the equations $x = \frac{m}{100}$, $x - 6 = \frac{m}{100}$, with $x$ in the intervals $x < 1$ and $x \geq 3$.

This means that we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $0 < m < 100$ and $6\frac{m}{100} < 3$. This simplifies to $0 < m < 150$.

So, we need to find the number of positive integers from 1 to 149, which is 149.

However, we have double-counted the case $m = 100$, so we need to subtract 1 from 149.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $| |x-1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 148.

So, the positive integer value of $m$ is 148.
The answer is: $148$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"For certain ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ of real numbers, the system of equations
\[\begin{aligned} ax+by&=1 \\ x^2 + y^2 &= 50  \end{aligned}\]has at least one solution, and each solution is an ordered pair $(x,y)\,$ of integers. How many such ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ are there?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The graph of $ax+by=1$ is a line, while the graph of $x^2+y^2=50$ is a circle centered at the origin. Therefore, $(a, b)$ satisfies the conditions if and only if the line and circle intersect at least once, and they intersect only at lattice points (points with integer coordinates).

Knowing this, it makes sense to look for lattice points on the circle whose equation is $x^2+y^2=50$. Testing cases, we find that there are twelve lattice points on the circle: $(\pm 1, \pm 7)$, $(\pm 7, \pm 1)$, and $(\pm 5, \pm 5)$ (where the two $\pm$ signs in each pair are independent of each other).

There are $\tbinom{12}{2} = 66$ pairs of these points, and each pair determines a line. However, the graph of $ax+by=1$ can never pass through the origin $(0, 0)$, since if $x=y=0$, then $ax+by=0 \neq 1$. Therefore, the six pairs which consist of diametrically opposed points are invalid, since the line through them passes through the origin. This corrects our count to $66 - 6 = 60$.

In addition, for each of the twelve points, there is a line tangent to the circle at that point, so that the only solution to the system is that one point. This brings the final total to $60 + 12 = \boxed{72}$. The answer is $\boxed{72}$

**Solution:** 



To solve this problem, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has $4$ distinct solutions. 

We start by analyzing the equation. The expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, can be either positive or negative. Let's consider these two cases separately.

Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 > 0$. In this case, the equation becomes \[\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}.\] Solving for $\vert x-1 \vert$, we get \[\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}.\] This means $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 = -2 - \frac{m}{100}$. Solving these two equations, we get $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Case 2: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0$. In this case, the equation becomes \[-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = \frac{m}{100}.\] Solving for $\vert x-1 \vert$, we get \[\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}.\] This means $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 = -2 + \frac{m}{100}$. Solving these two equations, we get $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

To have four distinct solutions, we need the ranges of $x$ from the four equations to be disjoint. This means the endpoints of the ranges must not coincide. Comparing the endpoints, we find that the only way to avoid coincidence is to have $2 + \frac{m}{100} = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which gives $m = 0$. However, $m$ cannot be $0$, so there is no solution in this case.

Therefore, we must be in the situation where the ranges of $x$ from the four equations overlap. This means the endpoints of the ranges coincide. Comparing the endpoints, we find that the only way to make the ranges coincide is to have $2 + \frac{m}{100} = 3$ and $2 - \frac{m}{100} = 1$, which gives $m = 100$.

So, there is only one value of $m$ that gives four distinct solutions, namely $m = 100$. The answer is: 1

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def count_positive_integers():
    # The only value of m that gives four distinct solutions is m = 100.
    return 1

Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
If $|x-7| = |x+1|$, then either $x-7 = x+1$ or $x-7 = -(x+1)$.  Simplifying $x-7=x+1$ gives $0=8$, which has no solutions, so no values of $x$ satisfy $x-7 = x+1$.  If $x-7 = -(x+1)$, then $x-7 = -x-1$, so $2x = 6$, which gives $x=3$.  So, there is $\boxed{1}$ solution.

**Solution:** 


The problem involves finding the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions. 

Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Since the right side of the equation is always positive, the left side must also be positive. This implies that $\vert x-1 \vert -2 > 0$, or $\vert x-1 \vert > 2$. The solutions to this inequality are $x < -1$ or $x > 3$.

2. We can now split the absolute value expression on the left side of the equation:
   - If $x < -1$, the equation becomes $\vert -(x-1) - 2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\vert -x + 1 - 2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$ or $\vert -x - 1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$. This further simplifies to $\vert x + 1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$. The solutions to this equation are $x = -\frac{m}{100} - 1$ and $x = \frac{m}{100} - 1$. Since $x < -1$, we are interested in $x = -\frac{m}{100} - 1$.
   - If $x > 3$, the equation becomes $\vert x - 1 - 2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\vert x - 3 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$. The solutions to this equation are $x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$ and $x = -\frac{m}{100} + 3$. Since $x > 3$, we are interested in $x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$.

3. The solutions from the two cases above must satisfy the original inequality $x < -1$ or $x > 3$. For the first case, $-\frac{m}{100} - 1 < -1$, which simplifies to $-\frac{m}{100} < 0$, or $m > 0$. For the second case, $\frac{m}{100} + 3 > 3$, which simplifies to $\frac{m}{100} > 0$, or $m > 0$. Both conditions are satisfied for all positive $m$, so we only need to count the number of positive integer values of $m$ that give 4 distinct solutions.

4. The equation $\vert x + 1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$ has two solutions: $x = -\frac{m}{100} - 1$ and $x = \frac{m}{100} - 1$. The equation $\vert x - 3 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$ also has two solutions: $x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$ and $x = -\frac{m}{100} + 3$. So, the original equation has 4 distinct solutions.

5. Now we need to count the number of positive integer values of $m$ for which the original equation has 4 distinct solutions. We can do this by trial and error. By trying different values of $m$, we find that $m = 200$ is the only value that works.

So, there is only 1 positive integer $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. The value of $m$ is 200.

However, the question asks for how many positive integers $m$ satisfy this condition, so the answer is 1. The final answer is $\boxed{1}$.
