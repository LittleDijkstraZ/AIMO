**Problem:** 
"If $x + 2y= 4$ and $xy = -8$, what is the value of $x^2 + 4y^2$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
We see that $(x + 2y)^2 = (x^2 + 4y^2) + 4xy = 4^2 = 16$. We want to find $x^2 + 4y^2$ and are given $xy = -8$. So, $x^2 + 4y^2 + 4xy = x^2 + 4y^2 + 4(-8) = 16$. It follows that $x^2 + 4y^2 = \boxed{48}$. The answer is $\boxed{48}$

**Problem**
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


This problem is a bit complex and requires some mathematical insights. However, we can solve it using the following steps:

Step 1: We can rewrite the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$ by noting that $|a| = |-a|$.

Step 2: By the triangle inequality, we know that $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$. So, we have $|x-2y| + |2y-x| \geq |(x-2y) + (2y-x)| = |0| = 0$.

Step 3: But we are given that $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$, so we must have equality in the triangle inequality. This means that the signs of $x-2y$ and $2y-x$ must be the same, which implies that $x-2y$ and $2y-x$ must be either both positive or both negative.

Step 4: If they are both positive, then $x-2y = 2y-x$, which implies $x = 2y$. If they are both negative, then $x-2y = -(2y-x)$, which also implies $x = 2y$. So in both cases, we have $x = 2y$.

Step 5: Substituting $x = 2y$ into the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we get $|2y-y| + |y-4y| = 40$, which simplifies to $|y| + |-3y| = 40$, or $|y| + 3|y| = 40$, or $4|y| = 40$, or $|y| = 10$.

Step 6: Since $y$ can be either positive or negative, we have two possible solutions: $y = 10$ and $y = -10$. For $y = 10$, we have $x = 2y = 20$. For $y = -10$, we have $x = 2y = -20$.

Step 7: Now we substitute these values into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to find the minimum value. For $x = 20$ and $y = 10$, we get $5(20)^2 + 5(10)^2 - 8(20)(10) = 2000 + 500 - 1600 = 2400$. For $x = -20$ and $y = -10$, we get $5(-20)^2 + 5(-10)^2 - 8(-20)(-10) = 2000 + 500 - 1600 = 2400$.

Step 8: So in both cases, the value of the expression is 2400. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 2400.

**Problem:** 
"What is the minimum value of the expression $2x^2+3y^2+8x-24y+62$ for real $x$ and $y$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Rearranging the expression, we have  \[2x^2+8x+3y^2-24y+62\]We first complete the square in $x$. Factoring a 2 from the first two terms of the expression, we get  \[2(x^2+4x)+3y^2-24y+62\]In order for the expression inside the parenthesis to be a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(4/2)^2=4$ inside the parenthesis. Doing this, we have \[2(x^2+4x+4-4)+3y^2-24y+62 \Rightarrow 2(x+2)^2+3y^2-24y+54\]Now we complete the square in $y$. Factoring a 3 from the $y$ terms in the expression, we get \[2(x+2)^2+3(y^2-8y)+54\]In order for the expression inside the second parenthesis to be a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(8/2)^2=16$ inside the parenthesis. Doing this, we have \[2(x+2)^2+3(y^2-8y+16-16)+54 \Rightarrow 2(x+2)^2+3(y-4)^2+6\]Since the minimum value of $2(x+2)^2$ and $3(y-4)^2$ is $0$ (perfect squares can never be negative), the minimum value of the entire expression is $\boxed{6}$, and is achieved when $x=-2$ and $y=4$. The answer is $\boxed{6}$

Let's think step by step:
Rearranging the expression, we have  \[2x^2+8x+3y^2-24y+62\]We first complete the square in $x$. Factoring a 2 from the first two terms of the expression, we get  \[2(x^2+4x)+3y^2-24y+62\]In order for the expression inside the parenthesis to be a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(4/2)^2=4$ inside the parenthesis. Doing this, we have \[2(x^2+4x+4-4)+3y^2-24y+62 \Rightarrow 2(x+2)^2+3y^2-24y+54\]Now we complete the square in $y$. Factoring a 3 from the $y$ terms in the expression, we get \[2(x+2)^2+3(y^2-8y)+54\]In order for the expression inside the second parenthesis to be a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(8/2)^2=16$ inside the parenthesis. Doing this, we have \[2(x+2)^2+3(y^2-8y+16-16)+54 \Rightarrow 2(x+2)^2+3(y-4)^2+6\]Since the minimum value of $2(x+2)^2$ and $3(y-4)^2$ is $0$ (perfect squares can never be negative), the minimum value of the entire expression is $\boxed{6}$, and is achieved when $x=-2$ and $y=4$.

**Problem**
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


This problem is a bit too complex to solve with simple Python code. However, we can solve it using the method of completing the square.

First, let's rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2$.

Next, we can substitute $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ into the equation. Since $|a| + |b| = 40$, we know that $a$ and $b$ have the same absolute value, which means $a = b$ or $a = -b$. So we have two cases to consider:

1. If $x - 2y = y - 2x$, then we can solve this equation to get $x = 4y/3$. Substitute this into the expression, we get $(4y/3 - 2y)^2 + (y - 2*4y/3)^2 = (y/3)^2 + (-y/3)^2 = 2/9 * y^2$.

2. If $x - 2y = -(y - 2x)$, then we can solve this equation to get $x = -2y/3$. Substitute this into the expression, we get $(-2y/3 - 2y)^2 + (y - 2*(-2y/3))^2 = (-8y/3)^2 + (5y/3)^2 = 89/9 * y^2$.

Now, we need to find the minimum value of $2/9 * y^2$ and $89/9 * y^2$. Since $2/9 < 89/9$, the minimum value is achieved when $x = 4y/3$.

Substitute $x = 4y/3$ into the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we get $|4y/3 - 2y| + |y - 2*4y/3| = 40$, which simplifies to $|y/3| + |-y/3| = 40$, which is true for all real numbers $y$.

So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is achieved when $x = 4y/3$. Substitute $x = 4y/3$ into the expression, we get $(4y/3 - 2y)^2 + (y - 2*4y/3)^2 = (y/3)^2 + (-y/3)^2 = 2/9 * y^2$.

To find the minimum value of $2/9 * y^2$, we can take the derivative with respect to $y$ and set it to zero. The derivative of $2/9 * y^2$ is $4/9 * y$, set it to zero, we get $y = 0$. Substitute $y = 0$ into the expression, we get $2/9 * 0^2 = 0$.

So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0.
The answer is: $0$

**Problem**
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is equivalent to $|x-2y| = |2x-y|$, which implies that $x-2y = \pm(2x-y)$.
If $x-2y = 2x-y$, then $y = x$, and if $x-2y = -(2x-y)$, then $x = 2y$.
So either $x = y$ or $x = 2y$.
Now, we substitute $x = y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to get $5x^2+5x^2-8x^2 = 2x^2$.
And we substitute $x = 2y$ into the expression to get $5(2y)^2+5y^2-8(2y)(y) = 20y^2+5y^2-16y^2 = 9y^2$.
Since $x$ and $y$ are real numbers, both $2x^2$ and $9y^2$ are non-negative.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0, which occurs when $x = y$ or $x = 2y$.
However, we need to find the minimum value under the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
By trying some values, we find that when $x = 10$ and $y = 5$, the constraint is satisfied.
So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the given constraint is $5(10)^2+5(5)^2-8(10)(5) = 500+125-400 = 225$.
The answer is: $0$

**Problem:** 
"What is the minimum value of the expression $x^2+y^2+2x-4y+8$ for real $x$ and $y$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Rearranging the expression, we have  \[x^2+2x+y^2-4y+8\]Completing the square in $x$, we need to add and subtract $(2/2)^2=1$. Completing the square in $y$, we need to add and subtract $(4/2)^2=4$. Thus, we have \[(x^2+2x+1)-1+(y^2-4y+4)-4+8 \Rightarrow (x+1)^2+(y-2)^2+3\]Since the minimum value of $(x+1)^2$ and $(y-2)^2$ is $0$ (perfect squares can never be negative), the minimum value of the entire expression is $\boxed{3}$, and is achieved when $x=-1$ and $y=2$. The answer is $\boxed{3}$
