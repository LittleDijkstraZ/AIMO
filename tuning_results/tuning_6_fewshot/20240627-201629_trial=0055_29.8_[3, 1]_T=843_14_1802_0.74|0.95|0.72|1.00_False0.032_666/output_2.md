**Problem:** 
"Let \[f(x) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
-x + 3 & \text{if } x \le 0, \\
2x - 5 & \text{if } x > 0.
\end{array}
\right.\]How many solutions does the equation $f(f(x)) = 4$ have?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
To solve the equation $f(f(x)) = 4,$ we first find the values $x$ such that $f(x) = 4.$

Either $f(x) = -x + 3$ (for $x \le 0$) or $f(x) = 2x - 5$ (for $x > 0$). If $-x + 3 = 4,$ then $x = -1.$ Note that this value satisfies $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = 4,$ then $x = 9/2.$ Note that this value satisfies $x > 0.$ Therefore, the solutions to $f(x) = 4$ are $x = -1$ and $x = 9/2.$

Next, we solve for the values $x$ such that $f(x) = -1.$ If $-x + 3 = -1,$ then $x = 4.$ This value does not satisfy $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = -1,$ then $x = 2.$ This value satisfies $x > 0.$

Finally, we solve for the values $x$ such that $f(x) = 9/2.$ If $-x + 3 = 9/2,$ then $x = -3/2.$ This value satisfies $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = 9/2,$ then $x = 19/4.$ This value satisfies $x > 0.$

Therefore, the equation $f(f(x)) = 4$ has the solutions $x = 2,$ $-3/2,$ and $19/4,$ for a total of $\boxed{3}$ solutions. The answer is $\boxed{3}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if the number $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 1 and 2. This is because the function $| |x - 1| - 2 |$ has a graph that consists of two 'V's, each with a width of 1 unit. The equation has 4 distinct solutions when the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between the heights of these 'V's, which are 1 and 2.

So, we want to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Multiplying all sides of the inequalities by 100 gives $100 < m < 200$. The number of positive integers in this range is $200 - 100 - 1 = 99$.

So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 99. The answer is: $99$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many solutions does the equation \[\frac{(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)\dotsm(x-100)}{(x-1^2)(x-2^2)(x-3^2)\dotsm(x-100^2)} = 0\]have for $x$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Any solution to this equation must make the numerator of the left-hand side zero, while keeping the denominator non-zero. The numerator is zero when $x$ is one of the numbers $1, 2, 3, \dots, 100.$ However, for any value in this list that is a perfect square, the denominator will also be zero, so that value of $x$ will not be a root. Therefore, we want to find the number of integers in the list $1, 2, \dots, 100$ which are not perfect squares. The perfect squares in the list are $1^2, 2^2, \dots, 10^2,$ so there are $10$ perfect squares, and \[100 - 10 = \boxed{90}\]integers which are not perfect squares. The answer is $\boxed{90}$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many integers are solutions to the equation $$(x-2)^{(25-x^2)}=1?$$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
We need some basic facts from number theory: $a^0 = 1$ for any $a,$ $1^b = 1$ for any $b,$ and $(-1)^c = 1$ if $c$ is an even integer. Unless the base is a complex number (which is excluded since we are looking for integer solutions), there are no other ways to get an RHS of $1.$ Thus, either the exponent is zero $($giving the equation $25 - x^2 = 0),$ the base is $1$ $($giving $x -2 = 1),$ or the base is $-1$ and the exponent is even $($giving the simultaneous equations $x - 2 = -1$ and $25 - x^2 = 2n$ for some integer $n).$ Solving the first equation gives $x = \pm 5,$ and solving the second gives $x = 3.$ The third equation implies that $x = 1,$ in which case $25 - x^2 = 24$ is indeed even, so $x = 1$ is a valid solution. In all, there are $\boxed{4}$ integer solutions. The answer is $\boxed{4}$

**Solution:** 



The problem involves the absolute value function and the equation with four distinct solutions. Sympy does not have a built-in function for absolute value, but we can easily define it using the Heaviside step function. The Heaviside step function, `H(x)`, is defined as 0 for `x < 0` and 1 for `x >= 0`. Therefore, `abs(x) = x * H(x) + (-x) * (1 - H(x))`. We will use this to rewrite the absolute value function in our equation.

First, we will define a function `num_solutions()` to calculate the number of distinct solutions for a given value of $m$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve, Heaviside

def num_solutions(m):
    x = symbols('x')
    # Define the absolute value function using the Heaviside step function
    abs_x = x * Heaviside(x) - x * Heaviside(-x)
    # Define the equation
    equation = Eq(abs(abs_x - 2), m / 100)
    # Solve the equation
    solutions = solve(equation, x)
    # Count the number of distinct solutions
    num_sol = len(set(solutions))
    return num_sol

# Use a for loop to iterate over the possible values of m
# and count the number of solutions for each value
num_solutions_count = 0
for m in range(1, 101):
    if num_solutions(m) == 4:
        num_solutions_count += 1

print(num_solutions_count)
```

**Solution:** 


The problem asks us to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

To solve this problem, we can use the property of absolute value function that if $f(x) = |g(x)|$, then the equation $f(x) = k$ has the same number of solutions as the equation $g(x) = k$ or $g(x) = -k$.

So, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is equivalent to the following two equations:
1. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$
2. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$

For each of these equations, we can further split them into two cases:
1.1. $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$
1.2. $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$
2.1. $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$
2.2. $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$

For each of these cases, we can further split them into two sub-cases based on the absolute value:
1.1.1. $x - 1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$
1.1.2. $x - 1 = -(2 + \frac{m}{100})$
1.2.1. $x - 1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$
1.2.2. $x - 1 = -(2 - \frac{m}{100})$
2.1.1. $x - 1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$
2.1.2. $x - 1 = -(2 - \frac{m}{100})$
2.2.1. $x - 1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$
2.2.2. $x - 1 = -(2 + \frac{m}{100})$

Solving these equations, we can find the values of $x$ for each case and then count the number of distinct solutions.

After solving these equations and counting the number of distinct solutions, we find that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions when $m = 100$.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $1$. The answer is $\boxed{1}$.
