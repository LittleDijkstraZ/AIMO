Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The equation is equal to zero if either of the two factors is zero.
2. Each of the factors is a product of two terms, each of which is a squared absolute value minus a constant.
3. For each factor, if either of the terms is zero, the whole factor is zero.
4. The term $\vert x + y \vert - 10$ is zero when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
5. Similarly, the term $\vert x - y \vert - 10$ is zero when $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
6. The term $\vert x \vert - 8$ is zero when $\vert x \vert = 8$, which implies $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
7. The term $\vert y \vert - 8$ is zero when $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.
8. These conditions define a square with vertices at $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,-8)$, and $(-8,8)$.
9. The area of this square is $16 \times 16 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256.

    # The vertices of the square are (8,8), (8,-8), (-8,-8), and (-8,8)
    # The side length of the square is 16
    side_length = 16

    # The area of the square is side_length^2
    area = side_length**2

    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

The area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is $\boxed{256}$.

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.
The first term is zero when $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which simplifies to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
The second term is zero when $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which simplifies to $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The solutions to these equations are the vertices of a square with side length 16.
The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many square units are in the area of the triangle whose vertices are the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the curve $y = (x-3)^2 (x+2)$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we need to find where this curve intersects the $x$ and $y$ axes.  If $y=0$, then $(x-3)^2(x+2)=0$, which has solutions of $x=3$ and $x=-2$.  If $x=0$, then $y=(-3)^2(2)=18$.  So, the curve has two $x$-intercepts and one $y$-intercept.  The length of the base along the $x$-axis is $3-(-2)=5$.  The height from this base is equal to the $y$-intercept, 18.  The area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 5\cdot 18=\boxed{45}$. The answer is $\boxed{45}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

The first term is zero when $|\pm x \pm y| - 10 = 0$, which simplifies to $|\pm x \pm y| = 10$. This gives us four equations: $|x + y| = 10$, $|x - y| = 10$, $|x| = 8$, and $|y| = 8$. The solutions to these equations are the vertices of a square with side length 16.

The second term is zero when $|\pm x| - 8 = 0$ or $|\pm y| - 8 = 0$, which simplifies to $|x| = 8$ or $|y| = 8$. These are the same conditions we already found for the vertices of the square.

So, the points that satisfy the given equation are the vertices of a square with side length 16. The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

The area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is $\boxed{256}$.
