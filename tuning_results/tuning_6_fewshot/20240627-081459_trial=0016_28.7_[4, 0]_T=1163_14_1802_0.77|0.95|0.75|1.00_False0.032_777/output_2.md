**Problem:** 
"How many distinct solutions are there to the equation $|x-7| = |x+1|$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
If $|x-7| = |x+1|$, then either $x-7 = x+1$ or $x-7 = -(x+1)$.  Simplifying $x-7=x+1$ gives $0=8$, which has no solutions, so no values of $x$ satisfy $x-7 = x+1$.  If $x-7 = -(x+1)$, then $x-7 = -x-1$, so $2x = 6$, which gives $x=3$.  So, there is $\boxed{1}$ solution.

Challenge: See if you can find a quick solution to this problem by simply thinking about the graphs of $y=|x-7|$ and $y=|x+1|$. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



To solve this problem, we need to find the value of $m$ for which the equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. 

The expression $| |x - 1| - 2 |$ represents the distance between $x$ and $1$, minus $2$, and then taking the absolute value of that. The graph of this expression has three "pieces":

1. For $x < -1$, the expression simplifies to $-(x - 1) - 2 = -x - 1$, so the graph is a line with slope $-1$ and $y$-intercept at $-1$.
2. For $-1 \leq x \leq 3$, the expression simplifies to $(x - 1) - 2 = x - 3$, so the graph is a line with slope $1$ and $y$-intercept at $-3$.
3. For $x > 3$, the expression simplifies to $(x - 1) - 2 = x - 3$, so the graph is a line with slope $1$ and $y$-intercept at $-3$.

The equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when the line $y = \frac{m}{100}$ intersects the graph of $| |x - 1| - 2 |$ in 4 different places. 

From the graph, we can see that this happens when $\frac{m}{100} = 1$. So, $m = 100$. 

Therefore, the value of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 100. The answer is: $100$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be rewritten as two cases:
- Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$
- Case 2: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$

For each case, we solve the equation inside the absolute value first:

- Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$
- Case 2: $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$

For each case, we again solve the absolute value equations:

- Case 1: $x - 1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x - 1 = -(2 + \frac{m}{100})$
- Case 2: $x - 1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ or $x - 1 = -(2 - \frac{m}{100})$

Solving these equations gives us four distinct solutions if and only if the following conditions are met:

- $0 < 2 + \frac{m}{100} < 1$ (for Case 1)
- $0 < 2 - \frac{m}{100} < 1$ (for Case 2)
- $2 + \frac{m}{100} > 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ (to ensure distinct solutions)

Solving these inequalities, we find that $0 < m < 100$. Thus, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy these conditions is 100. However, we must exclude the values of $m$ that would result in a degenerate solution (i.e., where the absolute value equations have only one solution). This occurs when $2 + \frac{m}{100} = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, or $m = 0$. So, we exclude this value and are left with 99 possible values of $m$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 99.
The answer is: $99$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, we need to understand that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have 4 distinct solutions if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. This is because the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, will be equal to 2 or -2. So, we get $\frac{m}{100} = 2$.

2. To find the value of m, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 100 to get $m = 200$.

So, there is only one value of m for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions, and that is 200.

But we need to check if this value is valid by plugging it back into the original equation and confirming that it indeed has 4 distinct solutions.

Now, let's solve the problem using Python and Sympy:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Eq, Abs, solveset, S

def solve_equation():
    x, m = symbols('x m')
    equation = Eq(Abs(Abs(x - 1) - 2), m / 100)

    # Plug m = 200 into the equation
    equation_with_m = equation.subs(m, 200)

    # Find the solutions for x
    solutions = solveset(equation_with_m, x, domain=S.Reals)

    # Check if the number of solutions is 4
    if len(solutions) == 4:
        return 200

result = solve_equation()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS None

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
None
```

The above code doesn't give the correct result because it doesn't check if the solutions are distinct. Let's modify the code to do that:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Eq, Abs, solveset, S, simplify

def solve_equation():
    x, m = symbols('x m')
    equation = Eq(Abs(Abs(x - 1) - 2), m / 100)

    # Plug m = 200 into the equation
    equation_with_m = equation.subs(m, 200)

    # Find the solutions for x
    solutions = solveset(equation_with_m, x, domain=S.Reals)

    # Check if the number of solutions is 4 and if the solutions are distinct
    if len(solutions) == 4 and all(simplify(sol1 - sol2) != 0 for sol1 in solutions for sol2 in solutions if sol1 != sol2):
        return 200

result = solve_equation()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS None

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output

```

The above code still doesn't give the correct result because it doesn't check if the solutions are real. Let's modify the code to do that:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Eq, Abs, solveset, S, simplify, re, im

def solve_equation():
    x, m = symbols('x m')
    equation = Eq(Abs(Abs(x - 1) - 2), m / 100)

    # Plug m = 200 into the equation
    equation_with_m = equation.subs(m, 200)

    # Find the solutions for x
    solutions = solveset(equation_with_m, x, domain=S.Reals)

    # Check if the number of solutions is 4 and if the solutions are distinct and real
    if len(solutions) == 4 and all(im(sol) == 0 for sol in solutions) and all(simplify(sol1 - sol2) != 0 for sol1 in solutions for sol2 in solutions if sol1 != sol2):
        return 200

result = solve_equation()
print(result)
``````output

CODE RESULTS None

INTERMEDIATE OUT :

The above code still doesn't give the correct result because it doesn't check if the solutions are positive. Let's modify the code to do that:

```python

    equation_with_m = equation.subs(m, 200)

    # Find the solutions for x
    solutions = solveset(equation_with_m, x, domain=S.Reals)

    # Check if the number of solutions is 4 and if the solutions are distinct, real and positive
    if len(solutions) == 4 and all(im(sol) == 0 for sol in solutions) and all(simplify(sol1 - sol2) != 0 for sol1 in solutions for sol2 in solutions if sol1 != sol2) and all(re(sol) > 0 for sol in solutions):
        return 200

result = solve_equation()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS None

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
None
```

The above code still doesn't give the correct result because it doesn't check if the solutions are within the range of the absolute value inside the outer absolute value, i.e., $0 \le x-1 \le 3$. Let's modify the code to do that:

```python

    # Find the solutions for x
    solutions = solveset(equation_with_m, x, domain=S.Reals)

    # Check if the number of solutions is 4 and if the solutions are distinct, real, positive and within the range of the absolute value inside the outer absolute value
    if len(solutions) == 4 and all(im(sol) == 0 for sol in solutions) and all(simplify(sol1 - sol2) != 0 for sol1 in solutions for sol2 in solutions if sol1 != sol2) and all(re(sol) > 0 for sol in solutions) and all(0 <= re(sol) - 1 and re(sol) - 1 <= 3 for sol in solutions):

The above code still doesn't give the correct result because it doesn't check if the solutions are within the range of the absolute value inside the inner absolute value, i.e., $0 \le x-1$ or $x-1 \le 0$. Let's modify the code to do that:

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many integers are solutions to the equation $$(x-2)^{(25-x^2)}=1?$$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
We need some basic facts from number theory: $a^0 = 1$ for any $a,$ $1^b = 1$ for any $b,$ and $(-1)^c = 1$ if $c$ is an even integer. Unless the base is a complex number (which is excluded since we are looking for integer solutions), there are no other ways to get an RHS of $1.$ Thus, either the exponent is zero $($giving the equation $25 - x^2 = 0),$ the base is $1$ $($giving $x -2 = 1),$ or the base is $-1$ and the exponent is even $($giving the simultaneous equations $x - 2 = -1$ and $25 - x^2 = 2n$ for some integer $n).$ Solving the first equation gives $x = \pm 5,$ and solving the second gives $x = 3.$ The third equation implies that $x = 1,$ in which case $25 - x^2 = 24$ is indeed even, so $x = 1$ is a valid solution. In all, there are $\boxed{4}$ integer solutions. The answer is $\boxed{4}$
