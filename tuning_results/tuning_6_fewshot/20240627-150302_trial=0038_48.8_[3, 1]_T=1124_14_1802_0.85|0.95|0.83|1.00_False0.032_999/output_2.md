The problem is asking for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. 

First, let's consider the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. The right-hand side, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be positive, so $m$ must be positive. The left-hand side, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, is a piecewise function with $4$ cases to consider.

The piecewise function can be written as:
- If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 \geq 0$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \vert x-1 \vert - 2$.
- If $0 \leq \vert x-1 \vert -2 < 1$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = 2 - \vert x-1 \vert$.
- If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = 2 - \vert x-1 \vert$.
- If $2 - \vert x-1 \vert < 0$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \vert x-1 \vert - 2$.

By analyzing these cases, we find that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions when $0 < m < 100$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ is $100$.

The answer is: $100$

To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. The value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be greater than $0$ and less than or equal to $2$ for the equation to have $4$ solutions. Therefore, we have $0<\frac{m}{100} \leq 2$. Multiplying all sides of the inequality by $100$, we get $0<m\leq 200$. Now we need to find the number of positive integer values of $m$ that satisfy this inequality. 

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solve

def find_m():
    m = symbols('m')
    # Find the number of positive integer values of m
    num_m = solve(m - 200, m)[0] - solve(m, m)[0] + 1
    return num_m

result = find_m()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 201

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
201
```
But since $m$ must be less than or equal to $200$, the number of positive integer values of $m$ that satisfy the inequality is $200$. 

So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $200$. The answer is: $\boxed{200}$.

 The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is a piecewise function that has four cases depending on the value of $x$:
- If $x < 1$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \vert -x + 1 - 2 \vert = \vert -x - 1 \vert = x + 1 + 2 = x + 3$.
- If $1 \leq x < 3$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \vert x - 1 - 2 \vert = \vert x - 3 \vert = 3 - x$.
- If $3 \leq x < 5$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \vert x - 1 - 2 \vert = \vert x - 3 \vert = x - 3$.
- If $x \geq 5$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \vert x - 1 - 2 \vert = \vert x - 3 \vert = x - 3 - 2 = x - 5$.

Therefore, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 3$, $\frac{m}{100} = 1$, $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, or $\frac{m}{100} = 5$. Solving these equations gives $m = 300$, $m = 100$, $m = 200$, and $m = 500$. Therefore, the number of such positive integers $m$ is $4$. The answer is: $4$

## QUESTION 2 - 3

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"For certain ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ of real numbers, the system of equations
\[\begin{aligned} ax+by&=1 \\ x^2 + y^2 &= 50  \end{aligned}\]has at least one solution, and each solution is an ordered pair $(x,y)\,$ of integers. How many such ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ are there?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The graph of $ax+by=1$ is a line, while the graph of $x^2+y^2=50$ is a circle centered at the origin. Therefore, $(a, b)$ satisfies the conditions if and only if the line and circle intersect at least once, and they intersect only at lattice points (points with integer coordinates).

Knowing this, it makes sense to look for lattice points on the circle whose equation is $x^2+y^2=50$. Testing cases, we find that there are twelve lattice points on the circle: $(\pm 1, \pm 7)$, $(\pm 7, \pm 1)$, and $(\pm 5, \pm 5)$ (where the two $\pm$ signs in each pair are independent of each other).

There are $\tbinom{12}{2} = 66$ pairs of these points, and each pair determines a line. However, the graph of $ax+by=1$ can never pass through the origin $(0, 0)$, since if $x=y=0$, then $ax+by=0 \neq 1$. Therefore, the six pairs which consist of diametrically opposed points are invalid, since the line through them passes through the origin. This corrects our count to $66 - 6 = 60$.

In addition, for each of the twelve points, there is a line tangent to the circle at that point, so that the only solution to the system is that one point. This brings the final total to $60 + 12 = \boxed{72}$. The answer is $\boxed{72}$

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we will first try to solve the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ for a few values of $m$ and observe the number of distinct solutions. Then, we will try to find a pattern in the number of solutions with respect to $m$.

Let's start with $m=1$:
\[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{1}{100}\]
This equation has $4$ distinct solutions: $x = 0.99, 1.01, 3.01, 3.99$.

Now let's try $m=2$:
\[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{2}{100}\]
This equation also has $4$ distinct solutions: $x = 0.98, 1.02, 3.02, 3.98$.

By examining these few examples, we can observe a pattern: the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions for every positive integer $m$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is equal to the number of positive integers, which is infinite. However, the problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions in the range $1 \leq m \leq 100$.

To find the number of such $m$, we can simply count the number of positive integers in this range. There are $100$ positive integers from $1$ to $100$, inclusive. So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions in the range $1 \leq m \leq 100$ is $100$.
The answer is $\boxed{100}$.
