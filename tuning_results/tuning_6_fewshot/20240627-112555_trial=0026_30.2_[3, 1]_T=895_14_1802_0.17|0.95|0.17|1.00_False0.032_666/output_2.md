**Problem:** 
"How many integers are solutions to the equation $$(x-2)^{(25-x^2)}=1?$$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
We need some basic facts from number theory: $a^0 = 1$ for any $a,$ $1^b = 1$ for any $b,$ and $(-1)^c = 1$ if $c$ is an even integer. Unless the base is a complex number (which is excluded since we are looking for integer solutions), there are no other ways to get an RHS of $1.$ Thus, either the exponent is zero $($giving the equation $25 - x^2 = 0),$ the base is $1$ $($giving $x -2 = 1),$ or the base is $-1$ and the exponent is even $($giving the simultaneous equations $x - 2 = -1$ and $25 - x^2 = 2n$ for some integer $n).$ Solving the first equation gives $x = \pm 5,$ and solving the second gives $x = 3.$ The third equation implies that $x = 1,$ in which case $25 - x^2 = 24$ is indeed even, so $x = 1$ is a valid solution. In all, there are $\boxed{4}$ integer solutions. The answer is $\boxed{4}$

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $2$. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a graph that is a series of "steps" of height $1$ unit, and the equation has $4$ solutions when the right-hand side is strictly between $1$ and $2$. Therefore, we have $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which implies $100 < m < 200$. The number of positive integers $m$ in this range is $100$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $100$. The answer is: $100$

## QUESTION 2 - 1

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"For certain ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ of real numbers, the system of equations
\[\begin{aligned} ax+by&=1 \\ x^2 + y^2 &= 50  \end{aligned}\]has at least one solution, and each solution is an ordered pair $(x,y)\,$ of integers. How many such ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ are there?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The graph of $ax+by=1$ is a line, while the graph of $x^2+y^2=50$ is a circle centered at the origin. Therefore, $(a, b)$ satisfies the conditions if and only if the line and circle intersect at least once, and they intersect only at lattice points (points with integer coordinates).

Knowing this, it makes sense to look for lattice points on the circle whose equation is $x^2+y^2=50$. Testing cases, we find that there are twelve lattice points on the circle: $(\pm 1, \pm 7)$, $(\pm 7, \pm 1)$, and $(\pm 5, \pm 5)$ (where the two $\pm$ signs in each pair are independent of each other).

There are $\tbinom{12}{2} = 66$ pairs of these points, and each pair determines a line. However, the graph of $ax+by=1$ can never pass through the origin $(0, 0)$, since if $x=y=0$, then $ax+by=0 \neq 1$. Therefore, the six pairs which consist of diametrically opposed points are invalid, since the line through them passes through the origin. This corrects our count to $66 - 6 = 60$.

In addition, for each of the twelve points, there is a line tangent to the circle at that point, so that the only solution to the system is that one point. This brings the final total to $60 + 12 = \boxed{72}$. The answer is $\boxed{72}$

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $2$. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a graph that is a "V" shape with the "valleys" at $x=1$ and $x=3$, and the distance between the valleys is $2$. So, for $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ to be equal to a positive number strictly less than $2$, the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be strictly between $1$ and $2$.

This gives us the inequality $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Multiplying all sides of the inequality by $100$ gives $100 < m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from $101$ to $199$, inclusive. To find the number of these integers, we subtract the smallest integer in the range from the largest, and then add $1$. This gives $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$.

So, there are $99$ positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. The answer is: $99$.

        # Substitute the value of m into the equation
        equation_substituted = equation.subs(m, possible_m)

        # Solve the equation
        solutions = solve(equation_substituted, x)

        # Count the number of distinct solutions
