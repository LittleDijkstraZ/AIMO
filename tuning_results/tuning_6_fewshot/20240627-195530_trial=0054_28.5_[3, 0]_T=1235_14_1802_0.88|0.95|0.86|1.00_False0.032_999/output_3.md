draw(left--right);
label("$x$", (x/2, -0.1), S);

[/asy]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Let $w$ be the width of each of the identical rectangles. Since $PQ=3w$, $RS=2x$ and $PQ=RS$ (because $PQRS$ is a rectangle), then $2x = 3w$, or $$w=\frac{2}{3}x.$$ Therefore, the area of each of the five identical rectangles is $$x\left(\frac{2}{3}x\right)=\frac{2}{3}x^2.$$ Since the area of $PQRS$ is 4000 and it is made up of five of these identical smaller rectangles, then $$5\left(\frac{2}{3}x^2\right)=4000$$ or $$\frac{10}{3}x^2 = 4000$$ or $x^2 = 1200$ or $x \approx 34.6$ which, when rounded off to the nearest integer, is $\boxed{35}.$ The answer is $\boxed{35}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we first need to understand the given equation and then find the set of points that satisfy the equation. The equation is 
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$
The equation equals to zero if either of the two factors equals to zero.

For the first factor, we have two equations:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10$, which gives us two lines: $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x - y \vert = 10$, which gives us two lines: $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.

For the second factor, we have two equations:
1. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8$, which gives us two lines: $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.
2. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us two lines: $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

The intersection of these lines form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

```python

    return area

```

FAIL

```
After reviewing the code and the error, we realized that the error is due to the fact that `intersection_points` is an empty list. This is because the Sympy's `solve` function was not able to find a numerical solution for the given equation. This can happen when the equation is too complex or when the equation itself is not well-defined. In this case, it is probably best to solve this problem analytically rather than numerically.

Let's solve the problem analytically:
The equation is
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$
Either of the two factors need to be zero for the equation to be zero.

For the first factor, we have two cases:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10$, which gives us two lines: $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x - y \vert = 10$, which gives us two lines: $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.

For the second factor, we have two cases:
1. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8$, which gives us two lines: $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.
2. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us two lines: $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

The intersection of these lines form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

However, in this problem, the actual value of the area is not important. The important thing is that we have found the correct analytical solution and calculated the area correctly. The correct analytical solution confirms that the area of the polygon is 256.
The answer is: $256$.

## QUESTION 3 - 1 
- TIME_SPENT : 829 secs

1_
**Example**

**Problem:** 
"An ellipse is defined parametrically by
\[(x,y) = \left( \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t}, \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t} \right).\]Then the equation of the ellipse can be written in the form
\[Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0,\]where $A,$ $B,$ $C,$ $D,$ $E,$ and $F$ are integers, and $\gcd(|A|,|B|,|C|,|D|,|E|,|F|) = 1.$  Find $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F|.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
In the equation $y = \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\cos t$ to get
\[\cos t = \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3}.\]In the equation $x = \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\sin t$ to get
\[\sin t = \frac{1}{2} x (2 - \cos t) + 1 = \frac{1}{2} x \left( 2 - \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right) + 1 = 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)}.\]Since $\cos^2 t + \sin^2 t = 1,$
\[\left( \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right)^2 + \left( 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)} \right)^2 = 1.\]Multiplying both sides by $(2(y + 3))^2$ and expanding, it will simplify to
\[81x^2 - 36xy + 16y^2 - 108x + 240y + 900 = 0.\]Therefore, $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F| = 81 + 36 + 16 + 108 + 240 + 900 = \boxed{1381}.$ The answer is $\boxed{1381}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The expression $A \cdot B = 0$ is true if and only if $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the given equation is satisfied if and only if either of the following two equations is satisfied:
\[(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0\]
\[(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0\]
For the first equation to be satisfied, we must have both $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$, which simplifies to $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$. This gives us a square with side length $20$ and area $400$.
For the second equation to be satisfied, we must have both $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us a square with side length $16$ and area $256$.
The total area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of these two squares, which is $400 + 256 = 656$.
The answer is: $656$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_ 2= (-16,2).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that
\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as
\[\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1.\]Find $h + k + a + b.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we first need to understand the properties of the absolute value function and how it interacts with the given equation.
The absolute value function $|x|$ is defined as:
\[|x| = \begin{cases}
x & \text{if } x \geq 0 \\
-x & \text{if } x < 0
\end{cases}\]
This means that $|x|$ is always non-negative. Therefore, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ if and only if $|x| = 8$. Similarly, $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ if and only if $|y| = 8$.
Similarly, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ if and only if $|x + y| = 10$, and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ if and only if $|x - y| = 10$.
Therefore, the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied only when both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ hold simultaneously.
From the above conditions, we have $|x + y| = 10$, $|x - y| = 10$, $|x| = 8$, and $|y| = 8$. This means that $x$ and $y$ must lie in the intervals $[-8, 8]$ and $[-10, 10]$ respectively.
The set of points $(x, y)$ that satisfy these conditions forms a rectangle with side lengths 16 and 20. Therefore, the area of the polygon is $16 \times 20 = 320$.
The answer is $\boxed{320}$.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, we notice that the product of two terms is zero if and only if at least one of the terms is zero. That means we can split the problem into two separate problems:

1. Solve the equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. Solve the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first equation, we have $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only way this can happen is if $x = y = 5$ or $x = -y = -5$. So the points are $(5,5)$ and $(-5,-5)$.

For the second equation, we have $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The only way this can happen is if $x = 8$ or $x = -8$, and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. So the points are $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

Now we have the points of the polygon: $(5,5)$, $(-5,-5)$, $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$. By plotting these points, we can see that they form a square with side length $10$. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So the area of the convex polygon is $100$. The answer is: $100$.

Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Let $w$ be the width of each of the identical rectangles. Since $PQ=3w$, $RS=2x$ and $PQ=RS$ (because $PQRS$ is a rectangle), then $2x = 3w$, or $$w=\frac{2}{3}x.$$ Therefore, the area of each of the five identical rectangles is $$x\left(\frac{2}{3}x\right)=\frac{2}{3}x^2.$$ Since the area of $PQRS$ is 4000 and it is made up of five of these identical smaller rectangles, then $$5\left(\frac{2}{3}x^2\right)=4000$$ or $$\frac{10}{3}x^2 = 4000$$ or $x^2 = 1200$ or $x \approx 34.6$ which, when rounded off to the nearest integer, is $\boxed{35}.$ The answer is $\boxed{35}$

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we first need to understand that the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is true if and only if at least one of the factors is equal to zero. This means that the points that satisfy this equation are on the lines where each factor is equal to zero.

The first factor is equal to zero when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two lines forming a cross.

The second factor is equal to zero when $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of four lines forming a square.

Therefore, the points that satisfy the equation are those that are on the boundary of a cross inscribed in a square. The convex polygon formed by these points is a regular octagon.

To find the area of this octagon, we can first find the side length of the square and the cross. The side length of the square is 16 (since $\vert x \vert = 8$ implies $-8 \le x \le 8$, and similarly for y). The cross is formed by two lines with slope 1 and -1 passing through the points $(0, \pm 10)$ and $(\pm 10, 0)$. The distance from the origin to the line $x + y = 10$ is $\frac{10}{\sqrt{2}} = 5 \sqrt{2}$, so the side length of the cross is $2 \times 5 \sqrt{2} = 10 \sqrt{2}$.

The distance from the center of the octagon to each vertex is the side length of the cross divided by $\sqrt{2}$, or $5 \sqrt{2}$. Therefore, the area of the octagon is given by the area of the square minus the area of the four right triangles that make up the cross. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$, and the area of each right triangle is $\frac{1}{2} \times (5 \sqrt{2})^2 = 25$. Therefore, the area of the octagon is $256 - 4 \times 25 = 164$.
The answer is: $164$

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Let $w$ be the width of each of the identical rectangles. Since $PQ=3w$, $RS=2x$ and $PQ=RS$ (because $PQRS$ is a rectangle), then $2x = 3w$, or $$w=\frac{2}{3}x.$$ Therefore, the area of each of the five identical rectangles is $$x\left(\frac{2}{3}x\right)=\frac{2}{3}x^2.$$ Since the area of $PQRS$ is 4000 and it is made up of five of these identical smaller rectangles, then $$5\left(\frac{2}{3}x^2\right)=4000$$ or $$\frac{10}{3}x^2 = 4000$$ or $x^2 = 1200$ or $x \approx 34.6$ which, when rounded off to the nearest integer, is $\boxed{35}.$ The answer is $\boxed{35}$

The product of two factors equals zero if and only if at least one of the factors equals zero. This implies that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The first equation implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which represent two lines parallel to the x-axis and y-axis respectively, at a distance of 10 units from the origin.

The second equation implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which represent two lines parallel to the y-axis and x-axis respectively, at a distance of 8 units from the origin.

The intersection of these lines form a square with side length 16 (since the distance from the origin to each line is 8 in both x and y directions). Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of this square, which is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"An ellipse is defined parametrically by
\[(x,y) = \left( \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t}, \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t} \right).\]Then the equation of the ellipse can be written in the form
\[Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0,\]where $A,$ $B,$ $C,$ $D,$ $E,$ and $F$ are integers, and $\gcd(|A|,|B|,|C|,|D|,|E|,|F|) = 1.$  Find $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F|.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
In the equation $y = \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\cos t$ to get
\[\cos t = \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3}.\]In the equation $x = \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\sin t$ to get
\[\sin t = \frac{1}{2} x (2 - \cos t) + 1 = \frac{1}{2} x \left( 2 - \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right) + 1 = 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)}.\]Since $\cos^2 t + \sin^2 t = 1,$
\[\left( \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right)^2 + \left( 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)} \right)^2 = 1.\]Multiplying both sides by $(2(y + 3))^2$ and expanding, it will simplify to
\[81x^2 - 36xy + 16y^2 - 108x + 240y + 900 = 0.\]Therefore, $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F| = 81 + 36 + 16 + 108 + 240 + 900 = \boxed{1381}.$ The answer is $\boxed{1381}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


The function `solve()` in Sympy can be used to solve equations and systems of equations. However, in this case, we are not looking for the solutions of an equation, but rather the area of a geometric shape. The equation given in the problem is a product of two expressions, each of which represents the condition that the absolute value of a certain expression is equal to 10 or 8. The points that satisfy this equation are the points where at least one of these conditions is met.

1. The condition $|x + y| = 10$ represents a square with side length 20, centered at the origin, with its sides parallel to the coordinate axes.
2. The condition $|x - y| = 10$ represents another square with side length 20, also centered at the origin, but with its diagonals parallel to the coordinate axes.
3. The condition $|x| = 8$ represents a pair of vertical lines at $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.
4. The condition $|y| = 8$ represents a pair of horizontal lines at $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

The intersection of these four geometric shapes is a square with side length 16, centered at the origin, with its sides parallel to the coordinate axes. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solve

def area_of_polygon():
    # The side length of the square is 16
    side_length = 16

    # Calculate the area of the square
    area = side_length**2

    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is $\boxed{256}$.
