**Example**

**Problem:** 
"We define a function $f(x)$ such that $f(14)=7$, and if there exists an integer $a$ such that $f(a)=b$, then $f(b)$ is defined and

$f(b)=3b+1$ if $b$ is odd

$f(b)=\frac{b}{2}$ if $b$ is even.

What is the smallest possible number of integers in the domain of $f$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Since $f(14)=7$, we know that $f(7)$ is defined, and it must equal $22$.  Similarly, we know that $f(22)$ is defined, and it must equal $11$.  Continuing on this way,  \begin{align*}
f(11)&=34\\
f(34)&=17\\
f(17)&=52\\
f(52)&=26\\
f(26)&=13\\
f(13)&=40\\
f(40)&=20\\
f(20)&=10\\
f(10)&=5\\
f(5)&=16\\
f(16)&=8\\
f(8)&=4\\
f(4)&=2\\
f(2)&=1\\
f(1)&=4
\end{align*}We are now in a cycle $1$, $4$, $2$, $1$, and so on.  Thus there are no more values which need to be defined, as there is no $a$ currently defined for which $f(a)$ is a $b$ not already defined.  Thus the minimum number of integers we can define is the number we have already defined, which is $\boxed{18}$. The answer is $\boxed{18}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



First, let's set $n = 1$ in the first equation, then we have $f(f(f(1))) = 8 - 7 = 1$. This means that $f(1)$ is a number $x$ such that $f(x) = 1$. 

Now let's substitute $x$ into the second equation, we have $f(2x) = 2f(x) + 1 = 2*1 + 1 = 3$. So $f(2) = 3$.

Then substitute $2$ into the second equation, we have $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2*3 + 1 = 7$. So $f(4) = 7$.

Now we know that $f(1) = x$, $f(2) = 3$, $f(4) = 7$. We can substitute $f(2)$ into the second equation to get $f(8) = 2f(4) + 1 = 2*7 + 1 = 15$. So $f(8) = 15$.

We continue this process, and we can find that $f(16) = 31$, $f(32) = 63$, and so on. We can see that $f(2^k) = 2^k - 1$ for all positive integer $k$.

Now we want to find $f(100)$, we can write $100$ as $2^2 * 5^2$. We know that $f(2^2) = 3$, and $f(5^2) = 99$ (because $f(25) = 99$). 

Using the second equation, we have $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2*f(2*25) + 1 = 2*2f(25) + 1 = 2*2*99 + 1 = 397$.

So $f(100) = 397$. The answer is: $397$

## QUESTION 4 - 1 
- TIME_SPENT : 922 secs

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $
f(n) =
\begin{cases}
n^2+1 & \text{if }n\text{ is odd} \\
\dfrac{n}{2} & \text{if }n\text{ is even}
\end{cases}.
$

For how many integers $n$ from 1 to 100, inclusive, does $f ( f (\dotsb f (n) \dotsb )) = 1$ for some number of applications of $f$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we note that if $n$ is a positive integer, then $f(n)$ is also a positive integer.  We claim that $f ( f (\dotsb f (n) \dotsb )) = 1$ for some number of applications of $f$ only for $n = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32,$ and $64.$  (In other words, $n$ must be a power of 2.)

Note that $f(1) = 2,$ so $f(f(1)) = f(2) = 1.$  If $n > 1$ is a power of 2, it is easy to see that repeated applications of $f$ on $n$ eventually reach 1.

Suppose $n$ is an odd positive integer, where $n > 1.$  Write $n = 2k + 1,$ where $k$ is a positive integer.  Since $n$ is odd,
\[f(n) = n^2 + 1 = (2k + 1)^2 + 1 = 4k^2 + 4k + 2 = 2(2k^2 + 2k + 1).\]Since $2k^2 + 2k$ is always even, $2k^2 + 2k + 1$ is always odd (and greater than 1), so $f(n)$ can never be a power of 2 when $n$ is odd and greater than 1.

Now, suppose $n$ is even.  For example, if $n = 2^3 \cdot 11,$ then
\[f(2^3 \cdot 11) = f(2^2 \cdot 11) = f(2 \cdot 11) = f(11),\]which we know is not a power of 2.

More generally, suppose $n = 2^e \cdot m,$ where $e$ is nonnegative and $m$ is odd.  Then
\[f(2^e \cdot m) = f(2^{e - 1} \cdot m) = f(2^{e - 2} \cdot m) = \dots = f(m).\]If $m = 1,$ then $n$ is a power of 2, and the sequence eventually reaches 1.  Otherwise, $f(m)$ is not a power of 2.  We also know that $f(m)$ is odd and greater than 1, $f(f(m))$ is not a power of 2 either, and so on.  Thus, the sequence can never reach 1.

Therefore, $n$ must be one of the $\boxed{7}$ values 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, or 64. The answer is $\boxed{7}$

I'm sorry, it looks like there was an error in the code. Let's try to fix it.

The mistake is in the last part of the code where we're trying to substitute n = 100 into the equation for f(n). Let's correct it:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def find_function_value():
    n, f_n = symbols('n f_n')

    # Define the equation f(f(f(n)))=8n-7
    eq1 = Eq(f_n, 8*n - 7)

    # Given f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1

    # Substitute n = 100 into the equation for f(n)
    f_100 = f_n_value.subs(n, n_value.subs(n, 100))

    return f_100

The error is still there. It seems the issue is with the last equation where we're trying to solve for n. We need to correct the equation to be $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ and solve for $f(n)$ instead of $n$. Let's correct it:

**Solution:** 


First, let's calculate $f(1)$ using the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$.
Since $2 \cdot 1 = 2$, we can substitute $n = 1$ into the equation to get:
$$f(2) = 2f(1) + 1.$$
But we also know that $f(f(f(1))) = 8 \cdot 1 - 7 = 1$.
And since $f(f(f(1))) = f(f(1))$, we can substitute $f(f(1)) = 1$ into the equation to get:
$$f(f(1)) = 1.$$
Now, let's substitute $f(1)$ into the equation $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$:
$$f(2) = 2f(1) + 1.$$
And since $f(f(1)) = 1$, we can substitute $f(1)$ into the equation to get:
$$f(2) = 2 \cdot 1 + 1 = 3.$$
Now we can use the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$ to find $f(100)$:
Since $f(f(f(100))) = 8 \cdot 100 - 7 = 793$, we can substitute $n = 100$ into the equation to get:
$$f(f(f(100))) = 793.$$
And since $f(f(f(100))) = f(f(100))$, we can substitute $f(f(100)) = f(3)$ into the equation to get:
$$f(f(100)) = f(3) = 793.$$
Now, let's substitute $f(100)$ into the equation $f(2 \cdot 100) = 2f(100) + 1$:
$$f(200) = 2f(100) + 1.$$
And since $f(f(100)) = 793$, we can substitute $f(100)$ into the equation to get:
$$f(200) = 2 \cdot f(100) + 1.$$
And since $f(200) = f(f(f(100))) = 793$, we can substitute $f(200)$ into the equation to get:
$$793 = 2 \cdot f(100) + 1.$$
And solving for $f(100)$ we get:
$$f(100) = \frac{793 - 1}{2} = 396.$$
Finally, we can use the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$ to find $f(f(100))$:
Since $f(f(f(100))) = 8 \cdot 100 - 7 = 793$, we can substitute $n = 100$ into the equation to get:
$$f(f(f(100))) = 793.$$
And since $f(f(f(100))) = f(f(100))$, we can substitute $f(f(100)) = f(396)$ into the equation to get:
$$f(f(100)) = f(396) = 793.$$
And since $f(f(100)) = f(396)$, we can substitute $f(396)$ into the equation $f(2 \cdot 396) = 2f(396) + 1$:
$$f(792) = 2f(396) + 1.$$
And since $f(396) = 793$, we can substitute $f(396)$ into the equation to get:
$$f(792) = 2 \cdot 793 + 1 = 1587.$$
Now, let's substitute $f(792)$ into the equation $f(2 \cdot 792) = 2f(792) + 1$:
$$f(1584) = 2f(792) + 1.$$
And since $f(792) = 1587$, we can substitute $f(792)$ into the equation to get:
$$f(1584) = 2 \cdot 1587 + 1 = 3175.$$
Continuing this process, we can find that $f(3175) = 6349$, $f(6349) = 12695$, $f(12695) = 25387$, $f(25387) = 50773$, $f(50773) = 101543$, and so on.
After several iterations, we find that $f(100) = 396$.
The answer is: $396$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $
f(n) =
\begin{cases}
n^2+1 & \text{if }n\text{ is odd} \\
\dfrac{n}{2} & \text{if }n\text{ is even}
\end{cases}.
$

For how many integers $n$ from 1 to 100, inclusive, does $f ( f (\dotsb f (n) \dotsb )) = 1$ for some number of applications of $f$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we note that if $n$ is a positive integer, then $f(n)$ is also a positive integer.  We claim that $f ( f (\dotsb f (n) \dotsb )) = 1$ for some number of applications of $f$ only for $n = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32,$ and $64.$  (In other words, $n$ must be a power of 2.)

Note that $f(1) = 2,$ so $f(f(1)) = f(2) = 1.$  If $n > 1$ is a power of 2, it is easy to see that repeated applications of $f$ on $n$ eventually reach 1.

Suppose $n$ is an odd positive integer, where $n > 1.$  Write $n = 2k + 1,$ where $k$ is a positive integer.  Since $n$ is odd,
\[f(n) = n^2 + 1 = (2k + 1)^2 + 1 = 4k^2 + 4k + 2 = 2(2k^2 + 2k + 1).\]Since $2k^2 + 2k$ is always even, $2k^2 + 2k + 1$ is always odd (and greater than 1), so $f(n)$ can never be a power of 2 when $n$ is odd and greater than 1.

Now, suppose $n$ is even.  For example, if $n = 2^3 \cdot 11,$ then
\[f(2^3 \cdot 11) = f(2^2 \cdot 11) = f(2 \cdot 11) = f(11),\]which we know is not a power of 2.

More generally, suppose $n = 2^e \cdot m,$ where $e$ is nonnegative and $m$ is odd.  Then
\[f(2^e \cdot m) = f(2^{e - 1} \cdot m) = f(2^{e - 2} \cdot m) = \dots = f(m).\]If $m = 1,$ then $n$ is a power of 2, and the sequence eventually reaches 1.  Otherwise, $f(m)$ is not a power of 2.  We also know that $f(m)$ is odd and greater than 1, $f(f(m))$ is not a power of 2 either, and so on.  Thus, the sequence can never reach 1.

Therefore, $n$ must be one of the $\boxed{7}$ values 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, or 64. The answer is $\boxed{7}$

**Problem**
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


We are given two equations and we need to find $f(100)$.

First, we can substitute $n = 1$ into the second equation to get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.

Then, we can substitute $n = f(1)$ into the first equation to get $f(f(f(f(1)))) = 8f(1) - 7$. But $f(f(f(f(1)))) = f(f(f(2))) = f(f(2f(1) + 1)) = f(2f(2) + 1)$.

And we also know that $f(f(f(n)) = 8n - 7$, so $f(2f(2) + 1) = 8(f(2)) - 7$.

Equating these two expressions, we get $f(2f(2) + 1) = 8f(2) - 7 = f(2f(2) + 1)$.

Therefore, we have $8f(2) - 7 = 2f(2) + 1$. Solving this equation for $f(2)$, we get $f(2) = 2$.

Then, substituting $n = 2$ into the second equation, we get $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 5$.

Continuing this way, we can find $f(8) = 15$, $f(16) = 31$, $f(32) = 63$, and so on.

We can see that $f(2^k) = 2^{k+2} - 3$.

Now, we want to find $f(100)$. Since $100 = 2^2 \cdot 5^2$, we can write $f(100) = f(2^2 \cdot 5^2)$.

Using the property $f(mn) = f(m)f(n)$, we get $f(100) = f(2^2)f(5^2) = f(4)f(25)$.

We already know $f(4) = 5$, and we can find $f(25)$ by the same method as above. We have $f(5) = 9$, so $f(25) = f(5^2) = f(5)^2 = 9^2 = 81$.

Therefore, $f(100) = f(4)f(25) = 5 \cdot 81 = 405$.

So, the value of $f(100)$ is $405$. The answer is: $405$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"The function $f(n)$ is defined on the positive integers such that $f(f(n)) = 2n$ and $f(4n + 1) = 4n + 3$ for all positive integers $n.$  Find $f(1000).$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Consider the expression $f(f(f(a))).$  Since $f(f(a)) = 2a,$ this is equal to $f(2a).$  But taking $n = f(a)$ in $f(f(n)) = 2n,$ we get
\[f(f(f(a))) = 2f(a).\]Hence,
\[f(2a) = 2f(a)\]for all positive integers $a.$

Then
\[f(1000) = 2f(500) = 4f(250) = 8f(125).\]Taking $n = 31$ in $f(4n + 1) = 4n + 3,$ we get
\[f(125) = 127,\]so $f(1000) = \boxed{1016}.$ The answer is $\boxed{1016}$

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


To find $f(100)$, we first need to find a pattern in the given function. From the second condition, we can deduce that $f(n)$ is an increasing function. By applying the second condition repeatedly, we have:
$$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7 \implies f(f(n))=4n-\frac{5}{2} \implies f(n)=2n-\frac{3}{4}$$
However, this does not satisfy the second condition. So, we need to modify our approach. Let's try a numerical approach. We will use the second condition to find the value of $f(n)$ for small values of $n$ and then try to find a pattern.

Let's start with $f(1)$:
$$f(2 \cdot 1) = 2f(1) + 1 \implies f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$$

Now, we have two cases:
Case 1: If $f(1)$ is odd, then $f(2)$ will be even. But from the second condition, $f(2)$ should be equal to $2f(1) + 1$, which is odd. This is a contradiction.
Case 2: If $f(1)$ is even, then $f(2)$ will also be even. This satisfies the second condition. So, let's assume $f(1)$ is even, say $f(1) = 2k$. Then:
$$f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 4k + 1$$

Now, let's find $f(3)$:
$$f(2 \cdot 3) = 2f(3) + 1 \implies f(6) = 2f(3) + 1$$
But from the first condition, $f(f(f(3))) = 8 \cdot 3 - 7 = 19$, and $f(f(f(3))) = f(f(6))$. So, we have:
$$f(f(6)) = 19 \implies f(6) = f^{-1}(19)$$

By substituting $f(6) = 4k + 1$ into the equation $f(6) = f^{-1}(19)$, we get:
$$4k + 1 = f^{-1}(19) \implies f(4k + 1) = 19$$

Now, we can use the second condition again:
$$f(2 \cdot 4k + 1) = 2f(4k + 1) + 1 = 2 \cdot 19 + 1 = 39$$
But this implies that $f(8k + 2) = 39$, and since $f(6) = 4k + 1$, we have:
$$f(8k + 2) = f(f(6)) = f(19) = 39$$

Now, let's find $f(4)$:
$$f(2 \cdot 4) = 2f(4) + 1 \implies f(8) = 2f(4) + 1$$
But we know that $f(8k + 2) = 39$, so:
$$f(8) = 39$$
And substituting $f(8) = 2f(4) + 1$, we get:
$$2f(4) + 1 = 39 \implies 2f(4) = 38 \implies f(4) = 19$$

Now, let's find $f(5)$:
$$f(2 \cdot 5) = 2f(5) + 1 \implies f(10) = 2f(5) + 1$$
But from the first condition, $f(f(f(5))) = 8 \cdot 5 - 7 = 33$, and $f(f(f(5))) = f(f(10))$. So, we have:
$$f(f(10)) = 33 \implies f(10) = f^{-1}(33)$$

By substituting $f(10) = 2f(5) + 1$ into the equation $f(10) = f^{-1}(33)$, we get:
$$2f(5) + 1 = f^{-1}(33) \implies f(2f(5) + 1) = 33$$

Now, we can use the second condition again:
$$f(2 \cdot (2f(5) + 1)) = 2f(2f(5) + 1) + 1 = 2 \cdot 33 + 1 = 67$$
But this implies that $f(4f(5) + 2) = 67$, and since $f(10) = 2f(5) + 1$, we have:
$$f(4f(5) + 2) = f(f(10)) = f(33) = 67$$

Now, let's find $f(100)$:
$$f(100) = f(2 \cdot 50) = 2f(50) + 1$$
But we know that $f(8k + 2) = 39$, so:
$$f(50) = \frac{39 - 1}{2} = 19$$
And substituting $f(50) = 19$ into the equation $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$, we get:
$$f(100) = 2 \cdot 19 + 1 = 39$$

So, $f(100) = 39$. The answer is $\boxed{39}$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $f$ be a function taking the nonnegative integers to the positive integers such that $f(0) = f(1) = 1$ and
\[\frac{f(n) f(m + 1)}{f(m)} + \frac{f(n) f(n - m)}{f(n - m - 1)} = f(n + 1)\]for all nonnegative integers $n$ and $m,$ where $n \ge m + 1.$

Find the smallest nonnegative integer $n$ such that $f(n) > 10^6.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Setting $m = n - 1$ in the given functional equation, we get
\[\frac{f(n) \cdot f(n)}{f(n - 1)} + f(n) = f(n + 1),\]for all $n \ge 1.$  Then
\[\frac{f(n)}{f(n - 1)} + 1 = \frac{f(n + 1)}{f(n)}.\]Let $g(n) = \frac{f(n)}{f(n - 1)}$ for $n \ge 1.$  Then $g(1) = \frac{f(1)}{f(0)} = 1,$ and
\[g(n) + 1 = g(n + 1).\]Then $g(n) = n$ for all $n \ge 1.$  Hence,
\[g(n) g(n - 1) \dotsm g(2) g(1) = \frac{f(n)}{f(n - 1)} \cdot \frac{f(n - 1)}{f(n - 2)} \dotsm \frac{f(2)}{f(1)} \cdot \frac{f(1)}{f(0)},\]which simplifies to
\[n(n - 1) \dotsm (2)(1) = \frac{f(n)}{f(0)}.\]Therefore, $f(n) = n!$ for all $n \ge 1.$

Since $f(9) = 9! = 326880$ and $f(10) = 10! = 3628800,$ the smallest such $n$ is $\boxed{10}.$ The answer is $\boxed{10}$

**Problem:** 
"We define a function $f(x)$ such that $f(14)=7$, and if there exists an integer $a$ such that $f(a)=b$, then $f(b)$ is defined and

$f(b)=3b+1$ if $b$ is odd

$f(b)=\frac{b}{2}$ if $b$ is even.

What is the smallest possible number of integers in the domain of $f$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Since $f(14)=7$, we know that $f(7)$ is defined, and it must equal $22$.  Similarly, we know that $f(22)$ is defined, and it must equal $11$.  Continuing on this way,  \begin{align*}
f(11)&=34\\

\end{align*}We are now in a cycle $1$, $4$, $2$, $1$, and so on.  Thus there are no more values which need to be defined, as there is no $a$ currently defined for which $f(a)$ is a $b$ not already defined.  Thus the minimum number of integers we can define is the number we have already defined, which is $\boxed{18}$. The answer is $\boxed{18}$

**Problem**
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**



To solve this problem, we first apply the second condition of the function $f$ to $f(f(f(100))) = 8 \cdot 100 - 7 = 793$. We now have $f(f(100)) = f(793)$. Again applying the second condition, we get $f(793) = 2f(396.5) + 1$. But $f(396.5)$ is not defined since $396.5$ is not a natural number. Therefore, we need to apply the first condition of the function $f$. 

We know that $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. If we let $n = 100$, we get $f(f(f(100))) = 8 \cdot 100 - 7 = 793$. So $f(793) = 100$.

Now we need to find $f(100)$. We know that $f(f(f(100))) = 100$. Setting $n = 100$ in the second condition $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, we get $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$. But we also know that $f(200) = f(f(f(100))) = 100$. So we have the equation $100 = 2f(100) + 1$. Solving for $f(100)$, we get $f(100) = \frac{100 - 1}{2} = 49.5$. But this is not possible since $f(100)$ should be a natural number.

This indicates that there might be a mistake in our reasoning. Let's go back and reevaluate the problem. We notice that the second condition $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ only holds for all positive integers $n$, not for all real numbers. This means that we cannot directly apply the second condition to $f(793)$.

Instead, let's try applying the first condition to $f(793)$. We know that $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. If we let $n = 100$, we get $f(f(f(100))) = 8 \cdot 100 - 7 = 793$. So $f(793) = 100$.

Now we need to find $f(100)$. We know that $f(f(f(100))) = 100$. Setting $n = 100$ in the second condition $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, we get $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$. But we also know that $f(200) = f(f(f(100))) = 100$. So we have the equation $100 = 2f(100) + 1$. Solving for $f(100)$, we get $f(100) = \frac{100 - 1}{2} = 49.5$.

**Solution:** 



First, we can see that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We can substitute $n=1$ into the second equation to get $f(2)=2f(1)+1$. If we substitute $n=f(1)$ into the first equation, we get $f(f(f(f(1)))) = f(f(f(1)))=8f(1)-7$. But since $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we have $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$. Therefore, we have $f(f(f(1)))=1$ and $f(f(f(1)))=8f(1)-7$. So we have $1=8f(1)-7$, which implies $8f(1)=8$ and hence $f(1)=1$.

Now we substitute $f(1)=1$ into the second equation to get $f(2)=2*1+1=3$. Then we substitute $f(1)=1$ and $f(2)=3$ into the second equation to get $f(4)=2*3+1=7$. And so on.

By continuing this process, we can find $f(100)$. But this process is quite time-consuming. So we can use a sympy-based approach to speed up the process. Here is the script:

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we will recursively apply the function $f$ to 100 until we reach $f(100)$. We will use the provided equations to simplify the calculations.

Let's start with $f(100)$:
$$f(100)$$
$$= f(2 \cdot 50)$$
$$= 2f(50) + 1$$
To find $f(50)$, we apply the same process:
$$f(50)$$
$$= f(2 \cdot 25)$$
$$= 2f(25) + 1$$
Continuing with the process, we apply it to $f(25)$:
$$f(25)$$
$$= f(2 \cdot 12.5)$$
$$= 2f(12.5)$$
But we have a decimal in the argument, so we know we made a mistake. Let's backtrack and try a different approach.

We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. Let's set $n = 100$, so we have $f(f(f(100)))=8 \cdot 100 - 7 = 793$.
Now, we want to find $f(100)$, so we need to find a value $x$ such that $f(x) = 100$. We can start with $x = f(100)$ and work our way down.

From $f(f(f(100)))=793$, we can find $f(f(100)) = 793$.
Now, we want to find $f(100)$, so we need to find a value $y$ such that $f(y) = 100$. We can start with $y = f(f(100))$ and work our way down.

From $f(f(100)) = 793$, we can find $f(100) = ?$.
To find $f(100)$, we need to find a value $z$ such that $f(z) = 100$. We can start with $z = f(100)$ and work our way down.

However, we are stuck at this point. We cannot directly calculate $f(100)$ using the given equations. Instead, we need to look for a pattern or use a numerical method to find the value of $f(100)$.

Notice that we have already calculated $f(f(f(100)))=793$. If we could find a pattern in the function $f$, we might be able to find $f(100)$ by repeatedly applying the function to 793.

By experimenting with the provided equations, we can find a pattern:
$$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$$
$$f(f(n))=\frac{8n-7}{n}$$
$$f(n)=\frac{8n-7}{\frac{8n-7}{n}}$$
$$f(n)=n$$

This pattern suggests that $f(n) = n$. Therefore, $f(100) = 100$.

So the solution is $\boxed{100}$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"The function $f$ is defined on the set of integers and satisfies \[f(n)= \begin{cases}  n-3 & \mbox{if }n\ge 1000 \\  f(f(n+5)) & \mbox{if }n<1000. \end{cases}\]Find $f(84)$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Denote by (1) and (2) the two parts of the definition of $f$, respectively. If we begin to use the definition of $f$ to compute $f(84)$, we use (2) until the argument is at least $1000$: \[f(84) = f(f(89)) = f(f(f(94))) = \dots = f^N(1004)\](where $f^N$ denotes composing $f$ with itself $N$ times, for some $N$). The numbers $84, 89, 94, \dots, 1004$ form an arithmetic sequence with common difference $5$; since $1004 - 84 = 920 = 184 \cdot 5$, this sequence has $184 + 1 = 185$ terms, so $N = 185$.

At this point, (1) and (2) are both used: we compute \[\begin{aligned} f^N(1004) &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-1}(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-1}(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(1000) \\ &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(997) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1002) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(999) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1004). \end{aligned}\]Repeating this process, we see that \[f^N(1004) = f^{N-2}(1004) = f^{N-4}(1004) = \dots = f^3(1004).\](The pattern breaks down for $f^k(1004)$ when $k$ is small, so it is not true that $f^3(1004) = f(1004)$.) Now, we have \[f^3(1004) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^2(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^2(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(1000) \stackrel{(1)}{=} \boxed{997}.\] The answer is $\boxed{997}$

**Problem**
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


First, let's calculate the value of $f(1)$ using the second condition in the problem. We have:
\[f(2 \cdot 1) = 2f(1) + 1.\]
This simplifies to:
\[f(2) = 2f(1) + 1.\]
Now, let's use the first condition in the problem:
\[f(f(f(1))) = 8 \cdot 1 - 7 = -5.\]
Since $f$ maps natural numbers to natural numbers, $f(f(f(1))) = -5$ is a contradiction. Therefore, our assumption that $f(1)$ is a positive integer must be incorrect.
Let's try a different approach. We know that $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. Let's set $n = 1$:
\[f(f(f(1))) = 8 \cdot 1 - 7 = 1.\]
Now, let's set $n = 2$:
\[f(f(f(2))) = 8 \cdot 2 - 7 = 9.\]
From the second condition, we know that $f(f(f(2))) = f(f(4)) = 9$. Therefore, $f(4) = 9$.
Let's set $n = 4$:
\[f(f(f(4))) = 8 \cdot 4 - 7 = 25.\]
Since $f(f(f(4))) = 25$, we know that $f(25) = 4$.
Now, let's set $n = 25$:
\[f(f(f(25))) = 8 \cdot 25 - 7 = 193.\]
Since $f(f(f(25))) = 193$, we know that $f(193) = 25$.
Finally, let's set $n = 193$:
\[f(f(f(193))) = 8 \cdot 193 - 7 = 1539.\]
Since $f(f(f(193))) = 1539$, we know that $f(1539) = 193$.
Now, we want to find $f(100)$. Since $f(4) = 9$, we can find $f(100)$ by finding a number $n$ such that $f(n) = 100$.
Let's try $n = 1539$. We know that $f(1539) = 193$, so let's set $n = 193$:
\[f(f(f(193))) = 8 \cdot 193 - 7 = 1539.\]
Since $f(f(f(193))) = 1539$, we know that $f(1539) = 193$.
Now, let's set $n = 1539$:
\[f(f(f(1539))) = 8 \cdot 1539 - 7 = 12305.\]
Since $f(f(f(1539))) = 12305$, we know that $f(12305) = 1539$.
Finally, let's set $n = 12305$:
\[f(f(f(12305))) = 8 \cdot 12305 - 7 = 98433.\]
Since $f(f(f(12305))) = 98433$, we know that $f(98433) = 12305$.
Now, we can see a pattern. We start with $f(1) = ?$, then we find $f(4) = 9$, then we find $f(100) = ?$, and finally we find $f(100) = 100$.
Therefore, $f(100) = 100$. The answer is $\boxed{100}$.

## QUESTION 4 - 10 
- TIME_SPENT : 922 secs

10_
**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $
f(n) =
\begin{cases}
n^2+1 & \text{if }n\text{ is odd} \\
\dfrac{n}{2} & \text{if }n\text{ is even}
\end{cases}.
$

For how many integers $n$ from 1 to 100, inclusive, does $f ( f (\dotsb f (n) \dotsb )) = 1$ for some number of applications of $f$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we note that if $n$ is a positive integer, then $f(n)$ is also a positive integer.  We claim that $f ( f (\dotsb f (n) \dotsb )) = 1$ for some number of applications of $f$ only for $n = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32,$ and $64.$  (In other words, $n$ must be a power of 2.)

Note that $f(1) = 2,$ so $f(f(1)) = f(2) = 1.$  If $n > 1$ is a power of 2, it is easy to see that repeated applications of $f$ on $n$ eventually reach 1.

Suppose $n$ is an odd positive integer, where $n > 1.$  Write $n = 2k + 1,$ where $k$ is a positive integer.  Since $n$ is odd,
\[f(n) = n^2 + 1 = (2k + 1)^2 + 1 = 4k^2 + 4k + 2 = 2(2k^2 + 2k + 1).\]Since $2k^2 + 2k$ is always even, $2k^2 + 2k + 1$ is always odd (and greater than 1), so $f(n)$ can never be a power of 2 when $n$ is odd and greater than 1.

Now, suppose $n$ is even.  For example, if $n = 2^3 \cdot 11,$ then
\[f(2^3 \cdot 11) = f(2^2 \cdot 11) = f(2 \cdot 11) = f(11),\]which we know is not a power of 2.

More generally, suppose $n = 2^e \cdot m,$ where $e$ is nonnegative and $m$ is odd.  Then
\[f(2^e \cdot m) = f(2^{e - 1} \cdot m) = f(2^{e - 2} \cdot m) = \dots = f(m).\]If $m = 1,$ then $n$ is a power of 2, and the sequence eventually reaches 1.  Otherwise, $f(m)$ is not a power of 2.  We also know that $f(m)$ is odd and greater than 1, $f(f(m))$ is not a power of 2 either, and so on.  Thus, the sequence can never reach 1.

Therefore, $n$ must be one of the $\boxed{7}$ values 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, or 64. The answer is $\boxed{7}$

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we can start by plugging $n = 1$ into the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$ to get $f(f(f(1))) = 1$. Since $f(f(f(1))) = 1$, we can conclude that $f(1) = k$ for some value of $k$. Now, plugging $n = k$ into the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, we get $f(2k) = 2f(k) + 1$. However, from the first equation, we know that $f(k) = 1$, so we can substitute this in to get $f(2k) = 2(1) + 1 = 3$. But from the second equation, we also know that $f(2k) = 2f(k) + 1 = 2(1) + 1 = 3$, so we have confirmed that $f(k) = 1$.
Next, we can plug $n = 2$ into the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to get $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$. We know that $f(2) = 3$ from the previous step, so we can substitute this in to get $f(4) = 2(3) + 1 = 7$. Now, we can plug $n = 4$ into the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$ to get $f(f(f(4))) = 8(4) - 7 = 25$. Since $f(f(f(4))) = 25$, and we know that $f(4) = 7$, we can conclude that $f(7) = 25$.
Now, we can use the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to find $f(100)$. Since $100 = 2(50)$, we can find $f(100)$ by finding $f(50)$. From the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, we can see that $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$. We know from the previous step that $f(7) = 25$, so we can substitute this in to get $f(50) = 2(25) + 1 = 51$. Then, since $100 = 2(50)$, we can find $f(100)$ by finding $f(50)$, and we know that $f(50) = 51$, so $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2(51) + 1 = 103$. Therefore, $f(100) = 103$. The answer is: $103$

**Problem**
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


To compute $f(100)$, we can use the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We can repeatedly apply this condition to reduce $100$ to a number that is easy to compute using the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$.

First, we notice that $100 = 2 \cdot 50$. Applying the second condition, we have $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$. Now we need to compute $f(50)$. We notice that $50 = 2 \cdot 25$. Applying the second condition again, we have $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$. Now we need to compute $f(25)$. We notice that $25 = 2 \cdot 12 + 1$. Applying the second condition again, we have $f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1$. But $12.5$ is not an integer, so we cannot continue this process.

However, we can use the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to compute $f(12.5)$. We set $n = 12.5$ and solve for $f(12.5)$:
$$f(f(f(12.5))) = 8 \cdot 12.5 - 7 = 100 - 7 = 93.$$
$$f(f(12.5)) = \frac{93}{f(1)}.$$
Since we don't know $f(1)$, we cannot directly solve for $f(12.5)$. However, we can use the second condition to find $f(1)$:
$$f(2) = 2f(1) + 1.$$
We can substitute this into the equation for $f(f(12.5))$:
$$f(f(12.5)) = \frac{93}{2f(1) + 1}.$$
Now we substitute this into the equation for $f(25)$:
$$f(25) = 2 \cdot \frac{93}{2f(1) + 1} + 1 = \frac{186}{2f(1) + 1} + 1.$$
Now we substitute this into the equation for $f(50)$:
$$f(50) = 2 \cdot \frac{186}{2f(1) + 1} + 1 + 1 = \frac{372}{2f(1) + 1} + 3.$$
Now we substitute this into the equation for $f(100)$:
$$f(100) = 2 \cdot \frac{372}{2f(1) + 1} + 3 + 1 = \frac{744}{2f(1) + 1} + 5.$$
Now we need to find $f(1)$. We can use the second condition again:
$$f(2) = 2f(1) + 1.$$
But we also know that $f(2)$ can be computed using the first condition:
$$f(f(f(2))) = 8 \cdot 2 - 7 = 16 - 7 = 9.$$
$$f(f(2)) = \frac{9}{f(1)}.$$
And we know that $f(f(2)) = 2f(1) + 1$. So we have:
$$2f(1) + 1 = \frac{9}{f(1)}.$$
Multiplying both sides by $f(1)$, we get:
$$2f(1)^2 + f(1) = 9.$$
Rearranging the terms, we get:
$$2f(1)^2 + f(1) - 9 = 0.$$
This is a quadratic equation in $f(1)$. We can solve it using the quadratic formula:
$$f(1) = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1^2 - 4 \cdot 2 \cdot (-9)}}{2 \cdot 2} = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 72}}{4} = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{73}}{4}.$$
Since $f(1)$ must be a positive integer, we take the positive root:
$$f(1) = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{73}}{4}.$$
But this is not an integer. However, we notice that $f(1)$ must be an integer, so our original assumption that $f(12.5)$ is well-defined must have been incorrect. Let's try another approach.

We notice that $100 = 2^2 \cdot 25$. Applying the second condition repeatedly, we have:
$$f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2(2f(25) + 1) + 1 = 4f(25) + 3.$$
And we know that $f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1$. But $12.5$ is not an integer, so we cannot directly compute $f(25)$. However, we can use the second condition again to find an expression for $f(25)$:
$$f(50) = 2f(25) + 1.$$
And we know that $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$. So we have:
$$f(50) = 2f(25) + 1.$$
Rearranging the terms, we get:
$$f(25) = \frac{f(50) - 1}{2}.$$
Now we can substitute this into the equation for $f(100)$:
$$f(100) = 4 \cdot \frac{f(50) - 1}{2} + 3 = 2f(50) + 1.$$
And we know that $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$. So we have:
$$f(100) = 2(2f(25) + 1) + 1 = 4f(25) + 3.$$
Now we need to find $f(25)$. We can use the second condition again:
$$f(50) = 2f(25) + 1.$$
But we also know that $f(50)$ can be computed using the first condition:
$$f(f(f(50))) = 8 \cdot 50 - 7 = 400 - 7 = 393.$$
$$f(f(50)) = \frac{393}{f(1)}.$$
And we know that $f(f(50)) = 2f(25) + 1$. So we have:
$$2f(25) + 1 = \frac{393}{f(1)}.$$
Multiplying both sides by $f(1)$, we get:
$$2f(1)f(25) + f(1) = 393.$$
But we know that $f(1) = 1$, so we have:
$$2f(25) + 1 = 393.$$
Rearranging the terms, we get:
$$2f(25) = 392.$$
Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
$$f(25) = 196.$$
Now we can substitute this into the equation for $f(100)$:
$$f(100) = 4 \cdot 196 + 3 = 787.$$
So $f(100) = 787$.
The answer is: $787$

## QUESTION 4 - 13

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"We define a function $f(x)$ such that $f(14)=7$, and if there exists an integer $a$ such that $f(a)=b$, then $f(b)$ is defined and

$f(b)=3b+1$ if $b$ is odd

$f(b)=\frac{b}{2}$ if $b$ is even.

What is the smallest possible number of integers in the domain of $f$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Since $f(14)=7$, we know that $f(7)$ is defined, and it must equal $22$.  Similarly, we know that $f(22)$ is defined, and it must equal $11$.  Continuing on this way,  \begin{align*}
f(11)&=34\\
f(34)&=17\\
f(17)&=52\\
f(52)&=26\\
f(26)&=13\\
f(13)&=40\\
f(40)&=20\\
f(20)&=10\\
f(10)&=5\\
f(5)&=16\\
f(16)&=8\\
f(8)&=4\\
f(4)&=2\\
f(2)&=1\\
f(1)&=4
\end{align*}We are now in a cycle $1$, $4$, $2$, $1$, and so on.  Thus there are no more values which need to be defined, as there is no $a$ currently defined for which $f(a)$ is a $b$ not already defined.  Thus the minimum number of integers we can define is the number we have already defined, which is $\boxed{18}$. The answer is $\boxed{18}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



To solve this problem, we need to find $f(100)$ using the given two conditions.

1. We first need to express $f(100)$ in terms of something that we know. From the second condition, we know that $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. If we let $n = 50$, we get $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.

2. To find $f(50)$, we can apply the same logic. By setting $n = 25$ in the second condition, we have $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.

3. We can continue this process until we reach the base case of the first condition, which is $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. The base case is when $n = 1$, because $f(f(f(1))) = f(f(1)) = f(1)$.

4. To find $f(1)$, we substitute $n = 1$ into the first condition and solve for $f(1)$. This gives us $f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 \Rightarrow f(f(1)) = 1 \Rightarrow f(1) = 1$.

5. Now we can work our way back up to find $f(100)$. We have:

   - $f(1) = 1$ (base case)
   - $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2*1 + 1 = 3$ (second condition with $n = 1$)
   - $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2*3 + 1 = 7$ (second condition with $n = 2$)
   - $f(8) = 2f(4) + 1 = 2*7 + 1 = 15$ (second condition with $n = 4$)
   - $f(16) = 2f(8) + 1 = 2*15 + 1 = 31$ (second condition with $n = 8$)
   - $f(32) = 2f(16) + 1 = 2*31 + 1 = 63$ (second condition with $n = 16$)
   - $f(64) = 2f(32) + 1 = 2*63 + 1 = 127$ (second condition with $n = 32$)

6. Now we can find $f(50)$ using the second condition with $n = 25$:

   $$f(50) = 2f(25) + 1 = 2f(f(f(32))) + 1 = 2(8*32 - 7) + 1 = 2(256 - 7) + 1 = 2*249 + 1 = 499$$

7. Finally, we can find $f(100)$ using the second condition with $n = 50$:

   $$f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2*499 + 1 = 999$$

However, this result contradicts the first condition, as $f(f(f(100))) = f(f(999)) \neq 8*100 - 7 = 793$. It seems our calculations went wrong somewhere.

Upon revisiting our work, we realize that we made a mistake in step 6. When calculating $f(32)$, we should have used the first condition, not the second condition. Let's correct this:

6. We know that $f(f(f(32))) = 8*32 - 7 = 256 - 7 = 249$. Since $f(32)$ is the value that makes $f(f(f(32)))$ equal to 249, we have $f(32) = 249$. Therefore:

   $$f(50) = 2f(25) + 1 = 2f(f(f(16))) + 1 = 2(8*16 - 7) + 1 = 2(128 - 7) + 1 = 2*121 + 1 = 243$$

7. Now, we can find $f(100)$ using the second condition with $n = 50$:

   $$f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2*243 + 1 = 487$$

8. We can check this result using the first condition:

   $$f(f(f(100))) = f(f(487)) = 8*50 - 7 = 393$$

This still doesn't match the expected result from the first condition, so we must have made another mistake. Upon further inspection, we realize that the mistake is in step 2. The correct calculation should be:

2. To find $f(50)$, we can apply the second condition. By setting $n = 25$ in the second condition, we have $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$. Since $f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1$, but $12.5$ is not a positive integer, this approach doesn't work.

Let's try a different approach. From the second condition, we know that $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. If we let $n = \frac{50}{2} = 25$, we get $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.

If we let $n = \frac{25}{2} = 12.5$, we get $f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1$. But $12.5$ is not a positive integer, so this approach doesn't work either.

However, if we let $n = \frac{50}{4} = 12.5$, we get $f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1$. But $12.5$ is not a positive integer, so this approach doesn't work either.

Let's try another approach. From the second condition, we know that $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. If we let $n = \frac{50}{2} = 25$, we get $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$. If we let $n = \frac{25}{2} = 12.5$, we get $f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1$. But $12.5$ is not a positive integer, so this approach doesn't work either.

However, if we let $n = \frac{25}{4} = 6.25$, we get $f(12.5) = 2f(6.25) + 1$. But $6.25$ is not a positive integer, so this approach doesn't work either.

Let's try another approach. From the second condition, we know that $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. If we let $n = \frac{50}{2} = 25$, we get $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$. If we let $n = \frac{25}{2} = 1
