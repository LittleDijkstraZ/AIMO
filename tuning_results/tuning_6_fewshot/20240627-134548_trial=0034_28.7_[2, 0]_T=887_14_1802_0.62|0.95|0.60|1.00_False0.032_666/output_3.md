**Problem:** 
"Find the number of 10-tuples $(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{10})$ of real numbers such that
\[(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2 = \frac{1}{11}.\]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,
\begin{align*}
&[(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + \dots + 1^2 + 1^2)][(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2] \\
&\ge [(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + (x_2 - x_3) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10}]^2 = 1.
\end{align*}From the given condition, we have equality, so by the equality condition for Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[\frac{1 - x_1}{1} = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{1} = \frac{x_2 - x_3}{1} = \dots = \frac{x_9 - x_{10}}{1} = \frac{x_{10}}{1}.\]Let
\[d = 1 - x_1 = x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_3 = \dots = x_9 - x_{10} = x_{10}.\]Then
\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so
\[(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_{10}) = \left( \frac{10}{11}, \frac{9}{11}, \frac{8}{11}, \dots, \frac{1}{11} \right).\]In particular, there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


The problem is asking for the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points that satisfy the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

The equation equals to zero if either of the two factors equals to zero. We can set each factor equal to zero and solve for the corresponding conditions:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10 \Rightarrow x + y = \pm 10$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x - y \vert = 10 \Rightarrow x - y = \pm 10$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8 \Rightarrow x = \pm 8$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert y \vert = 8 \Rightarrow y = \pm 8$.

From the above conditions, we can see that the points that satisfy the equation are the vertices of a square with side length 16 (since the distance between the points $(8, 0)$ and $(-8, 0)$ is 16).

The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step.

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


First, we need to understand the given equation. The equation is of the form $A \cdot B = 0$, which means that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the points that satisfy the equation are either those that make $A = 0$ or $B = 0$.

Let's consider each term separately:

1. $A = (\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. This is a pair of lines: $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.
2. $B = (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This is a pair of lines: $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.
3. $C = (\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x \vert = 8$. This is a pair of lines: $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.
4. $D = (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert y \vert = 8$. This is a pair of lines: $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

Now, we can find the intersection points of these lines to determine the vertices of the polygon. There are 16 intersection points in total.

Finally, we can calculate the area of the polygon. The polygon is a square with side length 16, so its area is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"An ellipse is defined parametrically by
\[(x,y) = \left( \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t}, \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t} \right).\]Then the equation of the ellipse can be written in the form
\[Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0,\]where $A,$ $B,$ $C,$ $D,$ $E,$ and $F$ are integers, and $\gcd(|A|,|B|,|C|,|D|,|E|,|F|) = 1.$  Find $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F|.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
In the equation $y = \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\cos t$ to get
\[\cos t = \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3}.\]In the equation $x = \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\sin t$ to get
\[\sin t = \frac{1}{2} x (2 - \cos t) + 1 = \frac{1}{2} x \left( 2 - \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right) + 1 = 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)}.\]Since $\cos^2 t + \sin^2 t = 1,$
\[\left( \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right)^2 + \left( 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)} \right)^2 = 1.\]Multiplying both sides by $(2(y + 3))^2$ and expanding, it will simplify to
\[81x^2 - 36xy + 16y^2 - 108x + 240y + 900 = 0.\]Therefore, $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F| = 81 + 36 + 16 + 108 + 240 + 900 = \boxed{1381}.$ The answer is $\boxed{1381}$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_ 2= (-16,2).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that
\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as
\[\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1.\]Find $h + k + a + b.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. 

The first expression is zero when either $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x - y| - 10 = 0$. This implies $|x + y| = 10$ or $|x - y| = 10$. These are the equations of two lines passing through the origin making an angle of 45 degrees with the x and y axes respectively.

The second expression is zero when either $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$, which implies $|x| = 8$ or $|y| = 8$. These are the equations of two lines parallel to the y and x axes respectively, at a distance of 8 units from the origin.

The intersection points of these lines form a square with side length 16 units. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon formed by the points satisfying the given equation is 256.
