**Problem**
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


This problem is a bit tricky to solve directly. However, we can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to solve it.

The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states that for any real numbers $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$ and $b_1, b_2, ..., b_n$, we have:
\[(a_1^2 + a_2^2 + ... + a_n^2)(b_1^2 + b_2^2 + ... + b_n^2) \geq (a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 + ... + a_nb_n)^2.\]

In this problem, we can set $a_1 = x - 2y$, $a_2 = y - 2x$, $b_1 = 1$, and $b_2 = 1$. Then we have:
\[((x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2)(1^2 + 1^2) \geq ((x - 2y)(1) + (y - 2x)(1))^2.\]
Simplifying the left side gives:
\[((x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2)(2) \geq ((x - 2y) + (y - 2x))^2.\]
Simplifying the right side gives:
\[((x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2)(2) \geq (x - 2y + y - 2x)^2 = (-x + y)^2 = (y - x)^2.\]
So we have:
\[((x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2)(2) \geq (y - x)^2.\]
Given that $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$, we can square both sides to get:
\[((x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2) = 40^2 = 1600.\]
Substituting this into the inequality gives:
\[1600(2) \geq (y - x)^2.\]
Simplifying gives:
\[3200 \geq (y - x)^2.\]
Taking the square root of both sides gives:
\[\sqrt{3200} \geq |y - x|.\]
Since $|y - x|$ is always non-negative, we can drop the absolute value signs:
\[\sqrt{3200} \geq y - x.\]
Adding $x$ to both sides gives:
\[y \geq x + \sqrt{3200}.\]
Now we can substitute this back into the expression we want to minimize:
\[5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = 5x^2 + 5(x + \sqrt{3200})^2 - 8x(x + \sqrt{3200}).\]
Expanding and simplifying gives:
\[5x^2 + 5(x^2 + 2x\sqrt{3200} + 3200) - 8x^2 - 8x\sqrt{3200} = 5x^2 + 5x^2 + 10x\sqrt{3200} + 16000 - 8x^2 - 8x\sqrt{3200} = -3x^2 + 16000.\]
This is a quadratic function with a negative leading coefficient, so it has a maximum value. The maximum value occurs at $x = 0$, so substituting $x = 0$ into the expression gives:
\[-3(0)^2 + 16000 = 16000.\]
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is $-16000$. However, this is not possible because the expression we are minimizing is always non-negative.

We made a mistake in our reasoning. The inequality $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$ does not imply $(x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2 = 1600$. Instead, it implies $(x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2 \geq 1600$.

Let's correct this mistake and try again.

Using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality again, we have:
\[((x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2)(2) \geq (x - 2y + y - 2x)^2 = (-x + y)^2 = (y - x)^2.\]
Given that $(x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2 \geq 1600$, we can substitute this into the inequality to get:
\[1600(2) \geq (y - x)^2.\]
Simplifying gives:
\[3200 \geq (y - x)^2.\]
Taking the square root of both sides gives:
\[\sqrt{3200} \geq |y - x|.\]
Since $|y - x|$ is always non-negative, we can drop the absolute value signs:
\[y - x \leq \sqrt{3200}.\]
Adding $x$ to both sides gives:
\[y \leq x + \sqrt{3200}.\]
Now we can substitute this back into the expression we want to minimize:
\[5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = 5x^2 + 5(x + \sqrt{3200})^2 - 8x(x + \sqrt{3200}).\]
Expanding and simplifying gives:
\[5x^2 + 5(x^2 + 2x\sqrt{3200} + 3200) - 8x^2 - 8x\sqrt{3200} = 5x^2 + 5x^2 + 10x\sqrt{3200} + 16000 - 8x^2 - 8x\sqrt{3200} = -3x^2 + 16000.\]
This is a quadratic function with a negative leading coefficient, so it has a maximum value. The maximum value occurs at $x = 0$, so substituting $x = 0$ into the expression gives:
\[-3(0)^2 + 16000 = 16000.\]
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is $0$.

However, this is not possible because the expression we are minimizing is always non-negative.

We made another mistake in our reasoning. The inequality $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$ does not imply $(x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2 \geq 1600$. Instead, it implies $(x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2 \leq 1600$.

Let's correct this mistake and try again.

Using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality again, we have:
\[((x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2)(2) \geq (x - 2y + y - 2x)^2 = (-x + y)^2 = (y - x)^2.\]
Given that $(x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2 \leq 1600$, we can substitute this into the inequality to get:
\[1600(2) \geq (y - x)^2.\]
Simplifying gives:
\[3200 \geq (y - x)^2.\]
Taking the square root of both sides gives:
\[\sqrt{3200} \geq |y - x|.\]
Since $|y - x|$ is

**Problem:** 
"If $x + 2y= 4$ and $xy = -8$, what is the value of $x^2 + 4y^2$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
We see that $(x + 2y)^2 = (x^2 + 4y^2) + 4xy = 4^2 = 16$. We want to find $x^2 + 4y^2$ and are given $xy = -8$. So, $x^2 + 4y^2 + 4xy = x^2 + 4y^2 + 4(-8) = 16$. It follows that $x^2 + 4y^2 = \boxed{48}$. The answer is $\boxed{48}$

**Solution:**


This problem is a bit tricky to solve directly. However, we can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to solve it.

The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states that for any real numbers $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$ and $b_1, b_2, ..., b_n$, we have:
\[(a_1^2 + a_2^2 + ... + a_n^2)(b_1^2 + b_2^2 + ... + b_n^2) \geq (a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 + ... + a_nb_n)^2.\]

Let's apply the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to the given problem. Let $a_1 = x$, $a_2 = y$, $b_1 = 2$, and $b_2 = 1$. Then we have:
\[(x^2 + y^2)((2)^2 + (1)^2) \geq (2x + y)^2.\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[(x^2 + y^2)(5) \geq (2x + y)^2.\]
Multiplying both sides by 5, we get:
\[5x^2 + 5y^2 \geq (2x + y)^2.\]
Expanding the right side, we get:
\[5x^2 + 5y^2 \geq 4x^2 + 4xy + y^2.\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy \geq 3x^2 + 3y^2 + 4xy.\]
Simplifying further, we get:
\[5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy \geq 3(x^2 + y^2).\]
Now, we know that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. By the triangle inequality, we have:
\[|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |(x-2y) + (y-2x)| = |x-2y+y-2x| = |-x-y| = |-(x+y)| = |x+y|.\]
So, $|x+y| = 40$. Squaring both sides, we get:
\[(x+y)^2 = 40^2 = 1600.\]
Expanding, we get:
\[x^2 + 2xy + y^2 = 1600.\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[x^2 + y^2 + 2xy = 1600.\]
Comparing this with the inequality $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy \geq 3(x^2 + y^2)$, we can see that the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is $3(1600)/5 = 960$.

So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 960. The answer is: $960$
