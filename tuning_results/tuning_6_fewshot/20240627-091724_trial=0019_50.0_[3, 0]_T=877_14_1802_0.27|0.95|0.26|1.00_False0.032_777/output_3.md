**Problem:** 
"Five identical rectangles are arranged to form a larger rectangle $PQRS$, as shown.  The area of $PQRS$ is $4000$.  What is the length, $x$, rounded off to the nearest integer? [asy]
real x = 1; real w = 2/3;

// Draw outer square and labels
pair s = (0, 0); pair r = (2 * x, 0); pair q = (3 * w, x + w); pair p = (0, x + w);
draw(s--r--q--p--cycle);
label("$S$", s, SW); label("$R$", r, SE); label("$Q$", q, NE); label("$P$", p, NW);

// Draw other segments
draw((x, 0)--(x, w));
draw((0, w)--(2 * x, w));
draw((w, x + w)--(w, w)); draw((2 * w, x + w)--(2 * w, w));

// length labels
pair upper = (-0.1, x + w);
pair lower = (-0.1, w);
draw(lower--upper);
draw((-0.1 - 0.03, x + w)--(-0.1 + 0.03, x + w));
draw((-0.1 - 0.03, w)--(-0.1 + 0.03, w));
label("$x$", midpoint((-0.1, w)--(-0.1, x + w)), W);

pair left = (0, -0.1); pair right = (x, -0.1);
draw((0, -0.1 + 0.03)--(0, -0.1 - 0.03));
draw((x, -0.1 - 0.03)--(x, -0.1 + 0.03));
draw(left--right);
label("$x$", (x/2, -0.1), S);

[/asy]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Let $w$ be the width of each of the identical rectangles. Since $PQ=3w$, $RS=2x$ and $PQ=RS$ (because $PQRS$ is a rectangle), then $2x = 3w$, or $$w=\frac{2}{3}x.$$ Therefore, the area of each of the five identical rectangles is $$x\left(\frac{2}{3}x\right)=\frac{2}{3}x^2.$$ Since the area of $PQRS$ is 4000 and it is made up of five of these identical smaller rectangles, then $$5\left(\frac{2}{3}x^2\right)=4000$$ or $$\frac{10}{3}x^2 = 4000$$ or $x^2 = 1200$ or $x \approx 34.6$ which, when rounded off to the nearest integer, is $\boxed{35}.$ The answer is $\boxed{35}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$.

Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So the vertices of the polygon are also $(8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(8, -8)$.

The polygon is a square with side length 16. The area of a square is the side length squared, so the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_ 2= (-16,2).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that
\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as
\[\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1.\]Find $h + k + a + b.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

The first term is zero when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two squares in the coordinate plane, so they form a square with side length 20.

The second term is zero when $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two squares in the coordinate plane, so they form a square with side length 16.

The area of the convex polygon formed by the intersection of these squares is the area of the larger square minus the area of the smaller square. The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of the larger square is $20^2 = 400$ and the area of the smaller square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $400 - 256 = 144$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Find the number of 10-tuples $(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{10})$ of real numbers such that
\[(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2 = \frac{1}{11}.\]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,
\begin{align*}
&[(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + \dots + 1^2 + 1^2)][(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2] \\
&\ge [(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + (x_2 - x_3) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10}]^2 = 1.
\end{align*}From the given condition, we have equality, so by the equality condition for Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[\frac{1 - x_1}{1} = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{1} = \frac{x_2 - x_3}{1} = \dots = \frac{x_9 - x_{10}}{1} = \frac{x_{10}}{1}.\]Let
\[d = 1 - x_1 = x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_3 = \dots = x_9 - x_{10} = x_{10}.\]Then
\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so
\[(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_{10}) = \left( \frac{10}{11}, \frac{9}{11}, \frac{8}{11}, \dots, \frac{1}{11} \right).\]In particular, there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Solution:** 



The problem asks for the area of a polygon formed by the points that satisfy the given equation. The equation is a product of two terms, each of which is a square of a difference. The product is zero if and only if at least one of the terms is zero. Therefore, we need to find the points that satisfy each term being zero separately.

1. For the first term, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. This gives us two lines: $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.
2. For the second term, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us two more lines: $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.
3. For the third term, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$, which gives us two vertical lines: $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.
4. For the fourth term, $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us two horizontal lines: $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

The intersection points of these lines form a polygon. The polygon is a square with side length 20 (the distance between the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$, or the distance between the lines $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$). The area of the square is $20^2 = 400$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 400. The answer is: $400$

The first term is zero when either $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x-y| - 10 = 0$. These equations simplify to $|x+y| = 10$ and $|x-y| = 10$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x+y = 10$, $x+y = -10$, $x-y = 10$, and $x-y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle.

The second term is zero when either $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$. These equations simplify to $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines also form a rectangle.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is $0$ if and only if at least one of the factors is $0$. So we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these equations form a square with side length $20$.

2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations form a square with side length $16$.

The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for. The area of this polygon is the area of the smaller square minus the area of the overlap. The side length of the smaller square is $16$, so its area is $16^2 = 256$. The overlap is a square with side length $8$, so its area is $8^2 = 64$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $256 - 64 = 192$.

So the area of the convex polygon is $192$. The answer is: $192$
