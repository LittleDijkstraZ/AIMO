**Problem:** 
"The graph of $y=ax^2 + bx + c$ is a parabola with vertical axis of symmetry.  The vertex of this parabola is $(2,3)$ and the parabola contains the point $(4,4)$.  Find the value of $y$ when $x=6$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Because the parabola has vertex $(2,3)$, it is the graph of  \[y=a(x-2)^2+3\] for some number $a$.  In order for the graph to contain the point $(4,4)$, we must also have  \[4=a(4-2)^2+3=4a+3,\] so $a=\frac14$, and our parabola is the graph of \[y=\frac14(x-2)^2 + 3.\] Setting $x=6$ in this gives us  \[y = \frac14(6-2)^2 + 3 = 4+3=\boxed{7}.\] The answer is $\boxed{7}$

**Problem:** 
"Find the distance between the vertex of the graph of the equation $y=x^2 + 2x - 6 $ and the point $(4, 5)$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Completing the square, we get $y=(x + 1)^2 - 7 $. The vertex of the graph of this equation is thus $(-1, -7)$.The distance between $(4, 5)$ and $(-1, -7)$ is $\sqrt{(4-(-1))^2 + (5-(-7))^2} = \sqrt{25+144} =\boxed{13}$. The answer is $\boxed{13}$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $\mathcal{P}$ be the parabola in the plane determined by the equation $y = x^2.$  Suppose a circle $\mathcal{C}$ intersects $\mathcal{P}$ at four distinct points.  If three of these points are $(-28,784),$ $(-2,4),$ and $(13,169),$ find the sum of the distances from the focus of $\mathcal{P}$ to all four of the intersection points."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Let the four intersection points be $(a,a^2),$ $(b,b^2),$ $(c,c^2),$ and $(d,d^2).$  Let the equation of the circle be
\[(x - k)^2 + (y - h)^2 = r^2.\]Substituting $y = x^2,$ we get
\[(x - k)^2 + (x^2 - h)^2 = r^2.\]Expanding this equation, we get a fourth degree polynomial whose roots are $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ and $d.$  Furthermore, the coefficient of $x^3$ is 0, so by Vieta's formulas, $a + b + c + d = 0.$

We are given that three intersection points are $(-28,784),$ $(-2,4),$ and $(13,196),$ so the fourth root is $-((-28) + (-2) + 13) = 17.$

The distance from the focus to a point on the parabola is equal to the distance from the point to the directrix, which is $y = -\frac{1}{4}.$  Thus, the sum of the distances is
\[784 + \frac{1}{4} + 4 + \frac{1}{4} + 169 + \frac{1}{4} + 17^2 + \frac{1}{4} = \boxed{1247}.\] The answer is $\boxed{1247}$

The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is a numerical value. However, the output is empty because the script contains an error. The error is in the equation `equation = Eq(distance_AB, sqrt((distance_B - distance_A)**2 + (k*(distance_B - distance_A))**2))`. This equation is incorrect because it does not take into account the fact that the distance between the points of intersection is given as 6. The correct equation should be `equation = Eq(abs(solutions[1] - solutions[0]), 6)`. Let's correct this and re-run the script.

The script still fails to provide a numerical result. The error is due to the fact that the equation `equation = Eq(abs(solutions[1] - solutions[0]), 6)` is not solvable by sympy. This is because the equation involves the absolute value of a complex expression, which sympy is not able to handle.

However, we can solve this problem analytically. The equation of the parabola is $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$. The line $y = 4$ intersects the parabola when $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$. By the quadratic formula, the solutions are $x = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k} = 1 \pm \sqrt{1 - (l - 4)/k}$. The distance between the two points of intersection is $2\sqrt{1 - (l - 4)/k} = 6$, so $\sqrt{1 - (l - 4)/k} = 3$. Squaring both sides gives $1 - (l - 4)/k = 9$, or $(l - 4)/k = -8$. Solving for $l$ gives $l = 4 - 8k$.

Now we can substitute this value of $l$ into the expressions for distance_A and distance_B. The distance from each point of intersection to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + (kx^2 - 2kx + 4 - 8k)^2}$. Let's denote this distance as $D$. Then $D^2 = x^2 + (kx^2 - 2kx + 4 - 8k)^2$. We can simplify this expression by substituting $x = 1 \pm \sqrt{1 - (l - 4)/k} = 1 \pm 3$. For $x = 1 + 3 = 4$, we get $D^2 = 16 + (16k - 8k + 4 - 8k)^2 = 16 + 16^2 = 256$. For $x = 1 - 3 = -2$, we get $D^2 = 4 + (4k + 2k - 4 - 8k)^2 = 4 + 4^2 = 20$. Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $256 + 20 = 276$.

So the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is 276. The answer is $\boxed{276}$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 To solve this problem, we first need to find the x-coordinates of points A and B, then calculate the distances from A and B to the origin, and finally find the sum of the squares of these distances.

1. Set $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ and $y = 4$ equal to each other and solve for x:
\[kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4.\]
Rearrange the equation to get:
\[kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0.\]
Let's call this equation (1).

2. The distance between A and B is given as 6. By the distance formula, we have:
\[|x_2 - x_1| = 6.\]
Let $x_1$ and $x_2$ be the x-coordinates of points A and B, respectively.

3. The sum of the squares of the distances from A and B to the origin is given by:
\[(x_1^2 + y_1^2) + (x_2^2 + y_2^2).\]
Since $y_1 = y_2 = 4$, this simplifies to:
\[(x_1^2 + 16) + (x_2^2 + 16) = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32.\]

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. From equation (1), we know that the discriminant of the quadratic equation must be greater than 0 for it to have real roots (which are the x-coordinates of points A and B). The discriminant is given by:
\[D = (2k)^2 - 4k(l - 4) = 4k^2 - 4k(l - 4).\]
For $D > 0$, we have:
\[4k^2 - 4k(l - 4) > 0.\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[k^2 - k(l - 4) > 0.\]
This inequality will be used later.

2. By the quadratic formula, the x-coordinates of points A and B are given by:
\[x_{1,2} = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{(2k)^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k} = 1 \pm \sqrt{1 - (l - 4)}.\]
Since the distance between A and B is 6, we have:
\[|x_2 - x_1| = 6.\]
Substituting the expressions for $x_1$ and $x_2$, we get:
\[|1 + \sqrt{1 - (l - 4)} - (1 - \sqrt{1 - (l - 4)})| = 6.\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[2\sqrt{1 - (l - 4)} = 6.\]
Squaring both sides, we get:
\[4(1 - (l - 4)) = 36.\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[4(5 - l) = 36.\]
Dividing both sides by 4, we get:
\[5 - l = 9.\]
Solving for $l$, we get:
\[l = 5 - 9 = -4.\]
However, this value of $l$ does not satisfy the inequality $k^2 - k(l - 4) > 0$ we derived earlier. Therefore, we must have made a mistake in our calculations. Let's go back and check our work.

Upon reexamination, we realize that we made a mistake in our calculations when we used the quadratic formula to find the x-coordinates of points A and B. The correct formula should be:
\[x_{1,2} = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{(2k)^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k} = 1 \pm \sqrt{1 - (l - 4)/k^2}.\]
Now, let's redo the calculations with the correct formula.

2. Using the correct formula for $x_{1,2}$, we have:
\[x_{1,2} = 1 \pm \sqrt{1 - (l - 4)/k^2}.\]
Since the distance between A and B is 6, we have:
\[|x_2 - x_1| = 6.\]
Substituting the expressions for $x_1$ and $x_2$, we get:
\[|1 + \sqrt{1 - (l - 4)/k^2} - (1 - \sqrt{1 - (l - 4)/k^2})| = 6.\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[2\sqrt{1 - (l - 4)/k^2} = 6.\]
Squaring both sides, we get:
\[4(1 - (l - 4)/k^2) = 36.\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[4k^2 - 4(l - 4) = 36.\]
Dividing both sides by 4, we get:
\[k^2 - (l - 4) = 9.\]
Substituting $l = -4$, we get:
\[k^2 - (-4 - 4) = 9.\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[k^2 + 8 = 9.\]
Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get:
\[k^2 = 1.\]
Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[k = \pm 1.\]
Since $k > 0$, we have $k = 1$.

3. Now that we have found $k = 1$ and $l = -4$, we can find the x-coordinates of points A and B:
\[x_{1,2} = 1 \pm \sqrt{1 - (-4 - 4)/1^2} = 1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 8} = 1 \pm 3.\]
So, $x_1 = 1 - 3 = -2$ and $x_2 = 1 + 3 = 4$.

4. Now, we can find the sum of the squares of the distances from A and B to the origin:
\[(x_1^2 + y_1^2) + (x_2^2 + y_2^2) = (-2)^2 + 4^2 + 4^2 + 4^2 = 4 + 16 + 16 + 16 = 40.\]

Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from A and B to the origin is 40. The answer is: $40$

**Problem:** 
"The graph of $y=ax^2 + bx + c$ is a parabola with vertical axis of symmetry.  The vertex of this parabola is $(2,3)$ and the parabola contains the point $(4,4)$.  Find the value of $y$ when $x=6$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Because the parabola has vertex $(2,3)$, it is the graph of  \[y=a(x-2)^2+3\] for some number $a$.  In order for the graph to contain the point $(4,4)$, we must also have  \[4=a(4-2)^2+3=4a+3,\] so $a=\frac14$, and our parabola is the graph of \[y=\frac14(x-2)^2 + 3.\] Setting $x=6$ in this gives us  \[y = \frac14(6-2)^2 + 3 = 4+3=\boxed{7}.\] The answer is $\boxed{7}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, we need to find the x-coordinates of points A and B by setting $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ and $y = 4$ equal to each other and solving for x.
2. Then, we know that the distance between A and B is 6, so we can use the distance formula to set up an equation.
3. Next, we need to find the distances from A and B to the origin (0,0). We can use the distance formula again to find these distances.
4. Finally, we need to find the sum of the squares of these distances.

Now, let's write the code:

```python

    # Define the symbols

    equation = Eq(k*x**2 - 2*k*x + l, 4)

    # Solve the equation for x
    solutions = solve(equation, x)

    # Let A and B be the two points, with A being the left solution and B being the right solution
    A = solutions[0]
    B = solutions[1]

    # Calculate the distances from A and B to the origin
    distance_A = sqrt(A**2 + 0**2)
    distance_B = sqrt(B**2 + 0**2)

    # Calculate the sum of the squares of the distances
    sum_of_squares = distance_A**2 + distance_B**2

    # Simplify the expression
    sum_of_squares = sum_of_squares.simplify()

    return sum_of_squares

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"The smallest distance between the origin and a point on the parabola $y=x^2-5$ can be expressed as $\sqrt{a}/b$, where $a$ and $b$ are positive integers, and $a$ is not divisible by the square of any prime.  Find $a+b$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the distance formula, we are trying to minimize $\sqrt{x^2+y^2}=\sqrt{x^2+x^4-10x^2+25}$. In general minimization problems like this require calculus, but one elementary optimization method that sometimes works is completing the square.  We have $$\sqrt{x^2+x^4-10x^2+25}=\sqrt{(x^2-9/2)^2+(25-81/4)}.$$This expression is minimized when the square equals $0$, i.e. when $x=\pm 3/\sqrt{2}.$ For this value of $x$, the distance is $$\sqrt{25-\frac{81}{4}}=\frac{\sqrt{19}}{2}.$$Hence the desired answer is $\boxed{21}$. The answer is $\boxed{21}$

The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $32 + \frac{(k - 3|k|)^2}{k^2} + \frac{(k + 3|k|)^2}{k^2}$. However, we know that $k > 0$, so $|k| = k$. Thus, the expression simplifies to $32 + \frac{(k - 3k)^2}{k^2} + \frac{(k + 3k)^2}{k^2} = 32 + \frac{(-2k)^2}{k^2} + \frac{(4k)^2}{k^2} = 32 + 4 + 16 = 52$. Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $52$. The answer is $\boxed{52}$.

The output is not a numerical value, which indicates that we have made a mistake in our calculations. Let's go back and reevaluate the problem.

Upon revisiting the problem, we realize that we have made a mistake in our approach. The condition that the distance between A and B is 6 does not provide enough information to uniquely determine the values of k and l. Therefore, we cannot substitute this condition into our expression for the sum of the squares of the distances.

Instead, we need to find another way to solve the problem. Let's try a different approach.

Since the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$, we can substitute $y = 4$ into the equation of the parabola to get $4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l$. Rearranging terms, we have $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$. Let's denote this equation as equation (1).

The distance between $A$ and $B$ is given as 6. The distance between two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ in the plane is given by $\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$. In this case, the distance between $A$ and $B$ is $\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (4 - 4)^2} = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2} = x_2 - x_1 = 6$.

By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots of equation (1) is equal to $2k/k = 2$, and the product of the roots is equal to $(l - 4)/k$. Since the roots of equation (1) are $x_1$ and $x_2$, we have $x_1 + x_2 = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = (l - 4)/k$.

Now, we want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is given by $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. For point $A$, this is $\sqrt{x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2}$. Similarly, for point $B$, this is $\sqrt{x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2}$.

Let's denote $D_A = \sqrt{x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2}$ and $D_B = \sqrt{x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2}$. Then, the sum of the squares of the distances is $D_A^2 + D_B^2$.

We can simplify this expression using the fact that $(x_1 + x_2)^2 = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 2x_1x_2$. We have $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 2^2 - 2(l - 4)/k = 4 - 2(l - 4)/k$.

Also, $(kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2 = k^2(x_1^2 + x_2^2) - 4k(kx_1x_2) + 2l(kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l) + 2l(kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)$.

Substituting the expressions for $x_1^2 + x_2^2$ and $x_1x_2$, we get $D_A^2 + D_B^2 = k^2(4 - 2(l - 4)/k) - 4k(l - 4) + 2l(kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l) + 2l(kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)$.

This expression depends on $k$ and $l$, but we can't simplify it further without additional information. However, we can use the condition that the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6 to find a relationship between $k$ and $l$.

From the equation $x_1 + x_2 = 2$, we have $x_1 = 2 - x_2$. Substituting this into the equation $x_1x_2 = (l - 4)/k$, we get $(2 - x_2)x_2 = (l - 4)/k$. Rearranging terms, we have $2x_2 - x_2^2 = (l - 4)/k$. Multiplying both sides by $k$, we get $2kx_2 - kx_2^2 = l - 4$.

Now, we can substitute $x_2 = 3 - x_1$ into this equation to get $2k(3 - x_1) - k(3 - x_1)^2 = l - 4$. Expanding and simplifying, we have $6k - 2kx_1 - 9k + 6kx_1 - kx_1^2 = l - 4$. Rearranging terms, we get $kx_1^2 - 3kx_1 + 4 - l = 0$.

This equation must hold for the roots $x_1$ and $x_2$. Therefore, it must be the same as equation (1), which is $kx^2

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $\mathcal{P}$ be the parabola in the plane determined by the equation $y = x^2.$  Suppose a circle $\mathcal{C}$ intersects $\mathcal{P}$ at four distinct points.  If three of these points are $(-28,784),$ $(-2,4),$ and $(13,169),$ find the sum of the distances from the focus of $\mathcal{P}$ to all four of the intersection points."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Let the four intersection points be $(a,a^2),$ $(b,b^2),$ $(c,c^2),$ and $(d,d^2).$  Let the equation of the circle be
\[(x - k)^2 + (y - h)^2 = r^2.\]Substituting $y = x^2,$ we get
\[(x - k)^2 + (x^2 - h)^2 = r^2.\]Expanding this equation, we get a fourth degree polynomial whose roots are $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ and $d.$  Furthermore, the coefficient of $x^3$ is 0, so by Vieta's formulas, $a + b + c + d = 0.$

We are given that three intersection points are $(-28,784),$ $(-2,4),$ and $(13,196),$ so the fourth root is $-((-28) + (-2) + 13) = 17.$

The distance from the focus to a point on the parabola is equal to the distance from the point to the directrix, which is $y = -\frac{1}{4}.$  Thus, the sum of the distances is
\[784 + \frac{1}{4} + 4 + \frac{1}{4} + 169 + \frac{1}{4} + 17^2 + \frac{1}{4} = \boxed{1247}.\] The answer is $\boxed{1247}$

**Problem**
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


To solve this problem, we first need to find the x-coordinates of points A and B, then calculate the distances from A and B to the origin, and finally square and sum these distances.

1. Set $y = 4$ in the equation of the parabola and solve for x:
\[4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l.\]
Rearrange the equation to a standard quadratic form:
\[kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0.\]
Let $x_1$ and $x_2$ be the roots of this equation. By the quadratic formula,
\[x = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{(2k)^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k} = 1 \pm \sqrt{1 - \frac{l - 4}{k}}.\]
Since the points A and B are distance 6 apart, we have $|x_1 - x_2| = 6$, which gives us
\[|2\sqrt{1 - \frac{l - 4}{k}}| = 6 \Rightarrow \sqrt{1 - \frac{l - 4}{k}} = 3.\]
Squaring both sides, we get
\[1 - \frac{l - 4}{k} = 9 \Rightarrow \frac{l - 4}{k} = -8 \Rightarrow l - 4 = -8k \Rightarrow l = 4 - 8k.\]

2. Now, we can find the x-coordinates of A and B:
\[x_1 = 1 + \sqrt{1 - \frac{l - 4}{k}} = 1 + 3 = 4, \quad x_2 = 1 - \sqrt{1 - \frac{l - 4}{k}} = 1 - 3 = -2.\]

3. Calculate the distances from A and B to the origin:
\[OA = \sqrt{x_1^2 + y_1^2} = \sqrt{4^2 + (k(4)^2 - 2k(4) + l)^2} = \sqrt{16 + (16k - 8k + 4 - 8k)^2} = \sqrt{16 + (4 - 8k)^2},\]
\[OB = \sqrt{x_2^2 + y_2^2} = \sqrt{(-2)^2 + (k(-2)^2 - 2k(-2) + l)^2} = \sqrt{4 + (4k + 4k + 4 - 8k)^2} = \sqrt{4 + (8 - 4k)^2}.\]

4. Square and sum these distances:
\[OA^2 + OB^2 = (16 + (4 - 8k)^2) + (4 + (8 - 4k)^2).\]

Now, we can use Python to calculate the sum of the squares of the distances from A and B to the origin:

The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $80k^2 - 128k + 100$. However, we know that $k$ and $l$ are positive, so we can use the constraint $l = 4 - 8k$ to find the value of $k$. Setting $l = 0$, we get $0 = 4 - 8k$, which gives $k = \frac{1}{2}$. Substituting this value of $k$ into the expression for the sum of squares of distances, we get

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $\mathcal{P}$ be the parabola in the plane determined by the equation $y = x^2.$  Suppose a circle $\mathcal{C}$ intersects $\mathcal{P}$ at four distinct points.  If three of these points are $(-28,784),$ $(-2,4),$ and $(13,169),$ find the sum of the distances from the focus of $\mathcal{P}$ to all four of the intersection points."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Let the four intersection points be $(a,a^2),$ $(b,b^2),$ $(c,c^2),$ and $(d,d^2).$  Let the equation of the circle be
\[(x - k)^2 + (y - h)^2 = r^2.\]Substituting $y = x^2,$ we get
\[(x - k)^2 + (x^2 - h)^2 = r^2.\]Expanding this equation, we get a fourth degree polynomial whose roots are $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ and $d.$  Furthermore, the coefficient of $x^3$ is 0, so by Vieta's formulas, $a + b + c + d = 0.$

We are given that three intersection points are $(-28,784),$ $(-2,4),$ and $(13,196),$ so the fourth root is $-((-28) + (-2) + 13) = 17.$

The distance from the focus to a point on the parabola is equal to the distance from the point to the directrix, which is $y = -\frac{1}{4}.$  Thus, the sum of the distances is
\[784 + \frac{1}{4} + 4 + \frac{1}{4} + 169 + \frac{1}{4} + 17^2 + \frac{1}{4} = \boxed{1247}.\] The answer is $\boxed{1247}$

**Problem**
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"The smallest distance between the origin and a point on the parabola $y=x^2-5$ can be expressed as $\sqrt{a}/b$, where $a$ and $b$ are positive integers, and $a$ is not divisible by the square of any prime.  Find $a+b$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the distance formula, we are trying to minimize $\sqrt{x^2+y^2}=\sqrt{x^2+x^4-10x^2+25}$. In general minimization problems like this require calculus, but one elementary optimization method that sometimes works is completing the square.  We have $$\sqrt{x^2+x^4-10x^2+25}=\sqrt{(x^2-9/2)^2+(25-81/4)}.$$This expression is minimized when the square equals $0$, i.e. when $x=\pm 3/\sqrt{2}.$ For this value of $x$, the distance is $$\sqrt{25-\frac{81}{4}}=\frac{\sqrt{19}}{2}.$$Hence the desired answer is $\boxed{21}$. The answer is $\boxed{21}$
