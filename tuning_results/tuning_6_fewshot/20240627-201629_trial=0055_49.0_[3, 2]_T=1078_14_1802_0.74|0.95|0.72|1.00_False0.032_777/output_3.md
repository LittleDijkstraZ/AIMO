**Problem:** 
"How many square units are in the area of the triangle whose vertices are the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the curve $y = (x-3)^2 (x+2)$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we need to find where this curve intersects the $x$ and $y$ axes.  If $y=0$, then $(x-3)^2(x+2)=0$, which has solutions of $x=3$ and $x=-2$.  If $x=0$, then $y=(-3)^2(2)=18$.  So, the curve has two $x$-intercepts and one $y$-intercept.  The length of the base along the $x$-axis is $3-(-2)=5$.  The height from this base is equal to the $y$-intercept, 18.  The area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 5\cdot 18=\boxed{45}$. The answer is $\boxed{45}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


This problem requires a deep understanding of absolute value and inequalities, which is beyond the scope of this platform. However, we can provide a solution to a similar problem.

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of a square with side length 20. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.

Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

The intersection of these two squares is a smaller square with side length 8 (the vertices of the smaller square are the intersections of the vertices of the larger squares). The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon formed by the intersection of the two squares is the sum of the areas of the two smaller squares, which is $400 - 256 + 64 = 160$.

However, this answer is incorrect. The correct answer should be the area of the intersection of the two squares, which is $64$.

This problem is a bit tricky and requires a deep understanding of absolute value and inequalities. The actual solution to the problem presented in the question is as follows:

The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. This polygon is the intersection of the two squares described above. The area of this convex polygon is the area of the intersection of the two squares, which is $64$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $64$.
The answer is: $64$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Five identical rectangles are arranged to form a larger rectangle $PQRS$, as shown.  The area of $PQRS$ is $4000$.  What is the length, $x$, rounded off to the nearest integer? [asy]
real x = 1; real w = 2/3;

// Draw outer square and labels
pair s = (0, 0); pair r = (2 * x, 0); pair q = (3 * w, x + w); pair p = (0, x + w);
draw(s--r--q--p--cycle);
label("$S$", s, SW); label("$R$", r, SE); label("$Q$", q, NE); label("$P$", p, NW);

// Draw other segments

draw((0, w)--(2 * x, w));
draw((w, x + w)--(w, w)); draw((2 * w, x + w)--(2 * w, w));

// length labels
pair upper = (-0.1, x + w);
pair lower = (-0.1, w);
draw(lower--upper);
draw((-0.1 - 0.03, x + w)--(-0.1 + 0.03, x + w));
draw((-0.1 - 0.03, w)--(-0.1 + 0.03, w));
label("$x$", midpoint((-0.1, w)--(-0.1, x + w)), W);

pair left = (0, -0.1); pair right = (x, -0.1);
draw((0, -0.1 + 0.03)--(0, -0.1 - 0.03));
draw((x, -0.1 - 0.03)--(x, -0.1 + 0.03));
draw(left--right);
label("$x$", (x/2, -0.1), S);

[/asy]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Let $w$ be the width of each of the identical rectangles. Since $PQ=3w$, $RS=2x$ and $PQ=RS$ (because $PQRS$ is a rectangle), then $2x = 3w$, or $$w=\frac{2}{3}x.$$ Therefore, the area of each of the five identical rectangles is $$x\left(\frac{2}{3}x\right)=\frac{2}{3}x^2.$$ Since the area of $PQRS$ is 4000 and it is made up of five of these identical smaller rectangles, then $$5\left(\frac{2}{3}x^2\right)=4000$$ or $$\frac{10}{3}x^2 = 4000$$ or $x^2 = 1200$ or $x \approx 34.6$ which, when rounded off to the nearest integer, is $\boxed{35}.$ The answer is $\boxed{35}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. 

The first expression is zero when $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x-y| - 10 = 0$, which simplifies to $|x+y| = 10$ or $|x-y| = 10$. This represents a pair of parallel lines with a distance of 10 units between them.

The second expression is zero when $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$, which simplifies to $|x| = 8$ or $|y| = 8$. This represents a pair of parallel lines with a distance of 8 units from the origin.

The intersection of these lines form a rectangle with side lengths of 16 units and 20 units. The area of this rectangle is $16 \times 20 = 320$ square units.

So, the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points that satisfy the given equation is 320 square units.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The product of two terms equals zero if and only if at least one of the terms equals zero. So, we have two sets of equations: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

2. Solving the equations $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This results in a square with side length 10.

3. Solving the equations $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This results in a square with side length 16.

4. The area of the square with side length 10 is $10^2 = 100$, and the area of the square with side length 16 is $16^2 = 256$.

5. The convex polygon enclosed by the points satisfying the original equation is the intersection of these two squares, which is a square with side length 10.

6. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{100}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The expression is equal to zero when either of the terms in the product is zero. So, we have two sets of equations:
   a) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
   b) $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$

2. From a), we get $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $-8 \le x, y \le 8$.

3. From b), we get $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. Together with the results from a), this forms a square with vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

4. To find the side length of the square, we can calculate the distance between $(8, 8)$ and $(8, -8)$, which is $16$. So the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. This gives us two sets of equations:

1. $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x-y| - 10 = 0$
2. $|x| - 8 = 0$ and $|y| - 8 = 0$

For the first set of equations, we have $|x+y| = 10$ and $|x-y| = 10$. This implies that $x+y = \pm 10$ and $x-y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations gives us the vertices of the first polygon: $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, and $(-10, 0)$.

For the second set of equations, we have $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these four equations gives us the vertices of the second polygon: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The first polygon is a square with side length 10, so its area is $10^2 = 100$. The second polygon is a square with side length 16, so its area is $16^2 = 256$.

The area of the convex polygon formed by the union of the two polygons is the sum of the areas of the two polygons, which is $100 + 256 = 356$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 356. The answer is: $356$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Find the number of 10-tuples $(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{10})$ of real numbers such that
\[(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2 = \frac{1}{11}.\]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,
\begin{align*}
&[(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + \dots + 1^2 + 1^2)][(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2] \\
&\ge [(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + (x_2 - x_3) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10}]^2 = 1.
\end{align*}From the given condition, we have equality, so by the equality condition for Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[\frac{1 - x_1}{1} = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{1} = \frac{x_2 - x_3}{1} = \dots = \frac{x_9 - x_{10}}{1} = \frac{x_{10}}{1}.\]Let
\[d = 1 - x_1 = x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_3 = \dots = x_9 - x_{10} = x_{10}.\]Then
\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so
\[(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_{10}) = \left( \frac{10}{11}, \frac{9}{11}, \frac{8}{11}, \dots, \frac{1}{11} \right).\]In particular, there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. Therefore, either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

The first term being zero gives us:
\[(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0.\]
This can only be true if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of a square with side length 20: $(\pm 10, 0)$ and $(0, \pm 10)$.

The second term being zero gives us:
\[(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0.\]
This can only be true if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of a square with side length 16: $(\pm 8, 0)$ and $(0, \pm 8)$.

The two squares overlap, and the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points satisfying the given equation is the sum of the areas of the two squares minus the area of the overlapping region. 

The area of a square with side length $a$ is $a^2$. Therefore, the area of the first square is $20^2 = 400$, and the area of the second square is $16^2 = 256$. The overlapping region is a square with side length $8$, so its area is $8^2 = 64$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $400 + 256 - 64 = 592$.

"Let $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_ 2= (-16,2).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that
\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as

Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

"An ellipse is defined parametrically by
\[(x,y) = \left( \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t}, \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t} \right).\]Then the equation of the ellipse can be written in the form
\[Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0,\]where $A,$ $B,$ $C,$ $D,$ $E,$ and $F$ are integers, and $\gcd(|A|,|B|,|C|,|D|,|E|,|F|) = 1.$  Find $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F|.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
In the equation $y = \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\cos t$ to get
\[\cos t = \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3}.\]In the equation $x = \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\sin t$ to get
\[\sin t = \frac{1}{2} x (2 - \cos t) + 1 = \frac{1}{2} x \left( 2 - \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right) + 1 = 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)}.\]Since $\cos^2 t + \sin^2 t = 1,$
\[\left( \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right)^2 + \left( 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)} \right)^2 = 1.\]Multiplying both sides by $(2(y + 3))^2$ and expanding, it will simplify to
\[81x^2 - 36xy + 16y^2 - 108x + 240y + 900 = 0.\]Therefore, $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F| = 81 + 36 + 16 + 108 + 240 + 900 = \boxed{1381}.$ The answer is $\boxed{1381}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


The area of the convex polygon formed by the set of points $(x, y)$ satisfying the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is 0. This is because the equation is equal to 0 if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. Each of these conditions implies that either $|x + y| = 10$, $|x - y| = 10$, $|x| = 8$, or $|y| = 8$. These conditions define a set of lines in the plane, and the polygon formed by their intersections is a square with side length 16. However, the area of this square is 0 because its side length is 0 (the square is a line segment in the plane). Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 0. The answer is: $\boxed{0}$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many square units are in the area of the triangle whose vertices are the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the curve $y = (x-3)^2 (x+2)$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we need to find where this curve intersects the $x$ and $y$ axes.  If $y=0$, then $(x-3)^2(x+2)=0$, which has solutions of $x=3$ and $x=-2$.  If $x=0$, then $y=(-3)^2(2)=18$.  So, the curve has two $x$-intercepts and one $y$-intercept.  The length of the base along the $x$-axis is $3-(-2)=5$.  The height from this base is equal to the $y$-intercept, 18.  The area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 5\cdot 18=\boxed{45}$. The answer is $\boxed{45}$

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



First, we need to understand the problem. The given equation is a product of two terms set equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

The first term, $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, is zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These two equations represent two lines that intersect at right angles, forming a square with side length 20. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.

The second term, $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$, is zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These two equations represent a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

The points that satisfy the original equation are those that satisfy either of these conditions. Therefore, the convex polygon formed by these points is the union of the two squares, so its area is the sum of the areas of the two squares, which is $400 + 256 = 656$.

The answer is $\boxed{656}$.

Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Let $w$ be the width of each of the identical rectangles. Since $PQ=3w$, $RS=2x$ and $PQ=RS$ (because $PQRS$ is a rectangle), then $2x = 3w$, or $$w=\frac{2}{3}x.$$ Therefore, the area of each of the five identical rectangles is $$x\left(\frac{2}{3}x\right)=\frac{2}{3}x^2.$$ Since the area of $PQRS$ is 4000 and it is made up of five of these identical smaller rectangles, then $$5\left(\frac{2}{3}x^2\right)=4000$$ or $$\frac{10}{3}x^2 = 4000$$ or $x^2 = 1200$ or $x \approx 34.6$ which, when rounded off to the nearest integer, is $\boxed{35}.$ The answer is $\boxed{35}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The equation given is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term or the second term must be zero. This gives us four cases to consider:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8) = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8) = 0$.
2. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8) = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8) \neq 0$.
3. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8) \neq 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8) = 0$.
4. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8) \neq 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8) \neq 0$.

For the first case, we have $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us a square with side length 16.

For the second and third cases, we have $x = \pm 8$ and $y$ can be any value, or $y = \pm 8$ and $x$ can be any value. This gives us four vertical and four horizontal lines passing through $\pm 8$ on the coordinate plane.

For the fourth case, we have $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. This gives us four lines forming a cross at the points $(\pm 8, \pm 2)$ and $(\pm 2, \pm 8)$.

The area of the convex polygon formed by these lines is the area of the square with side length 16, which is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$
