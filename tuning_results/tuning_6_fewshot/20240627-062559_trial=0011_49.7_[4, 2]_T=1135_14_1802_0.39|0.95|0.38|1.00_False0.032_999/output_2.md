Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, we need to understand that the equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. This means that the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be equal to 2. This is because the expression $| |x - 1| - 2 |$ can only be equal to 2 for 4 distinct solutions.

2. So, we have $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, which gives us $m = 200$.

3. Therefore, the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 200.

So, the answer is $\boxed{200}$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many integers are solutions to the equation $$(x-2)^{(25-x^2)}=1?$$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
We need some basic facts from number theory: $a^0 = 1$ for any $a,$ $1^b = 1$ for any $b,$ and $(-1)^c = 1$ if $c$ is an even integer. Unless the base is a complex number (which is excluded since we are looking for integer solutions), there are no other ways to get an RHS of $1.$ Thus, either the exponent is zero $($giving the equation $25 - x^2 = 0),$ the base is $1$ $($giving $x -2 = 1),$ or the base is $-1$ and the exponent is even $($giving the simultaneous equations $x - 2 = -1$ and $25 - x^2 = 2n$ for some integer $n).$ Solving the first equation gives $x = \pm 5,$ and solving the second gives $x = 3.$ The third equation implies that $x = 1,$ in which case $25 - x^2 = 24$ is indeed even, so $x = 1$ is a valid solution. In all, there are $\boxed{4}$ integer solutions. The answer is $\boxed{4}$

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $1$ or $3$.
If $\frac{m}{100}=1$, then $m=100$.
If $\frac{m}{100}=3$, then $m=300$.
Therefore, there are $2$ possible values for $m$.

```python

def number_of_values():
    """For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"""

    possible_values = [100, 300]

    # Count the number of possible values
    num_values = len(possible_values)

    return num_values

result = number_of_values()
print(result)
```

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $2$. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a "V" shape with vertices at $x=1$ and $x=3$, and the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ determines the height of the "V" shape. If $\frac{m}{100}$ is less than $1$, the "V" shape does not intersect the x-axis at all. If $\frac{m}{100}$ is greater than or equal to $2$, the "V" shape intersects the x-axis at exactly two points. If $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $2$, the "V" shape intersects the x-axis at exactly four points.

So we want to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Multiplying all sides of the inequality by $100$ gives $100 < m < 200$. The number of positive integers in this range is $200 - 100 - 1 = 99$.

However, we have to subtract $1$ because $m$ cannot be $100$ or $200$ (because $m$ must be strictly between $100$ and $200$). So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $99 - 1 = 98$.

So the answer is $\boxed{98}$.

Here is a Python program that calculates the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions:
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def count_m():
    lower_bound = 100
    upper_bound = 200
    count = upper_bound - lower_bound - 1
    return count

result = count_m()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 99

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
99
```
However, we have to subtract $1$ because $m$ cannot be $100$ or $200$ (because $m$ must be strictly between $100$ and $200$). So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $99 - 1 = 98$.

So the answer is $\boxed{98}$.
The answer is $\boxed{98}$.

**Solution:**


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $2$. Therefore, we need to find the value of $m$ such that $\frac{m}{100}=2$.

To find $m$, we can multiply both sides of the equation by $100$ to get $m=200$.

So, the value of $m$ is $200$. The answer is: $200$

## QUESTION 2 - 7

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"For certain ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ of real numbers, the system of equations
\[\begin{aligned} ax+by&=1 \\ x^2 + y^2 &= 50  \end{aligned}\]has at least one solution, and each solution is an ordered pair $(x,y)\,$ of integers. How many such ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ are there?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The graph of $ax+by=1$ is a line, while the graph of $x^2+y^2=50$ is a circle centered at the origin. Therefore, $(a, b)$ satisfies the conditions if and only if the line and circle intersect at least once, and they intersect only at lattice points (points with integer coordinates).

Knowing this, it makes sense to look for lattice points on the circle whose equation is $x^2+y^2=50$. Testing cases, we find that there are twelve lattice points on the circle: $(\pm 1, \pm 7)$, $(\pm 7, \pm 1)$, and $(\pm 5, \pm 5)$ (where the two $\pm$ signs in each pair are independent of each other).

There are $\tbinom{12}{2} = 66$ pairs of these points, and each pair determines a line. However, the graph of $ax+by=1$ can never pass through the origin $(0, 0)$, since if $x=y=0$, then $ax+by=0 \neq 1$. Therefore, the six pairs which consist of diametrically opposed points are invalid, since the line through them passes through the origin. This corrects our count to $66 - 6 = 60$.

In addition, for each of the twelve points, there is a line tangent to the circle at that point, so that the only solution to the system is that one point. This brings the final total to $60 + 12 = \boxed{72}$. The answer is $\boxed{72}$

So the positive integer $m$ that makes the equation have $4$ distinct solutions is $100$. The answer is: $100$.
