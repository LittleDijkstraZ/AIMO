**Problem:** 
"How many square units are in the area of the triangle whose vertices are the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the curve $y = (x-3)^2 (x+2)$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we need to find where this curve intersects the $x$ and $y$ axes.  If $y=0$, then $(x-3)^2(x+2)=0$, which has solutions of $x=3$ and $x=-2$.  If $x=0$, then $y=(-3)^2(2)=18$.  So, the curve has two $x$-intercepts and one $y$-intercept.  The length of the base along the $x$-axis is $3-(-2)=5$.  The height from this base is equal to the $y$-intercept, 18.  The area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 5\cdot 18=\boxed{45}$. The answer is $\boxed{45}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. This means that the points that satisfy the equation are either on the curve defined by the first expression being zero or on the curve defined by the second expression being zero.

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, which is zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two squares with side length 20 centered at the origin.

The second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$, which is zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This is the equation of a square with side length 16 centered at the origin.

The points that satisfy the equation are therefore the vertices of the square with side length 20, which are $(\pm 10, 0)$, $(0, \pm 10)$, and the vertices of the square with side length 16, which are $(\pm 8, 0)$, $(0, \pm 8)$.

The convex polygon formed by these points is a rectangle with side lengths 16 and 20. The area of this rectangle is $16 \times 20 = 320$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 320.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    side_length_square1 = 20
    side_length_square2 = 16
    area = side_length_square1 * side_length_square2
    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 320

The area of the convex polygon is 320. The answer is: $320$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_ 2= (-16,2).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that
\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as
\[\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1.\]Find $h + k + a + b.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. 

Let's analyze each expression separately:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which further implies $x + y = \pm 10$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which further implies $x - y = \pm 10$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x \vert = 8$, which further implies $x = \pm 8$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert y \vert = 8$, which further implies $y = \pm 8$.

The solutions to these equations are the vertices of the polygon. We can find them by considering all possible combinations of the signs in the absolute value equations. 

After finding the vertices, we can calculate the area of the polygon using the Shoelace formula.

Here is the Python code to solve the problem:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Abs

def find_vertices():
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # List to store all vertices
    vertices = []

    # For each combination of signs in the absolute value equations
    for sign_x_plus_y in [1, -1]:
        for sign_x_minus_y in [1, -1]:
            for sign_x in [1, -1]:
                for sign_y in [1, -1]:
                    # Solve the absolute value equations
                    x_val = sign_x * 8
                    y_val = sign_y * 8
                    if Abs(x_val + y_val) == 10 and Abs(x_val - y_val) == 10:
                        vertices.append((x_val, y_val))

    return vertices

vertices = find_vertices()
print(vertices)
```

The output is empty because the vertices obtained from the absolute value equations do not satisfy both conditions simultaneously. This means that there is an error in the problem statement or the approach used to solve it. 

Upon revisiting the problem, we realize that the second condition $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$ respectively, which contradicts with the first condition $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. 

The correct conditions should be:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $x + y = \pm 10$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $x - y = \pm 10$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $x = \pm 8$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $y = \pm 8$.

Now, let's find the vertices again:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def find_vertices():
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # List to store all vertices
    vertices = []

    # For each combination of signs in the absolute value equations
    for sign_x_plus_y in [1, -1]:
        for sign_x_minus_y in [1, -1]:
            # Solve the absolute value equations
            x_val = 8 * sign_x_plus_y
            y_val = 8 * sign_x_minus_y
            if x_val + y_val == 10 or x_val + y_val == -10 and x_val - y_val == 10 or x_val - y_val == -10:
                vertices.append((x_val, y_val))

    return vertices

vertices = find_vertices()
print(vertices)
```

The output is still empty because the conditions given still do not satisfy simultaneously. 

Upon revisiting the problem again, we realize that the conditions given are contradictory. The first two conditions imply that $x$ and $y$ are both positive or both negative, while the last two conditions imply that $x$ and $y$ have opposite signs. This is a contradiction. 

The correct conditions should be:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $x + y = \pm 10$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $x - y = \pm 10$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $x = \pm 8$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $y = \pm 8$.

Now, let's find the vertices again:

```
The error in the code is due to the fact that the `solutions` list is empty. This is because the system of equations has no solutions. The equations represent four lines in the plane: two vertical lines at $x = \pm 8$ and two horizontal lines at $y = \pm 8$. The intersection of these lines is a rectangle with side lengths 16 and 20, so the area of the polygon is $16 \times 20 = 320$.

However, the error in the code is due to the fact that the `solutions` list is empty. This is because the system of equations has no solutions. The equations represent four lines in the plane: two vertical lines at $x = \pm 8$ and two horizontal lines at $y = \pm 8$. The intersection of these lines is a rectangle with side lengths 16 and 20, so the area of the polygon is $16 \times 20 = 320$.

To correct this, we can simply calculate the area of the rectangle directly:

    # Side lengths of the rectangle
    length = 20
    width = 16

    # Calculate the area
