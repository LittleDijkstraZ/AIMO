Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, we need to understand the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. This equation has 4 distinct solutions, which means that the right-hand side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, should be in the interval $(0, 2]$. The reason is that the absolute value of the left-hand side of the equation will be less than or equal to 2, so $\frac{m}{100}$ must be in the interval $(0, 2]$ to allow 4 distinct solutions.

Next, we want to find out how many positive integer values of $m$ will satisfy this condition. We can rewrite the inequality as $0 < \frac{m}{100} \leq 2$. Multiplying all sides by 100 gives $0 < m \leq 200$. So we need to find out how many positive integers fall into this range.

```python

            count += 1
    return count

result = count_positive_integers()
print(result)
```

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let \[f(x) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
-x + 3 & \text{if } x \le 0, \\
2x - 5 & \text{if } x > 0.
\end{array}
\right.\]How many solutions does the equation $f(f(x)) = 4$ have?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
To solve the equation $f(f(x)) = 4,$ we first find the values $x$ such that $f(x) = 4.$

Either $f(x) = -x + 3$ (for $x \le 0$) or $f(x) = 2x - 5$ (for $x > 0$). If $-x + 3 = 4,$ then $x = -1.$ Note that this value satisfies $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = 4,$ then $x = 9/2.$ Note that this value satisfies $x > 0.$ Therefore, the solutions to $f(x) = 4$ are $x = -1$ and $x = 9/2.$

Next, we solve for the values $x$ such that $f(x) = -1.$ If $-x + 3 = -1,$ then $x = 4.$ This value does not satisfy $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = -1,$ then $x = 2.$ This value satisfies $x > 0.$

Finally, we solve for the values $x$ such that $f(x) = 9/2.$ If $-x + 3 = 9/2,$ then $x = -3/2.$ This value satisfies $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = 9/2,$ then $x = 19/4.$ This value satisfies $x > 0.$

Therefore, the equation $f(f(x)) = 4$ has the solutions $x = 2,$ $-3/2,$ and $19/4,$ for a total of $\boxed{3}$ solutions. The answer is $\boxed{3}$

**Solution:** 


We will now solve the problem step by step.

1. First, let's draw the graph of $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ and $y = \frac{m}{100}$ to get an idea of how many solutions there are.
2. We can see that the equation $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has four distinct solutions when $\frac{2}{100} < \frac{m}{100} < \frac{3}{100}$.
3. So we need to find how many positive integers $m$ satisfy this inequality.
4. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are $2 < m < 3$.
5. The only positive integer $m$ that satisfies this inequality is $m = 2$.

So the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions for $m = 2$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ is $1$. The answer is $\boxed{1}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. If $|x-1| - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$, we have $|x-1| = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.
2. So, we have two cases:
   a. If $x-1 \geq 0$, then $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, so $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.
   b. If $x-1 < 0$, then $1-x = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, so $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Now, we need to find the number of distinct solutions for $x$. This means we need to find the number of $m$ such that the equations $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$ have 4 distinct solutions.

Setting the two equations equal to each other gives $3 + \frac{m}{100} = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\frac{2m}{100} = -4$, or $m = -200$. However, $m$ must be positive, so there are no such $m$ that satisfy the conditions.

We can then conclude that the equation $| \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can have 4 distinct solutions only if $m=200$. But this is not a positive integer.

Therefore, there must be a mistake in our reasoning. Let's re-examine the equation $| \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.

Notice that the absolute value of a quantity is always non-negative, so $| \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is non-negative. Therefore, the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must also be non-negative, which implies $m$ must be a non-negative integer.

However, we've been asked to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation has 4 distinct solutions. So, let's reconsider the two cases for the absolute value equation.

For $x-1 \geq 0$, we have $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$. For this equation to have 2 distinct solutions, $3 + \frac{m}{100}$ must be greater than $-1 - \frac{m}{100}$. This gives $4 + \frac{m}{100} > 0$, or $m > -400$. However, since $m$ must be a positive integer, this inequality doesn't limit the possible values of $m$.

For $x-1 < 0$, we have $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$. For this equation to have 2 distinct solutions, $-1 - \frac{m}{100}$ must be less than $3 + \frac{m}{100}$. This gives $-4 - \frac{m}{100} < 0$, or $m > 400$. But this is not possible, as $m$ must be a positive integer less than 400.

Therefore, we must have made a mistake in our reasoning. Let's re-examine the problem statement.

The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $| \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. But we have found that this equation can never have 4 distinct solutions, as the absolute value of a quantity is always non-negative and the right side of the equation must also be non-negative.

However, we've been asked to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation has 4 distinct solutions. Let's re-examine the two cases for the absolute value equation.

For $x-1 \geq 0$, we have $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$. For this equation to have 2 distinct solutions, $3 + \frac{m}{100}$ must be greater than $-1 - \frac{m}{100}$. This gives $4 + \frac{m}{100} > 0$, or $m > -400$. But since $m$ is a positive integer, this inequality doesn't limit the possible values of $m$.

For $x-1 < 0$, we have $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$. For this equation to have 2 distinct solutions, $-1 - \frac{m}{100}$ must be less than $3 + \frac{m}{100}$. This gives $-4 - \frac{m}{100} < 0$, or $m > 400$. But this is not possible, as $m$ must be a positive integer less than 400.

Therefore, the absolute value equation $| \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can have 4 distinct solutions only if both cases have 2 distinct solutions. This occurs when $m = 200$. But $m = 200$ is not a positive integer, which is a contradiction.

So, let's reconsider the problem statement again.

This gives $4 + \frac{m}{100} > 0$, or $m > -400$. But since $m$ is a positive integer, this inequality doesn't limit the possible values of $m$.

For $x-1 < 0$, we have $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$. For this equation to have 2 distinct solutions, $-1 - \frac{m}{100}$ must be less than $3 + \frac{m}{100}$. This gives $-4 - \frac{m}{100} < 0$, or $m > 400$. But this is not possible, as $m$ must be a positive integer less than 400.

**Solution:** 


To find the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions, we need to find the possible values of $m$ for which the equation has $4$ solutions.

Let's start by simplifying the equation. We know that $\frac{m}{100}$ must be a positive number, so $m$ must be a positive integer. Also, the absolute value function makes the expression inside it non-negative, so $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ must be greater than or equal to $0$. This means that $\vert x-1 \vert -2$ must be equal to some positive integer $k$ (where $k = m/100$). So we have $\vert x-1 \vert = k+2$. 

This equation will have $4$ solutions if and only if $k+2 > 1$, because in that case the absolute value equation will split into two separate linear equations, each of which will have two solutions. So we need $k > -1$, which means $m > -100$. 

However, since $m$ is a positive integer, the smallest possible value for $m$ is $1$. This corresponds to $k = 0$, which gives $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$. This equation splits into $x-1 = 2$ and $x-1 = -2$, yielding the four solutions $x = 3, -1$. 

So the only possible value for $m$ is $1$. To confirm this, we can substitute $m = 1$ back into the original equation to check if it has $4$ distinct solutions. The equation becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{1}{100}$, which simplifies to $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = 0.01$. 

Solving this equation, we find that $\vert x-1 \vert = 2.01$ or $\vert x-1 \vert = 1.99$. The first equation gives $x = 3.01$ or $x = -1.01$, and the second equation gives $x = 2.99$ or $x = 0.01$. These are all four distinct solutions, confirming that $m = 1$ is the only possible value. 

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $1$. The answer is: $1$

The value of $m$ that makes the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have $4$ distinct solutions is $1$. However, it's given that $m$ is a positive integer. So, we need to find the value of $m$ such that the equation has $4$ distinct solutions, where $m$ is a positive integer.

We will now find the value of $m$ that makes the equation have $4$ distinct solutions.

We know that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have $4$ distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100} = 1$.

So, we have $\frac{m}{100} = 1$.

To find the value of $m$, we can multiply both sides of the equation by $100$.

$m = 100$.

So, the value of $m$ that makes the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have $4$ distinct solutions, where $m$ is a positive integer, is $100$.

Therefore, the value of $m$ is $100$. The answer is: $100$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let \[f(x) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
-x + 3 & \text{if } x \le 0, \\
2x - 5 & \text{if } x > 0.
\end{array}
\right.\]How many solutions does the equation $f(f(x)) = 4$ have?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
To solve the equation $f(f(x)) = 4,$ we first find the values $x$ such that $f(x) = 4.$

Either $f(x) = -x + 3$ (for $x \le 0$) or $f(x) = 2x - 5$ (for $x > 0$). If $-x + 3 = 4,$ then $x = -1.$ Note that this value satisfies $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = 4,$ then $x = 9/2.$ Note that this value satisfies $x > 0.$ Therefore, the solutions to $f(x) = 4$ are $x = -1$ and $x = 9/2.$

Next, we solve for the values $x$ such that $f(x) = -1.$ If $-x + 3 = -1,$ then $x = 4.$ This value does not satisfy $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = -1,$ then $x = 2.$ This value satisfies $x > 0.$

Finally, we solve for the values $x$ such that $f(x) = 9/2.$ If $-x + 3 = 9/2,$ then $x = -3/2.$ This value satisfies $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = 9/2,$ then $x = 19/4.$ This value satisfies $x > 0.$

Therefore, the equation $f(f(x)) = 4$ has the solutions $x = 2,$ $-3/2,$ and $19/4,$ for a total of $\boxed{3}$ solutions. The answer is $\boxed{3}$

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



First, let's understand the problem. We need to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has exactly 4 distinct solutions.

To solve this, we can use the property of absolute value functions that $|a| = b$ has two solutions if $b > 0$, one solution if $b = 0$, and no solution if $b < 0$. Therefore, the equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ will have 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} > 0$ and the equation $|x - 1| - 2 = \pm \frac{m}{100}$ has 2 equations with 2 distinct solutions each.

We can solve this by first solving the equation $|x - 1| - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $|x - 1| - 2 = -\frac{m}{100}$. For each of these equations, we can split the absolute value into two cases: $x - 1 - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $-(x - 1) - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$, and $x - 1 - 2 = -\frac{m}{100}$ and $-(x - 1) - 2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.

This gives us four equations to solve: $x - 3 = \frac{m}{100}$, $x - 3 = -\frac{m}{100}$, $-x + 1 - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$, and $-x + 1 - 2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.

We can simplify these to: $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$, $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$, and $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

These four equations have 2 distinct solutions each if and only if the right-hand side is positive for at least one of the equations and the intervals for the solutions do not overlap.

For the first and third equations, the right-hand side is positive when $m > 0$, and the intervals for the solutions do not overlap when $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 + \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $m \neq -700$.

For the second and fourth equations, the right-hand side is positive when $m > 0$, and the intervals for the solutions do not overlap when $3 - \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $m \neq 500$.

Therefore, the equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $0 < m < 500$ or $500 < m < 700$.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is the number of integers in the interval $(0, 500)$ and the interval $(500, 700)$, which is $500 - 1 + 200 - 1 = 700 - 1$.

Therefore, the number of such positive integers $m$ is 699.

The value of $m$ that we are looking for is 699. To confirm, we can simply print this value:

```python

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**



The equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is less than $2$ but greater than $0$. This is because the expression $| |x-1|-2|$ can have at most four distinct solutions:
- If $| |x-1|-2|>2$, the equation has no solutions.
- If $| |x-1|-2|=2$, the equation has exactly two solutions.
- If $0<| |x-1|-2|<2$, the equation has exactly four distinct solutions.
- If $| |x-1|-2|=0$, the equation has exactly one solution.

We need to find the values of $m$ such that $0<\frac{m}{100}<2$. This is equivalent to $0<m<200$.

So the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition is $199$.

However, we also need to consider the fact that the equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ is equivalent to the system of equations
\[|x-1|-2=\frac{m}{100} \quad \text{or} \quad |x-1|-2=-\frac{m}{100}.\]
The second equation is equivalent to $|x-1|+2=\frac{m}{100}$, which leads to the same solutions as the first equation. Therefore, we have counted each solution twice. To get the correct number of distinct solutions, we need to divide the number of possible values of $m$ by $2$.

So the number of positive integers $m$ that make the equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ have four distinct solutions is $\frac{199}{2}=99.5$. However, the number of positive integers cannot be a decimal, so we must have made a mistake in our reasoning.

Upon revisiting our reasoning, we realize that we have only considered the case where the absolute value expression is positive. We have not considered the case where it is negative. If $| |x-1|-2|=-\frac{m}{100}$, then $|x-1|-2=-\frac{m}{100}$. This is equivalent to $|x-1|=2-\frac{m}{100}$. This can only have two distinct solutions if $2-\frac{m}{100}>0$, or $m<200$. Therefore, we need to consider the values of $m$ in the range $0<m<200$. The number of positive integers in this range is $199$. However, we have counted each solution twice, so we need to divide this number by $2$. The number of distinct solutions is then $\frac{199}{2}=99.5$. Again, this is not a valid number of solutions.

Upon further reflection, we realize that we have made an error in our reasoning. The equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ can have four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is less than $2$ but greater than or equal to $0$. The error in our reasoning was in not including the case where $| |x-1|-2|=0$. If $| |x-1|-2|=0$, then $|x-1|=2$, and the equation has exactly one solution. Therefore, we have overcounted the number of solutions and need to subtract one from our previous count.

So the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition is $199-1=198$. Again, we have made an error in our reasoning. The equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ can have four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is less than $2$ but greater than or equal to $0$. The error in our reasoning was in not including the case where $| |x-1|-2|=0$. If $| |x-1|-2|=0$, then $|x-1|=2$, and the equation has exactly one solution. However, this case is already included in the case where $0<| |x-1|-2|<2$. Therefore, we do not need to subtract one from our previous count.

So the number of positive integers $m$ that make the equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ have four distinct solutions is $198$. However, this number is even, and the number of solutions should be odd (since the equation is equivalent to a pair of equations, each of which has an odd number of solutions, and the sum of two odd numbers is even). Therefore, we must have made another error in our reasoning.

Upon revisiting our reasoning again, we realize that we have misunderstood the conditions for the equation to have four distinct solutions. The equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ can have four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is less than $2$ but greater than $0$. This is equivalent to $0<m<200$. However, we have not considered the case where $| |x-1|-2|=0$. If $| |x-1|-2|=0$, then $|x-1|=2$, and the equation has exactly one solution. However, this case is already included in the case where $0<| |x-1|-2|<2$. Therefore, we do not need to subtract one from our previous count.

So the number of positive integers $m$ that make the equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ have four distinct solutions is $198$.

So the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition is 198. The answer is $\boxed{198}$.

This is a complex problem that requires understanding of absolute value functions and the number of roots of an equation. The main idea is to first solve the equation for different values of $m$ and see how many distinct roots it has.

```python

from sympy import symbols, Eq, Abs, solveset, S, Rational

    distinct_roots = 0

    for possible_m in range(1, 101):  # Check possible values of m from 1 to 100
        current_equation = equation.subs(m, possible_m)
        solution = solveset(current_equation, x, domain=S.Reals)
        if len(solution) == 4:  # If there are 4 distinct roots
            distinct_roots += 1

    return distinct_roots

result = number_of_roots()
print(result)
```

After analyzing the error, it seems like the script is not handling the integer argument correctly. The reason is that `m` is a symbolic integer, not a numerical integer. We need to fix this by using a for loop instead.

Let's modify the script and add a for loop to check the values of $m$ from $1$ to $100$. For each value of $m$, we will solve the equation and count the number of distinct roots.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Eq, Abs, solveset, S, Rational

## QUESTION 2 - 13 
- TIME_SPENT : 472 secs

13_
**Example**

**Problem:** 
"For certain ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ of real numbers, the system of equations
\[\begin{aligned} ax+by&=1 \\ x^2 + y^2 &= 50  \end{aligned}\]has at least one solution, and each solution is an ordered pair $(x,y)\,$ of integers. How many such ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ are there?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The graph of $ax+by=1$ is a line, while the graph of $x^2+y^2=50$ is a circle centered at the origin. Therefore, $(a, b)$ satisfies the conditions if and only if the line and circle intersect at least once, and they intersect only at lattice points (points with integer coordinates).

Knowing this, it makes sense to look for lattice points on the circle whose equation is $x^2+y^2=50$. Testing cases, we find that there are twelve lattice points on the circle: $(\pm 1, \pm 7)$, $(\pm 7, \pm 1)$, and $(\pm 5, \pm 5)$ (where the two $\pm$ signs in each pair are independent of each other).

There are $\tbinom{12}{2} = 66$ pairs of these points, and each pair determines a line. However, the graph of $ax+by=1$ can never pass through the origin $(0, 0)$, since if $x=y=0$, then $ax+by=0 \neq 1$. Therefore, the six pairs which consist of diametrically opposed points are invalid, since the line through them passes through the origin. This corrects our count to $66 - 6 = 60$.

In addition, for each of the twelve points, there is a line tangent to the circle at that point, so that the only solution to the system is that one point. This brings the final total to $60 + 12 = \boxed{72}$. The answer is $\boxed{72}$
