**Problem:** 
"The function $f(n)$ is defined on the positive integers such that $f(f(n)) = 2n$ and $f(4n + 1) = 4n + 3$ for all positive integers $n.$  Find $f(1000).$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Consider the expression $f(f(f(a))).$  Since $f(f(a)) = 2a,$ this is equal to $f(2a).$  But taking $n = f(a)$ in $f(f(n)) = 2n,$ we get
\[f(f(f(a))) = 2f(a).\]Hence,
\[f(2a) = 2f(a)\]for all positive integers $a.$

Then
\[f(1000) = 2f(500) = 4f(250) = 8f(125).\]Taking $n = 31$ in $f(4n + 1) = 4n + 3,$ we get
\[f(125) = 127,\]so $f(1000) = \boxed{1016}.$ The answer is $\boxed{1016}$

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



To find $f(100)$, we first need to find a general formula for $f(n)$.

From the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we can see that applying the function $f$ three times gives $8n-7$. This suggests that $f$ might be a function that increases its argument by some value and then applies some other operation.

From the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can see that if we double the argument, the function value also doubles and then increases by 1. This suggests that the function might be linear with respect to its argument and then increases by 1 when doubled.

Let's try to find a function of the form $f(n) = kn + m$ that satisfies both conditions.

First, we substitute $f(n) = kn + m$ into the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$:
\[k(2n) + m = 2(kn + m) + 1 \implies 2kn + m = 2kn + 2m + 1.\]This simplifies to $m = 1$.

Now, we substitute $f(n) = kn + 1$ into the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$:
\[k(k(k n + 1) + 1) + 1 = 8n - 7.\]This simplifies to $k^3 n + k^2 + k + 1 = 8n - 7$. Equating the coefficients of $n$ gives $k^3 = 8$, so $k = 2$.

Thus, the function $f(n) = 2n + 1$ satisfies both conditions. Now we can find $f(100)$:
\[f(100) = 2 \cdot 100 + 1 = 201.\]So, $f(100) = 201$.

The answer is $\boxed{201}$.

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


To find $f(100)$, we can start by applying the second condition of the function $f$. We have $f(2 \cdot 50) = 2f(50) + 1$. So, we need to find $f(50)$ first.

Using the second condition again, we have $f(2 \cdot 25) = 2f(25) + 1$. To find $f(25)$, we need to find $f(12.5)$. But $12.5$ is not a natural number, so we cannot directly apply the given conditions.

However, we can use the first condition $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. Let's try $n = 125$. Then $f(f(f(125))) = 8 \cdot 125 - 7 = 1000 - 7 = 993$.

Now, we need to find $f(f(125))$. From the first condition, we have $f(f(125)) = \frac{993}{f(125)}$.

And from the second condition, we have $f(2 \cdot 62.5) = 2f(62.5) + 1$. So, $f(125) = 2f(62.5) + 1$.

Let's denote $f(62.5)$ as $x$. Then $f(125) = 2x + 1$. Substituting this into the equation $f(f(125)) = \frac{993}{f(125)}$, we get $f(f(125)) = \frac{993}{2x + 1}$.

We know that $f(f(125)) = f(62.5) = x$. So, we have $x = \frac{993}{2x + 1}$. Multiplying both sides by $2x + 1$, we get $x(2x + 1) = 993$.

Expanding and rearranging the equation, we get $2x^2 + x - 993 = 0$. This is a quadratic equation, and we can solve it using the quadratic formula $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$. Here, $a = 2$, $b = 1$, and $c = -993$.

We only need the positive solution, so we have $x = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{1 + 4 \cdot 2 \cdot 993}}{4} = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{7945}}{4}$.

Now, we can find $f(50)$ and $f(100)$.

From the second condition, $f(2 \cdot 25) = 2f(25) + 1$, we have $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.

And from the second condition, $f(2 \cdot 50) = 2f(50) + 1$, we have $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.

We can substitute the values of $f(62.5)$ and $f(125)$ into these equations to find $f(50)$ and $f(100)$.

After calculating, we get $f(100) = 199$.

So, the value of $f(100)$ is 199. The answer is: $199$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"We define a function $f(x)$ such that $f(14)=7$, and if there exists an integer $a$ such that $f(a)=b$, then $f(b)$ is defined and

$f(b)=3b+1$ if $b$ is odd

$f(b)=\frac{b}{2}$ if $b$ is even.

What is the smallest possible number of integers in the domain of $f$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Since $f(14)=7$, we know that $f(7)$ is defined, and it must equal $22$.  Similarly, we know that $f(22)$ is defined, and it must equal $11$.  Continuing on this way,  \begin{align*}
f(11)&=34\\
f(34)&=17\\
f(17)&=52\\
f(52)&=26\\
f(26)&=13\\
f(13)&=40\\
f(40)&=20\\
f(20)&=10\\
f(10)&=5\\
f(5)&=16\\
f(16)&=8\\
f(8)&=4\\
f(4)&=2\\
f(2)&=1\\
f(1)&=4
\end{align*}We are now in a cycle $1$, $4$, $2$, $1$, and so on.  Thus there are no more values which need to be defined, as there is no $a$ currently defined for which $f(a)$ is a $b$ not already defined.  Thus the minimum number of integers we can define is the number we have already defined, which is $\boxed{18}$. The answer is $\boxed{18}$

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we can start by calculating $f(1)$ using the second condition $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. Setting $n = 1$, we get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. But we also know that $f(f(f(1))) = 8(1) - 7 = -1$. Since $f(f(f(1))) = f(f(2))$, we have $f(f(2)) = -1$. Using the second condition again, we get $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$. Substituting $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$, we get $f(4) = 2(2f(1) + 1) + 1 = 4f(1) + 3$. But we also know that $f(f(f(2))) = 8(2) - 7 = 9$. Since $f(f(f(2))) = f(f(4))$, we have $f(f(4)) = 9$. Using the second condition again, we get $f(8) = 2f(4) + 1$. Substituting $f(4) = 4f(1) + 3$, we get $f(8) = 2(4f(1) + 3) + 1 = 8f(1) + 7$. But we also know that $f(f(f(4))) = 8(4) - 7 = 25$. Since $f(f(f(4))) = f(f(8))$, we have $f(f(8)) = 25$. Using the second condition again, we get $f(16) = 2f(8) + 1$. Substituting $f(8) = 8f(1) + 7$, we get $f(16) = 2(8f(1) + 7) + 1 = 16f(1) + 15$. But we also know that $f(f(f(8))) = 8(8) - 7 = 57$. Since $f(f(f(8))) = f(f(16))$, we have $f(f(16)) = 57$. Using the second condition again, we get $f(32) = 2f(16) + 1$. Substituting $f(16) = 16f(1) + 15$, we get $f(32) = 2(16f(1) + 15) + 1 = 32f(1) + 31$. But we also know that $f(f(f(16))) = 8(16) - 7 = 115$. Since $f(f(f(16))) = f(f(32))$, we have $f(f(32)) = 115$. Using the second condition again, we get $f(64) = 2f(32) + 1$. Substituting $f(32) = 32f(1) + 31$, we get $f(64) = 2(32f(1) + 31) + 1 = 64f(1) + 63$. But we also know that $f(f(f(32))) = 8(32) - 7 = 241$. Since $f(f(f(32))) = f(f(64))$, we have $f(f(64)) = 241$. Using the second condition again, we get $f(128) = 2f(64) + 1$. Substituting $f(64) = 64f(1) + 63$, we get $f(128) = 2(64f(1) + 63) + 1 = 128f(1) + 127$. But we also know that $f(f(f(64))) = 8(64) - 7 = 505$. Since $f(f(f(64))) = f(f(128))$, we have $f(f(128)) = 505$. Using the second condition again, we get $f(256) = 2f(128) + 1$. Substituting $f(128) = 128f(1) + 127$, we get $f(256) = 2(128f(1) + 127) + 1 = 256f(1) + 255$. But we also know that $f(f(f(128))) = 8(128) - 7 = 1001$. Since $f(f(f(128))) = f(f(256))$, we have $f(f(256)) = 1001$. Using the second condition again, we get $f(512) = 2f(256) + 1$. Substituting $f(256) = 256f(1) + 255$, we get $f(512) = 2(256f(1) + 255) + 1 = 512f(1) + 511$. But we also know that $f(f(f(256))) = 8(256) - 7 = 2009$. Since $f(f(f(256))) = f(f(512))$, we have $f(f(512)) = 2009$. Using the second condition again, we get $f(1024) = 2f(512) + 1$. Substituting $f(512) = 512f(1) + 511$, we get $f(1024) = 2(512f(1) + 511) + 1 = 1024f(1) + 1023$. But we also know that $f(f(f(512))) = 8(512) - 7 = 4017$. Since $f(f(f(512))) = f(f(1024))$, we have $f(f(1024)) = 4017$. Using the second condition again, we get $f(2048) = 2f(1024) + 1$. Substituting $f(1024) = 1024f(1) + 1023$, we get $f(2048) = 2(1024f(1) + 1023) + 1 = 2048f(1) + 2047$. But we also know that $f(f(f(1024))) = 8(1024) - 7 = 8035$. Since $f(f(f(1024))) = f(f(2048))$, we have $f(f(2048)) = 8035$. Using the second condition again, we get $f(4096) = 2f(2048) + 1$. Substituting $f(2048) = 2048f(1) + 2047$, we get $f(4096) = 2(2048f(1) + 2047) + 1 = 4096f(1) + 4095$. But we also know that $f(f(

**Solution:**



To solve this problem, we need to find the value of $f(100)$ using the given conditions. Let's start by applying the second condition to the first condition:
\[f(f(f(n)))=8n-7 \implies f(f(2f(n)+1))=8n-7.\]
Now, let's substitute $2f(n)+1$ into the second condition:
\[f(2(2f(n)+1)+1)=8n-7 \implies f(4f(n)+3)=8n-7.\]
Now, let's substitute $4f(n)+3$ into the second condition again:
\[f(2(4f(n)+3)+1)=8n-7 \implies f(8f(n)+7)=8n-7.\]
Now, let's try to find a pattern. If we continue this process, we will find that:
\[f(2^k f(n) + (2^k - 1)) = 8n - 7.\]
Now, let's try to find $f(100)$. We can write $100$ as $2^2 \cdot 25 + (2^2 - 1) = 4 \cdot 25 + 3$. So, we have:
\[f(100) = f(4 \cdot 25 + 3) = 8 \cdot 25 - 7 = 200 - 7 = 193.\]
So, $f(100) = 193$. The answer is: $193$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, and we are asked to find $f(100)$. So, let's set $n=50$ in the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we get $f(100)=2f(50)+1$.

2. Now we need to find $f(50)$. We can use the first condition again, set $n=25$, we get $f(f(f(25)))=8*25-7=193$, and since $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we have $f(f(25))=193$.

3. Again use the second condition, set $n=25$, we get $f(50)=2f(25)+1$. But we don't know $f(25)$ yet, so we need to find it first.

4. Set $n=12.5$ (note that $12.5$ is not a positive integer, but we can use the function to find $f(25)$), we get $f(f(f(12.5)))=8*12.5-7=93$, and since $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we have $f(f(12.5))=93$.

5. Again use the second condition, set $n=12.5$, we get $f(25)=2f(12.5)+1$. But we don't know $f(12.5)$ yet, so we need to find it first.

6. Set $n=6.25$, we get $f(f(f(6.25)))=8*6.25-7=41$, and since $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we have $f(f(6.25))=41$.

7. Again use the second condition, set $n=6.25$, we get $f(12.5)=2f(6.25)+1=2*41+1=83$.

8. Now we can find $f(25)=2f(12.5)+1=2*83+1=167$.

9. Finally, we can find $f(50)=2f(25)+1=2*167+1=335$.

10. Now we can find $f(100)=2f(50)+1=2*335+1=671$.

So, $f(100)=671$. The answer is: $671$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $
f(n) =
\begin{cases}
n^2+1 & \text{if }n\text{ is odd} \\
\dfrac{n}{2} & \text{if }n\text{ is even}
\end{cases}.
$

For how many integers $n$ from 1 to 100, inclusive, does $f ( f (\dotsb f (n) \dotsb )) = 1$ for some number of applications of $f$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we note that if $n$ is a positive integer, then $f(n)$ is also a positive integer.  We claim that $f ( f (\dotsb f (n) \dotsb )) = 1$ for some number of applications of $f$ only for $n = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32,$ and $64.$  (In other words, $n$ must be a power of 2.)

Note that $f(1) = 2,$ so $f(f(1)) = f(2) = 1.$  If $n > 1$ is a power of 2, it is easy to see that repeated applications of $f$ on $n$ eventually reach 1.

Suppose $n$ is an odd positive integer, where $n > 1.$  Write $n = 2k + 1,$ where $k$ is a positive integer.  Since $n$ is odd,
\[f(n) = n^2 + 1 = (2k + 1)^2 + 1 = 4k^2 + 4k + 2 = 2(2k^2 + 2k + 1).\]Since $2k^2 + 2k$ is always even, $2k^2 + 2k + 1$ is always odd (and greater than 1), so $f(n)$ can never be a power of 2 when $n$ is odd and greater than 1.

Now, suppose $n$ is even.  For example, if $n = 2^3 \cdot 11,$ then
\[f(2^3 \cdot 11) = f(2^2 \cdot 11) = f(2 \cdot 11) = f(11),\]which we know is not a power of 2.

More generally, suppose $n = 2^e \cdot m,$ where $e$ is nonnegative and $m$ is odd.  Then
\[f(2^e \cdot m) = f(2^{e - 1} \cdot m) = f(2^{e - 2} \cdot m) = \dots = f(m).\]If $m = 1,$ then $n$ is a power of 2, and the sequence eventually reaches 1.  Otherwise, $f(m)$ is not a power of 2.  We also know that $f(m)$ is odd and greater than 1, $f(f(m))$ is not a power of 2 either, and so on.  Thus, the sequence can never reach 1.

Therefore, $n$ must be one of the $\boxed{7}$ values 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, or 64. The answer is $\boxed{7}$

**Solution:** 


First, we can see that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Let's use these two equations to find $f(100)$.

We know that $f(f(f(100)))=8*100-7=793$. Now we need to find $f(f(100))$ such that $f(f(100))$ is the input of $f$ in the equation $f(f(f(100)))=793$.

From the second equation, we know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, so we can let $n=f(100)$ and get $f(2f(100))=2f(f(100))+1$. Let $2f(100)=x$, then we have $f(x)=2f(f(100))+1$.

Now we know that $f(f(f(100)))=793$, so $f(x)=793$. From the equation $f(x)=2f(f(100))+1$, we can solve for $f(f(100))$:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

def solve_f():
    f_100, x = symbols('f_100 x')
    equation = Eq(2 * f_100 + 1, 793)
    solution = solve(equation, f_100)
    return solution[0]

f_100 = solve_f()
print(f_100)
```

INTERMEDIATE OUT :

```
So $f(f(100))=396$. Now we need to find $f(100)$ such that $f(100)$ is the input of $f$ in the equation $f(f(100))=396$.

Again, from the second equation, we know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, so we can let $n=100$ and get $f(2*100)=2f(100)+1$. Let $2*100=200$, then we have $f(200)=2f(100)+1$.

Now we know that $f(f(100))=396$, so $f(200)=396$. From the equation $f(200)=2f(100)+1$, we can solve for $f(100)$:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def solve_f_100():
    f_100 = symbols('f_100')
    equation = Eq(2 * f_100 + 1, 396)
    solution = solve(equation, f_100)
    return solution[0]

f_100 = solve_f_100()
print(f_100)
``````output

CODE RESULTS 395/2

INTERMEDIATE OUT :

395/2
```
But the value of $f(100)$ should be an integer, so we must have made a mistake in our calculations. Let's go back and check our work.

We know that $f(f(f(100)))=793$, so $f(x)=793$. From the equation $f(x)=2f(f(100))+1$, we can solve for $f(f(100))$:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def solve_f_f_100():
    f_f_100, x = symbols('f_f_100 x')
    equation = Eq(2 * f_f_100 + 1, 793)
    solution = solve(equation, f_f_100)
    return solution[0]

f_f_100 = solve_f_f_100()
print(f_f_100)
``````output

CODE RESULTS 396

INTERMEDIATE OUT :

```
So $f(f(100))=396$. Now we need to find $f(100)$ such that $f(100)$ is the input of $f$ in the equation $f(2f(100))=793$.

From the second equation, we know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, so we can let $n=100$ and get $f(2*100)=2f(100)+1$. Let $2*100=200$, then we have $f(200)=2f(100)+1$.

Now we know that $f(2f(100))=793$, so $f(200)=793$. From the equation $f(200)=2f(100)+1$, we can solve for $f(100)$:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def solve_f_100_again():
    f_100 = symbols('f_100')
    equation = Eq(2 * f_100 + 1, 793)

So $f(100)=396$. Therefore, the value of $f(100)$ is 396.
The answer is: $396$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:


To solve this problem, we need to find the value of $f(100)$ based on the given conditions. We can start by plugging in $n = 100$ into the second equation: $f(2 \cdot 100) = 2f(100) + 1$. This simplifies to $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$.

Now, we can use the first equation with $n = 100$: $f(f(f(100))) = 8 \cdot 100 - 7 = 793$.

Let's denote $f(100)$ as $x$, so we have $f(f(f(100))) = f(f(x)) = f(x)$.

From $f(f(x)) = 793$, we can substitute $f(x)$ from the second equation: $f(2x + 1) = 793$.

However, we don't have enough information to directly find the value of $f(100)$ or $x$. But we can try to find a pattern by plugging in some values and see if we can find a pattern.

Let's start with $n = 1$: $f(f(f(1))) = f(f(1)) = f(1)$. From $f(f(f(1))) = 8 \cdot 1 - 7 = 1$, we get $f(1) = 1$.

Now, we can use the second equation to find $f(2)$: $f(2 \cdot 1) = 2f(1) + 1 \implies f(2) = 2 \cdot 1 + 1 = 3$.

Then, $f(f(f(2))) = f(f(3)) = f(3)$. From $f(f(f(2))) = 8 \cdot 2 - 7 = 9$, we get $f(3) = 3$.

Now, we can use the second equation to find $f(4)$: $f(2 \cdot 2) = 2f(2) + 1 \implies f(4) = 2 \cdot 3 + 1 = 7$.

Then, $f(f(f(4))) = f(f(7)) = f(7)$. From $f(f(f(4))) = 8 \cdot 4 - 7 = 29$, we get $f(7) = 7$.

Continuing this process, we can find that $f(15) = 15$, $f(31) = 31$, $f(63) = 63$, and so on. We can see that $f(2^k - 1) = 2^k - 1$ for $k \geq 1$.

Now, let's go back to the equation $f(2x + 1) = 793$. Since $f(2^k - 1) = 2^k - 1$, we can try to find a value of $k$ such that $2^k - 1$ is close to $793$. We find that $k = 9$ gives $2^9 - 1 = 511$, which is close to $793$.

So, we can try $x = 2^8 - 1 = 255$. Plugging this into $f(2x + 1) = 793$, we get $f(2 \cdot 255 + 1) = 793 \implies f(511) = 793$.

Now, we can use the second equation to find $f(512)$: $f(2 \cdot 256) = 2f(256) + 1$. Since $f(511) = 793$, we know that $f(256) = \frac{793 - 1}{2} = 396$.

Then, $f(2 \cdot 256) = 2 \cdot 396 + 1 = 793$.

So, $f(100) = f(256) = 396$. The value of $f(100)$ is 396.

The answer is: $396$

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, we can see that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. If we plug in $n=1$, we get $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$, which means $f(f(1))=1$.
2. Then we use the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. If we plug in $n=1$, we get $f(2)=2f(1)+1$. Since $f(f(1))=1$, we have $f(2)=2*1+1=3$.
3. Now we can use the second condition again to find $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2*3+1=7$.
4. Then we use the first condition to find $f(f(f(4)))=8*4-7=27$. Since $f(f(4))=27$, we have $f(27)=8*4-7=27$.
5. Now we can use the second condition to find $f(54)=2f(27)+1=2*27+1=55$.
6. Then we use the first condition to find $f(f(f(54)))=8*54-7=427$. Since $f(f(54))=427$, we have $f(427)=8*54-7=427$.
7. Now we can use the second condition to find $f(854)=2f(427)+1=2*427+1=855$.
8. Then we use the first condition to find $f(f(f(854)))=8*854-7=6827$. Since $f(f(854))=6827$, we have $f(6827)=8*854-7=6827$.
9. Now we can use the second condition to find $f(13654)=2f(6827)+1=2*6827+1=13655$.
10. Then we use the first condition to find $f(f(f(13654)))=8*13654-7=109227$. Since $f(f(13654))=109227$, we have $f(109227)=8*13654-7=109227$.
11. Now we can use the second condition to find $f(218454)=2f(109227)+1=2*109227+1=218455$.
12. Then we use the first condition to find $f(f(f(218454)))=8*218454-7=1747627$. Since $f(f(218454))=1747627$, we have $f(1747627)=8*218454-7=1747627$.
13. Now we can use the second condition to find $f(3495254)=2f(1747627)+1=2*1747627+1=3495255$.
14. Then we use the first condition to find $f(f(f(3495254)))=8*3495254-7=27962027$. Since $f(f(3495254))=27962027$, we have $f(27962027)=8*3495254-7=27962027$.
15. Now we can use the second condition to find $f(55924054)=2f(27962027)+1=2*27962027+1=55924055$.

We can see that the value of $f(n)$ is oscillating between $n$ and $2n+1$. It seems that the value of $f(n)$ is always one less than the next multiple of 3. So we can conjecture that $f(n)=3n-1$.

Now let's check if this conjecture holds for $n=100$:

$f(100)=3*100-1=299$.

So, the value of $f(100)$ is 299. However, this contradicts our previous results. The value of $f(100)$ should be 1 according to our previous steps. 

Let's go back and check our steps again. We made a mistake in step 11. The correct step should be:

11. Now we can use the second condition to find $f(218454)=2f(109227)-1=2*109227-1=218453$.

Now let's redo the steps with this correction:

11. Now we can use the second condition to find $f(218454)=2f(109227)-1=2*109227-1=218453$.
12. Then we use the first condition to find $f(f(f(218454)))=8*218454-7=1747627$. Since $f(f(218454))=1747627$, we have $f(1747627)=8*218454-7=1747627$.
13. Now we can use the second condition to find $f(3495254)=2f(1747627)-1=2*1747627-1=3495253$.
14. Then we use the first condition to find $f(f(f(3495254)))=8*3495254-7=27962027$. Since $f(f(3495254))=27962027$, we have $f(27962027)=8*3495254-7=27962027$.
15. Now we can use the second condition to find $f(55924054)=2f(27962027)-1=2*27962027-1=55924053$.

We can see that the value of $f(n)$ is oscillating between $2n-1$ and $2n+1$. It seems that the value of $f(n)$ is always one less than the next multiple of 3 when $n$ is odd, and one more than the next multiple of 3 when $n$ is even. So we can conjecture that $f(n)=3n-1$ when $n$ is odd, and $f(n)=3n+1$ when $n$ is even.

Now let's check if this conjecture holds for $n=100$:

Since 100 is even, we use the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$:

$f(100)=2f(50)+1=2(3*50+1)+1=301$.

So, the value of $f(100)$ is 301. This matches our

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"The function $f$ is defined on the set of integers and satisfies \[f(n)= \begin{cases}  n-3 & \mbox{if }n\ge 1000 \\  f(f(n+5)) & \mbox{if }n<1000. \end{cases}\]Find $f(84)$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Denote by (1) and (2) the two parts of the definition of $f$, respectively. If we begin to use the definition of $f$ to compute $f(84)$, we use (2) until the argument is at least $1000$: \[f(84) = f(f(89)) = f(f(f(94))) = \dots = f^N(1004)\](where $f^N$ denotes composing $f$ with itself $N$ times, for some $N$). The numbers $84, 89, 94, \dots, 1004$ form an arithmetic sequence with common difference $5$; since $1004 - 84 = 920 = 184 \cdot 5$, this sequence has $184 + 1 = 185$ terms, so $N = 185$.

At this point, (1) and (2) are both used: we compute \[\begin{aligned} f^N(1004) &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-1}(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-1}(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(1000) \\ &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(997) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1002) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(999) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1004). \end{aligned}\]Repeating this process, we see that \[f^N(1004) = f^{N-2}(1004) = f^{N-4}(1004) = \dots = f^3(1004).\](The pattern breaks down for $f^k(1004)$ when $k$ is small, so it is not true that $f^3(1004) = f(1004)$.) Now, we have \[f^3(1004) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^2(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^2(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(1000) \stackrel{(1)}{=} \boxed{997}.\] The answer is $\boxed{997}$

To solve this problem, we can substitute $n=50$ into the second equation to get $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$. Then, we can substitute $n=25$ into the second equation to get $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$. Continuing this process, we can keep substituting smaller values of $n$ until we reach a value that we can find directly from the first equation.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"We define a function $f(x)$ such that $f(14)=7$, and if there exists an integer $a$ such that $f(a)=b$, then $f(b)$ is defined and

$f(b)=\frac{b}{2}$ if $b$ is even.

What is the smallest possible number of integers in the domain of $f$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Since $f(14)=7$, we know that $f(7)$ is defined, and it must equal $22$.  Similarly, we know that $f(22)$ is defined, and it must equal $11$.  Continuing on this way,  \begin{align*}
f(11)&=34\\

Thus there are no more values which need to be defined, as there is no $a$ currently defined for which $f(a)$ is a $b$ not already defined.  Thus the minimum number of integers we can define is the number we have already defined, which is $\boxed{18}$. The answer is $\boxed{18}$

**Problem**
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


We can solve this problem by using the second condition $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ and the first condition $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$.

First, we can find $f(1)$ by setting $n = 1$ in the second condition:
\[f(2) = 2f(1) + 1.\]
Since $f(2)$ is also equal to $f(f(1))$, we can substitute $f(f(1))$ into the first condition:
\[f(f(1)) = 8 \cdot 1 - 7 = 1.\]
So we have $2f(1) + 1 = 1$, which gives us $f(1) = 0$.

Now we can find $f(2)$ by substituting $n = 1$ into the second condition:
\[f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2 \cdot 0 + 1 = 1.\]

Next, we can find $f(3)$ by substituting $n = 2$ into the second condition:
\[f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2 \cdot 1 + 1 = 3.\]

Continuing this process, we can find $f(4)$, $f(5)$, $f(6)$, and so on. However, this method becomes tedious and time-consuming. Instead, we can use the fact that the function $f$ is defined for all positive integers $n$. This means that we can try to find a pattern in the values of $f(n)$ as we calculate them.

After calculating several values, we notice that $f(n) = 2n - 1$ for all positive integers $n$. We can check that this function satisfies both conditions:

For the first condition, $f(f(f(n))) = f(f(2n - 1)) = f(2(2n - 1) - 1) = f(4n - 3) = 8n - 7$.

For the second condition, $f(2n) = 2(2n - 1) + 1 = 4n - 1$.

So, $f(n) = 2n - 1$ is indeed a solution to the problem. Now we can find $f(100)$ by substituting $n = 100$ into the function:
\[f(100) = 2 \cdot 100 - 1 = 199.\]
The answer is: $199$

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, let's set $n = 1$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. We get $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7$, or $f(f(f(1)))=1$.
2. This implies that $f(1)$ is the value that when fed into the function three times gives 1. The only positive integer value that satisfies this is 1, because $f(f(f(1)))=f(f(1))=f(1)=1$.
3. Now, let's use the second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. If we plug in $n=1$, we get $f(2)=2f(1)+1$, or $f(2)=2*1+1$, or $f(2)=3$.
4. Now, let's plug in $n=2$ into the second equation to find $f(4)$. We get $f(4)=2f(2)+1$, or $f(4)=2*3+1$, or $f(4)=7$.
5. Now, let's plug in $n=4$ into the second equation to find $f(8)$. We get $f(8)=2f(4)+1$, or $f(8)=2*7+1$, or $f(8)=15$.
6. Now, let's plug in $n=8$ into the second equation to find $f(16)$. We get $f(16)=2f(8)+1$, or $f(16)=2*15+1$, or $f(16)=31$.
7. We can see a pattern here: $f(2^k) = 2^k - 1 + 2^{k-1} - 1 + 2^{k-2} - 1 + ... + 2^0 - 1 = 2^k - 1$.
8. Now, let's find $f(100)$. Since $100 = 2^2 * 5^2$, we can write $100 = 2^2 * 5^2 = 2^2 * (2*5)^2 = 2^2 * 10^2$.
9. Using the pattern we found, we can say that $f(100) = f(2^2 * 10^2) = 2^2 - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3$.

However, this doesn't seem to be correct, because when we plug $f(100) = 3$ into the first equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we get $f(f(f(100)))=8*100-7$, or $f(f(3))=793$, but $f(3)$ cannot be 3 because $f(f(f(1)))=1$ and $f(1)=1$.

Let's try another approach. Since $f(f(f(1)))=1$, we know that $f(1)=1$. Now, let's plug in $n=1$ into the second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We get $f(2)=2f(1)+1$, or $f(2)=2*1+1$, or $f(2)=3$.

Now, let's plug in $n=2$ into the second equation to find $f(4)$. We get $f(4)=2f(2)+1$, or $f(4)=2*3+1$, or $f(4)=7$.

Now, let's plug in $n=4$ into the second equation to find $f(8)$. We get $f(8)=2f(4)+1$, or $f(8)=2*7+1$, or $f(8)=15$.

Now, let's plug in $n=8$ into the second equation to find $f(16)$. We get $f(16)=2f(8)+1$, or $f(16)=2*15+1$, or $f(16)=31$.

Again, we can see a pattern here: $f(2^k) = 2^k - 1 + 2^{k-1} - 1 + 2^{k-2} - 1 + ... + 2^0 - 1 = 2^k - 1$.

Now, let's find $f(100)$. Since $100 = 2^2 * 5^2$, we can write $100 = 2^2 * 5^2 = 2^2 * (2*5)^2 = 2^2 * 10^2$.

Using the pattern we found, we can say that $f(100) = f(2^2 * 10^2) = 2^2 - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3$.

Let's plug $f(100) = 3$ into the first equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. We get $f(f(f(100)))=8*100-7$, or $f(f(3))=793$.

Now, let's plug in $n=3$ into the second equation to find $f(6)$. We get $f(6)=2f(3)+1$, or $f(6)=2*3+1$, or $f(6)=7$.

Now, let's plug in $n=7$ into the second equation to find $f(14)$. We get $f(14)=2f(7)+1$, or $f(14)=2*7+1$, or $f(14)=15$.

Now, let's plug in $n=15$ into the second equation to find $f(30)$. We get $f(30)=2f(15)+1$, or $f(30)=2*15+1$, or $f(30)=31$.

Now, let's plug in $n=31$ into the second equation to find $f(62)$. We get $f(62)=2f(31)+1$, or $f(62)=2*31+1$, or $f(62)=63$.

Now, let's plug in $n=63$ into the second equation to find $f(126)$. We get $f(126)=2f(63)+1$, or $f(126)=2*63+1$, or $f(126)=127$.

Now, let's plug in $n=127$ into the second equation to find $f(254)$. We get $f(254)=2f(127)+1$, or $f(254)=2*127+1$, or $f(254)=255$.

Now, let's plug in $n=255$ into the second equation to find $f(508)$. We get $f(508)=2f(255)+1$, or $f(508)=2*255+1$, or $f(508)=511$.

Now, let's plug in $n=511$ into the second equation to find $f(1022)$. We get $f(1022)=2f(511)+1$, or $f(1022)=2*511+1$, or $f(1022)=1023$.

Now, let's plug in $n=1023$ into the second equation to

## QUESTION 4 - 13

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $f$ be a function taking the nonnegative integers to the positive integers such that $f(0) = f(1) = 1$ and
\[\frac{f(n) f(m + 1)}{f(m)} + \frac{f(n) f(n - m)}{f(n - m - 1)} = f(n + 1)\]for all nonnegative integers $n$ and $m,$ where $n \ge m + 1.$

Find the smallest nonnegative integer $n$ such that $f(n) > 10^6.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Setting $m = n - 1$ in the given functional equation, we get
\[\frac{f(n) \cdot f(n)}{f(n - 1)} + f(n) = f(n + 1),\]for all $n \ge 1.$  Then
\[\frac{f(n)}{f(n - 1)} + 1 = \frac{f(n + 1)}{f(n)}.\]Let $g(n) = \frac{f(n)}{f(n - 1)}$ for $n \ge 1.$  Then $g(1) = \frac{f(1)}{f(0)} = 1,$ and
\[g(n) + 1 = g(n + 1).\]Then $g(n) = n$ for all $n \ge 1.$  Hence,
\[g(n) g(n - 1) \dotsm g(2) g(1) = \frac{f(n)}{f(n - 1)} \cdot \frac{f(n - 1)}{f(n - 2)} \dotsm \frac{f(2)}{f(1)} \cdot \frac{f(1)}{f(0)},\]which simplifies to
\[n(n - 1) \dotsm (2)(1) = \frac{f(n)}{f(0)}.\]Therefore, $f(n) = n!$ for all $n \ge 1.$

Since $f(9) = 9! = 326880$ and $f(10) = 10! = 3628800,$ the smallest such $n$ is $\boxed{10}.$ The answer is $\boxed{10}$

**Solution:** 



To solve this problem, we will first find the value of $f(1)$ by setting $n = 1$ in the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. Then we will use the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to find the value of $f(n)$ for other values of $n$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

def calculate_f_100():
    # Define the symbol
    f_1 = symbols('f_1')

    # Set n = 1 in the equation f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7
    equation = Eq(f_1, 8*1 - 7)

    # Solve the equation to find the value of f(1)
    f_1_value = solve(equation, f_1)[0]

    # Initialize f(n) for n = 1
    f_n = {1: f_1_value}

    # Now we will find the value of f(n) for other values of n using the equation f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1
    for n in range(2, 101):
        # If n is even, use the equation f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1
        if n % 2 == 0:
            f_n[n] = 2 * f_n[n // 2] + 1
        # If n is odd, use the equation f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7
        else:
            f_n[n] = 8 * n - 7

    # Now we will find the value of f(100)
    f_100 = f_n[100]

    return f_100

result = calculate_f_100()
print(result)
