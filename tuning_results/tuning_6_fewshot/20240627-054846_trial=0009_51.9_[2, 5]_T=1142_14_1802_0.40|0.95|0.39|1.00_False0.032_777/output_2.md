**Problem:** 
"For certain ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ of real numbers, the system of equations
\[\begin{aligned} ax+by&=1 \\ x^2 + y^2 &= 50  \end{aligned}\]has at least one solution, and each solution is an ordered pair $(x,y)\,$ of integers. How many such ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ are there?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The graph of $ax+by=1$ is a line, while the graph of $x^2+y^2=50$ is a circle centered at the origin. Therefore, $(a, b)$ satisfies the conditions if and only if the line and circle intersect at least once, and they intersect only at lattice points (points with integer coordinates).

Knowing this, it makes sense to look for lattice points on the circle whose equation is $x^2+y^2=50$. Testing cases, we find that there are twelve lattice points on the circle: $(\pm 1, \pm 7)$, $(\pm 7, \pm 1)$, and $(\pm 5, \pm 5)$ (where the two $\pm$ signs in each pair are independent of each other).

There are $\tbinom{12}{2} = 66$ pairs of these points, and each pair determines a line. However, the graph of $ax+by=1$ can never pass through the origin $(0, 0)$, since if $x=y=0$, then $ax+by=0 \neq 1$. Therefore, the six pairs which consist of diametrically opposed points are invalid, since the line through them passes through the origin. This corrects our count to $66 - 6 = 60$.

In addition, for each of the twelve points, there is a line tangent to the circle at that point, so that the only solution to the system is that one point. This brings the final total to $60 + 12 = \boxed{72}$. The answer is $\boxed{72}$

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


To solve this problem, we need to analyze the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ and find for how many positive integers $m$ it has $4$ distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be rewritten as two separate cases:
1. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$
2. $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = \frac{m}{100}$

For each of these cases, we can further break them down into two sub-cases:

1.1. $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$
1.2. $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$
2.1. $-\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$
2.2. $-\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$

Each of these sub-cases gives us a different equation to solve. We need to find for how many positive integers $m$ each of these sub-cases has $2$ distinct solutions.

After solving each of these sub-cases and analyzing the number of distinct solutions, we find that the only sub-cases that give $2$ distinct solutions are:

1.2. $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ (for $1 \leq m \leq 200$)
2.1. $-\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ (for $1 \leq m \leq 200$)

So, for each of these sub-cases, we have $200$ possible values of $m$. Since each sub-case gives $2$ distinct solutions, and there are two sub-cases for each case of the original equation, the total number of distinct solutions for each value of $m$ is $4$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $200$.

The answer is: $200$

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions.

We can start by considering the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. This equation is equivalent to a pair of equations:

1. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, and
2. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.

For each of these equations, we can split the absolute value into two cases:

1.1. $x-1 -2 = \frac{m}{100}$,
1.2. $-(x-1) -2 = \frac{m}{100}$,
2.1. $x-1 -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$, and
2.2. $-(x-1) -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.

Solving these equations, we get the following four equations:

1.1. $x = 1 + 2 + \frac{m}{100} = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$,
1.2. $x = 1 + 2 - \frac{m}{100} = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$,
2.1. $x = 1 + 2 - \frac{m}{100} = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, and
2.2. $x = 1 + 2 + \frac{m}{100} = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.

From these equations, we can see that the solutions are $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$, and the two solutions are distinct if and only if $\frac{m}{100} \neq 0$. Therefore, the equation has four distinct solutions if and only if $m$ is a positive integer.

To find the number of such $m$, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. This is equivalent to finding the number of positive integers $m$ such that $0 < m < 200$. There are 199 such integers.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions is 199.

The answer is: $\boxed{199}$

**Solution:**


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $2$. This means $1<\frac{m}{100}<2$, which simplifies to $100<m<200$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from $101$ to $199$, inclusive. To find the number of these integers, we subtract the smallest integer from the largest and add $1$. So the number of positive integers $m$ is $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$. The answer is: $99$.

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $2$. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a graph that is a series of "steps" of height $1$ and width $1$, so for it to have $4$ distinct solutions, the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be strictly between $1$ and $2$.

So we have $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which simplifies to $100 < m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from $101$ to $199$, inclusive. To find the number of these integers, we subtract the smallest integer from the largest and add $1$:

```python

"How many solutions does the equation \[\frac{(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)\dotsm(x-100)}{(x-1^2)(x-2^2)(x-3^2)\dotsm(x-100^2)} = 0\]have for $x$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Any solution to this equation must make the numerator of the left-hand side zero, while keeping the denominator non-zero. The numerator is zero when $x$ is one of the numbers $1, 2, 3, \dots, 100.$ However, for any value in this list that is a perfect square, the denominator will also be zero, so that value of $x$ will not be a root. Therefore, we want to find the number of integers in the list $1, 2, \dots, 100$ which are not perfect squares. The perfect squares in the list are $1^2, 2^2, \dots, 10^2,$ so there are $10$ perfect squares, and \[100 - 10 = \boxed{90}\]integers which are not perfect squares. The answer is $\boxed{90}$

**Solution:** 



We can solve this problem by first analyzing the equation and the conditions given. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 1$. This is because the expression on the left-hand side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, can only take on the values from 0 to 2, and it takes on each of these values exactly twice as $x$ varies over the real numbers. Therefore, in order for the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, the right-hand side must be equal to 1. This gives us $m = 100$.

Therefore, the only positive integer value of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is $m = 100$.
The answer is $\boxed{100}$.

Assistant:

 The equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 1$. This is because the expression $| |x - 1| - 2 |$ can take on exactly 4 distinct values: $0, 1, 2,$ and $3$. If it equals $0$ or $3$, the equation has 2 solutions; if it equals $1$ or $2$, the equation has 4 solutions. Therefore, we must have $\frac{m}{100} = 1$, which gives $m = 100$.

So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 1. The answer is: $1$

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We know that the equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. This means that the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be equal to 2. 

2. If we set $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, we can solve for $m$ to get $m = 200$.

3. So, we need to check if the value of $m = 200$ makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions.

4. To do this, we substitute $m = 200$ into the equation and solve for $x$.

5. The equation becomes $| |x - 1| - 2 | = 2$.

6. We can solve this equation by considering two cases:

   a. If $|x - 1| - 2 \geq 0$, then the equation becomes $|x - 1| - 2 = 2$, which simplifies to $|x - 1| = 4$.

   b. If $|x - 1| - 2 < 0$, then the equation becomes $-(|x - 1| - 2) = 2$, which simplifies to $|x - 1| - 2 = -2$, and then $|x - 1| = 0$.

7. For case (a), $|x - 1| = 4$ gives us two solutions: $x - 1 = 4$ or $x - 1 = -4$. Solving these gives $x = 5$ or $x = -3$.

8. For case (b), $|x - 1| = 0$ gives us one solution: $x - 1 = 0$, which gives $x = 1$.

9. So, the four distinct solutions are $x = 5$, $x = -3$, $x = 1$.

10. Therefore, the value of $m = 200$ satisfies the condition that the equation has 4 distinct solutions.

The value of $m$ for which the equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 200. The answer is: $200$
