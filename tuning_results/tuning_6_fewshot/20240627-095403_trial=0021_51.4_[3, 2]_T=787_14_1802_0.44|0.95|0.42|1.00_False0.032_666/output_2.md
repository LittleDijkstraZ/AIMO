**Problem:** 
"How many distinct solutions are there to the equation $|x-7| = |x+1|$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
If $|x-7| = |x+1|$, then either $x-7 = x+1$ or $x-7 = -(x+1)$.  Simplifying $x-7=x+1$ gives $0=8$, which has no solutions, so no values of $x$ satisfy $x-7 = x+1$.  If $x-7 = -(x+1)$, then $x-7 = -x-1$, so $2x = 6$, which gives $x=3$.  So, there is $\boxed{1}$ solution.

Challenge: See if you can find a quick solution to this problem by simply thinking about the graphs of $y=|x-7|$ and $y=|x+1|$. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The equation $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 1 and 2. This is because the function $| |x-1| - 2 |$ has a graph with a "hump" shape, with the value of the function being 1 at the two points where the graph reaches its minimum, and 2 at the two points where it reaches its maximum. If $\frac{m}{100}$ is less than 1, the equation has no solutions. If $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to 1 or greater than 2, the equation has 2 or fewer solutions. If $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 1 and 2, the equation has 4 distinct solutions.

So we want to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Multiplying all sides of the inequalities by 100 gives $100 < m < 200$. The number of positive integers in this range is $200 - 100 - 1 = 99$.

    upper_bound = 200
    count = upper_bound - lower_bound - 1
    return count

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"For certain ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ of real numbers, the system of equations
\[\begin{aligned} ax+by&=1 \\ x^2 + y^2 &= 50  \end{aligned}\]has at least one solution, and each solution is an ordered pair $(x,y)\,$ of integers. How many such ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ are there?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The graph of $ax+by=1$ is a line, while the graph of $x^2+y^2=50$ is a circle centered at the origin. Therefore, $(a, b)$ satisfies the conditions if and only if the line and circle intersect at least once, and they intersect only at lattice points (points with integer coordinates).

Knowing this, it makes sense to look for lattice points on the circle whose equation is $x^2+y^2=50$. Testing cases, we find that there are twelve lattice points on the circle: $(\pm 1, \pm 7)$, $(\pm 7, \pm 1)$, and $(\pm 5, \pm 5)$ (where the two $\pm$ signs in each pair are independent of each other).

There are $\tbinom{12}{2} = 66$ pairs of these points, and each pair determines a line. However, the graph of $ax+by=1$ can never pass through the origin $(0, 0)$, since if $x=y=0$, then $ax+by=0 \neq 1$. Therefore, the six pairs which consist of diametrically opposed points are invalid, since the line through them passes through the origin. This corrects our count to $66 - 6 = 60$.

In addition, for each of the twelve points, there is a line tangent to the circle at that point, so that the only solution to the system is that one point. This brings the final total to $60 + 12 = \boxed{72}$. The answer is $\boxed{72}$

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


This problem is a challenging problem in mathematics that requires a deep understanding of absolute value functions and their graphs. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $3$. This is because the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, oscillates between $-3$ and $1$ as $x$ varies over the real numbers. Therefore, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $1<\frac{m}{100}<3$, or equivalently, $100<m<300$. The number of such integers is $300-100-1=199$.

```python

def count_m():
    """For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"""
    lower_bound = 100
    upper_bound = 300
    m_values = list(range(lower_bound + 1, upper_bound))
    return len(m_values)

result = count_m()

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many solutions does the equation \[\frac{(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)\dotsm(x-100)}{(x-1^2)(x-2^2)(x-3^2)\dotsm(x-100^2)} = 0\]have for $x$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Any solution to this equation must make the numerator of the left-hand side zero, while keeping the denominator non-zero. The numerator is zero when $x$ is one of the numbers $1, 2, 3, \dots, 100.$ However, for any value in this list that is a perfect square, the denominator will also be zero, so that value of $x$ will not be a root. Therefore, we want to find the number of integers in the list $1, 2, \dots, 100$ which are not perfect squares. The perfect squares in the list are $1^2, 2^2, \dots, 10^2,$ so there are $10$ perfect squares, and \[100 - 10 = \boxed{90}\]integers which are not perfect squares. The answer is $\boxed{90}$

The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $100$. However, we are asked for the number of such $m$ for which the equation has exactly $4$ distinct solutions. To achieve this, we need to exclude cases where the number of solutions is different from $4$.

After analyzing the problem, we can see that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have exactly $4$ distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100} = 1$. This is because the graph of the function $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ will have a shape of a "V" with a maximum height of $1$ from the x-axis. Therefore, the value of $m$ that satisfies this condition is $m = 100$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly $4$ distinct solutions is $1$. The answer is $\boxed{1}$.

Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
If $|x-7| = |x+1|$, then either $x-7 = x+1$ or $x-7 = -(x+1)$.  Simplifying $x-7=x+1$ gives $0=8$, which has no solutions, so no values of $x$ satisfy $x-7 = x+1$.  If $x-7 = -(x+1)$, then $x-7 = -x-1$, so $2x = 6$, which gives $x=3$.  So, there is $\boxed{1}$ solution.

Challenge: See if you can find a quick solution to this problem by simply thinking about the graphs of $y=|x-7|$ and $y=|x+1|$. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**



The problem asks for how many positive integers $m$ the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can have at most $4$ distinct solutions because the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, can take on four different values:

1. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$
2. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$
3. $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = \frac{m}{100}$
4. $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = -\frac{m}{100}$

Each of these equations can have zero, one, two, or four distinct solutions.

To find the value of $m$ that gives four distinct solutions, we can analyze the graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. The graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a "hump" with a maximum value of $2$ and a minimum value of $0$. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have four distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is between $0$ and $2$. Therefore, $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which gives $0 < m < 200$.

The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are $1, 2, ..., 199$. So, there are $199$ such integers.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $199$.

def count_positive_integers():
