**Problem:** 
"Let $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_ 2= (-16,2).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that
\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as
\[\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1.\]Find $h + k + a + b.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The expression equals zero if and only if both factors equal zero. So we have two sets of equations to solve: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

2. From $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, so $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.

3. From $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert x \vert = 8$, so $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.

4. Similarly, we get $y = 10 - x$ or $y = -10 - x$ from $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$, and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$ from $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.

5. Plot these equations in a coordinate plane, and we find that they form a square with side length 16.

6. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256.

    eq2 = Eq(Abs(x) - 8, 0)

    # Solve the equations
    solutions1 = solve(eq1, (x, y))
    solutions2 = solve(eq2, x)

    # Find the vertices of the polygon
    vertices = [tuple(sol) for sol in solutions1 if tuple(sol) not in [tuple(sol2) for sol in solutions2 for sol2 in solutions2]]

    # The polygon is a square with side length 16
    side_length = 16

    # Calculate the area
    area = side_length**2

**Problem:** 
"Let $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_ 2= (-16,2).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that
\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as

Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

**Solution:** 



To solve this problem, we first need to understand that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, we can break down the equation into two separate equations:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first equation, both terms must be zero:

$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$

This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only way this can be true is if $x + y = \pm10$ and $x - y = \pm10$. Solving these equations, we get the four lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

For the second equation, both terms must also be zero:

$(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The only way this can be true is if $x = \pm8$ and $y = \pm8$. Solving these equations, we get the four lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $\boxed{256}$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many square units are in the area of the triangle whose vertices are the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the curve $y = (x-3)^2 (x+2)$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we need to find where this curve intersects the $x$ and $y$ axes.  If $y=0$, then $(x-3)^2(x+2)=0$, which has solutions of $x=3$ and $x=-2$.  If $x=0$, then $y=(-3)^2(2)=18$.  So, the curve has two $x$-intercepts and one $y$-intercept.  The length of the base along the $x$-axis is $3-(-2)=5$.  The height from this base is equal to the $y$-intercept, 18.  The area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 5\cdot 18=\boxed{45}$. The answer is $\boxed{45}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


The problem statement asks for the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points that satisfy the given equation. The equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so it equals zero if either term equals zero. 

Let's analyze each term separately:
1. The first term is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. This term equals zero if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. 
2. The second term is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. This term equals zero if both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. 

From the first term, we have two systems of equations:
1. $x + y = \pm 10$
2. $x - y = \pm 10$

Solving these systems, we get the following four lines:
1. $y = -x + 10$
2. $y = -x - 10$
3. $y = x + 10$
4. $y = x - 10$

From the second term, we have two more systems of equations:
1. $x = \pm 8$
2. $y = \pm 8$

Solving these systems, we get the following four lines:
1. $x = 8$
2. $x = -8$
3. $y = 8$
4. $y = -8$

The eight lines divide the plane into 16 regions. The convex polygon is the intersection of these regions, which is a square with side length 16 units. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$ square units.

The answer is: $256$.
