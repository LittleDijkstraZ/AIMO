**Problem:** 
"Let $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_ 2= (-16,2).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that
\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as
\[\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1.\]Find $h + k + a + b.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


The given equation is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The only way for the sum of two squares to be zero is if each square is zero, so we have:
$\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$, $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$, and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.

From $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = \pm 10$.
From $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x - y = \pm 10$.
From $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$, which implies $x = \pm 8$.
From $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, we have $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $y = \pm 8$.

The solutions to these equations are:
$(x, y) = (8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$.
These points form a square with side length 16, so the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: 256

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either one of the terms must be zero. This gives us two sets of equations:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From the first set of equations, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square formed by the intersection of the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. The vertices are $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$.

From the second set of equations, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square formed by the intersection of the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. The vertices are $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The convex polygon formed by the union of these two squares is a 8x8 square. The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$. So the area of the convex polygon is 64. The answer is: 64

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we can break it down into steps:

1. First, we need to understand that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

2. Each of these equations has a solution in the form of four lines: $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

3. These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(8, 0)$, $(-8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, and $(0, -8)$.

4. To find the area of this rectangle, we simply multiply the length of one side by the length of the other side. The length of each side is 16, so the area is $16 \times 16 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Find the number of 10-tuples $(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{10})$ of real numbers such that
\[(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2 = \frac{1}{11}.\]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,
\begin{align*}
&[(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + \dots + 1^2 + 1^2)][(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2] \\
&\ge [(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + (x_2 - x_3) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10}]^2 = 1.
\end{align*}From the given condition, we have equality, so by the equality condition for Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[\frac{1 - x_1}{1} = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{1} = \frac{x_2 - x_3}{1} = \dots = \frac{x_9 - x_{10}}{1} = \frac{x_{10}}{1}.\]Let
\[d = 1 - x_1 = x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_3 = \dots = x_9 - x_{10} = x_{10}.\]Then
\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so
\[(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_{10}) = \left( \frac{10}{11}, \frac{9}{11}, \frac{8}{11}, \dots, \frac{1}{11} \right).\]In particular, there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



The area of the polygon is given by the sum of the areas of the two rectangles formed by the points satisfying the two equations separately.

The first equation is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. This is the equation of two lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.

The second equation is $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This is also the equation of two lines $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.

The third equation is $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$. This is the equation of two lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.

The fourth equation is $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert y \vert = 8$. This is the equation of two lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

The points satisfying the first equation form a rectangle with vertices at $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, and $(0, -10)$. The area of this rectangle is $20 \times 20 = 400$.

The points satisfying the second equation form a rectangle with vertices at $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, and $(-10, 0)$. The area of this rectangle is also $20 \times 20 = 400$.

The points satisfying the third equation form a rectangle with vertices at $(8, 0)$, $(-8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, and $(0, -8)$. The area of this rectangle is $16 \times 16 = 256$.

The points satisfying the fourth equation form a rectangle with vertices at $(0, 8)$, $(0, -8)$, $(8, 0)$, and $(-8, 0)$. The area of this rectangle is also $16 \times 16 = 256$.

Adding up the areas of the four rectangles, we get the total area of the polygon as $400 + 400 + 256 + 256 = 1312$.

However, this is not the correct answer. The problem is that we have counted the overlapping areas twice. The overlapping area is the square with vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(8, -8)$. The area of this square is $16 \times 16 = 256$.

Subtracting the overlapping area once from the sum of the areas of the four rectangles, we get the correct area of the polygon as $400 + 400 + 256 + 256 - 256 = 1312 - 256 = 1056$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $1056$. The answer is: $1056$

Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to $0$ if and only if at least one of the factors is $0$.

The factor $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ is $0$ if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These equations represent a square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$, centered at the origin.

The factor $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2$ is $0$ if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These equations represent a square with side length $16$, centered at the origin.

The intersection of these two squares is a smaller square with side length $10\sqrt{2} - 8\sqrt{2} = 2\sqrt{2}$, centered at the origin.

The area of a square with side length $s$ is $s^2$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $(2\sqrt{2})^2 = 8$.

The answer is: $8$

\[\frac{1 - x_1}{1} = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{1} = \frac{x_2 - x_3}{1} = \dots = \frac{x_9 - x_{10}}{1} = \frac{x_{10}}{1}.\]Let

\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, we can set each factor equal to zero and solve for the points that satisfy each equation.
For the first factor, we have $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
This gives us $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
For the second factor, we have $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This gives us $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
Now, let's solve these equations:
For $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, we have $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
For $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, we have $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
For $\vert x \vert = 8$, we have $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
For $\vert y \vert = 8$, we have $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.
By solving these equations, we find the points that satisfy the conditions:
$(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(2, 8)$, $(-2, 8)$, $(2, -8)$, and $(-2, -8)$.
These points form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So, the given equation is equivalent to the system of equations:

$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$$
$$((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$

2. Each of these equations is equivalent to the system of equations:

$$\vert x + y \vert = 10$$
$$\vert x - y \vert = 10$$

$$\vert x \vert = 8$$
$$\vert y \vert = 8$$

3. The solutions to the first system of equations are all points of the form $(x, -x \pm 10)$ and $(-x \pm 10, x)$, for $0 \le x \le 10$. The solutions to the second system of equations are all points of the form $(\pm 8, y)$ and $(x, \pm 8)$, for $0 \le y \le 8$.

4. The points that satisfy both systems of equations are the vertices of a square with side length 10.

5. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

The answer is: $100$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Find the number of 10-tuples $(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{10})$ of real numbers such that
\[(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2 = \frac{1}{11}.\]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,
\begin{align*}
&[(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + \dots + 1^2 + 1^2)][(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2] \\
&\ge [(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + (x_2 - x_3) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10}]^2 = 1.
\end{align*}From the given condition, we have equality, so by the equality condition for Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[\frac{1 - x_1}{1} = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{1} = \frac{x_2 - x_3}{1} = \dots = \frac{x_9 - x_{10}}{1} = \frac{x_{10}}{1}.\]Let
\[d = 1 - x_1 = x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_3 = \dots = x_9 - x_{10} = x_{10}.\]Then
\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so
\[(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_{10}) = \left( \frac{10}{11}, \frac{9}{11}, \frac{8}{11}, \dots, \frac{1}{11} \right).\]In particular, there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we first need to understand the properties of absolute value and how it interacts with square roots. The equation given is a product of two expressions, each of which must be zero for the product to be zero. Therefore, we need to solve each expression separately.

1. Solve $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$: This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
2. Solve $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$: This implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
3. Solve $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$: This implies $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
4. Solve $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$: This implies $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

Now we need to find the intersection points of these lines to determine the vertices of the polygon. There are 8 possible combinations of the equations above, which give us the vertices of the polygon. We can then calculate the area of the polygon by finding the lengths of its sides and using the formula for the area of a polygon with given vertices.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_ 2= (-16,2).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that
\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as
\[\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1.\]Find $h + k + a + b.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Find the number of 10-tuples $(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{10})$ of real numbers such that
\[(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2 = \frac{1}{11}.\]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

Let's think step by step:
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,
\begin{align*}

\end{align*}From the given condition, we have equality, so by the equality condition for Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[\frac{1 - x_1}{1} = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{1} = \frac{x_2 - x_3}{1} = \dots = \frac{x_9 - x_{10}}{1} = \frac{x_{10}}{1}.\]Let
\[d = 1 - x_1 = x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_3 = \dots = x_9 - x_{10} = x_{10}.\]Then
\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so
\[(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_{10}) = \left( \frac{10}{11}, \frac{9}{11}, \frac{8}{11}, \dots, \frac{1}{11} \right).\]In particular, there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$
