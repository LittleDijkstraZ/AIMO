**Problem:** 
"What is the minimum value of the expression $2x^2+3y^2+8x-24y+62$ for real $x$ and $y$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Rearranging the expression, we have  \[2x^2+8x+3y^2-24y+62\]We first complete the square in $x$. Factoring a 2 from the first two terms of the expression, we get  \[2(x^2+4x)+3y^2-24y+62\]In order for the expression inside the parenthesis to be a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(4/2)^2=4$ inside the parenthesis. Doing this, we have \[2(x^2+4x+4-4)+3y^2-24y+62 \Rightarrow 2(x+2)^2+3y^2-24y+54\]Now we complete the square in $y$. Factoring a 3 from the $y$ terms in the expression, we get \[2(x+2)^2+3(y^2-8y)+54\]In order for the expression inside the second parenthesis to be a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(8/2)^2=16$ inside the parenthesis. Doing this, we have \[2(x+2)^2+3(y^2-8y+16-16)+54 \Rightarrow 2(x+2)^2+3(y-4)^2+6\]Since the minimum value of $2(x+2)^2$ and $3(y-4)^2$ is $0$ (perfect squares can never be negative), the minimum value of the entire expression is $\boxed{6}$, and is achieved when $x=-2$ and $y=4$. The answer is $\boxed{6}$

**Problem**
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


This problem is a bit tricky to solve directly. However, we can make a substitution to simplify it. Let $u = x - 2y$ and $v = y - 2x$. Then we have $|u| + |v| = 40$. Now, we can express $x$ and $y$ in terms of $u$ and $v$:
\[x = \frac{u - v}{3}, \quad y = \frac{2u + v}{3}.\]
Substituting these into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$, we get:
\[5 \left(\frac{u - v}{3}\right)^2 + 5 \left(\frac{2u + v}{3}\right)^2 - 8 \left(\frac{u - v}{3}\right) \left(\frac{2u + v}{3}\right).\]
Simplifying this expression, we get:
\[ \frac{5}{9} (u^2 + v^2 - 2uv) + \frac{5}{9} (4u^2 + 4v^2 + 4uv) - \frac{16}{9} (u^2 - uv + v^2).\]
Simplifying further, we get:
\[ \frac{5}{9} (5u^2 + 5v^2 - 10uv) = \frac{25}{9} (u^2 + v^2 - 2uv).\]
Now, we know that $u^2 + v^2 - 2uv = (u - v)^2 \ge 0$, so the minimum value of the expression is $0$. However, we need to check if there are any values of $u$ and $v$ that satisfy $|u| + |v| = 40$ and make the expression equal to $0$.
If $u - v = 0$, then $u = v$. From $|u| + |v| = 40$, we have $|u| + |u| = 40$, so $2|u| = 40$ and $|u| = 20$. Thus, $u = 20$ and $v = 20$. Substituting these into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$, we get $0$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is $0$. The answer is: $0$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Find the minimum value of $2x^2 + 2y^2 + 5z^2 - 2xy - 4yz - 4x - 2z + 15$ over all real numbers $x,$ $y,$ $z.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
We can write the given expression as
\begin{align*}
&(x^2 - 4x + 4) + (x^2 - 2xy + y^2) + (y^2 - 4yz + 4z^2) + (z^2 - 2z + 1) + 10 \\
&= (x - 2)^2 + (x - y)^2 + (y - 2z)^2 + (z - 1)^2 + 10
\end{align*}The minimum value is then $\boxed{10},$ which occurs when $x = 2,$ $y = 2,$ and $z = 1.$ The answer is $\boxed{10}$

**Problem**
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


This problem requires us to analyze a function under a constraint. We can start by using the constraint to simplify the function.

The constraint is $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. By the triangle inequality, we know that $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$, so $|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |(x-2y) + (y-2x)| = |-x - y| = |-(x+y)| = |x+y|$. Therefore, we have $|x+y| = 40$.

Now, let's consider the function $f(x, y) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$. We can rewrite this as $f(x, y) = 5(x^2 - \frac{8}{5}xy + y^2) = 5[(x - \frac{4}{5}y)^2 - \frac{16}{25}y^2 + y^2] = 5[(x - \frac{4}{5}y)^2 + \frac{9}{25}y^2]$.

Since $(x - \frac{4}{5}y)^2 \geq 0$ and $\frac{9}{25}y^2 \geq 0$, we have $f(x, y) \geq 0$. Equality occurs when $x = \frac{4}{5}y$, which is consistent with the constraint $|x+y| = 40$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $f(x, y)$ under the given constraint is 0.
