**Problem:** 
"How many distinct solutions are there to the equation $|x-7| = |x+1|$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
If $|x-7| = |x+1|$, then either $x-7 = x+1$ or $x-7 = -(x+1)$.  Simplifying $x-7=x+1$ gives $0=8$, which has no solutions, so no values of $x$ satisfy $x-7 = x+1$.  If $x-7 = -(x+1)$, then $x-7 = -x-1$, so $2x = 6$, which gives $x=3$.  So, there is $\boxed{1}$ solution.

Challenge: See if you can find a quick solution to this problem by simply thinking about the graphs of $y=|x-7|$ and $y=|x+1|$. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Solution:** 



This problem is not computationally intensive, but it requires careful thought. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions, so $\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal to 2. This means $m = 200$. Therefore, the value of $m$ is 200.
The answer is: $200$

**Solution:** 


This problem requires us to solve the equation $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ for a certain value of $m$ such that it has exactly 4 distinct solutions. 

To do this, we can first plot the function $| |x-1| - 2 |$ and visually inspect where it equals $\frac{m}{100}$ for a certain value of $m$ to yield 4 distinct solutions. From the plot, we can estimate a value of $m$ that would give 4 distinct solutions. Then, we can use a loop to systematically try different values of $m$ until we find the one that gives 4 distinct solutions.

Let's start by plotting the function:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def absolute_value_function(x):
    return np.abs(np.abs(x - 1) - 2)

x_values = np.linspace(-10, 10, 1000)
y_values = absolute_value_function(x_values)

plt.plot(x_values, y_values)
plt.axhline(y=0.1, color='r', linestyle='--')
plt.show()
```
The red dashed line represents $\frac{m}{100}=0.1$. From the plot, it appears that the function $| |x-1| - 2 |$ equals 0.1 at four distinct points, indicating that $m=10$ might be a valid choice. Let's verify this by trying it in our equation:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Eq, Abs, solveset, S

def find_m():
    x = symbols('x')
    m = 10
    equation = Eq(Abs(Abs(x - 1) - 2), m / 100)
    solutions = solveset(equation, x, domain=S.Reals)
    return len(solutions)

number_of_solutions = find_m()
print(number_of_solutions)
```

CODE RESULTS 4

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
4
```
The number of distinct solutions for $m=10$ is indeed 4. Therefore, the value of $m$ that makes the equation $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ have 4 distinct solutions is $10$. The answer is: $10$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"For certain ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ of real numbers, the system of equations
\[\begin{aligned} ax+by&=1 \\ x^2 + y^2 &= 50  \end{aligned}\]has at least one solution, and each solution is an ordered pair $(x,y)\,$ of integers. How many such ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ are there?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The graph of $ax+by=1$ is a line, while the graph of $x^2+y^2=50$ is a circle centered at the origin. Therefore, $(a, b)$ satisfies the conditions if and only if the line and circle intersect at least once, and they intersect only at lattice points (points with integer coordinates).

Knowing this, it makes sense to look for lattice points on the circle whose equation is $x^2+y^2=50$. Testing cases, we find that there are twelve lattice points on the circle: $(\pm 1, \pm 7)$, $(\pm 7, \pm 1)$, and $(\pm 5, \pm 5)$ (where the two $\pm$ signs in each pair are independent of each other).

There are $\tbinom{12}{2} = 66$ pairs of these points, and each pair determines a line. However, the graph of $ax+by=1$ can never pass through the origin $(0, 0)$, since if $x=y=0$, then $ax+by=0 \neq 1$. Therefore, the six pairs which consist of diametrically opposed points are invalid, since the line through them passes through the origin. This corrects our count to $66 - 6 = 60$.

In addition, for each of the twelve points, there is a line tangent to the circle at that point, so that the only solution to the system is that one point. This brings the final total to $60 + 12 = \boxed{72}$. The answer is $\boxed{72}$

**Solution:** 


To solve the problem, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.
We can start by considering the absolute value equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$.
This equation can be rewritten as two separate equations: $|x - 1| - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $-(|x - 1| - 2) = \frac{m}{100}$.
Simplifying these equations gives $|x - 1| = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $|x - 1| = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, respectively.
The first equation $|x - 1| = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ has solutions when $2 + \frac{m}{100} > 0$, or $m > -200$.
The second equation $|x - 1| = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ has solutions when $2 - \frac{m}{100} \geq 0$, or $m \leq 200$.
Combining these conditions, we have $-200 < m \leq 200$.
Now we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ in this range such that each equation has 4 distinct solutions.
For the equation $|x - 1| = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, there are 4 distinct solutions when $0 < 2 + \frac{m}{100} < 3$, or $-2 < \frac{m}{100} < 1$.
This gives $-200 < m < 100$.
For the equation $|x - 1| = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, there are 4 distinct solutions when $0 < 2 - \frac{m}{100} < 3$, or $-1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$.
This gives $-100 < m < 200$.
Taking the intersection of these two ranges, we have $-100 < m < 100$.
The number of positive integers $m$ in this range is 100.
Therefore, there are 100 positive integers $m$ for which the equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.
The answer is: $100$

**Solution:** 



We are going to numerically solve this problem. We know that the equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. We want to find the value of $m$.

To do this, we will use a loop to iterate through all possible positive integer values of $m$ and check if the equation has 4 distinct solutions. If it does, we return the value of $m$.

Here is the entire script:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Eq, Abs, solveset
import itertools

def find_m():
    x = symbols('x')
    m = 1
    while True:
        equation = Eq(Abs(Abs(x - 1) - 2), m / 100)
        solutions = solveset(equation, x)
        if len(solutions) == 4:
            return m
        m += 1

print(find_m())
```

If you run this script, it will output the correct value of $m$ which makes the equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ have 4 distinct solutions.

```output

FAIL


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

Traceback: line 918, in _solve_abs
    raise ValueError(filldedent('''
ValueError: 
Absolute values cannot be inverted in the complex domain.

FAIL

```

It seems that the script encountered an error due to the nature of the problem. The error is related to the inability of Sympy to handle absolute value equations in the complex domain. However, we can solve this problem analytically, as shown below.

The equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if the right-hand side $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to 2. This is because the expression $|x-1|-2$ changes its sign at $x=1$, and the absolute value of a quantity changes its sign at the point where the quantity is zero. Therefore, the equation $| |x-1|-2|=c$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $c=2$.

Setting $\frac{m}{100}=2$, we get $m=200$. 

So the value of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 200. The answer is: $200$

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of distinct solutions the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has. Since the right side of the equation is positive, the left side must also be positive, so $m$ must be less than or equal to $200$. 

We know that $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ can take on three values: $0, 1,$ or $2$. Thus, the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be $1$ or $2$ in order for the equation to have $4$ distinct solutions. 

If $\frac{m}{100} = 1$, then $m = 100$. If $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, then $m = 200$.

So, the only values of $m$ that work are $100$ and $200$. 

However, we need to check if these values actually give us $4$ distinct solutions. 

For $m=100$, the equation becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=1$. This has $4$ solutions: $x = -1, 3, 0, 4$.

For $m=200$, the equation becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=2$. This also has $4$ solutions: $x = -1, 3, 0, 4$.

Thus, both $m=100$ and $m=200$ satisfy the condition of having $4$ distinct solutions. The number of such positive integers $m$ is $2$. The answer is: $2$

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we can first understand that the equation $| |x-1|-2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $2$ (inclusive). This is because the function $| |x-1|-2|$ oscillates between $1$ and $2$ as $x$ varies.

To find the values of $m$ that satisfy this condition, we can multiply both sides of the inequality $1 \leq \frac{m}{100} \leq 2$ by $100$ to get $100 \leq m \leq 200$.

Now we need to find the number of positive integers in this interval. We can find this by subtracting the smallest integer in the interval from the largest integer in the interval and then adding $1$. This gives us $200 - 100 + 1 = 101$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $| |x-1|-2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is $101$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def count_positive_integers():
    lower_bound = 100

    return count

result = count_positive_integers()

```

        equation = Eq(abs(abs(x - 1) - 2), m_value / 100)
        solutions = solve(equation, x)
        if len(solutions) == 4:  # check if the number of solutions is 4
            count += 1

    return count
