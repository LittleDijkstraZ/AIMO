**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_ 2= (-16,2).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that
\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as
\[\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1.\]Find $h + k + a + b.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many square units are in the area of the triangle whose vertices are the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the curve $y = (x-3)^2 (x+2)$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we need to find where this curve intersects the $x$ and $y$ axes.  If $y=0$, then $(x-3)^2(x+2)=0$, which has solutions of $x=3$ and $x=-2$.  If $x=0$, then $y=(-3)^2(2)=18$.  So, the curve has two $x$-intercepts and one $y$-intercept.  The length of the base along the $x$-axis is $3-(-2)=5$.  The height from this base is equal to the $y$-intercept, 18.  The area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 5\cdot 18=\boxed{45}$. The answer is $\boxed{45}$

**Solution:** 


The problem involves absolute value expressions and the need to find the area of the region enclosed by the points that satisfy the equation. The equation is of the form $f(x, y) = 0$, where $f(x, y)$ is a product of two quadratic expressions. The product equals zero if and only if at least one of the factors equals zero. Therefore, we can break down the problem into solving the equations $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

We can solve these equations separately and then find the intersection of the solutions to obtain the boundary of the region. Finally, we can calculate the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the boundary.

Here is the python code to solve the problem:

```python

from sympy import symbols, Abs, solveset, S

def find_area():

    eq2 = solveset(Abs(x - y) - 10, x, domain=S.Reals)
    eq3 = solveset(Abs(x) - 8, x, domain=S.Reals)
    eq4 = solveset(Abs(y) - 8, y, domain=S.Reals)

    # Find the intersection of the solutions
    boundary = eq1.intersect(eq2).intersect(eq3).intersect(eq4)

    # Create a polygon from the boundary points
    poly = Polygon(*boundary)

    # Calculate the area of the polygon
    area = poly.area

    return area

area = find_area()

The code above contains a mistake in the use of `solveset`. The function `solveset` is used to find the solution set of an equation, but in this case, it is not suitable because the equations involve absolute value functions which are not straightforward to solve symbolically. Instead, we can solve the absolute value equations manually.

For $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, the solutions are $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$. Similarly, for $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, the solutions are $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$, for $\vert x \vert = 8$, the solutions are $x = 8$ and $x = -8$, and for $\vert y \vert = 8$, the solutions are $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

The intersection of these solutions gives us the boundary of the region:

- For $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, we have $x = 10$ and $y = 0$.
- For $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$, we have $x = 0$ and $y = 10$.
- For $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$, we have $x = 0$ and $y = -10$.
- For $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$, we have $x = -10$ and $y = 0$.
- For $x = 8$ and $x = -8$, we have $y = 2$ and $y = -2$.
- For $y = 8$ and $y = -8$, we have $x = 2$ and $x = -2$.

These points form a rectangle with vertices $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, -2)$, and $(-8, 2)$. The area of this rectangle is $(8 - (-8)) \times (2 - (-2)) = 16 \times 4 = 64$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 64 square units.

The answer is $\boxed{64}$.

**Problem:** 
"Let $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_ 2= (-16,2).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that
\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as

Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



The given equation is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. The first equation implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, and the second equation implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. 

The solutions of the first equation are:
1) $x + y = 10$, which gives $y = 10 - x$
2) $x + y = -10$, which gives $y = -10 - x$
3) $x - y = 10$, which gives $y = x - 10$
4) $x - y = -10$, which gives $y = x + 10$

The solutions of the second equation are:
1) $x = 8$, which gives $y = \pm 8$
2) $x = -8$, which gives $y = \pm 8$
3) $y = 8$, which gives $x = \pm 8$
4) $y = -8$, which gives $x = \pm 8$

By plotting these points on a coordinate plane, we can see that they form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: 256

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we first need to understand the equation and its implications. The equation is a product of two quadratic expressions equal to zero. Therefore, either one of the expressions must be zero for the equation to hold. This gives us two separate cases to consider.

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This equation implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This is only possible when $x = y = 5$ or $x = -y = -5$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This equation implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This is only possible when $x = 8$ or $x = -8$ and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

Combining these two cases, we find that the points that satisfy the equation are $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$, and $(5, 5)$, $(-5, -5)$, $(-5, 5)$, and $(5, -5)$. These points form a rectangle with side lengths 16 and 10, so the area of the rectangle is $16 \times 10 = 160$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 160.

The answer is: $160$
