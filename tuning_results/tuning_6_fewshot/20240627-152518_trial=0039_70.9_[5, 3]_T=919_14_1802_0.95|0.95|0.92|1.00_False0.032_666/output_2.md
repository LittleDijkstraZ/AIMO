**Problem:** 
"How many distinct solutions are there to the equation $|x-7| = |x+1|$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
If $|x-7| = |x+1|$, then either $x-7 = x+1$ or $x-7 = -(x+1)$.  Simplifying $x-7=x+1$ gives $0=8$, which has no solutions, so no values of $x$ satisfy $x-7 = x+1$.  If $x-7 = -(x+1)$, then $x-7 = -x-1$, so $2x = 6$, which gives $x=3$.  So, there is $\boxed{1}$ solution.

Challenge: See if you can find a quick solution to this problem by simply thinking about the graphs of $y=|x-7|$ and $y=|x+1|$. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many solutions does the equation \[\frac{(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)\dotsm(x-100)}{(x-1^2)(x-2^2)(x-3^2)\dotsm(x-100^2)} = 0\]have for $x$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Any solution to this equation must make the numerator of the left-hand side zero, while keeping the denominator non-zero. The numerator is zero when $x$ is one of the numbers $1, 2, 3, \dots, 100.$ However, for any value in this list that is a perfect square, the denominator will also be zero, so that value of $x$ will not be a root. Therefore, we want to find the number of integers in the list $1, 2, \dots, 100$ which are not perfect squares. The perfect squares in the list are $1^2, 2^2, \dots, 10^2,$ so there are $10$ perfect squares, and \[100 - 10 = \boxed{90}\]integers which are not perfect squares. The answer is $\boxed{90}$

**Solution:** 


To find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions, we can use a trial and error approach. We can start by setting $m$ to different positive integer values and counting the number of distinct solutions.

```python

    x = symbols('x')

m_values = range(1, 101)
num_solutions = [count_solutions(m) for m in m_values]

```
The values of $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions are from $1$ to $100$. However, we are asked to find the number of such $m$. To find this, we can simply count the number of elements in the list.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def count_solutions():
    return len(result)

num_solutions = count_solutions()
print(num_solutions)
```

CODE RESULTS 100

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
100
```
However, this is not the correct answer. We made a mistake in our approach. The number of solutions should be $4$ for some specific values of $m$. But we are counting all the values of $m$ from $1$ to $100$, which will obviously not result in $4$ solutions for all $m$.

Let's reconsider the problem. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions for a specific value of $m$. This means that the right hand side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, is the value that splits the graph of the left hand side into $4$ distinct parts. The graph of the left hand side, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, is a "V" shape with the minimum value of $0$ at $x=1$, and the maximum value of $2$ at $x=\pm\infty$. Thus, $\frac{m}{100}$ should be in the range $(0, 2)$. Therefore, $m$ should be in the range $(0, 200)$.

Now, we can modify our script to only consider values of $m$ in the range $(0, 200)$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def count_solutions(m):
    x = symbols('x')
    equation = Eq(abs(abs(x - 1) - 2), m / 100)
    solutions = solve(equation, x)
    return len(set(solutions))

m_values = range(1, 201)
num_solutions = [count_solutions(m) for m in m_values if m in range(1, 201)]

result = [m for m in m_values if m in range(1, 201) and num_solutions[m_values.index(m)] == 4]
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS ['']

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
['']
```
The output is empty, which means we have made another mistake in our approach. The `result` list is empty because we are not appending the correct values of $m$ to the `result` list. The `result` list should contain the values of $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions. But currently, we are just printing the values of $m$ without checking if the equation has $4$ distinct solutions for that $m$.

Let's modify our script again.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def count_solutions(m):
    x = symbols('x')
    equation = Eq(abs(abs(x - 1) - 2), m / 100)
    solutions = solve(equation, x)
    return len(set(solutions))

m_values = range(1, 201)
num_solutions = [count_solutions(m) for m in m_values if m in range(1, 201)]

result = [m for m in m_values if m in range(1, 201) and num_solutions[m_values.index(m)] == 4]
print(len(result))
``````output

CODE RESULTS ['']

INTERMEDIATE OUT :

['']
```
The output is still empty. This is because we are not printing the correct number of solutions. The number of solutions should be $4$, but currently we are just checking if the equation has any solutions for that $m$. We need to modify our script again to only consider the values of $m$ for which the equation has exactly $4$ distinct solutions.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def count_solutions(m):
    x = symbols('x')
    equation = Eq(abs(abs(x - 1) - 2), m / 100)
    solutions = solve(equation, x)
    return len(set(solutions))

m_values = range(1, 201)
num_solutions = [count_solutions(m) for m in m_values if m in range(1, 201)]

result = [m for m in m_values if m in range(1, 201) and num_solutions[m_values.index(m)] == 4]

    return solutions.count(4)

count = find_m()
print(count)
```

CODE RESULTS 100

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output

```
The number of possible values for $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 100. The value of $m$ is an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive. However, the question asks for the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition, so we must discard the value $m=0$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition is 100 - 1 = 99.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 99. The value of $m$ is an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive. However, the question asks for the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition, so we must discard the value $m=0$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition is 100 - 1 = 99.
The answer is $\boxed{99}$.

Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Any solution to this equation must make the numerator of the left-hand side zero, while keeping the denominator non-zero. The numerator is zero when $x$ is one of the numbers $1, 2, 3, \dots, 100.$ However, for any value in this list that is a perfect square, the denominator will also be zero, so that value of $x$ will not be a root. Therefore, we want to find the number of integers in the list $1, 2, \dots, 100$ which are not perfect squares. The perfect squares in the list are $1^2, 2^2, \dots, 10^2,$ so there are $10$ perfect squares, and \[100 - 10 = \boxed{90}\]integers which are not perfect squares. The answer is $\boxed{90}$

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we need to find the value of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. 

1. First, we need to understand the structure of the equation. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is a piecewise function with four cases based on the absolute value expression inside. 

2. To find the number of distinct solutions, we can graph the function and count the number of times it intersects the line $y = \frac{m}{100}$.

3. For the equation to have $4$ distinct solutions, the line $y = \frac{m}{100}$ must intersect the graph at $4$ different points.

4. By trial and error, we can find the value of $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions. 

5. After trial and error, we find that $m = 200$ is the value that gives $4$ distinct solutions. 

Therefore, the value of $m$ that makes the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have $4$ distinct solutions is $m = 200$. The answer is $\boxed{200}$.

## QUESTION 2 - 10

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"For certain ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ of real numbers, the system of equations
\[\begin{aligned} ax+by&=1 \\ x^2 + y^2 &= 50  \end{aligned}\]has at least one solution, and each solution is an ordered pair $(x,y)\,$ of integers. How many such ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ are there?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The graph of $ax+by=1$ is a line, while the graph of $x^2+y^2=50$ is a circle centered at the origin. Therefore, $(a, b)$ satisfies the conditions if and only if the line and circle intersect at least once, and they intersect only at lattice points (points with integer coordinates).

Knowing this, it makes sense to look for lattice points on the circle whose equation is $x^2+y^2=50$. Testing cases, we find that there are twelve lattice points on the circle: $(\pm 1, \pm 7)$, $(\pm 7, \pm 1)$, and $(\pm 5, \pm 5)$ (where the two $\pm$ signs in each pair are independent of each other).

There are $\tbinom{12}{2} = 66$ pairs of these points, and each pair determines a line. However, the graph of $ax+by=1$ can never pass through the origin $(0, 0)$, since if $x=y=0$, then $ax+by=0 \neq 1$. Therefore, the six pairs which consist of diametrically opposed points are invalid, since the line through them passes through the origin. This corrects our count to $66 - 6 = 60$.

In addition, for each of the twelve points, there is a line tangent to the circle at that point, so that the only solution to the system is that one point. This brings the final total to $60 + 12 = \boxed{72}$. The answer is $\boxed{72}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The equation $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$.
This is because the expression $| |x-1| - 2 |$ will be equal to 2 when it is inside the absolute value bars, i.e., when $|x-1| - 2 = 2$ or $|x-1| - 2 = -2$.
The first equation simplifies to $|x-1| = 4$, which has solutions $x = 5$ and $x = -3$.
The second equation simplifies to $|x-1| = 0$, which has solution $x = 1$.
Therefore, if $m = 200$, the equation has 4 distinct solutions.
The value of $m$ that satisfies the condition is 200.
The answer is: $\boxed{200}$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let \[f(x) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
-x + 3 & \text{if } x \le 0, \\
2x - 5 & \text{if } x > 0.
\end{array}
\right.\]How many solutions does the equation $f(f(x)) = 4$ have?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
To solve the equation $f(f(x)) = 4,$ we first find the values $x$ such that $f(x) = 4.$

Either $f(x) = -x + 3$ (for $x \le 0$) or $f(x) = 2x - 5$ (for $x > 0$). If $-x + 3 = 4,$ then $x = -1.$ Note that this value satisfies $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = 4,$ then $x = 9/2.$ Note that this value satisfies $x > 0.$ Therefore, the solutions to $f(x) = 4$ are $x = -1$ and $x = 9/2.$

Next, we solve for the values $x$ such that $f(x) = -1.$ If $-x + 3 = -1,$ then $x = 4.$ This value does not satisfy $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = -1,$ then $x = 2.$ This value satisfies $x > 0.$

Finally, we solve for the values $x$ such that $f(x) = 9/2.$ If $-x + 3 = 9/2,$ then $x = -3/2.$ This value satisfies $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = 9/2,$ then $x = 19/4.$ This value satisfies $x > 0.$

Therefore, the equation $f(f(x)) = 4$ has the solutions $x = 2,$ $-3/2,$ and $19/4,$ for a total of $\boxed{3}$ solutions. The answer is $\boxed{3}$
