Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Let $w$ be the width of each of the identical rectangles. Since $PQ=3w$, $RS=2x$ and $PQ=RS$ (because $PQRS$ is a rectangle), then $2x = 3w$, or $$w=\frac{2}{3}x.$$ Therefore, the area of each of the five identical rectangles is $$x\left(\frac{2}{3}x\right)=\frac{2}{3}x^2.$$ Since the area of $PQRS$ is 4000 and it is made up of five of these identical smaller rectangles, then $$5\left(\frac{2}{3}x^2\right)=4000$$ or $$\frac{10}{3}x^2 = 4000$$ or $x^2 = 1200$ or $x \approx 34.6$ which, when rounded off to the nearest integer, is $\boxed{35}.$ The answer is $\boxed{35}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, -2)$, and $(-8, 2)$.

Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So the square is formed with side length 16.

The area of the square is therefore $16^2 = 256$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_square():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = area_of_square()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is $\boxed{256}$.

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

The first term is zero when either $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x-y| - 10 = 0$. This implies $|x+y| = 10$ or $|x-y| = 10$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x+y = 10$, $x+y = -10$, $x-y = 10$, and $x-y = -10$.

The second term is zero when either $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$. This implies $|x| = 8$ or $|y| = 8$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersection points of these lines are $(-8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, and $(8, 8)$. These points form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

```python

def polygon_area():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output

```
The area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is $\boxed{256}$.
