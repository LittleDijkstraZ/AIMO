**Problem:** 
"Let $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_ 2= (-16,2).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that
\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as
\[\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1.\]Find $h + k + a + b.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


First, we need to understand that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These two equations represent two lines in the coordinate plane, and their intersection forms a square with side length 20. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.

The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which represents a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

However, the second case is not valid because the points in the square formed by the intersection of the two lines satisfy the original equation, while the points in the square formed by the second case do not. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 400.
The answer is: $400$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Find the number of 10-tuples $(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{10})$ of real numbers such that
\[(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2 = \frac{1}{11}.\]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,
\begin{align*}
&[(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + \dots + 1^2 + 1^2)][(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2] \\
&\ge [(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + (x_2 - x_3) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10}]^2 = 1.
\end{align*}From the given condition, we have equality, so by the equality condition for Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[\frac{1 - x_1}{1} = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{1} = \frac{x_2 - x_3}{1} = \dots = \frac{x_9 - x_{10}}{1} = \frac{x_{10}}{1}.\]Let
\[d = 1 - x_1 = x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_3 = \dots = x_9 - x_{10} = x_{10}.\]Then
\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so
\[(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_{10}) = \left( \frac{10}{11}, \frac{9}{11}, \frac{8}{11}, \dots, \frac{1}{11} \right).\]In particular, there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the given equation is satisfied if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$. Similarly, the equation $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$. The equations $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ imply $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $-8 \leq x \leq 8$ and $-8 \leq y \leq 8$.

The solutions $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, $x - y = -10$, $-8 \leq x \leq 8$, and $-8 \leq y \leq 8$ form a rectangle with side lengths $20$ and $16$. The area of this rectangle is $20 \times 16 = 320$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"An ellipse is defined parametrically by
\[(x,y) = \left( \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t}, \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t} \right).\]Then the equation of the ellipse can be written in the form
\[Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0,\]where $A,$ $B,$ $C,$ $D,$ $E,$ and $F$ are integers, and $\gcd(|A|,|B|,|C|,|D|,|E|,|F|) = 1.$  Find $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F|.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
In the equation $y = \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\cos t$ to get
\[\cos t = \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3}.\]In the equation $x = \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\sin t$ to get
\[\sin t = \frac{1}{2} x (2 - \cos t) + 1 = \frac{1}{2} x \left( 2 - \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right) + 1 = 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)}.\]Since $\cos^2 t + \sin^2 t = 1,$
\[\left( \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right)^2 + \left( 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)} \right)^2 = 1.\]Multiplying both sides by $(2(y + 3))^2$ and expanding, it will simplify to
\[81x^2 - 36xy + 16y^2 - 108x + 240y + 900 = 0.\]Therefore, $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F| = 81 + 36 + 16 + 108 + 240 + 900 = \boxed{1381}.$ The answer is $\boxed{1381}$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step.

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


The problem is asking for the area of a polygon formed by the intersection of the solution sets of two inequalities. The first inequality is $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x - y| - 10 = 0$, and the second is $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$. 

To solve this, we can use the following steps:

1. First, we need to find the solution sets of the four absolute value equations. 
2. Then, we find the intersection of these solution sets.
3. Finally, we calculate the area of the polygon formed by these intersection points.

Let's start with the first step:

The equation $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ gives us $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$. The equation $|x - y| - 10 = 0$ gives us $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$. The equation $|x| - 8 = 0$ gives us $x = 8$ or $x = -8$. The equation $|y| - 8 = 0$ gives us $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

Now, let's find the intersection of these solution sets:

The intersection of $x + y = 10$ and $x = 8$ is $(8, 2)$. The intersection of $x + y = 10$ and $y = 8$ is $(2, 8)$. The intersection of $x + y = -10$ and $x = 8$ is $(8, -18)$. The intersection of $x + y = -10$ and $y = 8$ is $(-18, 8)$. The intersection of $x - y = 10$ and $x = 8$ is $(8, -2)$. The intersection of $x - y = 10$ and $y = 8$ is $(18, 8)$. The intersection of $x - y = -10$ and $x = 8$ is $(8, 18)$. The intersection of $x - y = -10$ and $y = 8$ is $(-2, 8)$. The intersection of $x = 8$ and $y = 8$ is $(8, 8)$. The intersection of $x = 8$ and $y = -8$ is $(8, -8)$. The intersection of $x = -8$ and $y = 8$ is $(-8, 8)$. The intersection of $x = -8$ and $y = -8$ is $(-8, -8)$.

Finally, let's calculate the area of the polygon formed by these intersection points. The polygon is a square with side length 16, so its area is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256.
The answer is: $256$

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is true if and only if both of the following equations are true:

   a) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
   
   b) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

2. For the first equation to be true, we need both $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, -2)$, and $(-8, 2)$.

3. For the second equation to be true, we need both $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$.

4. Combining the solutions from both equations, we find that the points that satisfy the original equation are the vertices of a $8 \times 8$ square.

5. The area of a square with side length $s$ is $s^2$. Therefore, the area of the square with side length 8 is $8^2 = 64$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 64.

The answer is: $64$

"Find the number of 10-tuples $(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{10})$ of real numbers such that

Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,
\begin{align*}

&\ge [(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + (x_2 - x_3) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10}]^2 = 1.
\end{align*}From the given condition, we have equality, so by the equality condition for Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[\frac{1 - x_1}{1} = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{1} = \frac{x_2 - x_3}{1} = \dots = \frac{x_9 - x_{10}}{1} = \frac{x_{10}}{1}.\]Let
\[d = 1 - x_1 = x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_3 = \dots = x_9 - x_{10} = x_{10}.\]Then
\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so
\[(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_{10}) = \left( \frac{10}{11}, \frac{9}{11}, \frac{8}{11}, \dots, \frac{1}{11} \right).\]In particular, there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Solution:** 



This problem involves the concept of absolute values and absolute value inequalities. We can solve the absolute value equations step by step.

1. Solve the absolute value equation $|x + y| - 10 = 0$. This equation is equivalent to $|x + y| = 10$. The solutions are $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.
2. Solve the absolute value equation $|x - y| - 10 = 0$. This equation is equivalent to $|x - y| = 10$. The solutions are $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.
3. Solve the absolute value equation $|x| - 8 = 0$. This equation is equivalent to $|x| = 8$. The solutions are $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.
4. Solve the absolute value equation $|y| - 8 = 0$. This equation is equivalent to $|y| = 8$. The solutions are $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

The intersection of these solutions gives us the vertices of the polygon. The polygon is a square with side length 16. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we first need to understand the given equation and the conditions it imposes on the points $(x, y)$. The equation is of the form $f(x, y) \cdot g(x, y) = 0$. This means that either $f(x, y) = 0$ or $g(x, y) = 0$. So the points that satisfy this equation are those that satisfy either $f(x, y) = 0$ or $g(x, y) = 0$.

The function $f(x, y)$ is of the form $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, and $g(x, y)$ is of the form $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$.

The function $f(x, y) = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of a square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$.

The function $g(x, y) = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us a square with side length $16$.

The convex polygon formed by the points that satisfy the given equation is the union of these two squares. The area of this polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares, which is $2(10\sqrt{2} \times 10\sqrt{2}) + 2(16 \times 16) = 400 + 512 = 912$.

However, this result is not possible because the area of a square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$ is $(10\sqrt{2})^2 = 200$, and the area of a square with side length $16$ is $16^2 = 256$. The sum of these two areas is $200 + 256 = 456$, not $912$.

We must have made a mistake in our calculations. Let's retrace our steps and find the error.

The function $f(x, y) = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of a square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$. This is correct.

The function $g(x, y) = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us a square with side length $16$. This is also correct.

The convex polygon formed by the points that satisfy the given equation is the union of these two squares. However, the union of these two squares is not the same as the square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$ and the square with side length $16$ being joined along a common side. Instead, the union of these two squares forms a larger square with side length $10\sqrt{2} + 16$.

The area of this larger square is $(10\sqrt{2} + 16)^2 = 200 + 320\sqrt{2} + 256 = 456 + 320\sqrt{2}$.

However, this result is not possible because the area of a square with side length $10\sqrt{2} + 16$ is not a real number. We must have made a mistake in our calculations.

Let's retrace our steps and find the error.

The function $f(x, y) = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of a square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$. This is correct.

The function $g(x, y) = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us a square with side length $16$. This is also correct.

The convex polygon formed by the points that satisfy the given equation is the union of these two squares. The union of these two squares forms a larger square with side length $10\sqrt{2} + 16$. However, this is not the correct interpretation of the problem.

The points that satisfy $f(x, y) = 0$ form a square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$, and the points that satisfy $g(x, y) = 0$ form a square with side length $16$. The convex polygon formed by the points that satisfy the given equation is the intersection of these two squares. This intersection is a smaller square whose side length is the difference of the side lengths of the two larger squares, which is $10\sqrt{2} - 16$.

The area of this smaller square is $(10\sqrt{2} - 16)^2 = 200 - 320\sqrt{2} + 256 = 456 - 320\sqrt{2}$.

However, this result is not possible because the area of a square with side length $10\sqrt{2} - 16$ is not a real number. We must have made a mistake in our calculations.

Let's retrace our steps and find the error.

The function $f(x, y) = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of a square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$. This is correct.

The function $g(x, y) = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us a square with side length $16$. This is also correct.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_ 2= (-16,2).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that
\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as
\[\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1.\]Find $h + k + a + b.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



First, we need to understand the problem. The equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. Each term is a sum of squares, which are always nonnegative. Therefore, for the product to be zero, each term must be zero. This gives us four conditions:

1. $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x - y| - 10 = 0$.
2. $|x| - 8 = 0$ and $|y| - 8 = 0$.

Let's solve these conditions one by one:

1. $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ implies $|x + y| = 10$, so $x + y = \pm 10$.
2. $|x - y| - 10 = 0$ implies $|x - y| = 10$, so $x - y = \pm 10$.
3. $|x| - 8 = 0$ implies $|x| = 8$, so $x = \pm 8$.
4. $|y| - 8 = 0$ implies $|y| = 8$, so $y = \pm 8$.

The solutions to these equations are the vertices of the polygon. By solving these equations, we find the vertices to be: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The polygon is a square with side length 16. The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

The answer is: $256$

## QUESTION 3 - 10

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"An ellipse is defined parametrically by
\[(x,y) = \left( \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t}, \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t} \right).\]Then the equation of the ellipse can be written in the form
\[Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0,\]where $A,$ $B,$ $C,$ $D,$ $E,$ and $F$ are integers, and $\gcd(|A|,|B|,|C|,|D|,|E|,|F|) = 1.$  Find $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F|.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
In the equation $y = \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\cos t$ to get
\[\cos t = \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3}.\]In the equation $x = \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\sin t$ to get
\[\sin t = \frac{1}{2} x (2 - \cos t) + 1 = \frac{1}{2} x \left( 2 - \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right) + 1 = 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)}.\]Since $\cos^2 t + \sin^2 t = 1,$
\[\left( \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right)^2 + \left( 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)} \right)^2 = 1.\]Multiplying both sides by $(2(y + 3))^2$ and expanding, it will simplify to
\[81x^2 - 36xy + 16y^2 - 108x + 240y + 900 = 0.\]Therefore, $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F| = 81 + 36 + 16 + 108 + 240 + 900 = \boxed{1381}.$ The answer is $\boxed{1381}$

**Solution:** 


The area of the convex polygon formed by the set of points $(x, y)$ satisfying the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is 0. This is because the equation is equal to 0 if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. Each of these conditions implies that either $|x + y| = 10$, $|x - y| = 10$, $|x| = 8$, or $|y| = 8$. These conditions define a set of lines in the plane, and the intersection of these lines is the set of points that satisfy all the conditions. This set of points forms a polygon, but the area of this polygon is 0, because the polygon is just a collection of lines. The answer is: $0$

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The expression equals zero if and only if both factors equal zero. So we have two sets of equations to solve: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

2. From $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, so $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.

3. From $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert x \vert = 8$, so $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.

4. Similarly, we get $y = 10 - x$ or $y = -10 - x$ from $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$, and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$ from $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.

5. Plot these equations in a coordinate plane, and we find that they form a square with side length 16.

6. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256.

```
The problem with the above script is that it doesn't correctly calculate the side length of the square. The max function is trying to find the maximum difference between all pairs of points, but it's not finding any pairs because the solutions list is empty. The script doesn't correctly combine the solutions from the two sets of equations.

Let's fix that:

```python

## QUESTION 3 - 13 
- TIME_SPENT : 492 secs

13_
**Example**

**Problem:** 
"An ellipse is defined parametrically by
\[(x,y) = \left( \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t}, \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t} \right).\]Then the equation of the ellipse can be written in the form
\[Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0,\]where $A,$ $B,$ $C,$ $D,$ $E,$ and $F$ are integers, and $\gcd(|A|,|B|,|C|,|D|,|E|,|F|) = 1.$  Find $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F|.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
In the equation $y = \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\cos t$ to get
\[\cos t = \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3}.\]In the equation $x = \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\sin t$ to get
\[\sin t = \frac{1}{2} x (2 - \cos t) + 1 = \frac{1}{2} x \left( 2 - \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right) + 1 = 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)}.\]Since $\cos^2 t + \sin^2 t = 1,$
\[\left( \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right)^2 + \left( 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)} \right)^2 = 1.\]Multiplying both sides by $(2(y + 3))^2$ and expanding, it will simplify to
\[81x^2 - 36xy + 16y^2 - 108x + 240y + 900 = 0.\]Therefore, $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F| = 81 + 36 + 16 + 108 + 240 + 900 = \boxed{1381}.$ The answer is $\boxed{1381}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The given equation is a product of two terms, each of which is a square of a difference. The product is zero if and only if at least one of the terms is zero. Therefore, we have the following four cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, or $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, or $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert y \vert = 8$, or $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

The solutions from cases 1 and 2 form a square with side length $20$, and the solutions from cases 3 and 4 form a square with side length $16$. The intersection of these two squares is a smaller square with side length $8$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares minus the area of the smaller square:

$$(20^2 + 16^2 - 8^2) = 400 + 256 - 64 = 592.$$
