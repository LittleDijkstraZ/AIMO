**Problem:** 
"How many distinct solutions are there to the equation $|x-7| = |x+1|$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
If $|x-7| = |x+1|$, then either $x-7 = x+1$ or $x-7 = -(x+1)$.  Simplifying $x-7=x+1$ gives $0=8$, which has no solutions, so no values of $x$ satisfy $x-7 = x+1$.  If $x-7 = -(x+1)$, then $x-7 = -x-1$, so $2x = 6$, which gives $x=3$.  So, there is $\boxed{1}$ solution.

Challenge: See if you can find a quick solution to this problem by simply thinking about the graphs of $y=|x-7|$ and $y=|x+1|$. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Solution:** 



```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solveset, S, Abs, Eq
from itertools import count

def find_m():
    """For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"""
    x, m = symbols('x m')
    equation = Eq(Abs(Abs(x - 1) - 2), m/100)
    num_solutions = 0

    for m_value in count(1):
        equation_modified = equation.subs(m, m_value)
        solutions = solveset(equation_modified, x, domain=S.Reals)
        if len(solutions) == 4:
            num_solutions += 1
        if num_solutions > 100:  # This is a hack to prevent infinite loop.
            break

    return num_solutions

result = find_m()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 101

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
101
```
The value of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $101$. However, it is important to note that the equation may have more than $4$ solutions for some values of $m$, but we are only interested in the case where it has exactly $4$ solutions. The value of $m$ for which the equation has exactly $4$ solutions is $101$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $1$. The value of the unknown variable $m$ is $101$. The answer is: $101$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many solutions does the equation \[\frac{(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)\dotsm(x-100)}{(x-1^2)(x-2^2)(x-3^2)\dotsm(x-100^2)} = 0\]have for $x$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Any solution to this equation must make the numerator of the left-hand side zero, while keeping the denominator non-zero. The numerator is zero when $x$ is one of the numbers $1, 2, 3, \dots, 100.$ However, for any value in this list that is a perfect square, the denominator will also be zero, so that value of $x$ will not be a root. Therefore, we want to find the number of integers in the list $1, 2, \dots, 100$ which are not perfect squares. The perfect squares in the list are $1^2, 2^2, \dots, 10^2,$ so there are $10$ perfect squares, and \[100 - 10 = \boxed{90}\]integers which are not perfect squares. The answer is $\boxed{90}$

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The problem is asking for the number of values of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions. 

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $2$, i.e., $1<\frac{m}{100}<2$. This implies $100<m<200$. The number of positive integers in this range is $100$. So, there is only one value of $m$ that satisfies the conditions of the problem. The value of $m$ is $150$. 

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is $1$.

The answer is $\boxed{1}$.

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The given equation has four distinct solutions, which means that the equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has four solutions.
We know that the absolute value function $|x|$ splits into two cases: $x$ if $x \geq 0$ and $-x$ if $x < 0$. So, the equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ also splits into two cases:

1. $|x-1|-2=\frac{m}{100}$: This equation is equivalent to $|x-1|=2+\frac{m}{100}$. This splits into two sub-cases:
   a. $x-1=2+\frac{m}{100}$: This gives us $x=3+\frac{m}{100}$.
   b. $x-1=-2-\frac{m}{100}$: This gives us $x=-1-\frac{m}{100}$.

2. $-(|x-1|-2)=\frac{m}{100}$: This equation is equivalent to $|x-1|-2=-\frac{m}{100}$. This splits into two sub-cases:
   a. $x-1-2=-\frac{m}{100}$: This gives us $x=-3+\frac{m}{100}$.
   b. $x-1+2=\frac{m}{100}$: This gives us $x=1+\frac{m}{100}$.

So, the four solutions are $x=3+\frac{m}{100}$, $x=-1-\frac{m}{100}$, $x=-3+\frac{m}{100}$, and $x=1+\frac{m}{100}$.

For these four solutions to be distinct, the four values of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be distinct. This means that $3-(-1)=-4$ and $3-(-3)=6$ must both be different from $1-(-1)=2$.

Therefore, $m=400$ is a solution. We can check that no other value of $m$ will make the four values of $\frac{m}{100}$ distinct.

So, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions, and that is $m=400$. The answer is: $1$

**Solution:** 



We know that the equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions. The expression $| |x-1|-2|$ is a piecewise function of $x$ which can take the forms of $2 - |x-1|$ or $|x-1| - 2$. This function will be equal to $\frac{m}{100}$ exactly four times, so we need to find the value of $m$ for which the equation $| |x-1|-2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions.

The equation $| |x-1|-2| = \frac{m}{100}$ will have four distinct solutions when the right hand side is between $0$ and $2$. That is, $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which gives $0 < m < 200$.

Now we need to find the value of $m$ for which the equation $| |x-1|-2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has exactly four distinct solutions. This can be done by plotting the function $y = | |x-1|-2|$ and seeing where it intersects the horizontal line $y = \frac{m}{100}$.

The function $y = | |x-1|-2|$ is a "V" shape with the vertex at $x = 1$. The distance between the two "arms" of the "V" is $4$. The line $y = \frac{m}{100}$ will intersect the "V" shape at four distinct points when $\frac{m}{100} = 1$. This gives $m = 100$.

So, the value of $m$ for which the equation $| |x-1|-2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has exactly four distinct solutions is $100$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $| |x-1|-2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions is $1$.
The answer is: $1$
