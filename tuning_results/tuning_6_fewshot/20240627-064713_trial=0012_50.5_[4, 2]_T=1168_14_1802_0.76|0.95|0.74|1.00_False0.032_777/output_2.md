**Problem:** 
"How many solutions does the equation \[\frac{(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)\dotsm(x-100)}{(x-1^2)(x-2^2)(x-3^2)\dotsm(x-100^2)} = 0\]have for $x$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Any solution to this equation must make the numerator of the left-hand side zero, while keeping the denominator non-zero. The numerator is zero when $x$ is one of the numbers $1, 2, 3, \dots, 100.$ However, for any value in this list that is a perfect square, the denominator will also be zero, so that value of $x$ will not be a root. Therefore, we want to find the number of integers in the list $1, 2, \dots, 100$ which are not perfect squares. The perfect squares in the list are $1^2, 2^2, \dots, 10^2,$ so there are $10$ perfect squares, and \[100 - 10 = \boxed{90}\]integers which are not perfect squares. The answer is $\boxed{90}$

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $2$. Therefore, $1<\frac{m}{100}<2$, which implies $100<m<200$. The number of positive integers $m$ in this range is $200-100-1=99$. So there are $99$ positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions. The answer is: $99$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many distinct solutions are there to the equation $|x-7| = |x+1|$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
If $|x-7| = |x+1|$, then either $x-7 = x+1$ or $x-7 = -(x+1)$.  Simplifying $x-7=x+1$ gives $0=8$, which has no solutions, so no values of $x$ satisfy $x-7 = x+1$.  If $x-7 = -(x+1)$, then $x-7 = -x-1$, so $2x = 6$, which gives $x=3$.  So, there is $\boxed{1}$ solution.

Challenge: See if you can find a quick solution to this problem by simply thinking about the graphs of $y=|x-7|$ and $y=|x+1|$. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we need to determine for how many positive integers $m$ the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

We know that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to the distance between any two consecutive solutions of $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$.

The solutions of $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$ are $x = -1$ and $x = 3$. The distance between these two solutions is $4$. Therefore, we have $\frac{m}{100} = 4$.

Solving for $m$ gives $m = 400$.

Therefore, the value of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is $400$.

The answer is: $400$.

**Solution:** 



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to the distance between two adjacent steps in the piecewise function defined by $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. This function has three steps at $x = -1$, $x = 3$, and $x = 5$. The distances between these steps are $4$ and $2$. So, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal to one of these distances. Therefore, $m$ must be one of the values $400$ or $200$. 

We need to determine which value of $m$ results in 4 distinct solutions. This can be done by graphing the function $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ and observing where it intersects the horizontal line $y = \frac{m}{100}$. For $m = 400$, the line intersects the function at four points, while for $m = 200$, the line intersects the function at two points. Therefore, the only value of $m$ that results in 4 distinct solutions is $m = 400$.

The answer is: $1$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many integers are solutions to the equation $$(x-2)^{(25-x^2)}=1?$$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
We need some basic facts from number theory: $a^0 = 1$ for any $a,$ $1^b = 1$ for any $b,$ and $(-1)^c = 1$ if $c$ is an even integer. Unless the base is a complex number (which is excluded since we are looking for integer solutions), there are no other ways to get an RHS of $1.$ Thus, either the exponent is zero $($giving the equation $25 - x^2 = 0),$ the base is $1$ $($giving $x -2 = 1),$ or the base is $-1$ and the exponent is even $($giving the simultaneous equations $x - 2 = -1$ and $25 - x^2 = 2n$ for some integer $n).$ Solving the first equation gives $x = \pm 5,$ and solving the second gives $x = 3.$ The third equation implies that $x = 1,$ in which case $25 - x^2 = 24$ is indeed even, so $x = 1$ is a valid solution. In all, there are $\boxed{4}$ integer solutions. The answer is $\boxed{4}$

The problem asks for how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions. 

This is a complex problem to solve analytically, but we can use Python's `sympy` library to solve it.

First, let's define the function `num_solutions()` to solve this problem:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

def num_solutions():
    """For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"""
    x, m = symbols('x m')
    num_sol = 0

    for m_val in range(1, 101):  # Loop through possible values of m
        equation = Eq(abs(abs(x - 1) - 2), m_val/100)
        solutions = solve(equation, x)

        if len(solutions) == 4:  # If the equation has 4 solutions
            num_sol += 1

    return num_sol

result = num_solutions()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 100

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
100
```
The value of $m$ that makes the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have $4$ distinct solutions is $100$. So the number of positive integers $m$ is $1$.
The answer is $\boxed{1}$.

**Solution:** 



We are given the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ and we want to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which this equation has exactly four distinct solutions.

We know that the right-hand side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be positive, so $m$ must be positive.

We can start by considering the possible forms of the absolute value expressions on the left-hand side.

Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$
The absolute value expression $\vert x-1 \vert$ can be rewritten as a piecewise function:
\[\vert x-1 \vert = \begin{cases} x-1, & \text{if } x \geq 1 \\ -(x-1), & \text{if } x < 1 \end{cases}\]
So we can rewrite the equation as two separate cases:

Case 1a: $x-1 -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, if $x \geq 1$. This simplifies to $x-3 = \frac{m}{100}$, and solving for $x$ gives $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Case 1b: $-(x-1) -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, if $x < 1$. This simplifies to $-x+1 -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, or $-x-1 = \frac{m}{100}$, and solving for $x$ gives $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Case 2: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$

Case 2a: $x-1 -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$, if $x \geq 1$. This simplifies to $x-3 = -\frac{m}{100}$, and solving for $x$ gives $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Case 2b: $-(x-1) -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$, if $x < 1$. This simplifies to $-x+1 -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$, or $-x-1 = -\frac{m}{100}$, and solving for $x$ gives $x = 1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Now, we need to find the values of $m$ for which each of these cases have exactly four distinct solutions.

For Case 1a, the equation $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ has exactly one solution, so it does not satisfy the condition of having four distinct solutions.

For Case 1b, the equation $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$ also has exactly one solution, so it does not satisfy the condition of having four distinct solutions.

For Case 2a, the equation $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ has exactly one solution, so it does not satisfy the condition of having four distinct solutions.

For Case 2b, the equation $x = 1 - \frac{m}{100}$, has exactly one solution, so it does not satisfy the condition of having four distinct solutions.

However, we can combine some of these cases to form equations that have four distinct solutions. For example, consider the equation $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ for $x < 1$ and $x = 1 - \frac{m}{100}$ for $x \geq 1$. This equation has four distinct solutions for $x$.

To find the value of $m$ for which this occurs, we set $3 - \frac{m}{100} = 1 - \frac{m}{100}$. Simplifying this gives $2 = 0$, which is a contradiction. However, if we set $3 - \frac{m}{100} = 1 + \frac{m}{100}$, we get $2 = \frac{2m}{100}$, or $m = 100$.

So, the only value of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly four distinct solutions is $m = 100$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has exactly four distinct solutions is $1$. The answer is $\boxed{1}$.
