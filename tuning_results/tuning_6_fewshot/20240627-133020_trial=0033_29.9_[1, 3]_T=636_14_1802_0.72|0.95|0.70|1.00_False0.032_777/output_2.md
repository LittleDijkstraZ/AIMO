**Problem:** 
"How many distinct solutions are there to the equation $|x-7| = |x+1|$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
If $|x-7| = |x+1|$, then either $x-7 = x+1$ or $x-7 = -(x+1)$.  Simplifying $x-7=x+1$ gives $0=8$, which has no solutions, so no values of $x$ satisfy $x-7 = x+1$.  If $x-7 = -(x+1)$, then $x-7 = -x-1$, so $2x = 6$, which gives $x=3$.  So, there is $\boxed{1}$ solution.

Challenge: See if you can find a quick solution to this problem by simply thinking about the graphs of $y=|x-7|$ and $y=|x+1|$. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 1 and 2. This is because the graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ consists of four line segments of slope $\pm1$ and has a "V" shape, and $\frac{m}{100}$ determines the height of this "V". If $\frac{m}{100}$ is less than 1, the "V" is too shallow to intersect the x-axis at 4 points. If $\frac{m}{100}$ is greater than 2, the "V" is too steep to intersect the x-axis at 4 points. If $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 1 and 2, the "V" intersects the x-axis at 4 points. Therefore, we want to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $1<\frac{m}{100}<2$. Multiplying all sides of the inequalities by 100 gives $100<m<200$. The number of positive integers in this range is $200-100-1=99$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 99. The answer is: $\boxed{99}$

The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $100$. However, we need to find the value of $m$ that makes the equation have $4$ distinct solutions. To do this, we can manually check the values of $m$ that make the equation have $4$ distinct solutions.

After checking, we find that the value of $m$ that makes the equation have $4$ distinct solutions is $200$. Therefore, the value of $m$ is $200$. The answer is: $200$
