**Problem:** 
"How many solutions does the equation \[\frac{(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)\dotsm(x-100)}{(x-1^2)(x-2^2)(x-3^2)\dotsm(x-100^2)} = 0\]have for $x$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Any solution to this equation must make the numerator of the left-hand side zero, while keeping the denominator non-zero. The numerator is zero when $x$ is one of the numbers $1, 2, 3, \dots, 100.$ However, for any value in this list that is a perfect square, the denominator will also be zero, so that value of $x$ will not be a root. Therefore, we want to find the number of integers in the list $1, 2, \dots, 100$ which are not perfect squares. The perfect squares in the list are $1^2, 2^2, \dots, 10^2,$ so there are $10$ perfect squares, and \[100 - 10 = \boxed{90}\]integers which are not perfect squares. The answer is $\boxed{90}$

The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $100$. However, we are asked for the number of such $m$ that are integers. Since $m$ ranges from $1$ to $100$, all of these values of $m$ are positive integers. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition is $100$. The answer is $\boxed{100}$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many distinct solutions are there to the equation $|x-7| = |x+1|$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
If $|x-7| = |x+1|$, then either $x-7 = x+1$ or $x-7 = -(x+1)$.  Simplifying $x-7=x+1$ gives $0=8$, which has no solutions, so no values of $x$ satisfy $x-7 = x+1$.  If $x-7 = -(x+1)$, then $x-7 = -x-1$, so $2x = 6$, which gives $x=3$.  So, there is $\boxed{1}$ solution.

Challenge: See if you can find a quick solution to this problem by simply thinking about the graphs of $y=|x-7|$ and $y=|x+1|$. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Solution:** 



To solve this problem, we will use the fact that the equation $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. This is because the expression $| |x-1| - 2 |$ can only be equal to 2 in 4 distinct ways:

1. When $|x-1| - 2 = 2$, we get $|x-1| = 4$, which gives us two solutions: $x = 5$ and $x = -3$.
2. When $|x-1| - 2 = -2$, we get $|x-1| = 0$, which gives us one solution: $x = 1$.
3. When $-|x-1| + 2 = 2$, we get $|-x+1| = 0$, which gives us one solution: $x = 1$.
4. When $-|x-1| + 2 = -2$, we get $|-x+1| = 4$, which gives us two solutions: $x = -3$ and $x = 5$.

Therefore, the only value of $m$ that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions is $m = 200$.

So the answer is $\boxed{200}$.

## QUESTION 2 - 5

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"For certain ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ of real numbers, the system of equations
\[\begin{aligned} ax+by&=1 \\ x^2 + y^2 &= 50  \end{aligned}\]has at least one solution, and each solution is an ordered pair $(x,y)\,$ of integers. How many such ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ are there?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The graph of $ax+by=1$ is a line, while the graph of $x^2+y^2=50$ is a circle centered at the origin. Therefore, $(a, b)$ satisfies the conditions if and only if the line and circle intersect at least once, and they intersect only at lattice points (points with integer coordinates).

Knowing this, it makes sense to look for lattice points on the circle whose equation is $x^2+y^2=50$. Testing cases, we find that there are twelve lattice points on the circle: $(\pm 1, \pm 7)$, $(\pm 7, \pm 1)$, and $(\pm 5, \pm 5)$ (where the two $\pm$ signs in each pair are independent of each other).

There are $\tbinom{12}{2} = 66$ pairs of these points, and each pair determines a line. However, the graph of $ax+by=1$ can never pass through the origin $(0, 0)$, since if $x=y=0$, then $ax+by=0 \neq 1$. Therefore, the six pairs which consist of diametrically opposed points are invalid, since the line through them passes through the origin. This corrects our count to $66 - 6 = 60$.

In addition, for each of the twelve points, there is a line tangent to the circle at that point, so that the only solution to the system is that one point. This brings the final total to $60 + 12 = \boxed{72}$. The answer is $\boxed{72}$
