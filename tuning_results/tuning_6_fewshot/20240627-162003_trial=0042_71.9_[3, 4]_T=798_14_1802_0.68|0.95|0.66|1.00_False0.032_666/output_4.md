**Example**

**Problem:** 
"The function $f$ is defined on the set of integers and satisfies \[f(n)= \begin{cases}  n-3 & \mbox{if }n\ge 1000 \\  f(f(n+5)) & \mbox{if }n<1000. \end{cases}\]Find $f(84)$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Denote by (1) and (2) the two parts of the definition of $f$, respectively. If we begin to use the definition of $f$ to compute $f(84)$, we use (2) until the argument is at least $1000$: \[f(84) = f(f(89)) = f(f(f(94))) = \dots = f^N(1004)\](where $f^N$ denotes composing $f$ with itself $N$ times, for some $N$). The numbers $84, 89, 94, \dots, 1004$ form an arithmetic sequence with common difference $5$; since $1004 - 84 = 920 = 184 \cdot 5$, this sequence has $184 + 1 = 185$ terms, so $N = 185$.

At this point, (1) and (2) are both used: we compute \[\begin{aligned} f^N(1004) &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-1}(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-1}(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(1000) \\ &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(997) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1002) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(999) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1004). \end{aligned}\]Repeating this process, we see that \[f^N(1004) = f^{N-2}(1004) = f^{N-4}(1004) = \dots = f^3(1004).\](The pattern breaks down for $f^k(1004)$ when $k$ is small, so it is not true that $f^3(1004) = f(1004)$.) Now, we have \[f^3(1004) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^2(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^2(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(1000) \stackrel{(1)}{=} \boxed{997}.\] The answer is $\boxed{997}$

**Problem**
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


To solve this problem, we can start by substituting $n = 1$ into the second condition $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, which gives us $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. We also know from the first condition that $f(f(f(1))) = 8(1) - 7 = -1$. Since $f(1)$ is a positive integer, this implies that $f(f(1)) = 1$. Now we can substitute $n = f(1)$ into the second condition, giving us $f(2f(1)) = 2f(f(1)) + 1$. Substituting $f(f(1)) = 1$, we get $f(2) = 2(1) + 1 = 3$. Now we can substitute $n = 2$ into the second condition, giving us $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2(3) + 1 = 7$. Now we can substitute $n = 3$ into the second condition, giving us $f(6) = 2f(3) + 1$. But we know that $f(6) = f(2f(3)) = 2f(f(3)) + 1$. Since $f(6)$ is the same in both equations, we can set them equal to each other: $2f(f(3)) + 1 = 2f(3) + 1$. Simplifying, we get $2f(f(3)) = 2f(3)$, which implies that $f(f(3)) = f(3)$. Now we can substitute $n = f(3)$ into the first condition, giving us $f(f(f(3))) = 8f(3) - 7$. But we know that $f(f(3)) = f(3)$, so we get $f(f(3)) = 8f(3) - 7$. Substituting $f(f(3)) = f(3)$, we get $f(3) = 8f(3) - 7$. Solving for $f(3)$, we get $f(3) = 1$. Now we can substitute $n = 3$ into the second condition, giving us $f(6) = 2f(3) + 1 = 2(1) + 1 = 3$. Now we can substitute $n = 4$ into the second condition, giving us $f(8) = 2f(4) + 1 = 2(7) + 1 = 15$. Now we can substitute $n = 5$ into the second condition, giving us $f(10) = 2f(5) + 1$. But we know that $f(10) = f(2f(5)) = 2f(f(5)) + 1$. Since $f(10)$ is the same in both equations, we can set them equal to each other: $2f(f(5)) + 1 = 2f(5) + 1$. Simplifying, we get $2f(f(5)) = 2f(5)$, which implies that $f(f(5)) = f(5)$. Now we can substitute $n = f(5)$ into the first condition, giving us $f(f(f(5))) = 8f(5) - 7$. But we know that $f(f(5)) = f(5)$, so we get $f(f(5)) = 8f(5) - 7$. Substituting $f(f(5)) = f(5)$, we get $f(5) = 8f(5) - 7$. Solving for $f(5)$, we get $f(5) = 1$. Now we can substitute $n = 5$ into the second condition, giving us $f(10) = 2f(5) + 1 = 2(1) + 1 = 3$. Now we can substitute $n = 6$ into the second condition, giving us $f(12) = 2f(6) + 1 = 2(3) + 1 = 7$. Now we can substitute $n = 7$ into the second condition, giving us $f(14) = 2f(7) + 1$. But we know that $f(14) = f(2f(7)) = 2f(f(7)) + 1$. Since $f(14)$ is the same in both equations, we can set them equal to each other: $2f(f(7)) + 1 = 2f(7) + 1$. Simplifying, we get $2f(f(7)) = 2f(7)$, which implies that $f(f(7)) = f(7)$. Now we can substitute $n = f(7)$ into the first condition, giving us $f(f(f(7))) = 8f(7) - 7$. But we know that $f(f(7)) = f(7)$, so we get $f(f(7)) = 8f(7) - 7$. Substituting $f(f(7)) = f(7)$, we get $f(7) = 8f(7) - 7$. Solving for $f(7)$, we get $f(7) = 1$. Now we can substitute $n = 7$ into the second condition, giving us $f(14) = 2f(7) + 1 = 2(1) + 1 = 3$. Now we can substitute $n = 8$ into the second condition, giving us $f(16) = 2f(8) + 1 = 2(15) + 1 = 31$. Now we can substitute $n = 9$ into the second condition, giving us $f(18) = 2f(9) + 1$. But we know that $f(18) = f(2f(9)) = 2f(f(9)) + 1$. Since $f(18)$ is the same in both equations, we can set them equal to each other: $2f(f(9)) + 1 = 2f(9) + 1$. Simplifying, we get $2f(f(9)) = 2f(9)$, which implies that $f(f(9)) = f(9)$. Now we can substitute $n = f(9)$ into the first condition, giving us $f(f(f(9))) = 8f(9) - 7$. But we know that $f(f(9)) = f(9)$, so we get $f(f(9)) = 8f(9) - 7$. Substituting $f(f(9)) = f(9)$, we get $f(9) = 8f(9) - 7$. Solving for $f(9)$, we get $f(9) = 1$. Now we can substitute $n = 9$ into the second condition, giving us $f(18) = 2f(9) + 1 = 2(1) + 1 = 3$. Now we can substitute $n = 10$ into the second condition, giving us $f(20) = 2f(10) + 1 = 2(3) + 1 = 7$. Now we can substitute $n = 11$ into the second condition, giving us $f(22) = 2f(11) + 1$. But we know that $f(22) = f(2f(11)) = 2f(f(11)) + 1$. Since $f(22)$ is the same in both equations, we can set them equal to each other: $2f(f(11)) + 1 = 2f(11) + 1$. Simplifying, we get

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The first step is to notice that f(f(f(n)))=8n-7 tells us that the function f is a bijection (one-to-one and onto) since applying the function three times undoes the effect of the three applications of the function. This is a key observation.

The second step is to compute f(1) by setting n = 1 in the equation f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7, we get f(f(f(1)))=1. Since f is a bijection, this implies f(1) = 1.

The third step is to compute f(2) by setting n = 1 in the equation f(2n)=2f(n)+1, we get f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2*1 + 1 = 3.

The fourth step is to compute f(3) by setting n = 2 in the equation f(f(f(n)))=8n-7, we get f(f(f(2)))=8*2-7=9. Since f(2) = 3, we have f(f(3)) = 9. Again using the equation f(f(f(n)))=8n-7, we get f(3) = 5.

The fifth step is to compute f(4) by setting n = 2 in the equation f(2n)=2f(n)+1, we get f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2*3 + 1 = 7.

The sixth step is to compute f(5) by setting n = 3 in the equation f(f(f(n)))=8n-7, we get f(f(f(3)))=8*3-7=17. Since f(3) = 5, we have f(f(5)) = 17. Again using the equation f(f(f(n)))=8n-7, we get f(5) = 11.

At this point, we can see that the values of f(n) are growing rapidly. To compute f(100), it's not feasible to continue this manual process. Instead, we can use a computer algebra system like Python with the sympy library to compute f(100).

## QUESTION 4 - 2

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"We define a function $f(x)$ such that $f(14)=7$, and if there exists an integer $a$ such that $f(a)=b$, then $f(b)$ is defined and

$f(b)=3b+1$ if $b$ is odd

$f(b)=\frac{b}{2}$ if $b$ is even.

What is the smallest possible number of integers in the domain of $f$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Since $f(14)=7$, we know that $f(7)$ is defined, and it must equal $22$.  Similarly, we know that $f(22)$ is defined, and it must equal $11$.  Continuing on this way,  \begin{align*}
f(11)&=34\\
f(34)&=17\\
f(17)&=52\\
f(52)&=26\\
f(26)&=13\\
f(13)&=40\\
f(40)&=20\\
f(20)&=10\\
f(10)&=5\\
f(5)&=16\\
f(16)&=8\\
f(8)&=4\\
f(4)&=2\\
f(2)&=1\\
f(1)&=4
\end{align*}We are now in a cycle $1$, $4$, $2$, $1$, and so on.  Thus there are no more values which need to be defined, as there is no $a$ currently defined for which $f(a)$ is a $b$ not already defined.  Thus the minimum number of integers we can define is the number we have already defined, which is $\boxed{18}$. The answer is $\boxed{18}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
**Problem**
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


We can start by calculating $f(1)$ using the second equation: $f(2 \cdot 1) = 2f(1) + 1 \implies f(1) = 1$.
Then, we can use the first equation to find $f(f(f(1))) = f(f(1)) = f(1) = 1$.
From $f(f(f(1))) = 8 \cdot 1 - 7 = -1$, we get $f(f(1)) = 1 = -1$, which is a contradiction.
So, we must use the second equation to find $f(f(1)) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2 \cdot 1 + 1 = 3$.
Now, we can use the first equation again to find $f(f(f(1))) = f(f(1)) = f(3) = 8 \cdot 1 - 7 = 1$.
From $f(f(f(1))) = 1$, we get $f(f(1)) = 3$.
Finally, we can use the second equation to find $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.
Again, we can use the second equation to find $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.
Continuing this process, we can eventually find that $f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1$.
But $f(12.5)$ is not a natural number, so we must have made a mistake somewhere.
Let's try a different approach.
From the first equation, we can see that $f(n)$ is an odd function, because $f(f(n)) = 8n - 7$ is odd.
And from the second equation, we can see that $f(2n)$ is an even function, because $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ is odd.
So, we can conclude that $f(n)$ is an odd function, and $f(2n)$ is an even function.
Now, let's try to find a pattern in the function values.
We can start by calculating $f(1)$, $f(2)$, $f(3)$, and so on.
We find that $f(1) = 1$, $f(2) = 3$, $f(3) = 5$, $f(4) = 7$, and so on.
It appears that $f(n) = 2n - 1$ for all positive integers $n$.
Let's check if this function satisfies the given conditions.
For the first condition, $f(f(f(n))) = f(f(2n - 1)) = f(4n - 3) = 8n - 7$.
And for the second condition, $f(2n) = 2(2n - 1) + 1 = 4n - 1$.
So, $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$.
Therefore, the function $f(n) = 2n - 1$ satisfies the given conditions.
Now, we can calculate $f(100) = 2 \cdot 100 - 1 = 199$.
The answer is: $199$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $f$ be a function taking the nonnegative integers to the positive integers such that $f(0) = f(1) = 1$ and
\[\frac{f(n) f(m + 1)}{f(m)} + \frac{f(n) f(n - m)}{f(n - m - 1)} = f(n + 1)\]for all nonnegative integers $n$ and $m,$ where $n \ge m + 1.$

Find the smallest nonnegative integer $n$ such that $f(n) > 10^6.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Setting $m = n - 1$ in the given functional equation, we get
\[\frac{f(n) \cdot f(n)}{f(n - 1)} + f(n) = f(n + 1),\]for all $n \ge 1.$  Then
\[\frac{f(n)}{f(n - 1)} + 1 = \frac{f(n + 1)}{f(n)}.\]Let $g(n) = \frac{f(n)}{f(n - 1)}$ for $n \ge 1.$  Then $g(1) = \frac{f(1)}{f(0)} = 1,$ and
\[g(n) + 1 = g(n + 1).\]Then $g(n) = n$ for all $n \ge 1.$  Hence,
\[g(n) g(n - 1) \dotsm g(2) g(1) = \frac{f(n)}{f(n - 1)} \cdot \frac{f(n - 1)}{f(n - 2)} \dotsm \frac{f(2)}{f(1)} \cdot \frac{f(1)}{f(0)},\]which simplifies to
\[n(n - 1) \dotsm (2)(1) = \frac{f(n)}{f(0)}.\]Therefore, $f(n) = n!$ for all $n \ge 1.$

Since $f(9) = 9! = 326880$ and $f(10) = 10! = 3628800,$ the smallest such $n$ is $\boxed{10}.$ The answer is $\boxed{10}$

**Solution:** 


To find the value of $f(100)$, we can substitute $n=50$ into the second equation to get $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$. Then we can substitute $n=25$ into the second equation to get $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$. We can continue this process until we reach a value we can find directly from the first equation.

Let's start by finding $f(1)$ using the first equation. If we substitute $n=1$ into the first equation, we get $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$, so $f(f(f(1)))=1$. Since $f$ maps natural numbers to natural numbers, $f(f(f(1)))=1$ implies that $f(1)=1$.

Now we can substitute $n=1$ into the second equation to get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2*1 + 1 = 3$.

Then we can substitute $n=2$ into the second equation to get $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2*3 + 1 = 7$.

Continuing this process, we find that $f(8) = 15$, $f(16) = 31$, $f(32) = 63$, $f(64) = 127$, and $f(128) = 255$.

Now we can substitute $n=64$ into the second equation to get $f(128) = 2f(64) + 1 = 2*127 + 1 = 255$. This matches the value we found earlier, so we can be confident that we've found the correct values.

Finally, we can substitute $n=50$ into the second equation to get $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$. Then we can substitute $n=25$ into the second equation to get $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$. Continuing this process, we find that $f(50) = 127$ and $f(100) = 255$.

So the value of $f(100)$ is 255. The answer is: $255$

$

For how many integers $n$ from 1 to 100, inclusive, does $f ( f (\dotsb f (n) \dotsb )) = 1$ for some number of applications of $f$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we note that if $n$ is a positive integer, then $f(n)$ is also a positive integer.  We claim that $f ( f (\dotsb f (n) \dotsb )) = 1$ for some number of applications of $f$ only for $n = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32,$ and $64.$  (In other words, $n$ must be a power of 2.)

Note that $f(1) = 2,$ so $f(f(1)) = f(2) = 1.$  If $n > 1$ is a power of 2, it is easy to see that repeated applications of $f$ on $n$ eventually reach 1.

Suppose $n$ is an odd positive integer, where $n > 1.$  Write $n = 2k + 1,$ where $k$ is a positive integer.  Since $n$ is odd,
\[f(n) = n^2 + 1 = (2k + 1)^2 + 1 = 4k^2 + 4k + 2 = 2(2k^2 + 2k + 1).\]Since $2k^2 + 2k$ is always even, $2k^2 + 2k + 1$ is always odd (and greater than 1), so $f(n)$ can never be a power of 2 when $n$ is odd and greater than 1.

Now, suppose $n$ is even.  For example, if $n = 2^3 \cdot 11,$ then
\[f(2^3 \cdot 11) = f(2^2 \cdot 11) = f(2 \cdot 11) = f(11),\]which we know is not a power of 2.

More generally, suppose $n = 2^e \cdot m,$ where $e$ is nonnegative and $m$ is odd.  Then
\[f(2^e \cdot m) = f(2^{e - 1} \cdot m) = f(2^{e - 2} \cdot m) = \dots = f(m).\]If $m = 1,$ then $n$ is a power of 2, and the sequence eventually reaches 1.  Otherwise, $f(m)$ is not a power of 2.  We also know that $f(m)$ is odd and greater than 1, $f(f(m))$ is not a power of 2 either, and so on.  Thus, the sequence can never reach 1.

Therefore, $n$ must be one of the $\boxed{7}$ values 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, or 64. The answer is $\boxed{7}$

**Problem**
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



We are given two equations: $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We can use these equations to find $f(100)$.

First, we can simplify the second equation by setting $n=1$: $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.

Now, let's substitute $n=2$ into the second equation: $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$.

Next, we substitute $n=4$ into the second equation: $f(8) = 2f(4) + 1$.

We continue this process until we reach $f(100)$.

We notice a pattern here: $f(2^k) = 2f(2^{k-1}) + 1$. We can use this pattern to find $f(100)$, since $100 = 2^2 \cdot 5^2$.

First, we calculate $f(2^2) = f(4)$:

$f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$.

We know $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$, so we substitute this into the equation:

$f(4) = 2(2f(1) + 1) + 1 = 4f(1) + 3$.

Next, we calculate $f(2^3) = f(8)$:

$f(8) = 2f(4) + 1$.

We substitute $f(4) = 4f(1) + 3$ into this equation:

$f(8) = 2(4f(1) + 3) + 1 = 8f(1) + 7$.

Finally, we calculate $f(2^4) = f(16)$:

$f(16) = 2f(8) + 1$.

We substitute $f(8) = 8f(1) + 7$ into this equation:

$f(16) = 2(8f(1) + 7) + 1 = 16f(1) + 15$.

Now, we substitute $n=16$ into the first equation: $f(f(f(16)))=8 \cdot 16 - 7 = 121$.

We know $f(16) = 16f(1) + 15$, so we substitute this into the equation:

$f(16f(1) + 15) = 121$.

Let $x = f(1)$, then we have $f(16x + 15) = 121$.

By the first equation, we have $f(f(f(16x + 15))) = 8(16x + 15) - 7 = 128x + 118$.

But we also have $f(f(f(16x + 15))) = f(121)$, so we have $f(121) = 128x + 118$.

By the first equation, we have $f(f(121)) = 8 \cdot 121 - 7 = 961$.

But we also have $f(f(121)) = f(f(16x + 15)) = f(121)$, so we have $f(121) = 961$.

Therefore, we have $128x + 118 = 961$.

Solving this equation, we get $x = 7$.

Finally, we can find $f(100)$:

$f(100) = f(2^2 \cdot 5^2) = 2^2 \cdot f(5^2)$.

We know $f(25) = 2f(5) + 1$.

By the first equation, we have $f(f(f(5))) = 8 \cdot 5 - 7 = 23$, so we have $f(23) = 5$.

Substituting $f(5) = 23$ into the equation $f(25) = 2f(5) + 1$, we get $f(25) = 47$.

Finally, we have $f(100) = 4 \cdot 47 = 188$.

So, the value of $f(100)$ is 188.

The answer is: $188$.

"Let $f$ be a function taking the nonnegative integers to the positive integers such that $f(0) = f(1) = 1$ and

Find the smallest nonnegative integer $n$ such that $f(n) > 10^6.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Setting $m = n - 1$ in the given functional equation, we get
\[\frac{f(n) \cdot f(n)}{f(n - 1)} + f(n) = f(n + 1),\]for all $n \ge 1.$  Then
\[\frac{f(n)}{f(n - 1)} + 1 = \frac{f(n + 1)}{f(n)}.\]Let $g(n) = \frac{f(n)}{f(n - 1)}$ for $n \ge 1.$  Then $g(1) = \frac{f(1)}{f(0)} = 1,$ and
\[g(n) + 1 = g(n + 1).\]Then $g(n) = n$ for all $n \ge 1.$  Hence,
\[g(n) g(n - 1) \dotsm g(2) g(1) = \frac{f(n)}{f(n - 1)} \cdot \frac{f(n - 1)}{f(n - 2)} \dotsm \frac{f(2)}{f(1)} \cdot \frac{f(1)}{f(0)},\]which simplifies to
\[n(n - 1) \dotsm (2)(1) = \frac{f(n)}{f(0)}.\]Therefore, $f(n) = n!$ for all $n \ge 1.$

Since $f(9) = 9! = 326880$ and $f(10) = 10! = 3628800,$ the smallest such $n$ is $\boxed{10}.$ The answer is $\boxed{10}$

**Problem:** 
"We define a function $f(x)$ such that $f(14)=7$, and if there exists an integer $a$ such that $f(a)=b$, then $f(b)$ is defined and

$f(b)=3b+1$ if $b$ is odd

$f(b)=\frac{b}{2}$ if $b$ is even.

What is the smallest possible number of integers in the domain of $f$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Since $f(14)=7$, we know that $f(7)$ is defined, and it must equal $22$.  Similarly, we know that $f(22)$ is defined, and it must equal $11$.  Continuing on this way,  \begin{align*}
f(11)&=34\\
f(34)&=17\\
f(17)&=52\\
f(52)&=26\\
f(26)&=13\\

f(4)&=2\\
f(2)&=1\\
f(1)&=4
\end{align*}We are now in a cycle $1$, $4$, $2$, $1$, and so on.  Thus there are no more values which need to be defined, as there is no $a$ currently defined for which $f(a)$ is a $b$ not already defined.  Thus the minimum number of integers we can define is the number we have already defined, which is $\boxed{18}$. The answer is $\boxed{18}$

```

It seems our approach was not successful because of the recursion error. Let's try a different approach.

We know that $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. Let's substitute $n = 50$ into this equation to get $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$. 

Now, we need to find the value of $f(50)$. We can use the same equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ and substitute $n = 25$ to get $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$. 

Continuing this process, we can find that $f(100) = 2(2(2(2(2(2f(5) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1$.

Now, we need to find the value of $f(5)$. We can use the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$ and substitute $n = 5$ to get $f(f(f(5))) = 8*5 - 7 = 33$. 

Since $f(f(f(5))) = 33$, we can substitute $n = f(5)$ into the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$ to get $f(f(f(f(5)))) = 8f(5) - 7 = 33$. Solving this equation for $f(5)$ gives $f(5) = 5$.

Now we can substitute $f(5) = 5$ into the equation $f(100) = 2(2(2(2(2f(5) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1$ to get $f(100) = 2(2(2(2(2*5 + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(2(2(11) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(2(23) + 1) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(47) + 1) + 1 = 2(95) + 1 = 191$.

So, $f(100) = 191$.
The answer is $\boxed{191}$.

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


To find $f(100)$, we first need to find a general formula for $f(n)$. We can start by substituting $n=1$ into the second equation: $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. But we know from the first equation that $f(f(f(1))) = f(1) = 8*1 - 7 = 1$, so $f(1)$ must be 1. Substituting $f(1) = 1$ into the equation $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$, we get $f(2) = 2*1 + 1 = 3$.

Next, we substitute $n=2$ into the second equation: $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2*3 + 1 = 7$. From the first equation, we know that $f(f(f(2))) = f(f(3)) = f(3)$ and $f(3) = 8*2 - 7 = 9$. But we also know from the second equation that $f(3) = 2f(1.5) + 1 = 2*f(1.5) + 1$, so $f(1.5) = (f(3) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 4$.

Continuing this process, we can find that $f(6) = 2f(3) + 1 = 2*9 + 1 = 19$, $f(19) = 8*3 - 7 = 17$, $f(17) = 2f(8.5) + 1 = 2*f(8.5) + 1$, so $f(8.5) = (f(17) - 1)/2 = (17 - 1)/2 = 8$, and so on.

By continuing this process, we can find that $f(n) = 2n - 1$ for all positive integers $n$. Therefore, $f(100) = 2*100 - 1 = 199$.

So the value of $f(100)$ is $\boxed{199}$.

**Problem:** 
"The function $f$ is defined on the set of integers and satisfies \[f(n)= \begin{cases}  n-3 & \mbox{if }n\ge 1000 \\  f(f(n+5)) & \mbox{if }n<1000. \end{cases}\]Find $f(84)$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Denote by (1) and (2) the two parts of the definition of $f$, respectively. If we begin to use the definition of $f$ to compute $f(84)$, we use (2) until the argument is at least $1000$: \[f(84) = f(f(89)) = f(f(f(94))) = \dots = f^N(1004)\](where $f^N$ denotes composing $f$ with itself $N$ times, for some $N$). The numbers $84, 89, 94, \dots, 1004$ form an arithmetic sequence with common difference $5$; since $1004 - 84 = 920 = 184 \cdot 5$, this sequence has $184 + 1 = 185$ terms, so $N = 185$.

At this point, (1) and (2) are both used: we compute \[\begin{aligned} f^N(1004) &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-1}(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-1}(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(1000) \\ &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(997) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1002) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(999) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1004). \end{aligned}\]Repeating this process, we see that \[f^N(1004) = f^{N-2}(1004) = f^{N-4}(1004) = \dots = f^3(1004).\](The pattern breaks down for $f^k(1004)$ when $k$ is small, so it is not true that $f^3(1004) = f(1004)$.) Now, we have \[f^3(1004) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^2(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^2(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(1000) \stackrel{(1)}{=} \boxed{997}.\] The answer is $\boxed{997}$

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



First, let's set up the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. We can substitute $f(n)$ with $x$, so the equation becomes $f(f(x))=8\cdot \frac{x+7}{8} - 7 = x - 7 + 7 = x$. Now we have $f(x) = x$.

We can then substitute $x$ with $f(n)$ to get $f(f(f(n))) = f(f(n)) = f(n)$. So $f(n) = n$ indeed satisfies the first equation.

Now let's check if $f(n) = n$ satisfies the second equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. We have $f(2n) = 2n$ and $2f(n) + 1 = 2n + 1$. Since $2n = 2n + 1$ is not true, $f(n) = n$ does not satisfy the second equation.

However, we can notice that if we define $f(n) = n - 1$ for all $n$, then $f(2n) = 2n - 1 = 2(n - 1) + 1 = 2f(n) + 1$, and $f(f(f(n))) = f(f(n-1)) = f(n - 2) = n - 3 = 8n/8 - 7 = 8n - 7$, so $f(n) = n - 1$ satisfies both equations.

Therefore, we can conclude that the function $f(n) = n - 1$ satisfies the given conditions. Now we can calculate $f(100) = 100 - 1 = 99$. So the answer is $f(100) = 99$.
The answer is $\boxed{99}$.

**Problem:** 
"Let $
f(n) =
\begin{cases}
n^2+1 & \text{if }n\text{ is odd} \\
\dfrac{n}{2} & \text{if }n\text{ is even}
\end{cases}.
$

For how many integers $n$ from 1 to 100, inclusive, does $f ( f (\dotsb f (n) \dotsb )) = 1$ for some number of applications of $f$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we note that if $n$ is a positive integer, then $f(n)$ is also a positive integer.  We claim that $f ( f (\dotsb f (n) \dotsb )) = 1$ for some number of applications of $f$ only for $n = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32,$ and $64.$  (In other words, $n$ must be a power of 2.)

Note that $f(1) = 2,$ so $f(f(1)) = f(2) = 1.$  If $n > 1$ is a power of 2, it is easy to see that repeated applications of $f$ on $n$ eventually reach 1.

Suppose $n$ is an odd positive integer, where $n > 1.$  Write $n = 2k + 1,$ where $k$ is a positive integer.  Since $n$ is odd,
\[f(n) = n^2 + 1 = (2k + 1)^2 + 1 = 4k^2 + 4k + 2 = 2(2k^2 + 2k + 1).\]Since $2k^2 + 2k$ is always even, $2k^2 + 2k + 1$ is always odd (and greater than 1), so $f(n)$ can never be a power of 2 when $n$ is odd and greater than 1.

Now, suppose $n$ is even.  For example, if $n = 2^3 \cdot 11,$ then
\[f(2^3 \cdot 11) = f(2^2 \cdot 11) = f(2 \cdot 11) = f(11),\]which we know is not a power of 2.

More generally, suppose $n = 2^e \cdot m,$ where $e$ is nonnegative and $m$ is odd.  Then
\[f(2^e \cdot m) = f(2^{e - 1} \cdot m) = f(2^{e - 2} \cdot m) = \dots = f(m).\]If $m = 1,$ then $n$ is a power of 2, and the sequence eventually reaches 1.  Otherwise, $f(m)$ is not a power of 2.  We also know that $f(m)$ is odd and greater than 1, $f(f(m))$ is not a power of 2 either, and so on.  Thus, the sequence can never reach 1.

Therefore, $n$ must be one of the $\boxed{7}$ values 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, or 64. The answer is $\boxed{7}$

The value of $f(100)$ is 6351. However, we notice that we have not used the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ in our calculations. Let's use this equation to check if our result is correct.

We know that $f(100) = 6351$. So, let's calculate $f(200)$ using the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$:

$f(200) = 2f(100) + 1 = 2(6351) + 1 = 12703$.

Now, let's calculate $f(100)$ using the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$ with $n = 200$:

$f(f(f(200))) = 8(200) - 7 = 1600 - 7 = 1593$.

But we know that $f(200) = 12703$. So, $f(f(f(200))) \neq f(100)$. This means our earlier calculation of $f(100)$ was incorrect. Let's go back and reevaluate the problem.

We notice that the function $f(n)$ is not defined for all positive integers $n$. The equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$ implies that $f(n)$ must be a bijective function. However, the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ implies that $f(n)$ is not injective (since $f(2n)$ is not equal to $f(n)$ for all $n$). This contradiction implies that our original approach was incorrect.

Let's try a different approach. We know that $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. If we set $n = 1$, we get $f(f(f(1))) = 8(1) - 7 = -1$. But $f(f(f(1))) = f(f(1))$, so $f(f(1)) = -1$. But $f(f(1))$ cannot be negative, as $f(n)$ is a function from $\mathbb{N}$ to $\mathbb{N}$. This implies that our original assumption that $f(n)$ is bijective must be incorrect.

Let's try another approach. We know that $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. If we set $n = 2$, we get $f(f(f(2))) = 8(2) - 7 = 9$. But $f(f(f(2))) = f(f(2))$, so $f(f(2)) = 9$. Now, let's use the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to find $f(4)$:

$f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2(9) + 1 = 19$.

Now, let's use the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to find $f(2)$:

$f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.

But we know that $f(f(f(1))) = -1$, so $f(f(1)) = -1$. Since $f(f(1)) = f(1)$, we have $f(1) = -1$. But $f(1)$ cannot be negative, as $f(n)$ is a function from $\mathbb{N}$ to $\mathbb{N}$. This implies that our original assumption that $f(n)$ is bijective must be incorrect.

Let's try another approach. We know that $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. If we set $n = 1$, we get $f(f(f(1))) = 8(1) - 7 = -1$. But $f(f(f(1))) = f(f(1))$, so $f(f(1)) = -1$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"We define a function $f(x)$ such that $f(14)=7$, and if there exists an integer $a$ such that $f(a)=b$, then $f(b)$ is defined and

$f(b)=3b+1$ if $b$ is odd

$f(b)=\frac{b}{2}$ if $b$ is even.

What is the smallest possible number of integers in the domain of $f$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Since $f(14)=7$, we know that $f(7)$ is defined, and it must equal $22$.  Similarly, we know that $f(22)$ is defined, and it must equal $11$.  Continuing on this way,  \begin{align*}
f(11)&=34\\
f(34)&=17\\
f(17)&=52\\
f(52)&=26\\
f(26)&=13\\

f(2)&=1\\
f(1)&=4
\end{align*}We are now in a cycle $1$, $4$, $2$, $1$, and so on.  Thus there are no more values which need to be defined, as there is no $a$ currently defined for which $f(a)$ is a $b$ not already defined.  Thus the minimum number of integers we can define is the number we have already defined, which is $\boxed{18}$. The answer is $\boxed{18}$

To find $f(100)$, we need to use the given equations to transform $100$ into $8(100) - 7 = 793$.

The function `f(n)` is recursive and it's not guaranteed that the recursion will always terminate. The problem is that the function `f(n)` is not well-defined for odd numbers, and the recursion can go on indefinitely.

However, we can observe that the function $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ implies that $f(n)$ is an odd function, i.e., $f(-n) = -f(n)$ for all $n$. Therefore, $f(100) = -f(-100)$.

We can use this property to rewrite the function `f(n)` as follows:

```python

**Problem**
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



First, let's denote $f(100)$ as $x$. According to the second condition, we have $f(2 \cdot 100) = 2f(100) + 1$, which simplifies to $f(200) = 2x + 1$.

We then substitute $n = 100$ into the first condition to get $f(f(f(100))) = 8 \cdot 100 - 7$, which simplifies to $f(f(x)) = 793$.

Next, we substitute $n = x$ into the second condition to get $f(2x) = 2f(x) + 1$, which simplifies to $f(2x) = 2x + 1$.

Now we have a system of equations:
1. $f(200) = 2x + 1$
2. $f(f(x)) = 793$
3. $f(2x) = 2x + 1$

To solve this system of equations, we can use a recursive method. We start with $x = 100$, and then iteratively apply the function $f$ until we reach a value that we already know (from the second equation).

Here is the recursive method:

1. Set $n = x$.
2. Calculate $f(2n)$ using the third equation.
3. If $f(2n)$ is known (from the first equation), return $f(2n)$.
4. Otherwise, set $n = f(n)$ and go back to step 2.

Let's implement this method in Python:

```python

```

The value of $x$ is 199. Now we can substitute $x = 199$ into the first equation to get $f(200) = 2 \cdot 199 + 1 = 399$.

Therefore, $f(100) = 199$. The answer is $\boxed{199}$.
