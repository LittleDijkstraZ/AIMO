**Problem:** 
"Let $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_ 2= (-16,2).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that
\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as
\[\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1.\]Find $h + k + a + b.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.

The first term is zero when $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two lines in the plane, so they enclose a rectangle with side lengths 20.

The second term is zero when $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. This implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two lines in the plane, so they enclose a square with side length 16.

The intersection of these two rectangles is a square with side length 8. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of the square, which is $8^2 = 64$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 64.

"Let $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_ 2= (-16,2).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that
\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.

The first expression is zero when either $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x-y| - 10 = 0$. This gives us the lines $x+y = 10$, $x+y = -10$, $x-y = 10$, and $x-y = -10$.

The second expression is zero when either $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$. This gives us the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$. The length of the rectangle is $16$ and the width is $16$, so the area of the rectangle is $16 \times 16 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

```python

    # The length and width of the rectangle
    length = 16
    width = 16

    # Calculate the area of the rectangle
    area = length * width

    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.

The first term is zero when $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. These equations simplify to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle.

The second term is zero when $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. These equations simplify to $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines also form a rectangle.

The intersection of the two rectangles is a square with side length 10 (the distance between the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$). Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of the square, which is $10^2 = 100$.

The answer is: $100$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



This problem involves understanding the properties of absolute values and how they interact with equations and inequalities. The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero, which means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. We will analyze each case separately.

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. This expression is zero if and only if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these absolute value equations are the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle.

The second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. This expression is zero if and only if both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these absolute value equations are the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square.

The intersection of the rectangle and the square is the convex polygon that encloses the points that satisfy the original equation. The area of this polygon is the area of the rectangle, which is $20 \times 20 = 400$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 400. The answer is: $400$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Find the number of 10-tuples $(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{10})$ of real numbers such that
\[(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2 = \frac{1}{11}.\]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,
\begin{align*}
&[(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + \dots + 1^2 + 1^2)][(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2] \\
&\ge [(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + (x_2 - x_3) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10}]^2 = 1.
\end{align*}From the given condition, we have equality, so by the equality condition for Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[\frac{1 - x_1}{1} = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{1} = \frac{x_2 - x_3}{1} = \dots = \frac{x_9 - x_{10}}{1} = \frac{x_{10}}{1}.\]Let
\[d = 1 - x_1 = x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_3 = \dots = x_9 - x_{10} = x_{10}.\]Then
\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so
\[(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_{10}) = \left( \frac{10}{11}, \frac{9}{11}, \frac{8}{11}, \dots, \frac{1}{11} \right).\]In particular, there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we first need to understand that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if either of the following two conditions is met:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first condition to be true, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the four lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

For the second condition to be true, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations, we get the four lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The points that satisfy either of these conditions form a square with side length 20. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 400.

```
The above error occurred because the equation is too complex for Sympy to solve directly. However, we can solve this problem by geometric intuition. The points that satisfy either of the two conditions form a square with side length 20. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 400. The answer is: $400$

\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so
\[(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_{10}) = \left( \frac{10}{11}, \frac{9}{11}, \frac{8}{11}, \dots, \frac{1}{11} \right).\]In particular, there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. 

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. This expression is zero if and only if both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these equations are all points $(x, y)$ such that the distance between $(x, y)$ and the origin is 10. This is the equation of a circle centered at the origin with radius 10.

The second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. This expression is zero if and only if both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are all points $(x, y)$ such that the distance between $(x, y)$ and the origin is 8. This is the equation of a circle centered at the origin with radius 8.

The intersection of these two circles is a square with side length 16 (since the difference in the radii of the two circles is 2, and the side length of the square is twice this difference). The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_ 2= (-16,2).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that
\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as
\[\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1.\]Find $h + k + a + b.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Abs, Piecewise, simplify

def area_of_polygon():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # Define the equation
    equation = (((Abs(x + y) - 10)**2 + (Abs(x - y) - 10)**2)) * ((Abs(x) - 8)**2 + (Abs(y) - 8)**2)

    # The equation equals zero if and only if either of the two factors equals zero
    # Each factor is a product of two absolute value expressions minus a constant squared
    # Each of these expressions equals zero if and only if the absolute value of the argument equals the constant
    # Thus, the equation equals zero if and only if the absolute value of the sum or difference of x and y equals 10, or the absolute value of x or y equals 8
    # This describes a square with side length 20 centered at the origin, and a square with side length 16 centered at the origin
    # The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon described by the equation

    # The side length of the square is the diameter of the circle defined by the equation,
    # which is twice the distance from the origin to the nearest vertex of the square
    # For the square with side length 20, this distance is 10
    # For the square with side length 16, this distance is 8
    # Thus, the side length of the convex polygon is the minimum of these two distances, which is 8

    # The area of a square is the side length squared, so the area of the convex polygon is 8^2 = 64

    return 64

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
