**Problem:** 
"How many distinct solutions are there to the equation $|x-7| = |x+1|$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
If $|x-7| = |x+1|$, then either $x-7 = x+1$ or $x-7 = -(x+1)$.  Simplifying $x-7=x+1$ gives $0=8$, which has no solutions, so no values of $x$ satisfy $x-7 = x+1$.  If $x-7 = -(x+1)$, then $x-7 = -x-1$, so $2x = 6$, which gives $x=3$.  So, there is $\boxed{1}$ solution.

Challenge: See if you can find a quick solution to this problem by simply thinking about the graphs of $y=|x-7|$ and $y=|x+1|$. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

To solve this problem, we can analyze the equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$.

The expression $| |x-1|-2|$ represents the distance between $x$ and $1$, minus $2$. This is a quantity that is always non-negative, and it is equal to $\frac{m}{100}$ for some positive integer $m$.

The expression $|x-1|-2$ can take on the values $\frac{m}{100}$ and $-\frac{m}{100}$. This gives us the two equations:

1. $|x-1|-2 = \frac{m}{100}$
2. $|x-1|-2 = -\frac{m}{100}$

We can solve these two equations separately.

For equation 1, we have:
$|x-1| = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which gives two sub-equations:
1.1. $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, or
1.2. $x-1 = -2 - \frac{m}{100}$.

For equation 2, we have:
$|x-1| = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which gives two sub-equations:
2.1. $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, or
2.2. $x-1 = -2 + \frac{m}{100}$.

We can solve these sub-equations to find the values of $x$ that satisfy each equation. For each value of $x$, we count the number of distinct solutions.

The final step is to count the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions.

The output indicates that there are no positive integers $m$ for which the equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. However, it seems we have made a mistake in our calculation. Let's review the steps and the equations again.

The equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ can be rewritten as:

1. $|x-1| = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ or
2. $|x-1| = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.

For the first equation, we have two sub-equations:
1.1. $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, or
1.2. $x-1 = -(2 + \frac{m}{100})$.

And for the second equation, we have two sub-equations:
2.1. $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, or
2.2. $x-1 = -(2 - \frac{m}{100})$.

Now let's solve these sub-equations:

1.1. $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$,
1.2. $x = - \frac{m}{100}$,
2.1. $x = 1 - \frac{m}{100}$,
2.2. $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

The four solutions are distinct for $m = 100$, which gives us the desired 4 distinct solutions.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 1.
The answer is: $1$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let \[f(x) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
-x + 3 & \text{if } x \le 0, \\
2x - 5 & \text{if } x > 0.
\end{array}
\right.\]How many solutions does the equation $f(f(x)) = 4$ have?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
To solve the equation $f(f(x)) = 4,$ we first find the values $x$ such that $f(x) = 4.$

Either $f(x) = -x + 3$ (for $x \le 0$) or $f(x) = 2x - 5$ (for $x > 0$). If $-x + 3 = 4,$ then $x = -1.$ Note that this value satisfies $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = 4,$ then $x = 9/2.$ Note that this value satisfies $x > 0.$ Therefore, the solutions to $f(x) = 4$ are $x = -1$ and $x = 9/2.$

Next, we solve for the values $x$ such that $f(x) = -1.$ If $-x + 3 = -1,$ then $x = 4.$ This value does not satisfy $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = -1,$ then $x = 2.$ This value satisfies $x > 0.$

Finally, we solve for the values $x$ such that $f(x) = 9/2.$ If $-x + 3 = 9/2,$ then $x = -3/2.$ This value satisfies $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = 9/2,$ then $x = 19/4.$ This value satisfies $x > 0.$

Therefore, the equation $f(f(x)) = 4$ has the solutions $x = 2,$ $-3/2,$ and $19/4,$ for a total of $\boxed{3}$ solutions. The answer is $\boxed{3}$

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


This problem is not suitable for direct programming solution as it requires a deep understanding of the absolute value function and its properties, and how these properties impact the number of solutions to an equation.

However, the analysis of the problem reveals that for the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] to have $4$ distinct solutions, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal to $2$. This is because the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=c$ has $4$ distinct solutions when $c=2$. Therefore, $m=200$.

So, the number of positive integer solutions for $m$ is $1$. The answer is: $1$

**Solution:** 


This problem involves the absolute value function, which can be tricky to solve algebraically. However, we can solve it by considering the possible cases for the absolute value function.

1. If $m=0$, the equation simplifies to $| |x-1|-2|=0$, which implies $|x-1|=2$. This gives two solutions $x=3$ and $x=-1$. So, $m=0$ is not a valid solution.

2. If $m>0$, the equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if the right-hand side $\frac{m}{100}$ is between 0 and 2. This means $0<\frac{m}{100}<2$, which implies $0<m<200$.

So, the positive integer values of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions are those integers from 1 to 199. The number of such integers is $199$. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{199}$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"For certain ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ of real numbers, the system of equations
\[\begin{aligned} ax+by&=1 \\ x^2 + y^2 &= 50  \end{aligned}\]has at least one solution, and each solution is an ordered pair $(x,y)\,$ of integers. How many such ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ are there?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The graph of $ax+by=1$ is a line, while the graph of $x^2+y^2=50$ is a circle centered at the origin. Therefore, $(a, b)$ satisfies the conditions if and only if the line and circle intersect at least once, and they intersect only at lattice points (points with integer coordinates).

Knowing this, it makes sense to look for lattice points on the circle whose equation is $x^2+y^2=50$. Testing cases, we find that there are twelve lattice points on the circle: $(\pm 1, \pm 7)$, $(\pm 7, \pm 1)$, and $(\pm 5, \pm 5)$ (where the two $\pm$ signs in each pair are independent of each other).

There are $\tbinom{12}{2} = 66$ pairs of these points, and each pair determines a line. However, the graph of $ax+by=1$ can never pass through the origin $(0, 0)$, since if $x=y=0$, then $ax+by=0 \neq 1$. Therefore, the six pairs which consist of diametrically opposed points are invalid, since the line through them passes through the origin. This corrects our count to $66 - 6 = 60$.

In addition, for each of the twelve points, there is a line tangent to the circle at that point, so that the only solution to the system is that one point. This brings the final total to $60 + 12 = \boxed{72}$. The answer is $\boxed{72}$

**Solution:** 


We want to find the values of $m$ for which the equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions. 

First, let's analyze the equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$. The expression $|x-1|-2$ represents the distance between $x$ and $1$, minus $2$. This means that $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ is the equation of a curve that consists of two "steps" of size $\frac{m}{100}$, centered at $x=1$, with the "base" of the steps being $2$ units away from $1$. 

The curve will have four distinct solutions when the "steps" intersect the $x$-axis at exactly four points. This happens when the height of the "steps" (i.e., $\frac{m}{100}$) is between $0$ and $2$. Therefore, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, or equivalently, $0 < m < 200$. The number of such positive integers is $199$. 

However, we also need to consider the case where the "steps" touch the $x$-axis at exactly one point. This happens when the height of the "steps" is exactly $0$ or exactly $2$. The height of the "steps" is $0$ when $m=0$, and the height of the "steps" is $2$ when $m=200$. But we are looking for positive integers $m$, so we only consider $m=200$. 

Therefore, the total number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is $199 + 1 = 200$.

So, the value of the unknown variable $m$ is $200$.
The answer is $\boxed{200}$.

**Solution:**



We need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has $4$ distinct solutions.

The number of distinct solutions of the equation is related to the value of $\frac{m}{100}$. If $\frac{m}{100}$ is less than $2$, there are no solutions. If it is equal to $2$, there is one solution. If it is between $2$ and $4$, there are two solutions. If it is equal to $4$, there are three solutions. If it is greater than $4$, there are four solutions.

Therefore, for the equation to have four distinct solutions, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal to $4$. Solving for $m$ gives $m = 400$.

"How many integers are solutions to the equation $$(x-2)^{(25-x^2)}=1?$$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
We need some basic facts from number theory: $a^0 = 1$ for any $a,$ $1^b = 1$ for any $b,$ and $(-1)^c = 1$ if $c$ is an even integer. Unless the base is a complex number (which is excluded since we are looking for integer solutions), there are no other ways to get an RHS of $1.$ Thus, either the exponent is zero $($giving the equation $25 - x^2 = 0),$ the base is $1$ $($giving $x -2 = 1),$ or the base is $-1$ and the exponent is even $($giving the simultaneous equations $x - 2 = -1$ and $25 - x^2 = 2n$ for some integer $n).$ Solving the first equation gives $x = \pm 5,$ and solving the second gives $x = 3.$ The third equation implies that $x = 1,$ in which case $25 - x^2 = 24$ is indeed even, so $x = 1$ is a valid solution. In all, there are $\boxed{4}$ integer solutions. The answer is $\boxed{4}$

**Solution:**


To solve this problem, we need to analyze the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] and find for how many values of $m$ it has $4$ distinct solutions.

The expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ represents a function that has "V" shaped graph with three "knees" at $x= -1, 1, 3$. The value of the function at these points is $3, 1, 1$ respectively. Thus, the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must lie in the interval $(0, 1]$ for the function to have $4$ distinct solutions. This implies $0 < \frac{m}{100} \leq 1$ or equivalently $0 < m \leq 100$. 

Therefore, the positive integer values of $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions are $1, 2, 3, ..., 100$. The number of such values is $100$.

So, the answer is $\boxed{100}$.

**Solution:** 


This problem involves understanding the absolute value function and how it behaves. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can have at most 4 solutions because of the double absolute value. We need to find the value of $m$ for which this equation has exactly 4 solutions.

One way to approach this problem is to consider the possible cases for the double absolute value. The expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ can be equal to zero, one, two, or three in the following ways:

1. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 0$, then $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$. This gives us two solutions: $x = 3$ and $x = -1$.
2. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 1$, then $\vert x-1 \vert = 3$. This gives us two more solutions: $x = 4$ and $x = -2$.
3. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 2$, then $\vert x-1 \vert = 4$. This gives us two more solutions: $x = 5$ and $x = -3$.
4. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 3$, then $\vert x-1 \vert = 5$. This gives us the last two solutions: $x = 6$ and $x = -4$.

Therefore, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly 4 solutions when $\frac{m}{100} = 1$. Solving for $m$ gives $m = 100$.

So, the value of $m$ for which the equation has exactly 4 solutions is $100$. The answer is: $100$
