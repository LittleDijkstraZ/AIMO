**Problem:** 
"Let $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_ 2= (-16,2).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that
\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as
\[\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1.\]Find $h + k + a + b.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we can use the fact that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if either of the following two conditions is true:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first condition to be true, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These conditions define a square with side length 10, centered at the origin.

For the second condition to be true, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These conditions define a square with side length 16, centered at the origin.

The intersection of these two squares is a smaller square with side length 8, centered at the origin. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of the larger square minus the area of the smaller square. The area of a square with side length $s$ is $s^2$, so the area of the larger square is $10^2 = 100$, and the area of the smaller square is $8^2 = 64$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $100 - 64 = 36$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 36. The answer is: $36$

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We are given a math problem and we need to solve it.
2. The problem is to find the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points that satisfy the equation.
3. The equation is $ ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
4. The equation equals to zero if either of the two factors equals to zero.
5. Each factor is a product of two squares, so if a square equals to zero, then the square itself must be zero.
6. For the first factor, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, and similarly for the second factor $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
7. Solving these absolute value equations gives us the vertices of the polygon.
8. The vertices form a square with side length 16 (since $\vert x \vert = 8$ implies $-8 \leq x \leq 8$).
9. The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of the polygon is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The given equation is a product of two terms, which means that either of the terms must be zero for the equation to hold. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the square as $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0)$.

For the second case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the square as $(8, 0), (-8, 0), (0, 8), (0, -8)$.

The intersection of these two squares forms a smaller square with side length 6 (obtained by subtracting the smaller side of the smaller square from the larger side of the larger square). The area of this square is $6^2 = 36$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 36 square units.

The answer is: $36$

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero, which means either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. Let's analyze these two cases separately.

1. If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length 10.

2. If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length 16.

The area of the convex polygon formed by the intersection of these two squares is the area of the smaller square, which has side length 10. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is $\boxed{100}$.

**Solution:** 



The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ are the solutions to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of a square with side length 20. The vertices are $(10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, $(-10, 0)$, and $(0, -10)$.

The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us a square with side length 16. The vertices are $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The intersection of these two squares is a smaller square with side length 8. The vertices are $(4, 4)$, $(4, -4)$, $(-4, 4)$, and $(-4, -4)$.

The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side. Therefore, the area of the smaller square is $8^2 = 64$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 64.

The answer is: $64$

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we first need to understand that the expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ will be true only when both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. Solving these absolute value equations gives us $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$, and $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$. These equations represent four lines in the coordinate plane.

Similarly, the expression $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ will be true only when both $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $x = 8$ or $x = -8$, and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. These equations represent four lines in the coordinate plane.

The intersection of these four sets of lines forms a square with side length 10 (since the maximum value of $x + y$ or $x - y$ is 10 when $|x|$ or $|y|$ is 8). The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 100.
The answer is: $100$
