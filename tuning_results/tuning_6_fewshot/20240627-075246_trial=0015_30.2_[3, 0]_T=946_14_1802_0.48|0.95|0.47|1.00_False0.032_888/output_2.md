**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many solutions does the equation \[\frac{(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)\dotsm(x-100)}{(x-1^2)(x-2^2)(x-3^2)\dotsm(x-100^2)} = 0\]have for $x$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Any solution to this equation must make the numerator of the left-hand side zero, while keeping the denominator non-zero. The numerator is zero when $x$ is one of the numbers $1, 2, 3, \dots, 100.$ However, for any value in this list that is a perfect square, the denominator will also be zero, so that value of $x$ will not be a root. Therefore, we want to find the number of integers in the list $1, 2, \dots, 100$ which are not perfect squares. The perfect squares in the list are $1^2, 2^2, \dots, 10^2,$ so there are $10$ perfect squares, and \[100 - 10 = \boxed{90}\]integers which are not perfect squares. The answer is $\boxed{90}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The equation $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $2$. This is because the function $| |x-1| - 2 |$ has a graph that is a series of V-shapes, with the $x$-intercepts occurring at $x = 1, 3, 5, 7, \dots$, and the minimum value of the function being $1$. Therefore, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be strictly between $1$ and $2$, so $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Multiplying all sides of the inequalities by $100$ gives $100 < m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from $101$ to $199$, inclusive. To find the number of these integers, we subtract the smallest integer from the largest and add $1$: $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$. Therefore, there are $99$ positive integers $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions.

The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is $99$. However, the error in the original solution was due to a misunderstanding of the problem. The equation $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $2$. This is because the function $| |x-1| - 2 |$ has a graph that is a series of V-shapes, with the $x$-intercepts occurring at $x = 1, 3, 5, 7, \dots$, and the minimum value of the function being $1$. Therefore, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be strictly between $1$ and $2$, so $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Multiplying all sides of the inequalities by $100$ gives $100 < m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from $101$ to $199$, inclusive. To find the number of these integers, we subtract the smallest integer from the largest and add $1$: $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$. Therefore, there are $99$ positive integers $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions.
However, the question asks for the number of positive integers $m$ that make the equation have exactly four distinct solutions. This means we need to consider the values of $m$ that make the equation have either $4$ distinct solutions or no solutions at all. The values of $m$ that make the equation have no solutions are those for which $\frac{m}{100}$ is either less than or equal to $0$ or greater than or equal to $3$. The first case occurs when $m \leq 0$ or $m \geq 300$, and the second case occurs when $m > 300$. Therefore, the values of $m$ that make the equation have exactly four distinct solutions are those in the range $100 < m < 300$. The number of positive integers in this range is $300 - 100 - 1 = 199$. However, this includes the values of $m$ that make the equation have more than four distinct solutions, which are those in the range $200 < m < 300$. The number of positive integers in this range is $300 - 200 - 1 = 99$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that make the equation have exactly four distinct solutions is $199 - 99 = 100$. The answer is $\boxed{100}$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many distinct solutions are there to the equation $|x-7| = |x+1|$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
If $|x-7| = |x+1|$, then either $x-7 = x+1$ or $x-7 = -(x+1)$.  Simplifying $x-7=x+1$ gives $0=8$, which has no solutions, so no values of $x$ satisfy $x-7 = x+1$.  If $x-7 = -(x+1)$, then $x-7 = -x-1$, so $2x = 6$, which gives $x=3$.  So, there is $\boxed{1}$ solution.

Challenge: See if you can find a quick solution to this problem by simply thinking about the graphs of $y=|x-7|$ and $y=|x+1|$. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

First, let's rewrite the equation as $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.

We know that the left-hand side of the equation can be either 0, 1, or 2. So we need to find the values of $m$ for which the right-hand side is equal to 0, 1, or 2.

If the right-hand side is 0, then we have $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=0$, which simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$. Solving this equation gives us $x=3$ or $x=-1$.

If the right-hand side is 1, then we have $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=1$, which gives us two cases:
1. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 1$, which simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = 3$. Solving this equation gives us $x=4$ or $x=-2$.
2. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -1$, which simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = 1$. Solving this equation gives us $x=2$ or $x=0$.

If the right-hand side is 2, then we have $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=2$, which simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = 4$. However, this equation has no solutions, as the absolute value of a number cannot be negative.

So, the values of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions are the values that make the right-hand side equal to 1. These values are 100, 100, and 200 (corresponding to the cases when the right-hand side is 1). Therefore, there are 2 such values of $m$.

The answer is: $2$

## QUESTION 2 - 5

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"For certain ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ of real numbers, the system of equations
\[\begin{aligned} ax+by&=1 \\ x^2 + y^2 &= 50  \end{aligned}\]has at least one solution, and each solution is an ordered pair $(x,y)\,$ of integers. How many such ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ are there?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The graph of $ax+by=1$ is a line, while the graph of $x^2+y^2=50$ is a circle centered at the origin. Therefore, $(a, b)$ satisfies the conditions if and only if the line and circle intersect at least once, and they intersect only at lattice points (points with integer coordinates).

Knowing this, it makes sense to look for lattice points on the circle whose equation is $x^2+y^2=50$. Testing cases, we find that there are twelve lattice points on the circle: $(\pm 1, \pm 7)$, $(\pm 7, \pm 1)$, and $(\pm 5, \pm 5)$ (where the two $\pm$ signs in each pair are independent of each other).

There are $\tbinom{12}{2} = 66$ pairs of these points, and each pair determines a line. However, the graph of $ax+by=1$ can never pass through the origin $(0, 0)$, since if $x=y=0$, then $ax+by=0 \neq 1$. Therefore, the six pairs which consist of diametrically opposed points are invalid, since the line through them passes through the origin. This corrects our count to $66 - 6 = 60$.

In addition, for each of the twelve points, there is a line tangent to the circle at that point, so that the only solution to the system is that one point. This brings the final total to $60 + 12 = \boxed{72}$. The answer is $\boxed{72}$
