Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Let $w$ be the width of each of the identical rectangles. Since $PQ=3w$, $RS=2x$ and $PQ=RS$ (because $PQRS$ is a rectangle), then $2x = 3w$, or $$w=\frac{2}{3}x.$$ Therefore, the area of each of the five identical rectangles is $$x\left(\frac{2}{3}x\right)=\frac{2}{3}x^2.$$ Since the area of $PQRS$ is 4000 and it is made up of five of these identical smaller rectangles, then $$5\left(\frac{2}{3}x^2\right)=4000$$ or $$\frac{10}{3}x^2 = 4000$$ or $x^2 = 1200$ or $x \approx 34.6$ which, when rounded off to the nearest integer, is $\boxed{35}.$ The answer is $\boxed{35}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. Let's consider each term separately.

For the first term, we have $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these absolute value equations are:
1. $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, which gives $x = 10$ and $y = 0$.
2. $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$, which gives $x = 0$ and $y = 10$.
3. $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$, which gives $x = -10$ and $y = 0$.
4. $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$, which gives $x = 0$ and $y = -10$.
These solutions represent the vertices of the polygon.

For the second term, we have $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these absolute value equations are:
1. $x = 8$ and $y = 8$.
2. $x = 8$ and $y = -8$.
3. $x = -8$ and $y = 8$.
4. $x = -8$ and $y = -8$.
These solutions also represent the vertices of the polygon.

The vertices of the polygon are thus $(10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(0, -10)$, $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$. We can plot these points to visualize the polygon.

The polygon is a square with side length 20 (from the points $(10, 0)$ to $(0, -10)$ or from the points $(8, 8)$ to $(-8, -8)$). The area of the square is therefore $20^2 = 400$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 400. The answer is: $400$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The expression $AB=0$ is true if and only if $A=0$ or $B=0$. So the given equation is satisfied if and only if at least one of the following two conditions is satisfied:
1. $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$
2. $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$
The first condition is equivalent to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of a square with side length 10. The vertices are $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, and $(-10, 0)$.
The second condition is equivalent to $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of a square with side length 16. The vertices are $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.
The intersection of these two squares is a smaller square with side length 8. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of the larger square minus the area of the smaller square. The area of a square with side length $a$ is $a^2$, so the area of the larger square is $10^2 = 100$ and the area of the smaller square is $8^2 = 64$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $100 - 64 = 36$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many square units are in the area of the triangle whose vertices are the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the curve $y = (x-3)^2 (x+2)$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we need to find where this curve intersects the $x$ and $y$ axes.  If $y=0$, then $(x-3)^2(x+2)=0$, which has solutions of $x=3$ and $x=-2$.  If $x=0$, then $y=(-3)^2(2)=18$.  So, the curve has two $x$-intercepts and one $y$-intercept.  The length of the base along the $x$-axis is $3-(-2)=5$.  The height from this base is equal to the $y$-intercept, 18.  The area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 5\cdot 18=\boxed{45}$. The answer is $\boxed{45}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


The problem is asking for the area of the convex polygon that is enclosed by the points that satisfy the equation
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$

The equation equals to zero if either of the two terms equals to zero. 

For the first term, we have two cases:
1. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. This forms a square with side length 20 centered at the origin.
2. $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This forms a square with side length 20 centered at the origin as well.

For the second term, we have two cases:
1. $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$. This forms a square with side length 16 centered at the origin.
2. $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $\vert y \vert = 8$. This forms a square with side length 16 centered at the origin as well.

The intersection of these squares form a smaller square with side length 8 centered at the origin. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of the larger square minus the area of the smaller square.

The area of the larger square is $20^2 = 400$, and the area of the smaller square is $8^2 = 64$. So the area of the convex polygon is $400 - 64 = 336$. The answer is: $336$

Since $PQ=3w$, $RS=2x$ and $PQ=RS$ (because $PQRS$ is a rectangle), then $2x = 3w$, or $$w=\frac{2}{3}x.$$ Therefore, the area of each of the five identical rectangles is $$x\left(\frac{2}{3}x\right)=\frac{2}{3}x^2.$$ Since the area of $PQRS$ is 4000 and it is made up of five of these identical smaller rectangles, then $$5\left(\frac{2}{3}x^2\right)=4000$$ or $$\frac{10}{3}x^2 = 4000$$ or $x^2 = 1200$ or $x \approx 34.6$ which, when rounded off to the nearest integer, is $\boxed{35}.$ The answer is $\boxed{35}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


This problem is a bit tricky to solve directly using sympy. However, by examining the equation, we can see that the product of two quantities must be zero, which means each quantity must be zero. This gives us two separate equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

Solving these four equations will give us the coordinates of the vertices of the polygon.

    # Solve the second set of equations

    return vertices1 + vertices2

vertices = find_vertices()

The vertices of the polygon are: (10, 10), (10, -10), (-10, 10), (-10, -10), (8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), and (-8, -8).

To find the area of the polygon, we can use the Shoelace Formula. The Shoelace Formula takes the coordinates of the vertices of a polygon, in any order, and calculates its area. For a polygon with vertices $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), ..., (x_n, y_n)$, the formula is:

$$\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| (x_1y_2 + x_2y_3 + ... + x_ny_1) - (y_1x_2 + y_2x_3 + ... + y_nx_1) \right|$$

**Problem:** 
"How many square units are in the area of the triangle whose vertices are the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the curve $y = (x-3)^2 (x+2)$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we need to find where this curve intersects the $x$ and $y$ axes.  If $y=0$, then $(x-3)^2(x+2)=0$, which has solutions of $x=3$ and $x=-2$.  If $x=0$, then $y=(-3)^2(2)=18$.  So, the curve has two $x$-intercepts and one $y$-intercept.  The length of the base along the $x$-axis is $3-(-2)=5$.  The height from this base is equal to the $y$-intercept, 18.  The area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 5\cdot 18=\boxed{45}$. The answer is $\boxed{45}$

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we first need to understand the given equation and the conditions under which it equals zero. The equation is a product of two terms, so it equals zero when either of the terms is zero. 

The first term, $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, equals zero when both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which simplifies to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These equations represent two lines, $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ in the first quadrant, and their reflections in the other quadrants. 

The second term, $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$, equals zero when both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which simplifies to $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These equations represent two lines, $x = 8$ and $y = 8$ in the first quadrant, and their reflections in the other quadrants. 

The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 10, as the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ intersect at $(5,5)$, and the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$ intersect at $(8,8)$. The vertices of the square are $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, and $(-5,-5)$.

The area of the square is the side length squared, which is $10^2 = 100$.

So the area of the convex polygon formed by the points satisfying the given equation is 100.

The answer is: $100$

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.
2. The first term is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, and this equals zero if and only if both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
3. The second term is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$, and this equals zero if and only if both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
4. Solving the equations in step 2, we get $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. These are the equations of two intersecting lines. Solving the equations in step 3, we get $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. These are the equations of four parallel lines.
5. The intersection points of the lines from step 4 are the vertices of the polygon. By solving these equations, we find that the vertices of the polygon are $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$.
6. To find the area of the polygon, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle and subtract the areas of the four right triangles that are formed by the sides of the rectangle and the diagonals of the rectangle. The sides of the rectangle are of length 16 (from $-8$ to $8$ on both axes) and the diagonals are of length 20 (from $-10$ to $10$ on both axes).
7. The area of the rectangle is $16 \times 16 = 256$, and the area of each right triangle is $0.5 \times 16 \times 16 = 128$. Since there are four right triangles, the total area of the right triangles is $4 \times 128 = 512$.
8. Subtracting the total area of the right triangles from the area of the rectangle, we get the area of the polygon: $256 - 512 = -256$. However, the area cannot be negative, so we must have made a mistake somewhere.
9. Upon revisiting our calculations, we realize that we made a mistake in step 6. The diagonals of the rectangle are of length 20, not 16. The correct calculation is as follows: The area of the rectangle is still $16 \times 16 = 256$, and the area of each right triangle is now $0.5 \times 20 \times 20 = 200$. Since there are four right triangles, the total area of the right triangles is $4 \times 200 = 800$.
10. Subtracting the total area of the right triangles from the area of the rectangle, we get the area of the polygon: $256 - 800 = -544$. Again, the area cannot be negative.
11. Upon revisiting our calculations again, we realize that we made another mistake in step 7. The area of the rectangle should be $16 \times 16 = 256$, and the area of each right triangle should be $0.5 \times 16 \times 16 = 128$. Since there are four right triangles, the total area of the right triangles is $4 \times 128 = 512$.
12. Subtracting the total area of the right triangles from the area of the rectangle, we get the area of the polygon: $256 - 512 = -256$. Again, the area cannot be negative.
13. We have made a mistake in our reasoning. The points that satisfy the given equation are not the vertices of a rectangle, but the vertices of a square. The vertices of the square are $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.
14. The sides of the square are of length 16 (from $-8$ to $8$ on both axes). The area of the square is $16 \times 16 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This is only possible if $x = 0$ and $y = 0$. Similarly, the expression $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which is only possible if $-8 \leq x \leq 8$ and $-8 \leq y \leq 8$. Therefore, the points that satisfy both conditions are $(0, 0)$, and all points in the square with vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(8, -8)$. The area of this square is $16 \times 16 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Let $w$ be the width of each of the identical rectangles. Since $PQ=3w$, $RS=2x$ and $PQ=RS$ (because $PQRS$ is a rectangle), then $2x = 3w$, or $$w=\frac{2}{3}x.$$ Therefore, the area of each of the five identical rectangles is $$x\left(\frac{2}{3}x\right)=\frac{2}{3}x^2.$$ Since the area of $PQRS$ is 4000 and it is made up of five of these identical smaller rectangles, then $$5\left(\frac{2}{3}x^2\right)=4000$$ or $$\frac{10}{3}x^2 = 4000$$ or $x^2 = 1200$ or $x \approx 34.6$ which, when rounded off to the nearest integer, is $\boxed{35}.$ The answer is $\boxed{35}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. Let's consider each case separately.

1. For the first term to be zero, we need $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. This gives us $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these absolute value equations are the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length 10 and diagonal length $10\sqrt{2}$.

2. For the second term to be zero, we need $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. This gives us $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these absolute value equations are the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length 16 and diagonal length $16\sqrt{2}$.

The intersection of the two squares is the convex polygon formed by the intersection of the points that satisfy both equations. The area of this convex polygon is the area of the smaller square. The side length of the smaller square is the length of the diagonal of the smaller square, which is half the diagonal of the larger square. The diagonal of the larger square is $16\sqrt{2}$, so the diagonal of the smaller square is $\frac{16\sqrt{2}}{2} = 8\sqrt{2}$. The area of the smaller square is $(\text{side length})^2 = (8\sqrt{2})^2 = 128$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 128.

To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.
