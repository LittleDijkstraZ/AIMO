**Problem:** 
"Let $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_ 2= (-16,2).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that
\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as
\[\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1.\]Find $h + k + a + b.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

**Solution:** 


The problem is asking for the area of a polygon formed by the intersection of two circles and their lines of symmetry.

First, let's consider the two equations:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first equation to be true, both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies that $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$.

Solving these, we get two lines of symmetry: $x = 5$ and $y = 5$.

For the second equation to be true, both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies that $x = 8$ and $y = 8$ or $x = -8$ and $y = -8$.

Solving these, we get four lines of symmetry: $x = 8$, $y = 8$, $x = -8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersection of these lines of symmetry form a square with side length 10, so the area of the polygon is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 100.
The answer is: $100$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Find the number of 10-tuples $(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{10})$ of real numbers such that
\[(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2 = \frac{1}{11}.\]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,
\begin{align*}
&[(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + \dots + 1^2 + 1^2)][(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2] \\
&\ge [(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + (x_2 - x_3) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10}]^2 = 1.
\end{align*}From the given condition, we have equality, so by the equality condition for Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[\frac{1 - x_1}{1} = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{1} = \frac{x_2 - x_3}{1} = \dots = \frac{x_9 - x_{10}}{1} = \frac{x_{10}}{1}.\]Let
\[d = 1 - x_1 = x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_3 = \dots = x_9 - x_{10} = x_{10}.\]Then
\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so
\[(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_{10}) = \left( \frac{10}{11}, \frac{9}{11}, \frac{8}{11}, \dots, \frac{1}{11} \right).\]In particular, there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Solution:** 


The problem asks us to find the area of a convex polygon formed by the points that satisfy the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

This equation is equal to zero if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From these, we can see that the points that satisfy the equation must satisfy either $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

These equations represent 4 straight lines in the coordinate plane:
1. The line $x + y = 10$
2. The line $x + y = -10$
3. The line $x - y = 10$
4. The line $x - y = -10$
5. The line $x = 8$
6. The line $x = -8$
7. The line $y = 8$
8. The line $y = -8$

These lines enclose a rectangle with vertices at $(\pm 8, \pm 8)$. The length and width of the rectangle are both $16$, so its area is $16 \times 16 = 256$.
The answer is $\boxed{256}$.

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


First, let's understand the problem. We need to find the area of a polygon formed by the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

The equation is equal to zero if either of the two factors is zero. Let's consider each factor separately:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$: This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$: This implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = \pm 10$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$: This implies $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$: This implies $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = \pm 8$.

By solving these equations, we can find the vertices of the polygon:

1. For $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$, we get four vertices: $(5, 5)$, $(5, -5)$, $(-5, 5)$, and $(-5, -5)$.
2. For $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$, we get four more vertices: $(8, 0)$, $(-8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, and $(0, -8)$.

Now we can plot these points on a coordinate plane and see that they form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

Therefore, the area of the polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, observe that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So we can set each factor equal to zero and solve for the corresponding points.

2. For the first factor, we have: $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x - y| - 10 = 0$. These equations simplify to $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

3. For the second factor, we have: $|x| - 8 = 0$ and $|y| - 8 = 0$. These equations simplify to $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

4. By plotting these lines on the coordinate plane, we find that they enclose a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many square units are in the area of the triangle whose vertices are the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the curve $y = (x-3)^2 (x+2)$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we need to find where this curve intersects the $x$ and $y$ axes.  If $y=0$, then $(x-3)^2(x+2)=0$, which has solutions of $x=3$ and $x=-2$.  If $x=0$, then $y=(-3)^2(2)=18$.  So, the curve has two $x$-intercepts and one $y$-intercept.  The length of the base along the $x$-axis is $3-(-2)=5$.  The height from this base is equal to the $y$-intercept, 18.  The area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 5\cdot 18=\boxed{45}$. The answer is $\boxed{45}$
