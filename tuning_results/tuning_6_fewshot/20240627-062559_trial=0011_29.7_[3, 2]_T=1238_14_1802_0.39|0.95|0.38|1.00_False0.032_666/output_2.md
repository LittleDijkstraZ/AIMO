**Problem:** 
"For certain ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ of real numbers, the system of equations
\[\begin{aligned} ax+by&=1 \\ x^2 + y^2 &= 50  \end{aligned}\]has at least one solution, and each solution is an ordered pair $(x,y)\,$ of integers. How many such ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ are there?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The graph of $ax+by=1$ is a line, while the graph of $x^2+y^2=50$ is a circle centered at the origin. Therefore, $(a, b)$ satisfies the conditions if and only if the line and circle intersect at least once, and they intersect only at lattice points (points with integer coordinates).

Knowing this, it makes sense to look for lattice points on the circle whose equation is $x^2+y^2=50$. Testing cases, we find that there are twelve lattice points on the circle: $(\pm 1, \pm 7)$, $(\pm 7, \pm 1)$, and $(\pm 5, \pm 5)$ (where the two $\pm$ signs in each pair are independent of each other).

There are $\tbinom{12}{2} = 66$ pairs of these points, and each pair determines a line. However, the graph of $ax+by=1$ can never pass through the origin $(0, 0)$, since if $x=y=0$, then $ax+by=0 \neq 1$. Therefore, the six pairs which consist of diametrically opposed points are invalid, since the line through them passes through the origin. This corrects our count to $66 - 6 = 60$.

In addition, for each of the twelve points, there is a line tangent to the circle at that point, so that the only solution to the system is that one point. This brings the final total to $60 + 12 = \boxed{72}$. The answer is $\boxed{72}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $2$. This is because the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a graph that is a "V" shape with the "bottom" of the "V" at $y=1$ and the "top" of the "V" at $y=2$. Therefore, the equation $f(x) = \frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $2$.

So we want to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Multiplying all sides of the inequalities by $100$ gives $100 < m < 200$. The number of positive integers in this range is $200 - 100 - 1 = 99$.

So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $99$. The answer is: $99$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many solutions does the equation \[\frac{(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)\dotsm(x-100)}{(x-1^2)(x-2^2)(x-3^2)\dotsm(x-100^2)} = 0\]have for $x$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Any solution to this equation must make the numerator of the left-hand side zero, while keeping the denominator non-zero. The numerator is zero when $x$ is one of the numbers $1, 2, 3, \dots, 100.$ However, for any value in this list that is a perfect square, the denominator will also be zero, so that value of $x$ will not be a root. Therefore, we want to find the number of integers in the list $1, 2, \dots, 100$ which are not perfect squares. The perfect squares in the list are $1^2, 2^2, \dots, 10^2,$ so there are $10$ perfect squares, and \[100 - 10 = \boxed{90}\]integers which are not perfect squares. The answer is $\boxed{90}$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many integers are solutions to the equation $$(x-2)^{(25-x^2)}=1?$$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
We need some basic facts from number theory: $a^0 = 1$ for any $a,$ $1^b = 1$ for any $b,$ and $(-1)^c = 1$ if $c$ is an even integer. Unless the base is a complex number (which is excluded since we are looking for integer solutions), there are no other ways to get an RHS of $1.$ Thus, either the exponent is zero $($giving the equation $25 - x^2 = 0),$ the base is $1$ $($giving $x -2 = 1),$ or the base is $-1$ and the exponent is even $($giving the simultaneous equations $x - 2 = -1$ and $25 - x^2 = 2n$ for some integer $n).$ Solving the first equation gives $x = \pm 5,$ and solving the second gives $x = 3.$ The third equation implies that $x = 1,$ in which case $25 - x^2 = 24$ is indeed even, so $x = 1$ is a valid solution. In all, there are $\boxed{4}$ integer solutions. The answer is $\boxed{4}$

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we need to find the value of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

We can start by analyzing the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. This equation has four distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is a number between $1$ and $2$, inclusive. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a graph that is a series of V-shapes, each with a width of $1$ unit. Therefore, for the equation to have four distinct solutions, the right-hand side $\frac{m}{100}$ must be a number between $1$ and $2$.

To find the corresponding value of $m$, we can multiply both sides of the inequality $1 \leq \frac{m}{100} \leq 2$ by $100$ to get $100 \leq m \leq 200$. Therefore, the value of $m$ that makes the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have $4$ distinct solutions is any integer from $100$ to $200$, inclusive.

To find the number of such integers, we can subtract the smallest value from the largest value and then add $1$. This gives us $200 - 100 + 1 = 101$.

However, this result is incorrect. We made a mistake in our reasoning. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is a number between $1$ and $2$, but it also has four distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is a number between $0$ and $1$. Therefore, we need to consider both cases.

The value of $\frac{m}{100}$ that is a number between $0$ and $1$ is given by $0 \leq \frac{m}{100} \leq 1$, which gives $0 \leq m \leq 100$. Therefore, the value of $m$ that makes the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have $4$ distinct solutions is any integer from $0$ to $100$, inclusive. The number of such integers is $100 + 1 = 101$.

However, this also gives us a total of $101 + 101 = 202$ values of $m$, which is impossible since the problem asks for a single value of $m$. The mistake in our reasoning is that we double-counted the value of $m$ that makes $\frac{m}{100}$ exactly equal to $1$. This value of $m$ corresponds to the case where the right-hand side of the equation is exactly equal to the width of one of the V-shapes in the graph of the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. In this case, the equation has only three distinct solutions, not four.

Therefore, we need to subtract one from our previous count of $202$. This gives us $202 - 1 = 201$. However, this result is still incorrect. The mistake in our reasoning is that we subtracted the wrong value. We should not have subtracted the value of $m$ that makes $\frac{m}{100}$ exactly equal to $1$. Instead, we should have only counted the values of $m$ that make $\frac{m}{100}$ strictly less than $1$ or strictly greater than $1$.

The value of $m$ that makes $\frac{m}{100}$ strictly less than $1$ is given by $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 1$, which gives $0 < m < 100$. The number of integers in this range is $99$. The value of $m$ that makes $\frac{m}{100}$ strictly greater than $1$ is given by $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which gives $100 < m < 200$. The number of integers in this range is $99$. Therefore, the total number of values of $m$ that make the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have $4$ distinct solutions is $99 + 99 + 1 = 199$.

However, this result is still incorrect. The mistake in our reasoning is that we did not consider the value of $m$ that makes $\frac{m}{100}$ exactly equal to $1$. This value of $m$ corresponds to the case where the right-hand side of the equation is exactly equal to the width of one of the V-shapes in the graph of the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. In this case, the equation has exactly three distinct solutions, not four.

Therefore, we need to add one to our previous count of $199$. This gives us $199 + 1 = 200$. This is the correct number of values of $m$ that make the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have $4$ distinct solutions.

Therefore, the value of $m$ that makes the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have $4$ distinct solutions is any integer from $0$ to $200$, inclusive, except for the value $m = 100$. The number of such integers is $200$.

However, this result is still incorrect. The mistake in our reasoning is that we did not consider the value of $m$ that makes $\frac{m}{100}$ exactly equal to $2$. This value of $m$ corresponds to the case where the right-hand side of the equation is exactly equal to twice the width of one of the V-shapes in the graph of the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. In this case, the equation has exactly three distinct solutions, not four.

Therefore, we need to subtract one from our previous count of $200$. This gives us $200 - 1 = 199$. This is the correct number of values of $m$ that make the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have $4$ distinct solutions.

Therefore, the value of $m$ that makes the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have $4$ distinct solutions is any integer from $0$ to $199$, inclusive. The number of such integers is $200$.

However, this result is still incorrect. The mistake in our reasoning is that we did not consider the value of $m$ that makes $\frac{m}{100}$ exactly equal to $0$. This value of $m$ corresponds to the case where the right-hand side of the equation is exactly equal to zero. In this case, the equation has exactly one distinct solution, not four.

Therefore, we need to add one to our previous count of $200$. This gives us $200 + 1 = 201$. This is the correct number of values of $m$ that make the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have $4$ distinct solutions.

Therefore, the value of $m$ that makes the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have $4$ distinct solutions is any integer from $1$ to $199$, inclusive. The

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"For certain ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ of real numbers, the system of equations
\[\begin{aligned} ax+by&=1 \\ x^2 + y^2 &= 50  \end{aligned}\]has at least one solution, and each solution is an ordered pair $(x,y)\,$ of integers. How many such ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ are there?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The graph of $ax+by=1$ is a line, while the graph of $x^2+y^2=50$ is a circle centered at the origin. Therefore, $(a, b)$ satisfies the conditions if and only if the line and circle intersect at least once, and they intersect only at lattice points (points with integer coordinates).

Knowing this, it makes sense to look for lattice points on the circle whose equation is $x^2+y^2=50$. Testing cases, we find that there are twelve lattice points on the circle: $(\pm 1, \pm 7)$, $(\pm 7, \pm 1)$, and $(\pm 5, \pm 5)$ (where the two $\pm$ signs in each pair are independent of each other).

There are $\tbinom{12}{2} = 66$ pairs of these points, and each pair determines a line. However, the graph of $ax+by=1$ can never pass through the origin $(0, 0)$, since if $x=y=0$, then $ax+by=0 \neq 1$. Therefore, the six pairs which consist of diametrically opposed points are invalid, since the line through them passes through the origin. This corrects our count to $66 - 6 = 60$.

In addition, for each of the twelve points, there is a line tangent to the circle at that point, so that the only solution to the system is that one point. This brings the final total to $60 + 12 = \boxed{72}$. The answer is $\boxed{72}$

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $2$. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a graph that is a series of $V$s, with the $V$s getting narrower as $x$ increases or decreases. The value $\frac{m}{100}$ determines the height of the $V$s, and if it is less than $1$, there will be no $V$s that cross the $x$-axis, meaning no solutions. If it is greater than $2$, all the $V$s will be too wide to cross the $x$-axis, again no solutions. If it is strictly between $1$ and $2$, exactly $4$ distinct solutions will exist.

So we want to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Multiplying all parts of the inequality by $100$ gives $100 < m < 200$. The number of positive integers in this range is $200 - 100 - 1 = 99$. So there are $99$ positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions. The answer is: $99$

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



The problem asks for how many positive integers $m$ the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. 

This equation is equivalent to a piecewise function. We can break it down into cases based on the value of $x$:

1. If $x < 1$, then $\vert x - 1 \vert = 1 - x$. So the equation becomes $\vert 1 - x - 2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert -x - 1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$. This simplifies to $\vert x + 1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$.
2. If $1 \leq x < 3$, then $\vert x - 1 \vert = x - 1$. So the equation becomes $\vert x - 1 - 2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert x - 3 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$. This simplifies to $x - 3 = \frac{m}{100}$ or $3 - x = \frac{m}{100}$.
3. If $x \geq 3$, then $\vert x - 1 \vert = x - 1$. So the equation becomes $\vert x - 1 - 2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert x - 3 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$. This simplifies to $x - 3 = \frac{m}{100}$ or $3 - x = \frac{m}{100}$.

Now we need to find the values of $m$ for which each of these equations has 4 distinct solutions. 

For the equation $\vert x + 1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, it has 2 distinct solutions if $\frac{m}{100} > 1$, or $m > 100$.

For the equation $x - 3 = \frac{m}{100}$, it has 2 distinct solutions if $\frac{m}{100} < 1$, or $m < 100$.

For the equation $3 - x = \frac{m}{100}$, it has 2 distinct solutions if $\frac{m}{100} < 1$, or $m < 100$.

So the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when $100 > m > 0$. There are $99$ such positive integers $m$.

So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is $99$.

The answer is: $99$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many integers are solutions to the equation $$(x-2)^{(25-x^2)}=1?$$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
We need some basic facts from number theory: $a^0 = 1$ for any $a,$ $1^b = 1$ for any $b,$ and $(-1)^c = 1$ if $c$ is an even integer. Unless the base is a complex number (which is excluded since we are looking for integer solutions), there are no other ways to get an RHS of $1.$ Thus, either the exponent is zero $($giving the equation $25 - x^2 = 0),$ the base is $1$ $($giving $x -2 = 1),$ or the base is $-1$ and the exponent is even $($giving the simultaneous equations $x - 2 = -1$ and $25 - x^2 = 2n$ for some integer $n).$ Solving the first equation gives $x = \pm 5,$ and solving the second gives $x = 3.$ The third equation implies that $x = 1,$ in which case $25 - x^2 = 24$ is indeed even, so $x = 1$ is a valid solution. In all, there are $\boxed{4}$ integer solutions. The answer is $\boxed{4}$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"For certain ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ of real numbers, the system of equations
\[\begin{aligned} ax+by&=1 \\ x^2 + y^2 &= 50  \end{aligned}\]has at least one solution, and each solution is an ordered pair $(x,y)\,$ of integers. How many such ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ are there?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The graph of $ax+by=1$ is a line, while the graph of $x^2+y^2=50$ is a circle centered at the origin. Therefore, $(a, b)$ satisfies the conditions if and only if the line and circle intersect at least once, and they intersect only at lattice points (points with integer coordinates).

Knowing this, it makes sense to look for lattice points on the circle whose equation is $x^2+y^2=50$. Testing cases, we find that there are twelve lattice points on the circle: $(\pm 1, \pm 7)$, $(\pm 7, \pm 1)$, and $(\pm 5, \pm 5)$ (where the two $\pm$ signs in each pair are independent of each other).

There are $\tbinom{12}{2} = 66$ pairs of these points, and each pair determines a line. However, the graph of $ax+by=1$ can never pass through the origin $(0, 0)$, since if $x=y=0$, then $ax+by=0 \neq 1$. Therefore, the six pairs which consist of diametrically opposed points are invalid, since the line through them passes through the origin. This corrects our count to $66 - 6 = 60$.

In addition, for each of the twelve points, there is a line tangent to the circle at that point, so that the only solution to the system is that one point. This brings the final total to $60 + 12 = \boxed{72}$. The answer is $\boxed{72}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $2$. This is because the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a graph that is a series of "steps" with the step heights equal to $1$ and $2$. Therefore, the equation $f(x) = \frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $2$.

The inequality $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$ can be rewritten as $100 < m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are precisely the integers from $101$ to $199$, inclusive. To find the number of such integers, we subtract the smallest integer from the largest and add $1$: $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$.

So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $99$.
