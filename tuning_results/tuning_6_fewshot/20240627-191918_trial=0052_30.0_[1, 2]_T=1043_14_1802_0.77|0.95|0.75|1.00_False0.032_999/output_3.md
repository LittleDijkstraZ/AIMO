**Problem:** 
"Let $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_ 2= (-16,2).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that
\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as
\[\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1.\]Find $h + k + a + b.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, which means that either one of the expressions must be zero for the entire product to be zero. So, we have two sets of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

Each set of equations simplifies to:

1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$
2. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$

For $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, we have four cases: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $-(x + y) = 10$, and $-(x + y) = -10$. This gives us the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x + y = -10$, and $x + y = 10$. These lines are parallel and equally spaced, so they form a square.

For $\vert x \vert = 8$, we have two cases: $x = 8$ and $x = -8$. This gives us the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$. These lines are parallel and equally spaced, so they form a square.

Similarly, for $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, we can deduce that the lines $y = x + 10$, $y = x - 10$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$ form a square.

The intersection of these squares is a smaller square with side length 6 (the distance between the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$, or $y = 8$ and $y = -8$). The area of this square is $6^2 = 36$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 36. The answer is: $36$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"An ellipse is defined parametrically by
\[(x,y) = \left( \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t}, \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t} \right).\]Then the equation of the ellipse can be written in the form
\[Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0,\]where $A,$ $B,$ $C,$ $D,$ $E,$ and $F$ are integers, and $\gcd(|A|,|B|,|C|,|D|,|E|,|F|) = 1.$  Find $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F|.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
In the equation $y = \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\cos t$ to get
\[\cos t = \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3}.\]In the equation $x = \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\sin t$ to get
\[\sin t = \frac{1}{2} x (2 - \cos t) + 1 = \frac{1}{2} x \left( 2 - \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right) + 1 = 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)}.\]Since $\cos^2 t + \sin^2 t = 1,$
\[\left( \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right)^2 + \left( 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)} \right)^2 = 1.\]Multiplying both sides by $(2(y + 3))^2$ and expanding, it will simplify to
\[81x^2 - 36xy + 16y^2 - 108x + 240y + 900 = 0.\]Therefore, $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F| = 81 + 36 + 16 + 108 + 240 + 900 = \boxed{1381}.$ The answer is $\boxed{1381}$

**Solution:** 



This problem is a geometry problem about finding the area of a polygon. The equation given is a product of two expressions, each of which is a squared absolute value minus a constant. The only way for this product to be zero is if at least one of the expressions is zero. 

So we have four cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For each case, we solve the equation and plot the resulting lines on a graph. The intersection points of these lines will be the vertices of the polygon.

1. For the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which gives $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.
2. For the second case, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which gives $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.
3. For the third case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$, which gives $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.
4. For the fourth case, we have $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

Plotting these lines on a graph, we find that they form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So the area of the convex polygon is 256.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many square units are in the area of the triangle whose vertices are the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the curve $y = (x-3)^2 (x+2)$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we need to find where this curve intersects the $x$ and $y$ axes.  If $y=0$, then $(x-3)^2(x+2)=0$, which has solutions of $x=3$ and $x=-2$.  If $x=0$, then $y=(-3)^2(2)=18$.  So, the curve has two $x$-intercepts and one $y$-intercept.  The length of the base along the $x$-axis is $3-(-2)=5$.  The height from this base is equal to the $y$-intercept, 18.  The area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 5\cdot 18=\boxed{45}$. The answer is $\boxed{45}$

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we first need to understand the equation and the conditions under which it equals to zero. The equation is:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$

This equation equals to zero if either of the two factors equals to zero. The first factor equals to zero when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The second factor equals to zero when $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The solutions to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$ are the vertices of the polygon. We can find these vertices by considering all possible combinations of the four absolute value equations.

Once we have all the vertices, we can calculate the area of the polygon using the Shoelace formula.

Here is the python code to solve this problem:

```python

The area of the convex polygon is 0. However, this is not possible as a polygon has a non-zero area. There must be a mistake in our calculation. Let's reexamine our steps.

Upon closer inspection, we realize that we are not considering the case when the absolute value equations give us a combination of positive and negative solutions. For example, when we solve $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, we only consider the case where both $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$. We should also consider the case where $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$ or $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$.

Let's modify our code to consider these additional cases:

```python

    vertices_4 = solve([Abs(x + y) - 10, Abs(x - y) + 10, Abs(x) - 8, Abs(y) + 8])
    vertices_5 = solve([Abs(x + y) - 10, Abs(x - y) - 10, Abs(x) + 8, Abs(y) - 8])
    vertices_6 = solve([Abs(x + y) - 10, Abs(x - y) + 10, Abs(x) + 8, Abs(y) - 8])

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many square units are in the area of the triangle whose vertices are the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the curve $y = (x-3)^2 (x+2)$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we need to find where this curve intersects the $x$ and $y$ axes.  If $y=0$, then $(x-3)^2(x+2)=0$, which has solutions of $x=3$ and $x=-2$.  If $x=0$, then $y=(-3)^2(2)=18$.  So, the curve has two $x$-intercepts and one $y$-intercept.  The length of the base along the $x$-axis is $3-(-2)=5$.  The height from this base is equal to the $y$-intercept, 18.  The area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 5\cdot 18=\boxed{45}$. The answer is $\boxed{45}$

To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we need to understand the properties of absolute value and the conditions that make a product equal to zero.

1. The expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm10$ and $x - y = \pm10$. Solving these equations, we get four lines: $y = -x + 10$, $y = -x - 10$, $y = x + 10$, and $y = x - 10$.

2. The expression $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm8$ and $y = \pm8$. So we get four lines: $y = 8$, $y = -8$, $x = 8$, and $x = -8$.

3. The intersection of the lines from step 1 and step 2 will give us the vertices of the polygon. By solving the equations, we get the vertices: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

4. Now we need to find the area of the polygon. The polygon is a square with side length 16 (since the distance between $(8, 8)$ and $(8, -8)$ is 16). The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$.

**Problem:** 
"Find the number of 10-tuples $(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{10})$ of real numbers such that
\[(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2 = \frac{1}{11}.\]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,
\begin{align*}
&[(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + \dots + 1^2 + 1^2)][(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2] \\
&\ge [(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + (x_2 - x_3) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10}]^2 = 1.
\end{align*}From the given condition, we have equality, so by the equality condition for Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[\frac{1 - x_1}{1} = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{1} = \frac{x_2 - x_3}{1} = \dots = \frac{x_9 - x_{10}}{1} = \frac{x_{10}}{1}.\]Let
\[d = 1 - x_1 = x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_3 = \dots = x_9 - x_{10} = x_{10}.\]Then
\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so
\[(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_{10}) = \left( \frac{10}{11}, \frac{9}{11}, \frac{8}{11}, \dots, \frac{1}{11} \right).\]In particular, there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

The first factor is equal to 0 if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. The second factor is equal to 0 if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

The solutions to $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$ are the lines $y = \pm x \pm 10$, and the solutions to $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$ are the lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. The lines $y = \pm x \pm 10$ intersect the lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$ at the points $(\pm 8, \pm 2)$, $(\pm 8, \mp 18)$, $(\pm 2, \pm 8)$, and $(\mp 18, \pm 8)$. These points form a rectangle with side lengths 16 and 32, so the area of the rectangle is $16 \times 32 = 512$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 512.

## QUESTION 3 - 10

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many square units are in the area of the triangle whose vertices are the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the curve $y = (x-3)^2 (x+2)$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we need to find where this curve intersects the $x$ and $y$ axes.  If $y=0$, then $(x-3)^2(x+2)=0$, which has solutions of $x=3$ and $x=-2$.  If $x=0$, then $y=(-3)^2(2)=18$.  So, the curve has two $x$-intercepts and one $y$-intercept.  The length of the base along the $x$-axis is $3-(-2)=5$.  The height from this base is equal to the $y$-intercept, 18.  The area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 5\cdot 18=\boxed{45}$. The answer is $\boxed{45}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.
