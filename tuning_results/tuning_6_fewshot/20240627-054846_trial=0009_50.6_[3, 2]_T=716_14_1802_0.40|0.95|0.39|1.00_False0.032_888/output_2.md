Assistant:

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. This is because the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, can take on three distinct values: $-2$, $0$, and $2$. The value of $2$ gives us 4 distinct solutions.

So we need to solve the equation $\frac{m}{100} = 2$ for $m$. Multiplying both sides by $100$ gives us $m = 200$.

So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 1, because there is only one value of $m$ that satisfies the equation, namely $m = 200$. The answer is: $1$

## QUESTION 2 - 1

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"For certain ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ of real numbers, the system of equations
\[\begin{aligned} ax+by&=1 \\ x^2 + y^2 &= 50  \end{aligned}\]has at least one solution, and each solution is an ordered pair $(x,y)\,$ of integers. How many such ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ are there?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The graph of $ax+by=1$ is a line, while the graph of $x^2+y^2=50$ is a circle centered at the origin. Therefore, $(a, b)$ satisfies the conditions if and only if the line and circle intersect at least once, and they intersect only at lattice points (points with integer coordinates).

Knowing this, it makes sense to look for lattice points on the circle whose equation is $x^2+y^2=50$. Testing cases, we find that there are twelve lattice points on the circle: $(\pm 1, \pm 7)$, $(\pm 7, \pm 1)$, and $(\pm 5, \pm 5)$ (where the two $\pm$ signs in each pair are independent of each other).

There are $\tbinom{12}{2} = 66$ pairs of these points, and each pair determines a line. However, the graph of $ax+by=1$ can never pass through the origin $(0, 0)$, since if $x=y=0$, then $ax+by=0 \neq 1$. Therefore, the six pairs which consist of diametrically opposed points are invalid, since the line through them passes through the origin. This corrects our count to $66 - 6 = 60$.

In addition, for each of the twelve points, there is a line tangent to the circle at that point, so that the only solution to the system is that one point. This brings the final total to $60 + 12 = \boxed{72}$. The answer is $\boxed{72}$

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


To solve this problem, we need to analyze the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ and find for how many positive integers $m$ it has $4$ distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be rewritten as two separate cases:
1. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$
2. $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = \frac{m}{100}$

For each of these cases, we can further break them down into two sub-cases:

1.1. $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$
1.2. $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$
2.1. $-\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$
2.2. $-\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$

Each of these sub-cases gives us a different equation to solve. We need to find for how many positive integers $m$ each of these sub-cases has $2$ distinct solutions.

After solving each of these sub-cases and analyzing the number of distinct solutions, we find that the only sub-cases that give $2$ distinct solutions are:

1.2. $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ (for $1 \leq m \leq 200$)
2.1. $-\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ (for $1 \leq m \leq 200$)

So, for each of these sub-cases, we have $200$ possible values of $m$. Since each sub-case gives $2$ distinct solutions, and there are two sub-cases for each case of the original equation, the total number of distinct solutions for each value of $m$ is $4$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $200$.

The answer is: $200$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many solutions does the equation \[\frac{(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)\dotsm(x-100)}{(x-1^2)(x-2^2)(x-3^2)\dotsm(x-100^2)} = 0\]have for $x$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Any solution to this equation must make the numerator of the left-hand side zero, while keeping the denominator non-zero. The numerator is zero when $x$ is one of the numbers $1, 2, 3, \dots, 100.$ However, for any value in this list that is a perfect square, the denominator will also be zero, so that value of $x$ will not be a root. Therefore, we want to find the number of integers in the list $1, 2, \dots, 100$ which are not perfect squares. The perfect squares in the list are $1^2, 2^2, \dots, 10^2,$ so there are $10$ perfect squares, and \[100 - 10 = \boxed{90}\]integers which are not perfect squares. The answer is $\boxed{90}$

**Problem:** 
"How many integers are solutions to the equation $$(x-2)^{(25-x^2)}=1?$$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
We need some basic facts from number theory: $a^0 = 1$ for any $a,$ $1^b = 1$ for any $b,$ and $(-1)^c = 1$ if $c$ is an even integer. Unless the base is a complex number (which is excluded since we are looking for integer solutions), there are no other ways to get an RHS of $1.$ Thus, either the exponent is zero $($giving the equation $25 - x^2 = 0),$ the base is $1$ $($giving $x -2 = 1),$ or the base is $-1$ and the exponent is even $($giving the simultaneous equations $x - 2 = -1$ and $25 - x^2 = 2n$ for some integer $n).$ Solving the first equation gives $x = \pm 5,$ and solving the second gives $x = 3.$ The third equation implies that $x = 1,$ in which case $25 - x^2 = 24$ is indeed even, so $x = 1$ is a valid solution. In all, there are $\boxed{4}$ integer solutions. The answer is $\boxed{4}$

To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!

**Solution:** 



The problem asks for how many positive integers $m$ the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. 

This equation is a piecewise function with $4$ cases depending on the value of $x$. We can solve this equation by considering each case separately and then summing up the number of solutions in each case.

1. If $x < 1$, then $\vert x - 1 \vert = 1 - x$. The equation becomes $\vert 1 - x - 2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert -x - 1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$. This simplifies to $\vert x + 1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$. The solutions to this equation are $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

2. If $1 \leq x < 3$, then $\vert x - 1 \vert = x - 1$. The equation becomes $\vert x - 1 - 2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert x - 3 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$. This simplifies to $x - 3 = \frac{m}{100}$ or $3 - x = \frac{m}{100}$. The solutions to these equations are $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.

3. If $x \geq 3$, then $\vert x - 1 \vert = x - 1$. The equation becomes $\vert x - 1 - 2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert x - 3 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$. This simplifies to $x - 3 = \frac{m}{100}$ or $3 - x = \frac{m}{100}$. The solutions to these equations are $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.

We want the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions. This happens when the solutions from the first and third cases do not overlap with the solutions from the second case. This happens when $\frac{m}{100} < 2$, or $m < 200$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $199$.

The answer is: $199$

from sympy import symbols, solve, Eq, Abs

def find_m():
    x, m = symbols('x m')
    equation = Eq(Abs(Abs(x - 1) - 2), m/100)
