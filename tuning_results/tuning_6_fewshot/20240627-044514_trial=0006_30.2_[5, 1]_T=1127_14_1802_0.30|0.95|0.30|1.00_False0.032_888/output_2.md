Assistant:

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 1 and 2. This is because the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a graph that is a series of V-shapes, with the base of each V at integer values. The height of each V is 1, and the width of each V is 4 (since the function changes from increasing to decreasing or vice versa at $x = 1-2 = -1$, $1$, and $1+2 = 3$). Therefore, for $f(x)$ to have 4 distinct solutions, the right hand side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be strictly between 1 and 2. This means $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, or equivalently, $100 < m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from 101 to 199, inclusive. To find the number of these integers, we subtract the smallest integer from the largest and add 1. So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$. The answer is: 99

Assistant:

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 1 and 2. This is because the expression on the left side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, can take on any value from 0 to 3, and it equals $\frac{m}{100}$ exactly when $\frac{m}{100}$ is in this range.

So we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Multiplying all sides of the inequalities by 100 gives $100 < m < 200$. The number of positive integers in this range is $200 - 100 - 1 = 99$.

So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 99. The answer is: $99$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many solutions does the equation \[\frac{(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)\dotsm(x-100)}{(x-1^2)(x-2^2)(x-3^2)\dotsm(x-100^2)} = 0\]have for $x$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Any solution to this equation must make the numerator of the left-hand side zero, while keeping the denominator non-zero. The numerator is zero when $x$ is one of the numbers $1, 2, 3, \dots, 100.$ However, for any value in this list that is a perfect square, the denominator will also be zero, so that value of $x$ will not be a root. Therefore, we want to find the number of integers in the list $1, 2, \dots, 100$ which are not perfect squares. The perfect squares in the list are $1^2, 2^2, \dots, 10^2,$ so there are $10$ perfect squares, and \[100 - 10 = \boxed{90}\]integers which are not perfect squares. The answer is $\boxed{90}$

The value of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $1$. However, this value does not satisfy the conditions of the problem. We need to find the value of $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions. After revisiting the problem, we realize that we need to find the value of $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions. We can do this by analyzing the graph of the equation. The graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is a series of V-shaped lines, each with two "humps" separated by a distance of $\frac{m}{100}$. For the equation to have $4$ distinct solutions, the humps of the V-shaped lines must intersect the x-axis in such a way that there are $4$ distinct intersections. By analyzing the graph, we find that this occurs when $m=50$. Therefore, the value of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $50$. The value of $m$ is $50$. The answer is: $50$

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We are given the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ and we want to find for how many positive integers $m$ does it have 4 distinct solutions.

2. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can have 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to 2.

3. Therefore, we need to solve the equation $2 = \frac{m}{100}$ for $m$.

4. Multiplying both sides of the equation by 100 gives $m = 200$.

So the positive integer $m$ that makes the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have 4 distinct solutions is 200.

The answer is: $200$

**Solution:** 



To solve this problem, we need to find the value of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions.

We can start by analyzing the equation. The expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a piecewise function that takes on the value of $2-x+1$ when $x>3$, $x-1-2$ when $1<x<3$, $-(x-1-2)$ when $x<-1$, and $-(2-x+1)$ when $-1<x<1$. Simplifying these expressions gives $3-x$, $x-3$, $x+3$, and $-(x-3)$, respectively.

Now, we want this expression to be equal to $\frac{m}{100}$. This means that the absolute value of the difference between the left and right sides of the equation can be equal to $\frac{m}{100}$. This gives us four separate equations to solve:

1. $3-x = \frac{m}{100}$
2. $x-3 = \frac{m}{100}$
3. $x+3 = \frac{m}{100}$
4. $-(x-3) = \frac{m}{100}$

Solving these equations for $x$ gives:

1. $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$
2. $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$
3. $x = -\frac{m}{100} - 3$
4. $x = \frac{m}{100} - 3$

For these equations to have four distinct solutions, the intervals defined by these equations must not overlap. This happens when the absolute value of the difference between the right sides of adjacent equations is greater than 2. 

Checking the differences, we have:

- The difference between the right sides of the first and second equations is $2\frac{m}{100}$.
- The difference between the right sides of the second and third equations is $6\frac{m}{100}$.
- The difference between the right sides of the third and fourth equations is $6\frac{m}{100}$.

For these differences to be greater than 2, we must have $\frac{m}{100} > 1$, which implies $m > 100$. The smallest integer value of $m$ that satisfies this condition is $m = 101$.

Therefore, the value of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions is $m = 101$. The answer is: $101$
