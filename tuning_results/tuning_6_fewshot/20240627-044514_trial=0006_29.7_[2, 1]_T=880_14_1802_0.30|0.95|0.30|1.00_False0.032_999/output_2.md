**Problem:** 
"How many solutions does the equation \[\frac{(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)\dotsm(x-100)}{(x-1^2)(x-2^2)(x-3^2)\dotsm(x-100^2)} = 0\]have for $x$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Any solution to this equation must make the numerator of the left-hand side zero, while keeping the denominator non-zero. The numerator is zero when $x$ is one of the numbers $1, 2, 3, \dots, 100.$ However, for any value in this list that is a perfect square, the denominator will also be zero, so that value of $x$ will not be a root. Therefore, we want to find the number of integers in the list $1, 2, \dots, 100$ which are not perfect squares. The perfect squares in the list are $1^2, 2^2, \dots, 10^2,$ so there are $10$ perfect squares, and \[100 - 10 = \boxed{90}\]integers which are not perfect squares. The answer is $\boxed{90}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we need to find the value of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

We can start by analyzing the equation. The expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a piecewise function that takes on the value of $2-x$ when $x<1$, $1-x$ when $1\leq x \leq 3$, $x-3$ when $x>3$. The right-hand side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, is a constant.

For the equation to have $4$ distinct solutions, the constant must be equal to one of the "steps" in the piecewise function. That is, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal to $1$, $2$, or $3$. Solving for $m$ in each case gives $m=100$, $200$, or $300$.

Therefore, the value of $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $100$, $200$, or $300$. However, we need to check if these values indeed give $4$ distinct solutions.

For $m=100$, the equation becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=1$. This gives us three intervals to consider:

1. For $x<1$, the equation becomes $2-x=1$, which gives $x=1$.
2. For $1\leq x \leq 3$, the equation becomes $1-x=1$, which has no solution.
3. For $x>3$, the equation becomes $x-3=1$, which gives $x=4$.

So, for $m=100$, we have two distinct solutions: $x=1$ and $x=4$.

For $m=200$, the equation becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=2$. This gives us four intervals to consider:

1. For $x<1$, the equation becomes $2-x=2$, which gives $x=0$.
2. For $1\leq x \leq 3$, the equation becomes $1-x=2$, which has no solution.
3. For $3<x<5$, the equation becomes $x-3=2$, which gives $x=5$.
4. For $x\geq 5$, the equation becomes $x-3=2$, which gives $x=5$.

So, for $m=200$, we have three distinct solutions: $x=0$, $x=5$, and $x=5$. The solution $x=5$ is repeated, so we only have two distinct solutions.

For $m=300$, the equation becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=3$. This gives us five intervals to consider:

1. For $x<1$, the equation becomes $2-x=3$, which gives $x=-1$. But this solution is not valid as $x$ must be positive.
2. For $1\leq x \leq 3$, the equation becomes $1-x=3$, which has no solution.
3. For $3<x<5$, the equation becomes $x-3=3$, which gives $x=6$.
4. For $5\leq x \leq 7$, the equation becomes $x-3=3$, which gives $x=6$.
5. For $x>7$, the equation becomes $x-3=3$, which gives $x=6$.

So, for $m=300$, we have only one distinct solution: $x=6$.

Therefore, the only value of $m$ that gives $4$ distinct solutions is $m=200$. The answer is $\boxed{200}$.

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $2$. Therefore, $m = 200$.

We can verify this by plotting the graph of the equation. The graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a V-shape with the vertex at $(1,2)$. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have $4$ distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to the height of the V-shape, which is $2$. Therefore, $m = 200$.

```python

def find_m():
    """For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"""

    return m

result = find_m()
print(result)

The value of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $200$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy this condition is $1$. The answer is: $1$
