**Problem:** 
"Let $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_ 2= (-16,2).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that
\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as
\[\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1.\]Find $h + k + a + b.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



This problem involves understanding the absolute value function and how it interacts with the multiplication operation. The equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. We can break this down into four separate cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 \neq 0$.
3. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 \neq 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
4. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 \neq 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 \neq 0$.

For cases 2, 3, and 4, at least one of the absolute value expressions is not equal to zero, so the product of the terms is not zero. Therefore, only case 1 needs to be considered.

For case 1, we have:

1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

From $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, we have four possibilities: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $-x - y = 10$, and $-x - y = -10$. Similarly, we have four possibilities for each of the other absolute value equations.

By considering all combinations of these possibilities, we find that the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the original equation are the vertices of a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

**Solution:** 


The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. 

The first expression is zero when either $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x - y| - 10 = 0$. This implies $|x + y| = 10$ or $|x - y| = 10$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

The second expression is zero when either $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$. This implies $|x| = 8$ or $|y| = 8$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersection points of these lines are the vertices of the polygon: $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

The polygon is a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.

The first term is zero when $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which simplifies to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two lines in the plane, forming a cross shape.

The second term is zero when $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which simplifies to $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two vertical lines at $x = \pm 8$ and two horizontal lines at $y = \pm 8$, forming a square with side length 16.

The intersection of these two shapes forms a square with side length 10, because the cross shape is contained within the square with side length 16.

The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side, so the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

The equation given in the problem is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. 

The first expression is zero when either $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x - y| - 10 = 0$. These equations simplify to $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

The second expression is zero when either $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$. These equations simplify to $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersection of these lines form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256.
