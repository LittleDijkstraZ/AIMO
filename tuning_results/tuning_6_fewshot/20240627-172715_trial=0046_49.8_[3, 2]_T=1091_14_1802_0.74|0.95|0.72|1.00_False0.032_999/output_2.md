**Problem:** 
"How many distinct solutions are there to the equation $|x-7| = |x+1|$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
If $|x-7| = |x+1|$, then either $x-7 = x+1$ or $x-7 = -(x+1)$.  Simplifying $x-7=x+1$ gives $0=8$, which has no solutions, so no values of $x$ satisfy $x-7 = x+1$.  If $x-7 = -(x+1)$, then $x-7 = -x-1$, so $2x = 6$, which gives $x=3$.  So, there is $\boxed{1}$ solution.

Challenge: See if you can find a quick solution to this problem by simply thinking about the graphs of $y=|x-7|$ and $y=|x+1|$. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


To solve the problem, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

Step 1: We start by setting $\frac{m}{100}$ to a variable, say $y$. So we have $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = y$.

Step 2: The expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = y$ has four distinct solutions if and only if $0 < y < 1$. This is because the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, can take on values in the range $(-2, 1)$, and $y$ must be in this range to produce four distinct solutions.

Step 3: Therefore, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 1$. Multiplying all sides of the inequality by 100 gives $0 < m < 100$.

Step 4: The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from 1 to 99. Therefore, there are 99 such integers.

However, we want the number of such integers $m$, which is $\boxed{99}$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many solutions does the equation \[\frac{(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)\dotsm(x-100)}{(x-1^2)(x-2^2)(x-3^2)\dotsm(x-100^2)} = 0\]have for $x$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Any solution to this equation must make the numerator of the left-hand side zero, while keeping the denominator non-zero. The numerator is zero when $x$ is one of the numbers $1, 2, 3, \dots, 100.$ However, for any value in this list that is a perfect square, the denominator will also be zero, so that value of $x$ will not be a root. Therefore, we want to find the number of integers in the list $1, 2, \dots, 100$ which are not perfect squares. The perfect squares in the list are $1^2, 2^2, \dots, 10^2,$ so there are $10$ perfect squares, and \[100 - 10 = \boxed{90}\]integers which are not perfect squares. The answer is $\boxed{90}$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"For certain ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ of real numbers, the system of equations
\[\begin{aligned} ax+by&=1 \\ x^2 + y^2 &= 50  \end{aligned}\]has at least one solution, and each solution is an ordered pair $(x,y)\,$ of integers. How many such ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ are there?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The graph of $ax+by=1$ is a line, while the graph of $x^2+y^2=50$ is a circle centered at the origin. Therefore, $(a, b)$ satisfies the conditions if and only if the line and circle intersect at least once, and they intersect only at lattice points (points with integer coordinates).

Knowing this, it makes sense to look for lattice points on the circle whose equation is $x^2+y^2=50$. Testing cases, we find that there are twelve lattice points on the circle: $(\pm 1, \pm 7)$, $(\pm 7, \pm 1)$, and $(\pm 5, \pm 5)$ (where the two $\pm$ signs in each pair are independent of each other).

There are $\tbinom{12}{2} = 66$ pairs of these points, and each pair determines a line. However, the graph of $ax+by=1$ can never pass through the origin $(0, 0)$, since if $x=y=0$, then $ax+by=0 \neq 1$. Therefore, the six pairs which consist of diametrically opposed points are invalid, since the line through them passes through the origin. This corrects our count to $66 - 6 = 60$.

In addition, for each of the twelve points, there is a line tangent to the circle at that point, so that the only solution to the system is that one point. This brings the final total to $60 + 12 = \boxed{72}$. The answer is $\boxed{72}$

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**



To find the number of values of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions, we can analyze the number of changes in the slope of the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$.

The function $f(x)$ is a piecewise linear function with $4$ segments. Each segment is a line with a slope of $\pm1$. The changes in the slope occur at the points where the expression inside the absolute value is equal to $0$ or $4$.

For $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 0$, we get $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$, which gives $x=3$ or $x=-1$. For $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 4$, we get $\vert x-1 \vert = 6$, which has no solutions.

So the function $f(x)$ changes slope at $x=-1$ and $x=3$. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to the distance between these two points, which is $4$. Therefore, $m = 400$.

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The number of distinct solutions to the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $4$ if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $2$. Therefore, $m = 200$. 

To confirm this, we can substitute $m = 200$ into the equation to see if it has $4$ distinct solutions. The equation becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{200}{100}=2$. This equation has $4$ distinct solutions, namely $x = -1, 1, 3,$ and $5$.

Therefore, the only value of $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $m = 200$.
The answer is: $200$

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


This is a problem that requires a careful analysis of the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ and how it behaves for different values of its argument. The function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has four distinct solutions when it equals a constant value $k$. The function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is equal to $k$ when $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = k$ or $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -k$. Solving these equations gives us the four distinct solutions. 

The function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ equals $k$ for $k$ in the range $[0,3]$. For each value of $k$ in this range, there are four distinct solutions. Therefore, there is exactly one value of $m$ for each $k$ such that $\frac{m}{100}=k$, i.e., $m=100k$. Since $k$ can take on the values $0, 1, 2, 3$, there are four possible values of $m$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is $4$.

The answer is $\boxed{4}$.

Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
If $|x-7| = |x+1|$, then either $x-7 = x+1$ or $x-7 = -(x+1)$.  Simplifying $x-7=x+1$ gives $0=8$, which has no solutions, so no values of $x$ satisfy $x-7 = x+1$.  If $x-7 = -(x+1)$, then $x-7 = -x-1$, so $2x = 6$, which gives $x=3$.  So, there is $\boxed{1}$ solution.

Challenge: See if you can find a quick solution to this problem by simply thinking about the graphs of $y=|x-7|$ and $y=|x+1|$. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

Any solution to this equation must make the numerator of the left-hand side zero, while keeping the denominator non-zero. The numerator is zero when $x$ is one of the numbers $1, 2, 3, \dots, 100.$ However, for any value in this list that is a perfect square, the denominator will also be zero, so that value of $x$ will not be a root. Therefore, we want to find the number of integers in the list $1, 2, \dots, 100$ which are not perfect squares. The perfect squares in the list are $1^2, 2^2, \dots, 10^2,$ so there are $10$ perfect squares, and \[100 - 10 = \boxed{90}\]integers which are not perfect squares. The answer is $\boxed{90}$

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we need to find the number of values of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly four distinct solutions.

First, let's analyze the equation. The expression on the left, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, is a piecewise function that takes on the value of $2-x+1=3-x$ when $x<1$, $2-1+2=3$ when $1\leq x \leq 3$, and $x-1-2=x-3$ when $x>3$. So the equation becomes:
1. $3-x = \frac{m}{100}$ for $x<1$,
2. $3 = \frac{m}{100}$ for $1\leq x \leq 3$,
3. $x-3 = \frac{m}{100}$ for $x>3$.

From these equations, we can solve for $x$ in each case:
1. $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ for $x<1$,
2. $x = 3$ for $1\leq x \leq 3$,
3. $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ for $x>3$.

The equation has exactly four distinct solutions when the lines $y = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $y = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ intersect the lines $y=1$ and $y=3$ at distinct points. This happens when $\frac{m}{100} = 2$ and $\frac{m}{100} = 1$, which gives $m=200$ and $m=100$. So there are two values of $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions. The answer is $\boxed{2}$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many integers are solutions to the equation $$(x-2)^{(25-x^2)}=1?$$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
We need some basic facts from number theory: $a^0 = 1$ for any $a,$ $1^b = 1$ for any $b,$ and $(-1)^c = 1$ if $c$ is an even integer. Unless the base is a complex number (which is excluded since we are looking for integer solutions), there are no other ways to get an RHS of $1.$ Thus, either the exponent is zero $($giving the equation $25 - x^2 = 0),$ the base is $1$ $($giving $x -2 = 1),$ or the base is $-1$ and the exponent is even $($giving the simultaneous equations $x - 2 = -1$ and $25 - x^2 = 2n$ for some integer $n).$ Solving the first equation gives $x = \pm 5,$ and solving the second gives $x = 3.$ The third equation implies that $x = 1,$ in which case $25 - x^2 = 24$ is indeed even, so $x = 1$ is a valid solution. In all, there are $\boxed{4}$ integer solutions. The answer is $\boxed{4}$

The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $199$. However, this number is not in the interval (0, 2) as required by the problem. This suggests that we have misunderstood the problem. Let's reconsider it.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $m$ is in the interval (0, 2). Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is the number of positive integers in the interval (0, 2), which is 1.

Therefore, the correct answer is 1.

The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is $\boxed{1}$.

To solve this problem, we first need to understand the structure of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to the distance between the points where the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ changes its slope.

The function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ changes its slope at $x=1-2= -1$, $x=1+2=3$, and $x=1-(-2)=3$. So the distance between these points is $3 - (-1) = 4$. Therefore, we need to find the value of $m$ such that $\frac{m}{100} = 4$.

**Solution:** 


The problem asks us to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions.

To solve this, we can first rewrite the equation as $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.

This equation is equivalent to the system of equations $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.

For each of these equations, we can split the absolute value into two cases: $x-1 - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $-(x-1) - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$, and $x-1 - 2 = -\frac{m}{100}$ and $-(x-1) - 2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.

This gives us a total of four equations to solve:
1. $x - 3 = \frac{m}{100}$
2. $-(x - 1) - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$
3. $x - 3 = -\frac{m}{100}$
4. $-(x - 1) - 2 = -\frac{m}{100}$

Solving these equations for $x$, we get:
1. $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$
2. $x = 1 - \frac{m}{100}$
3. $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$
4. $x = 1 + \frac{m}{100}$

For these equations to have four distinct solutions, the values of $x$ must be distinct for each equation. This means that the constants on the right side must be distinct: $3 + \frac{m}{100}$, $1 - \frac{m}{100}$, $3 - \frac{m}{100}$, and $1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Setting these four values to be distinct, we get the following inequalities:
1. $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq 1 - \frac{m}{100}$
2. $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq 3 - \frac{m}{100}$
3. $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq 1 + \frac{m}{100}$
4. $1 - \frac{m}{100} \neq 3 - \frac{m}{100}$
5. $1 - \frac{m}{100} \neq 1 + \frac{m}{100}$
6. $3 - \frac{m}{100} \neq 1 + \frac{m}{100}$

Simplifying these inequalities, we get:
1. $m \neq -50$
2. $m \neq 0$
3. $m \neq 50$
4. $m \neq 100$
5. $m \neq 0$ (this is a repeat of inequality 2)
6. $m \neq 150$

The only values of $m$ that satisfy all these inequalities are $m = 100$. However, this value of $m$ gives us only three distinct solutions, not four. So, there are no values of $m$ that make the original equation have four distinct solutions.

However, we have made a mistake in our reasoning. The original equation is equivalent to the system of equations $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$. But we only considered the case where the right side of the equation is positive. We should also consider the case where the right side of the equation is negative. In this case, the system of equations becomes $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$ and $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$.

Following the same reasoning as before, we find that the only values of $m$ that make the original equation have four distinct solutions are $m = 50$ and $m = 150$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions is 2. The answer is $\boxed{2}$.
