Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

The expression $A \cdot B = 0$ means that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Thus, the given equation is equivalent to either
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$$
or
$$((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$

For the first equation to be zero, we must have both $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the square as $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, and $(-10, 0)$.

For the second equation to be zero, we must have both $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the square as $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The four squares form a 8 by 10 rectangle. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $8 \times 10 = 80$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 80.
The answer is: $80$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm10$ and $x - y = \pm10$. Solving these four equations, we get four vertices of the polygon: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$.

2. Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm8$ and $y = \pm8$. So the polygon is a square with side length 16.

3. To find the area of the square, we simply square the length of one side: $16^2 = 256$.

Now, let's write a python script to calculate the area:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so one or both of the expressions must be zero. Let's look at the two expressions:

1. $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$. This equation is only possible when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two squares in the coordinate plane, centered at the origin with side length 20.

2. $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. This equation is only possible when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which are the equations of two squares in the coordinate plane, centered at the origin with side length 16.

The intersection of the two squares is a square with side length 8 (the smaller one), which means that the area of the convex polygon is $8^2 = 64$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 64 square units. The answer is: $64$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. This means that the solutions to the equation are the union of the solutions to each of the two equations:

1. $(|x+y| - 10)^2 + (|x-y| - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(|x| - 8)^2 + (|y| - 8)^2 = 0$

From the first equation, we have $|x+y| = 10$ and $|x-y| = 10$. The solutions to these equations are all points $(x, y)$ that are at a distance of 10 from the lines $x+y=0$, $x+y=10$, $x-y=0$, and $x-y=10$. These lines form a square with side length 10.

From the second equation, we have $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. The solutions to these equations are all points $(x, y)$ that are at a distance of 8 from the x-axis and the y-axis. These lines form a square with side length 16.

The convex polygon is the intersection of these two squares, which is a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    # The side length of the square is 10
    side_length = 10

    # The area of the square is side_length^2
    area = side_length**2

The area of the convex polygon is $100$. The answer is: $100$.

The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.
The first term is zero when $|x+y| = 10$ and $|x-y| = 10$.
The second term is zero when $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$.
From $|x+y| = 10$, we have $x+y = \pm 10$ and $x-y = \pm 10$.
Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0), (8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8),$ and $(-8, -8)$.

The polygon formed by these vertices is a square with side length 10. So, the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The expression $A = ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if at least one of the factors is equal to zero. This gives us the following four conditions:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ which implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ which implies $\vert y \vert = 8$.

From conditions 3 and 4, we deduce that $-8 \le x, y \le 8$.

From conditions 1 and 2, we have:

- For $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$, we get $x = \pm 10$ and $y = 0$.
- For $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \mp 10$, we get $x = 0$ and $y = \pm 10$.

So the points that satisfy the conditions are $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0),$ and $(-10, 0)$. These points form a square with side length 20, so its area is $20^2 = 400$.

So the area of the polygon is 400. The answer is: $400$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_ 2= (-16,2).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that
\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as
\[\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1.\]Find $h + k + a + b.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. 

For the first expression, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, both terms must be zero, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This results in a square with side length 20, centered at the origin.

For the second expression, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, both terms must be zero, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This results in a square with side length 16, centered at the origin.

The convex polygon formed by the intersection of these two squares is a smaller square with side length 16 (the side length of the second square), because the first square (with side length 20) encloses the second square.

The area of a square is given by the square of the side length, so the area of the convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation involves absolute values, which can be tricky to handle directly in Sympy. However, we can rewrite the absolute values as:

$$\vert x \vert = \begin{cases} x, & \text{if } x \ge 0 \\ -x, & \text{if } x < 0 \end{cases}$$

$$\vert y \vert = \begin{cases} y, & \text{if } y \ge 0 \\ -y, & \text{if } y < 0 \end{cases}$$

So, we need to consider four cases for the absolute values in the given equation:

1. $x \ge 0$ and $y \ge 0$
2. $x < 0$ and $y < 0$
3. $x \ge 0$ and $y < 0$
4. $x < 0$ and $y \ge 0$

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

The output is empty because the Sympy's solve function cannot handle absolute value equations directly. However, we can solve this problem using a different approach.

The given equation is a product of two equations equal to zero. This means either the first equation is zero or the second equation is zero. Let's consider each equation separately.

For the first equation:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$$
This equation is true only when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that the points $(x, y)$ lie on a square with side length 20. The vertices of the square are $(10, 0), (0, 10), (-10, 0),$ and $(0, -10)$.

For the second equation:
$$((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$
This equation is true only when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that the points $(x, y)$ lie on a square with side length 16. The vertices of the square are $(8, 0), (0, 8), (-8, 0),$ and $(0, -8)$.

The intersection of these two squares is a smaller square with side length 8. The vertices of this square are $(4, 4), (4, -4), (-4, 4),$ and $(-4, -4)$.

The area of the smaller square is $8^2 = 64$. So, the area of the convex polygon is 64 square units.
The answer is: $64$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, we know that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, we can split the equation into two separate cases:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10$.
Case 2: $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x - y \vert = 10$.
Case 3: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8$.
Case 4: $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert y \vert = 8$.

For each case, we can solve for the absolute values and get the corresponding equations. The solutions to these equations will give us the vertices of the polygon.

1. For case 1, we have $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.
2. For case 2, we have $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.
3. For case 3, we have $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.
4. For case 4, we have $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

Now, we can find the vertices of the polygon by solving these equations:

1. For $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, we get $x = 5$ and $y = 5$.
2. For $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$, we get $x = 0$ and $y = 10$.
3. For $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$, we get $x = -5$ and $y = -5$.
4. For $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$, we get $x = 0$ and $y = -10$.
5. For $x = 8$ and $y = 8$, we get $x = 8$ and $y = 8$.
6. For $x = 8$ and $y = -8$, we get $x = 8$ and $y = -8$.
7. For $x = -8$ and $y = 8$, we get $x = -8$ and $y = 8$.
8. For $x = -8$ and $y = -8$, we get $x = -8$ and $y = -8$.

The vertices of the polygon are $(5, 5)$, $(0, 10)$, $(-5, -5)$, $(0, -10)$, $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$. We can now plot these points on a graph and determine the shape of the polygon. The polygon is a square with side length 10.

To find the area of the square, we use the formula for the area of a square, which is $side^2$. In this case, the side length is 10, so the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100.
The answer is: $100$
