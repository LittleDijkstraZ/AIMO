**Problem:** 
"How many solutions does the equation \[\frac{(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)\dotsm(x-100)}{(x-1^2)(x-2^2)(x-3^2)\dotsm(x-100^2)} = 0\]have for $x$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Any solution to this equation must make the numerator of the left-hand side zero, while keeping the denominator non-zero. The numerator is zero when $x$ is one of the numbers $1, 2, 3, \dots, 100.$ However, for any value in this list that is a perfect square, the denominator will also be zero, so that value of $x$ will not be a root. Therefore, we want to find the number of integers in the list $1, 2, \dots, 100$ which are not perfect squares. The perfect squares in the list are $1^2, 2^2, \dots, 10^2,$ so there are $10$ perfect squares, and \[100 - 10 = \boxed{90}\]integers which are not perfect squares. The answer is $\boxed{90}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}=1$. So we need to solve the equation $| |x-1|-2|=1$. This equation is equivalent to two cases:

1. $|x-1|-2=1$
2. $|x-1|-2=-1$

For the first case, we have $|x-1|=3$, which gives us two equations: $x-1=3$ and $x-1=-3$. Solving these gives us $x=4$ and $x=-2$.

For the second case, we have $|x-1|=1$, which gives us two equations: $x-1=1$ and $x-1=-1$. Solving these gives us $x=2$ and $x=0$.

So the solutions to the equation $| |x-1|-2|=1$ are $x=4$, $x=-2$, $x=2$, and $x=0$. Therefore, the value of $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $m=100$. The answer is $\boxed{1}$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many distinct solutions are there to the equation $|x-7| = |x+1|$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
If $|x-7| = |x+1|$, then either $x-7 = x+1$ or $x-7 = -(x+1)$.  Simplifying $x-7=x+1$ gives $0=8$, which has no solutions, so no values of $x$ satisfy $x-7 = x+1$.  If $x-7 = -(x+1)$, then $x-7 = -x-1$, so $2x = 6$, which gives $x=3$.  So, there is $\boxed{1}$ solution.

Challenge: See if you can find a quick solution to this problem by simply thinking about the graphs of $y=|x-7|$ and $y=|x+1|$. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

## QUESTION 2 - 5

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let \[f(x) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
-x + 3 & \text{if } x \le 0, \\
2x - 5 & \text{if } x > 0.
\end{array}
\right.\]How many solutions does the equation $f(f(x)) = 4$ have?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
To solve the equation $f(f(x)) = 4,$ we first find the values $x$ such that $f(x) = 4.$

Either $f(x) = -x + 3$ (for $x \le 0$) or $f(x) = 2x - 5$ (for $x > 0$). If $-x + 3 = 4,$ then $x = -1.$ Note that this value satisfies $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = 4,$ then $x = 9/2.$ Note that this value satisfies $x > 0.$ Therefore, the solutions to $f(x) = 4$ are $x = -1$ and $x = 9/2.$

Next, we solve for the values $x$ such that $f(x) = -1.$ If $-x + 3 = -1,$ then $x = 4.$ This value does not satisfy $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = -1,$ then $x = 2.$ This value satisfies $x > 0.$

Finally, we solve for the values $x$ such that $f(x) = 9/2.$ If $-x + 3 = 9/2,$ then $x = -3/2.$ This value satisfies $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = 9/2,$ then $x = 19/4.$ This value satisfies $x > 0.$

Therefore, the equation $f(f(x)) = 4$ has the solutions $x = 2,$ $-3/2,$ and $19/4,$ for a total of $\boxed{3}$ solutions. The answer is $\boxed{3}$

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


This problem is a complex problem that involves understanding the properties of the absolute value function and solving equations with multiple absolute values. It also requires analyzing the number of solutions for different values of $m$.

Let's start by simplifying the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}.\]

This equation will have $4$ distinct solutions when the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, equals $\frac{m}{100}$, $-\frac{m}{100}$, $2-\frac{m}{100}$, and $-2-\frac{m}{100}$.

This gives us the system of equations:

1. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$
2. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$
3. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 2-\frac{m}{100}$
4. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -2-\frac{m}{100}$

Solving each of these equations will give us the values of $m$ for which the original equation has $4$ distinct solutions.

After solving these equations, we find that only the second equation has a positive integer solution for $m$. The value of $m$ that satisfies this equation is $m=200$. Therefore, the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has $4$ distinct solutions only when $m=200$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $1$. The answer is: $1$

Next, we solve for the values $x$ such that $f(x) = -1.$ If $-x + 3 = -1,$ then $x = 4.$ This value does not satisfy $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = -1,$ then $x = 2.$ This value satisfies $x > 0.$

Therefore, the equation $f(f(x)) = 4$ has the solutions $x = 2,$ $-3/2,$ and $19/4,$ for a total of $\boxed{3}$ solutions. The answer is $\boxed{3}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



We first note that the expression $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|$ is always between 0 and 2, inclusive. Therefore, the right hand side $\frac{m}{100}$ must also be between 0 and 2. This gives us the inequality $0 \leq \frac{m}{100} \leq 2$, which simplifies to $0 \leq m \leq 200$.

Now we need to find for how many values of $m$ in this range the equation $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly 4 distinct solutions. 

We can start by analyzing the equation $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|=\frac{m}{100}$. The expression $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|$ can be either of the form $|u-2|$ or $|u+2|$, where $u = |x-1|$. 

The graph of $|u-2|$ has a V-shape with the vertex at $(2,0)$, and the graph of $|u+2|$ has a similar V-shape but with the vertex at $(-2,0)$. The equation $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|=\frac{m}{100}$ will have 4 distinct solutions when the horizontal line $y=\frac{m}{100}$ intersects these V-shapes in exactly 4 places.

This happens when $\frac{m}{100}=1$, which gives $m=100$. 

Therefore, the equation $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions only when $m=100$. So, there is only one positive integer $m$ that satisfies the condition.
The answer is $\boxed{1}$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many solutions does the equation \[\frac{(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)\dotsm(x-100)}{(x-1^2)(x-2^2)(x-3^2)\dotsm(x-100^2)} = 0\]have for $x$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Any solution to this equation must make the numerator of the left-hand side zero, while keeping the denominator non-zero. The numerator is zero when $x$ is one of the numbers $1, 2, 3, \dots, 100.$ However, for any value in this list that is a perfect square, the denominator will also be zero, so that value of $x$ will not be a root. Therefore, we want to find the number of integers in the list $1, 2, \dots, 100$ which are not perfect squares. The perfect squares in the list are $1^2, 2^2, \dots, 10^2,$ so there are $10$ perfect squares, and \[100 - 10 = \boxed{90}\]integers which are not perfect squares. The answer is $\boxed{90}$

The above code fails because we have not assigned a value to the variable `m` before using it in the equation. We need to fix this.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solveset, Abs, S, Rational

def find_m():
    # Define the variable
    x = symbols('x')
    m = symbols('m')

    # Define the equation
    equation = Eq(Abs(Abs(x - 1) - 2), Rational(m, 100))

    # Initialize counter
    counter = 0

    # Loop through possible values of m
    for m_value in range(1, 101):
        # Solve the equation for each value of m
        solutions = solveset(equation.subs('m', m_value), x, domain=S.Reals)
        # Check if the number of solutions is 4
        if len(solutions) == 4:
            counter += 1

    return counter

result = find_m()
print(result)
```

The above code still fails because we are trying to substitute a symbol `m` with a value in the equation. We need to solve the equation symbolically first, and then substitute the value of `m` after that.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solveset, Abs, S, Rational

def find_m():
    # Define the variable
    x = symbols('x')
    m = symbols('m')

    # Define the equation
    equation = Eq(Abs(Abs(x - 1) - 2), Rational(m, 100))

    # Solve the equation symbolically
    solutions = solveset(equation, x, domain=S.Reals)

    # Initialize counter
    counter = 0

    # Loop through possible values of m
    for m_value in range(1, 101):
        # Substitute the value of m in the solutions
        solutions_m = [solution.subs('m', m_value) for solution in solutions]
        # Check if the number of solutions is 4
        if len(solutions_m) == 4:
            counter += 1

    return counter

result = find_m()
print(result)
```

    raise TypeError('invalid input: %s' % p)

```

The above code still fails because we are trying to substitute a symbol `m` with a value in the solutions list. We need to solve the equation symbolically first, and then substitute the value of `m` after that. Let's correct this.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solveset, Abs, S, Rational

def find_m():
    # Define the variable
    x = symbols('x')
    m = symbols('m')

    # Define the equation
    equation = Eq(Abs(Abs(x - 1) - 2), Rational(m, 100))

    # Solve the equation symbolically
    solutions = solveset(equation, x, domain=S.Reals)

## QUESTION 2 - 10 
- TIME_SPENT : 496 secs

10_
**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many solutions does the equation \[\frac{(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)\dotsm(x-100)}{(x-1^2)(x-2^2)(x-3^2)\dotsm(x-100^2)} = 0\]have for $x$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Any solution to this equation must make the numerator of the left-hand side zero, while keeping the denominator non-zero. The numerator is zero when $x$ is one of the numbers $1, 2, 3, \dots, 100.$ However, for any value in this list that is a perfect square, the denominator will also be zero, so that value of $x$ will not be a root. Therefore, we want to find the number of integers in the list $1, 2, \dots, 100$ which are not perfect squares. The perfect squares in the list are $1^2, 2^2, \dots, 10^2,$ so there are $10$ perfect squares, and \[100 - 10 = \boxed{90}\]integers which are not perfect squares. The answer is $\boxed{90}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve, Abs, N

def count_valid_m():
    """For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"""
    x = symbols('x')
    m_values = []

    for m in range(1, 101):
        equation = Eq(Abs(Abs(x - 1) - 2), m/100)
        solutions = solve(equation, x)
        if len(solutions) == 4:
            m_values.append(m)

    return len(m_values)

result = count_valid_m()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 100

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
100
```
The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $100$. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{100}$.
