**Problem:** 
"What is the minimum value of the expression $x^2+y^2-6x+4y+18$ for real $x$ and $y$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Rearranging the expression, we have  \[x^2-6x+y^2+4y+18\]Completing the square in $x$, we need to add and subtract $(6/2)^2=9$. Completing the square in $y$, we need to add and subtract $(4/2)^2=4$. Thus, we have \[(x^2-6x+9)-9+(y^2+4y+4)-4+18 \Rightarrow (x-3)^2+(y+2)^2+5\]Since the minimum value of $(x-3)^2$ and $(y+2)^2$ is $0$ (perfect squares can never be negative), the minimum value of the entire expression is $\boxed{5}$, and is achieved when $x=3$ and $y=-2$. The answer is $\boxed{5}$

**Solution:**


This problem is a bit tricky to solve directly, but we can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to solve it.

The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states that for any real numbers $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$ and $b_1, b_2, ..., b_n$, we have
\[(a_1^2 + a_2^2 + ... + a_n^2)(b_1^2 + b_2^2 + ... + b_n^2) \geq (a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 + ... + a_nb_n)^2.\]

Let's apply the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to the given problem. Let $a_1 = x$, $a_2 = y$, $b_1 = 1$, and $b_2 = -2$. Then we have
\[(x^2 + y^2)(1^2 + (-2)^2) \geq (x - 2y)^2.\]
Simplifying the left side gives
\[(x^2 + y^2)(1 + 4) \geq (x - 2y)^2 \Rightarrow 5(x^2 + y^2) \geq (x - 2y)^2.\]
Similarly, let $a_1 = y$, $a_2 = x$, $b_1 = -2$, and $b_2 = 1$. Then we have
\[(y^2 + x^2)((-2)^2 + 1^2) \geq (y - 2x)^2.\]
Simplifying the left side gives
\[(y^2 + x^2)(4 + 1) \geq (y - 2x)^2 \Rightarrow 5(y^2 + x^2) \geq (y - 2x)^2.\]
Adding these two inequalities together gives
\[10(x^2 + y^2) \geq (x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2.\]
We are given that $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$, so we can substitute this into the inequality to get
\[10(x^2 + y^2) \geq 40^2 = 1600.\]
Dividing both sides by 10 gives
\[x^2 + y^2 \geq 160.\]
Now, we want to minimize the value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$. We can rewrite this as
\[5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy = 5(x^2 + y^2) - 4(2xy) = 5(x^2 + y^2) - 4[(x + y)^2 - (x^2 + y^2)] = 9(x^2 + y^2) - 4(x + y)^2.\]
Since $x^2 + y^2 \geq 160$, we want to minimize $9(x^2 + y^2) - 4(x + y)^2$.

By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we know that $(x + y)^2 \leq 2(x^2 + y^2)$. Therefore,
\[-4(x + y)^2 \geq -8(x^2 + y^2).\]
So,
\[9(x^2 + y^2) - 4(x + y)^2 \geq 9(x^2 + y^2) - 8(x^2 + y^2) = (x^2 + y^2).\]
Since $x^2 + y^2 \geq 160$, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is $160$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is 160.

**Problem**
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


This problem is a bit more complex than the previous one, and it requires a bit of mathematical insight. However, we can solve it using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.

The given expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ can be rewritten as $5(x^2-1.6xy+y^2)$. Now, we can complete the square inside the parentheses:
\[x^2-1.6xy+y^2 = (x^2-1.6xy+0.64y^2) + 0.36y^2 = (x-0.8y)^2 + 0.36y^2.\]
Since $(x-0.8y)^2$ and $0.36y^2$ are both non-negative, their sum is also non-negative. Therefore, $5(x^2-1.6xy+y^2) \geq 0$.

Now, let's consider the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. By the triangle inequality, we know that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |(x-2y) - (y-2x)| = |x-2y-y+2x| = |x-3y+2x| = |3x-3y| = 3|x-y|$. Therefore, we have $3|x-y| = 40$, which implies $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$.

By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have $(1+1)(x^2+y^2) \geq (x+y)^2$, which simplifies to $2(x^2+y^2) \geq (x+y)^2$. Substituting $x+y = \frac{40}{3}$, we get $2(x^2+y^2) \geq \left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $0$, and it is achieved when $x=0$ and $y=0$. However, these values do not satisfy the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. So, we need to find another way to minimize the expression under the constraint.

Notice that the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ can be rewritten as $5(x^2-1.6xy+y^2) = 5[(x-0.8y)^2 + 0.36y^2]$. Since $(x-0.8y)^2$ and $0.36y^2$ are both non-negative, their sum is minimized when both terms are zero. This happens when $x=0.8y$.

Substituting $x=0.8y$ into the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we get $|0.8y-2y| + |y-1.6y| = 40$, which simplifies to $| -1.2y | + | -0.6y | = 40$. This further simplifies to $1.8y = 40$, so $y = \frac{40}{1.8} = \frac{200}{9}$.

Substituting $y = \frac{200}{9}$ into $x=0.8y$, we get $x = \frac{160}{9}$.

Finally, substituting $x = \frac{160}{9}$ and $y = \frac{200}{9}$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get $5\left(\frac{160}{9}\right)^2 + 5\left(\frac{200}{9}\right)^2 - 8\left(\frac{160}{9}\right)\left(\frac{200}{9}\right) = 0$.

So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $0$. The answer is: $0$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"What is the minimum value of the expression $x^2+y^2+2x-4y+8$ for real $x$ and $y$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Rearranging the expression, we have  \[x^2+2x+y^2-4y+8\]Completing the square in $x$, we need to add and subtract $(2/2)^2=1$. Completing the square in $y$, we need to add and subtract $(4/2)^2=4$. Thus, we have \[(x^2+2x+1)-1+(y^2-4y+4)-4+8 \Rightarrow (x+1)^2+(y-2)^2+3\]Since the minimum value of $(x+1)^2$ and $(y-2)^2$ is $0$ (perfect squares can never be negative), the minimum value of the entire expression is $\boxed{3}$, and is achieved when $x=-1$ and $y=2$. The answer is $\boxed{3}$

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


This problem is a bit tricky to solve directly, but we can simplify it by using the fact that $|x-2y| + |y-2x|$ is always equal to $0$. This is because $|x-2y| = |-(y-2x)|$, so the two absolute values are always equal. Therefore, the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is only possible if both $|x-2y|$ and $|y-2x|$ are equal to $20$. This gives us two cases:

1. $x-2y = 20$ and $y-2x = 20$. Solving this system of equations gives $x = 20$ and $y = -10$.
2. $x-2y = -20$ and $y-2x = -20$. Solving this system of equations gives $x = -20$ and $y = 10$.

Now we substitute these values into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to find the minimum value:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols

def minimum_value():
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # Define the expression
    expr = 5*x**2 + 5*y**2 - 8*x*y

    # Substitute the values of x and y
    value1 = expr.subs({x: 20, y: -10})
    value2 = expr.subs({x: -20, y: 10})

    # Return the minimum value
    return min(value1, value2)

result = minimum_value()
