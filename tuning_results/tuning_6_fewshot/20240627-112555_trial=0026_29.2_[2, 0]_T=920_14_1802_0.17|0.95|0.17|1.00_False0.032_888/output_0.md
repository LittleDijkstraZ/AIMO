**Problem:** 
"The graph of the quadratic $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ is a parabola that passes through the points $(-1,7)$, $(5,7)$, and $(6,10)$.  What is the $x$-coordinate of the vertex of the parabola?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
We could substitute the points into the equation $y = ax^2 + bx + c$, solve for $a$, $b$, and $c$, and then complete the square to find the coordinates of the vertex.

However, a much faster way is to recognize that two of the points, namely $(-1,7)$ and $(5,7)$, have the same $y$-coordinate.  Therefore, these two points are symmetric about the parabola's axis of symmetry.  The axis must pass through the midpoint of the segment connecting these two symmetric points, so the axis must pass through $\left(\frac{-1+5}{2},\frac{7+7}{2}\right)$, which is $(2,7)$.  Therefore, the axis of symmetry is a vertical line through $(2,7)$.  This line is the graph of the equation $x=2$.  The axis of symmetry also passes through the vertex of the parabola, so the $x$-coordinate of the vertex is $\boxed{2}$. The answer is $\boxed{2}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

    # (sqrt(x1^2 + y1^2))^2 + (sqrt(x2^2 + y2^2))^2 = x1^2 + y1^2 + x2^2 + y2^2
    # Since y1 = y2 = 4, this simplifies to (x1^2 + 4^2) + (x2^2 + 4^2) = x1^2 + x2^2 + 32
    # The difference of the squares of two numbers a and b is (a - b)^2 = (a + b)^2 - 4ab

The error in the code is due to a mistake in the calculation. The correct calculation should be:

sum_of_squares = 4*k**2 - 12*k + 32

    k = symbols('k')

    # The sum of the squares of the distances is 4k^2 - 12k + 32

    # Substitute k = 1 (since k > 0, we can choose any positive value, and the result will be the same)

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"The graph of $y=ax^2 + bx + c$ is a parabola with vertical axis of symmetry.  The vertex of this parabola is $(2,3)$ and the parabola contains the point $(4,4)$.  Find the value of $y$ when $x=6$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Because the parabola has vertex $(2,3)$, it is the graph of  \[y=a(x-2)^2+3\] for some number $a$.  In order for the graph to contain the point $(4,4)$, we must also have  \[4=a(4-2)^2+3=4a+3,\] so $a=\frac14$, and our parabola is the graph of \[y=\frac14(x-2)^2 + 3.\] Setting $x=6$ in this gives us  \[y = \frac14(6-2)^2 + 3 = 4+3=\boxed{7}.\] The answer is $\boxed{7}$
