**Problem:** 
"Let $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_ 2= (-16,2).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that
\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as
\[\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1.\]Find $h + k + a + b.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


The problem requires us to find the area of a polygon formed by the intersection of two equations. The first equation is a condition that either $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x-y| - 10 = 0$, and the second equation is a condition that either $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$.

We know that $|x| - a = 0$ implies $x = a$ or $x = -a$, and similarly for $|y| - b = 0$. So the solutions to the second equation are $x = 8$ or $x = -8$, and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. For the first equation, we have two cases:
- If $|x+y| - 10 = 0$, then $x+y = 10$ or $x+y = -10$.
- If $|x-y| - 10 = 0$, then $x-y = 10$ or $x-y = -10$.

Solving these systems of equations, we find the vertices of the polygon:
- For $x+y = 10$ and $x = 8$, we get $y = 2$.
- For $x+y = 10$ and $x = -8$, we get $y = 18$.
- For $x+y = -10$ and $x = 8$, we get $y = -18$.
- For $x+y = -10$ and $x = -8$, we get $y = -2$.
- For $x-y = 10$ and $x = 8$, we get $y = -2$.
- For $x-y = 10$ and $x = -8$, we get $y = -18$.
- For $x-y = -10$ and $x = 8$, we get $y = 18$.
- For $x-y = -10$ and $x = -8$, we get $y = 2$.

So the vertices of the polygon are $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(-8, 18)$, $(-8, -18)$, $(8, 18)$, $(8, -18)$, and $(-8, 2)$.

To find the area of the polygon, we can divide it into four right triangles by drawing lines from the origin to each vertex. The area of each triangle is $\frac{1}{2} \times base \times height$. The base and height of each triangle are all 16 and 8 respectively, so the area of each triangle is $64$. Since there are four triangles, the total area of the polygon is $4 \times 64 = 256$.

So the area of the polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

**Solution:** 



First, let's understand the problem. The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either of the expressions must be zero for the equation to hold true. Therefore, we have two separate cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first case, both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ must be zero. This means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only way this can happen is if $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, and $(-5,-5)$.

For the second case, both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2$ must be zero. This means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The only way this can happen is if $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

Now, we have all the vertices of the polygon: $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, $(-5,-5)$, $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$. We can plot these points on a coordinate plane to see that the polygon is a square with side length $10$. The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side, so the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $100$. The answer is: $100$

**Solution:** 



First, let's understand the problem. We are asked to find the area of the convex polygon formed by the points that satisfy the given equation. The equation is quite complex, and it involves absolute values. The absolute value function in Python is abs().

To solve this problem, we can use the fact that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. This means that the given equation is zero if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From these equations, we can see that the points that satisfy the given equation are the points that satisfy at least one of the following four conditions:
1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$
2. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$
3. $\vert x \vert = 8$
4. $\vert y \vert = 8$

These conditions define a rectangle with vertices at $(\pm 8, 0)$, $(0, \pm 8)$, $(\pm 8, \pm 10)$, and $(\pm 10, \pm 8)$. The area of this rectangle is $2*8*20 = 320$.

So, the area of the convex polygon formed by the points that satisfy the given equation is 320 square units.
The answer is: $320$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Find the number of 10-tuples $(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{10})$ of real numbers such that
\[(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2 = \frac{1}{11}.\]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,
\begin{align*}
&[(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + \dots + 1^2 + 1^2)][(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2] \\
&\ge [(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + (x_2 - x_3) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10}]^2 = 1.
\end{align*}From the given condition, we have equality, so by the equality condition for Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[\frac{1 - x_1}{1} = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{1} = \frac{x_2 - x_3}{1} = \dots = \frac{x_9 - x_{10}}{1} = \frac{x_{10}}{1}.\]Let
\[d = 1 - x_1 = x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_3 = \dots = x_9 - x_{10} = x_{10}.\]Then
\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so
\[(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_{10}) = \left( \frac{10}{11}, \frac{9}{11}, \frac{8}{11}, \dots, \frac{1}{11} \right).\]In particular, there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the equation
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0\]is satisfied if and only if either
\[(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0\]or
\[(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0.\]The first equation is satisfied if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives the vertices of a square with side length 10. The second equation is satisfied if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives the vertices of a square with side length 16.

Therefore, the points satisfying the original equation enclose a convex polygon which is the union of two squares: one with side length 10 and one with side length 16. The area of a square with side length $s$ is $s^2$, so the area of the polygon is $10^2 + 16^2 = 100 + 256 = 356$.

```
The area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{356}$.

**Note:** The problem asks for the area of the convex polygon formed by the points that satisfy the given equation. The points that satisfy the equation form two squares: one with side length 10 and one with side length 16. The area of the polygon is the sum of the areas of these two squares. The area of a square is given by the square of the side length. So the area of the polygon is $10^2 + 16^2 = 100 + 256 = 356$. The answer is $\boxed{356}$.

FAIL

```
The sympy solution failed because sympy is not capable of solving this complex piecewise function. 

However, the problem can be solved geometrically. The condition $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that either $|x + y| = 10$ or $|x - y| = 10$. These are the equations of two lines passing through the origin, making an angle of $90^\circ$ with each other. Similarly, the condition $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $|x| = 8$ or $|y| = 8$, which are the equations of two lines passing through the origin, making an angle of $90^\circ$ with each other.

The intersection of these lines form a square with side length $16$. Therefore, the area of the polygon is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Find the number of 10-tuples $(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{10})$ of real numbers such that
\[(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2 = \frac{1}{11}.\]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,
\begin{align*}
&[(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + \dots + 1^2 + 1^2)][(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2] \\
&\ge [(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + (x_2 - x_3) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10}]^2 = 1.
\end{align*}From the given condition, we have equality, so by the equality condition for Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[\frac{1 - x_1}{1} = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{1} = \frac{x_2 - x_3}{1} = \dots = \frac{x_9 - x_{10}}{1} = \frac{x_{10}}{1}.\]Let
\[d = 1 - x_1 = x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_3 = \dots = x_9 - x_{10} = x_{10}.\]Then
\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so
\[(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_{10}) = \left( \frac{10}{11}, \frac{9}{11}, \frac{8}{11}, \dots, \frac{1}{11} \right).\]In particular, there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. Therefore, either the first term is zero, or the second term is zero. 

The first term is zero when $|x + y| = 10$ or $|x - y| = 10$. These are the equations of two lines in the plane. 

The second term is zero when $|x| = 8$ or $|y| = 8$, which are the equations of two more lines in the plane. 

The four lines intersect at the points $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$. These points form a rectangle with side lengths $16$ and $16$, so its area is $256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $256$.

Here is a Python program that calculates the area of the rectangle:
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def rectangle_area():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    # The sides of the rectangle are 16 units long
    side_length = 16

    # Calculate the area of the rectangle
    area = side_length ** 2

    return area

result = rectangle_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is $256$ square units. The answer is $\boxed{256}$.
