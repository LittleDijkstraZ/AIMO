Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, we set the two equations equal to each other to find the intersection points: $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$.
2. Rearrange the equation to a standard quadratic form: $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$.
3. Let's denote the roots of this equation as $x_1$ and $x_2$, which represent the x-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$. We know that the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, so we have $|x_2 - x_1| = 6$.
4. According to the properties of quadratic equations, the difference of the roots is given by $\frac{2\sqrt{D}}{a}$, where $D$ is the discriminant of the quadratic equation and $a$ is the coefficient of $x^2$. In our case, $a = k$, so the difference of the roots is $\frac{2\sqrt{(2k)^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{k} = 6$.
5. Simplify the equation: $2\sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k} = 6k$.
6. Square both sides to eliminate the square root: $4(4k^2 - 4kl + 16k) = 36k^2$.
7. Simplify the equation: $16k^2 - 16kl + 64k = 36k^2$.
8. Rearrange the equation: $20k^2 - 16kl + 64k = 0$.
9. This is a quadratic equation in $k$. We can solve it using the quadratic formula: $k = \frac{16l \pm \sqrt{(16l)^2 - 4*20*64}}{2*20}$.
10. Let's denote the roots of this equation as $k_1$ and $k_2$. We know that $k > 0$, so we choose the positive root: $k = \frac{16l + \sqrt{(16l)^2 - 4*20*64}}{40}$.
11. Substitute $k$ into the quadratic equation and solve for $l$.
12. Now we have the values of $k$ and $l$.
13. The distance from $A$ and $B$ to the origin can be found using the distance formula: $d_1 = \sqrt{x_1^2 + y_1^2} = \sqrt{x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2}$, and $d_2 = \sqrt{x_2^2 + y_2^2} = \sqrt{x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2}$.
14. Calculate the sum of the squares of the distances: $S = d_1^2 + d_2^2$.
15. Simplify the expression and substitute the values of $k$ and $l$.
16. Finally, we get the numerical answer.

However, solving this problem using sympy directly is not straightforward because it requires solving a quadratic equation and then calculating the sum of squares of distances. Instead, we can use a numerical method to find the values of $k$ and $l$. Here's a Python script to do that:

```python

    k, l = symbols('k l')

    # Substitute k into the quadratic equation and solve for l
    l_value = solve(k_value**2 - 2*k_value*l + l**2 - 4, l)[0]
    # Calculate the sum of squares of distances
    S = 2 * (k_value**2 + l_value**2)
    return S

result = solve_problem()
print(result)
```

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"The smallest distance between the origin and a point on the parabola $y=x^2-5$ can be expressed as $\sqrt{a}/b$, where $a$ and $b$ are positive integers, and $a$ is not divisible by the square of any prime.  Find $a+b$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the distance formula, we are trying to minimize $\sqrt{x^2+y^2}=\sqrt{x^2+x^4-10x^2+25}$. In general minimization problems like this require calculus, but one elementary optimization method that sometimes works is completing the square.  We have $$\sqrt{x^2+x^4-10x^2+25}=\sqrt{(x^2-9/2)^2+(25-81/4)}.$$This expression is minimized when the square equals $0$, i.e. when $x=\pm 3/\sqrt{2}.$ For this value of $x$, the distance is $$\sqrt{25-\frac{81}{4}}=\frac{\sqrt{19}}{2}.$$Hence the desired answer is $\boxed{21}$. The answer is $\boxed{21}$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"The graph of $y=ax^2 + bx + c$ is a parabola with vertical axis of symmetry.  The vertex of this parabola is $(2,3)$ and the parabola contains the point $(4,4)$.  Find the value of $y$ when $x=6$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Because the parabola has vertex $(2,3)$, it is the graph of  \[y=a(x-2)^2+3\] for some number $a$.  In order for the graph to contain the point $(4,4)$, we must also have  \[4=a(4-2)^2+3=4a+3,\] so $a=\frac14$, and our parabola is the graph of \[y=\frac14(x-2)^2 + 3.\] Setting $x=6$ in this gives us  \[y = \frac14(6-2)^2 + 3 = 4+3=\boxed{7}.\] The answer is $\boxed{7}$

CODE RESULTS Abs((k - sqrt(k*(k - l + 4)))/k)**2 + Abs((k + sqrt(k*(k - l + 4)))/k)**2

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
Abs((k - sqrt(k*(k - l + 4)))/k)**2 + Abs((k + sqrt(k*(k - l + 4)))/k)**2
```
The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is given by the expression:
\[Abs((k - sqrt(k*(k - l + 4)))/k)**2 + Abs((k + sqrt(k*(k - l + 4)))/k)**2\]
However, we know that the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6. Using the distance formula for parabolas, we have:
\[6^2 = (2k)^2 - 4(k*(k - l + 4))\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[36 = 4k^2 - 4k^2 + 4l - 16\]
\[36 = 4l - 16\]
\[4l = 52\]
\[l = 13\]
Substituting $l = 13$ into the expression for the sum of squares of distances, we get:
\[Abs((k - sqrt(k*(k - 13 + 4)))/k)**2 + Abs((k + sqrt(k*(k - 13 + 4)))/k)**2\]
\[Abs((k - sqrt(k*(k - 9)))/k)**2 + Abs((k + sqrt(k*(k - 9)))/k)**2\]
\[Abs((k - sqrt(k^2 - 9k))/k)**2 + Abs((k + sqrt(k^2 - 9k))/k)**2\]
Now, we need to find the value of $k$ that makes this expression valid. Since the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points, the discriminant of the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$ must be greater than 0. The discriminant is given by $b^2 - 4ac$, where $a = k$, $b = -2k$, and $c = l - 4$. So we have:
\[(-2k)^2 - 4*k*(l - 4) > 0\]
\[4k^2 - 4k*(13 - 4) > 0\]
\[4k^2 - 36k > 0\]
\[4k(k - 9) > 0\]
The solutions to this inequality are $k < 0$ or $k > 9$. However, since $k > 0$, we must have $k > 9$. Let's choose $k = 10$ for simplicity. Substituting $k = 10$ into the expression for the sum of squares of distances, we get:
\[Abs((10 - sqrt(10*(10 - 9)))/10)**2 + Abs((10 + sqrt(10*(10 - 9)))/10)**2\]
\[Abs((10 - 1)/10)**2 + Abs((10 + 1)/10)**2\]
\[Abs(9/10)**2 + Abs(11/10)**2\]
\[81/100 + 121/100 = 202/100 = 2.02\]
However, this result doesn't make sense because the sum of squares of distances should be a positive number. Let's try a different value of $k$. If we choose $k = 1$, we get:
\[Abs((1 - sqrt(1*(1 - 13 + 4)))/1)**2 + Abs((1 + sqrt(1*(1 - 13 + 4)))/1)**2\]
\[Abs((1 - sqrt(-8))/1)**2 + Abs((1 + sqrt(-8))/1)**2\]
This doesn't make sense either because we cannot take the square root of a negative number. Let's try a different approach.

From the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$, we can use the quadratic formula to find the roots:
\[x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{(-2k)^2 - 4*k*(l - 4)}}{2k} = 1 \pm \sqrt{1 - (l - 4)/k}\]
Since the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, we have:
\[6 = 2\sqrt{1 - (l - 4)/k}\]
Squaring both sides, we get:
\[36 = 4(1 - (l - 4)/k)\]
\[9 = 1 - (l - 4)/k\]
\[8 = (l - 4)/k\]
\[l - 4 = 8k\]
Substituting $l = 13$, we get:
\[13 - 4 = 8k\]
\[9 = 8k\]
\[k = 9/8\]
Substituting $k = 9/8$ into the expression for the sum of squares of distances, we get:
\[Abs((9/8 - sqrt((9/8)*(9/8 - 13 + 4)))/(9/8))**2 + Abs((9/8 + sqrt((9/8)*(9/8 - 13 + 4)))/(9/8))**2\]
\[Abs((9/8 - sqrt((9/8)*(-8/8)))/(9/8))**2 + Abs((9/8 + sqrt((9/8)*(-8/8)))/(9/8))**2\]
\[Abs((9/8 - 1/8)/(9/8))**2 + Abs((9/8 + 1/8)/(9/8))**2\]
\[Abs(1/1)**2 + Abs(11/9)**2\]
\[1 + 121/81 = 202/81\]
This result still doesn't make sense because the sum of squares of distances should be a positive number. Let's try a different approach.

From the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$, we can use the discriminant to find the sum of squares of distances:
\[(2k)^2 - 4*k*(l - 4) = 4k^2 - 4k*(l - 4)\]
\[4k^2 - 4k*(l - 4) = 36\]
\[4k^2 - 4k*(13 - 4) = 36\]
\[4k^2 - 36k = 36\]
\[4k^2

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Step 1: We have the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ and the line $y = 4$. The points of intersection are found by setting the equations equal to each other: $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$. Rearranging terms gives $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$. This is a quadratic equation, and we know that it has two solutions (the points $A$ and $B$).

Step 2: The distance between these two points is given as 6. In the complex plane, the distance between two points $z_1$ and $z_2$ is given by $|z_1 - z_2|$. So if $z_1$ and $z_2$ are the complex numbers corresponding to the points $A$ and $B$, then $|z_1 - z_2| = 6$.

Step 3: The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $|z_1|^2 + |z_2|^2$. By the triangle inequality, we have $|z_1 + z_2|^2 = |z_1|^2 + |z_2|^2 + 2\operatorname{Re}(z_1\bar{z}_2)$, where $\bar{z}$ is the complex conjugate of $z$.

Step 4: We know that $z_1 + z_2 = 2\operatorname{Re}(\operatorname{Root}(kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0))$, where $\operatorname{Root}(kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0)$ is a root of the quadratic equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$.

Step 5: We also know that $|z_1 + z_2| = 6$ from Step 2. So we can set up the equation $6^2 = (2\operatorname{Re}(\operatorname{Root}(kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0)))^2 + 2\operatorname{Re}(z_1\bar{z}_2)$.

Step 6: We want to find $|z_1|^2 + |z_2|^2$, so we can rearrange the equation to get $|z_1|^2 + |z_2|^2 = 6^2 - 2\operatorname{Re}(z_1\bar{z}_2)$.

Step 7: We know that $\operatorname{Re}(z_1\bar{z}_2) = \operatorname{Re}(\operatorname{Root}(kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0)\cdot\overline{\operatorname{Root}(kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0)}) = |\operatorname{Root}(kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0)|^2$.

Step 8: So we can substitute this back into the equation to get $|z_1|^2 + |z_2|^2 = 6^2 - 2|\operatorname{Root}(kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0)|^2$.

Step 9: To find the numerical value, we can use numerical methods to find the roots of the quadratic equation and substitute them into the equation.

Here is the Python code to do this:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solve, Abs, simplify

k, l = symbols('k l')
x = symbols('x')

# Define the quadratic equation
equation = k*x**2 - 2*k*x + l - 4

# Find the roots of the equation
roots = solve(equation, x)

# Calculate the sum of the squares of the distances
sum_of_squares = 6**2 - 2*Abs(roots[0])**2

# Simplify the result
sum_of_squares = simplify(sum_of_squares)

print(sum_of_squares)
```

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
36 - 2*Abs((k - sqrt(k*(k - l + 4)))/k)**2
```
Unfortunately, the expression is still not a simple numerical value. This is because we have not provided numerical values for $k$ and $l$. However, we can use numerical methods to find the sum of the squares of the distances for specific values of $k$ and $l$. For example, if we set $k = 1$ and $l = 1$, we get:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solve, Abs, simplify

k, l = symbols('k l')
x = symbols('x')

# Define the quadratic equation
equation = k*x**2 - 2*k*x + l - 4

# Find the roots of the equation
roots = solve(equation.subs({k: 1, l: 1}), x)

# Calculate the sum of the squares of the distances
sum_of_squares = 6**2 - 2*Abs(roots[0])**2

# Simplify the result
sum_of_squares = simplify(sum_of_squares)

print(sum_of_squares)
```

CODE RESULTS 34

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
34
```
So for $k = 1$ and $l = 1$, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $34$. However, this is just one specific case, and the actual value of the sum of the squares of the distances depends on the values of $k$ and $l$. To find the general solution, we would need to use more advanced techniques or numerical methods to find the roots of the quadratic equation and substitute them into the equation. But for now, we have found that the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $34$ when $k = 1$ and $l = 1$. The answer is: $34$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 To solve this problem, we first need to find the coordinates of points $A$ and $B$. Since the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$, we can set $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$. Rearranging the equation gives $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$. Let's call this equation (1).

The distance between points $A$ and $B$ is given as 6. By the distance formula, if $A = (x_1, y_1)$ and $B = (x_2, y_2)$, then $\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} = 6$. Since $y_1 = y_2 = 4$, this simplifies to $\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2} = 6$, or $|x_2 - x_1| = 6$.

By Vieta's formulas, if the roots of equation (1) are $x_1$ and $x_2$, then $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$. Since $|x_2 - x_1| = 6$, we have $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 36$, which expands to $x_2^2 - 2x_1x_2 + x_1^2 = 36$. Substituting $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$ gives $x_2^2 - 2\frac{l - 4}{k} + x_1^2 = 36$.

The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $x_1^2 + y_1^2 + x_2^2 + y_2^2 = x_1^2 + 4^2 + x_2^2 + 4^2 = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32$. Substituting $x_2^2 - 2\frac{l - 4}{k} + x_1^2 = 36$ gives $x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32 = 36 + 2\frac{l - 4}{k}$.

We need to find the value of $2\frac{l - 4}{k}$ to complete the calculation. Since $x_1 + x_2 = 2$, we can square this equation to get $x_1^2 + 2x_1x_2 + x_2^2 = 4$. Substituting $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$ gives $x_1^2 + 2\frac{l - 4}{k} + x_2^2 = 4$. Rearranging gives $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = 4 - 2\frac{l - 4}{k}$.

Substituting $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = 4 - 2\frac{l - 4}{k}$ into $x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32 = 36 + 2\frac{l - 4}{k}$ gives $4 - 2\frac{l - 4}{k} + 32 = 36 + 2\frac{l - 4}{k}$. Simplifying gives $36 = 4 + 4\frac{l - 4}{k}$, or $32 = 4\frac{l - 4}{k}$. Dividing by 4 gives $8 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$. Multiplying by $k$ gives $8k = l - 4$, or $l = 8k + 4$.

Substituting $l = 8k + 4$ into $2\frac{l - 4}{k}$ gives $2\frac{8k + 4 - 4}{k} = 16$. Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32 = 4 - 2\frac{l - 4}{k} + 32 = 4 - 16 + 32 = 20$.

The answer is: $20$

```output
2*(18*k - l + 4)/k
```
The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $\boxed{\frac{2(18k - l + 4)}{k}}$.

However, we know that the points $A$ and $B$ are on the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$, so we can substitute $y = 4$ into this equation to get $4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l$. Rearranging this equation gives $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$. This is the same equation as the parabola we were given, so the roots of this equation are the x-coordinates of $A$ and $B$. Therefore, the difference of the roots is $\sqrt{(2k)^2 - 4k(l - 4)} = \sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(l - 4)} = \sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k} = 6$. Squaring both sides gives $36 = 4k^2 - 4kl + 16k$. Rearranging this equation gives $4k^2 - 4kl + 16k - 36 = 0$. Dividing through by 4 gives $k^2 - kl + 4k - 9 = 0$. This is a quadratic equation in $k$, and we can solve it to find the value of $k$.

The quadratic formula gives $k = \frac{l \pm \sqrt{l^2 - 4(1)(4l - 9)}}{2}$. Since $k > 0$, we take the positive root, so $k = \frac{l + \sqrt{l^2 - 4(4l - 9)}}{2}$.

Substituting this value of $k$ into the expression for the sum of the squares of the distances gives

\[
\frac{2(18\left(\frac{l + \sqrt{l^2 - 4(4l - 9)}}{2}\right) - l + 4)}{\left(\frac{l + \sqrt{l^2 - 4(4l - 9)}}{2}\right)}.
\]

This simplifies to $32$, so the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $32$. The answer is: $32$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, we need to find the intersection points of the parabola and the line. We can do this by setting $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$.
2. Solving this equation for x will give us the x-coordinates of points A and B.
3. Then, we can find the y-coordinates of A and B by substituting the x-coordinates into the equation of the line $y = 4$.
4. The distances from A and B to the origin can be found using the distance formula $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$.
5. The sum of the squares of these distances is what we want to find.

Now, let's write the code:

 To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:

2. Calculate the distances from A and B to the origin using the coordinates found in step 1.
3. Square these distances and sum them up.

Let's start by writing a Python program to solve the problem:

The output of the program is a complicated expression. However, we know that the distance between A and B is 6, so we can use this information to simplify the expression. The distance between A and B is given by $|A - B| = 6$, which can be written as $|(k + sqrt(k*(k - l + 4))) - (k - sqrt(k*(k - l + 4)))| = 6$. Simplifying this gives $2*sqrt(k*(k - l + 4)) = 6$, so $sqrt(k*(k - l + 4)) = 3$. Squaring both sides gives $k*(k - l + 4) = 9$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $\mathcal{P}$ be the parabola in the plane determined by the equation $y = x^2.$  Suppose a circle $\mathcal{C}$ intersects $\mathcal{P}$ at four distinct points.  If three of these points are $(-28,784),$ $(-2,4),$ and $(13,169),$ find the sum of the distances from the focus of $\mathcal{P}$ to all four of the intersection points."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Let the four intersection points be $(a,a^2),$ $(b,b^2),$ $(c,c^2),$ and $(d,d^2).$  Let the equation of the circle be
\[(x - k)^2 + (y - h)^2 = r^2.\]Substituting $y = x^2,$ we get
\[(x - k)^2 + (x^2 - h)^2 = r^2.\]Expanding this equation, we get a fourth degree polynomial whose roots are $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ and $d.$  Furthermore, the coefficient of $x^3$ is 0, so by Vieta's formulas, $a + b + c + d = 0.$

We are given that three intersection points are $(-28,784),$ $(-2,4),$ and $(13,196),$ so the fourth root is $-((-28) + (-2) + 13) = 17.$

The distance from the focus to a point on the parabola is equal to the distance from the point to the directrix, which is $y = -\frac{1}{4}.$  Thus, the sum of the distances is
\[784 + \frac{1}{4} + 4 + \frac{1}{4} + 169 + \frac{1}{4} + 17^2 + \frac{1}{4} = \boxed{1247}.\] The answer is $\boxed{1247}$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"The smallest distance between the origin and a point on the parabola $y=x^2-5$ can be expressed as $\sqrt{a}/b$, where $a$ and $b$ are positive integers, and $a$ is not divisible by the square of any prime.  Find $a+b$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the distance formula, we are trying to minimize $\sqrt{x^2+y^2}=\sqrt{x^2+x^4-10x^2+25}$. In general minimization problems like this require calculus, but one elementary optimization method that sometimes works is completing the square.  We have $$\sqrt{x^2+x^4-10x^2+25}=\sqrt{(x^2-9/2)^2+(25-81/4)}.$$This expression is minimized when the square equals $0$, i.e. when $x=\pm 3/\sqrt{2}.$ For this value of $x$, the distance is $$\sqrt{25-\frac{81}{4}}=\frac{\sqrt{19}}{2}.$$Hence the desired answer is $\boxed{21}$. The answer is $\boxed{21}$

To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!

2*(2*k - l + 4)/k
```
The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $2\left(\frac{2k - l + 4}{k}\right)$. However, we know that $A$ and $B$ are the solutions of the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$. By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots of this equation is $\frac{2k}{k} = 2$, and the product of the roots is $\frac{l - 4}{k}$. Since the distance between $A$ and $B$ is $6$, we have $(A - B)^2 = (2k)^2 - 4k(l - 4) = 36$. Simplifying, we get $4k^2 - 4kl + 16k = 36k$, or $4k^2 - 4kl + 16k - 36k = 0$, or $4k^2 - 4kl - 20k = 0$. Dividing by $4k$, we get $k - l - 5 = 0$, or $l = k - 5$.

Substituting this into the sum of squares, we get $2\left(\frac{2k - (k - 5) + 4}{k}\right) = 2\left(\frac{k + 9}{k}\right) = 2 + \frac{18}{k}$. Since $k > 0$, the sum of squares is minimized when $k$ is as small as possible. The smallest possible value of $k$ is $1$, so the minimum sum of squares is $2 + 18 = 20$.

Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $20$. The answer is $\boxed{20}$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Find the distance between the vertex of the graph of the equation $y=x^2 + 2x - 6 $ and the point $(4, 5)$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Completing the square, we get $y=(x + 1)^2 - 7 $. The vertex of the graph of this equation is thus $(-1, -7)$.The distance between $(4, 5)$ and $(-1, -7)$ is $\sqrt{(4-(-1))^2 + (5-(-7))^2} = \sqrt{25+144} =\boxed{13}$. The answer is $\boxed{13}$
