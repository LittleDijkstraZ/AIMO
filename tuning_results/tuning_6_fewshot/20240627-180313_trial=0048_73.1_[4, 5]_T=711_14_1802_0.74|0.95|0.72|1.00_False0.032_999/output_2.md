**Problem:** 
"How many solutions does the equation \[\frac{(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)\dotsm(x-100)}{(x-1^2)(x-2^2)(x-3^2)\dotsm(x-100^2)} = 0\]have for $x$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Any solution to this equation must make the numerator of the left-hand side zero, while keeping the denominator non-zero. The numerator is zero when $x$ is one of the numbers $1, 2, 3, \dots, 100.$ However, for any value in this list that is a perfect square, the denominator will also be zero, so that value of $x$ will not be a root. Therefore, we want to find the number of integers in the list $1, 2, \dots, 100$ which are not perfect squares. The perfect squares in the list are $1^2, 2^2, \dots, 10^2,$ so there are $10$ perfect squares, and \[100 - 10 = \boxed{90}\]integers which are not perfect squares. The answer is $\boxed{90}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


The problem asks for how many positive integers $m$ the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

We first need to find the range of $m$ such that the equation has $4$ distinct solutions. We know that the right-hand side $\frac{m}{100}$ must be between $0$ and $2$, because the absolute value of a quantity cannot be negative and it must be less than or equal to $2$ for the equation to have a solution. Therefore, $0 \leq \frac{m}{100} \leq 2$, which gives $0 \leq m \leq 200$.

Next, we need to find the values of $m$ for which the equation has exactly $4$ distinct solutions. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is equivalent to two cases:
1. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.
2. $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.

For the first case, the equation $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ has two distinct solutions when $2 + \frac{m}{100} > 2$, which gives $\frac{m}{100} > 0$ or $m > 0$. The equation $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ has no solution when $2 + \frac{m}{100} < 0$, which gives $\frac{m}{100} < -2$ or $m < -200$, but this is not possible because $m$ must be between $0$ and $200$.

For the second case, the equation $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ has two distinct solutions when $2 - \frac{m}{100} > 0$, which gives $\frac{m}{100} < 2$ or $m < 200$. The equation $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ has no solution when $2 - \frac{m}{100} < 0$, which gives $\frac{m}{100} > 2$ or $m > 200$, but this is not possible because $m$ must be between $0$ and $200$.

Therefore, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions when $0 < m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this condition are $1, 2, \dots, 199$, so there are $199$ such positive integers $m$.

The answer is: $199$.

The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is $1$. However, this result seems incorrect. Let's analyze the equation again.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions for $m=1$. This can be seen by plotting the graph of $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ and $y = \frac{1}{100}$ and observing the intersection points.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is $1$. However, this result seems incorrect. Let's analyze the equation again.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions for $m=1$. This can be seen by plotting the graph of $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ and $y = \frac{1}{100}$ and observing the intersection points.

However, we need to consider the fact that the absolute value function makes the expression non-negative. Therefore, for the equation to have four distinct solutions, the right-hand side of the equation must be strictly positive. This means that $m$ must be strictly greater than $0$.

Let's modify our code to account for this.

```python

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve, Abs

def count_solutions():
    # Define the symbol

The output is not a number, which indicates that something went wrong in our code. Let's retrace our steps and look for the mistake.

The mistake is in the way we are checking the number of solutions. We are iterating over a range of values for $m$ and checking if the equation has 4 distinct solutions for each value. This approach is not correct because the number of solutions depends on the value of $m$. We need to find the values of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions and then count the number of such values.

Let's modify our code to find the values of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many distinct solutions are there to the equation $|x-7| = |x+1|$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
If $|x-7| = |x+1|$, then either $x-7 = x+1$ or $x-7 = -(x+1)$.  Simplifying $x-7=x+1$ gives $0=8$, which has no solutions, so no values of $x$ satisfy $x-7 = x+1$.  If $x-7 = -(x+1)$, then $x-7 = -x-1$, so $2x = 6$, which gives $x=3$.  So, there is $\boxed{1}$ solution.

Challenge: See if you can find a quick solution to this problem by simply thinking about the graphs of $y=|x-7|$ and $y=|x+1|$. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Problem:** 
"Let \[f(x) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
-x + 3 & \text{if } x \le 0, \\
2x - 5 & \text{if } x > 0.
\end{array}
\right.\]How many solutions does the equation $f(f(x)) = 4$ have?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
To solve the equation $f(f(x)) = 4,$ we first find the values $x$ such that $f(x) = 4.$

Either $f(x) = -x + 3$ (for $x \le 0$) or $f(x) = 2x - 5$ (for $x > 0$). If $-x + 3 = 4,$ then $x = -1.$ Note that this value satisfies $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = 4,$ then $x = 9/2.$ Note that this value satisfies $x > 0.$ Therefore, the solutions to $f(x) = 4$ are $x = -1$ and $x = 9/2.$

Next, we solve for the values $x$ such that $f(x) = -1.$ If $-x + 3 = -1,$ then $x = 4.$ This value does not satisfy $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = -1,$ then $x = 2.$ This value satisfies $x > 0.$

Finally, we solve for the values $x$ such that $f(x) = 9/2.$ If $-x + 3 = 9/2,$ then $x = -3/2.$ This value satisfies $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = 9/2,$ then $x = 19/4.$ This value satisfies $x > 0.$

Therefore, the equation $f(f(x)) = 4$ has the solutions $x = 2,$ $-3/2,$ and $19/4,$ for a total of $\boxed{3}$ solutions. The answer is $\boxed{3}$

**Solution:** 



To solve this problem, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. 

We can start by setting $\frac{m}{100}$ to a variable, say $k$. Then we have the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=k$. 

This equation can be solved by considering the different cases for the absolute value:

1. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = k$, then $\vert x-1 \vert = k + 2$. This gives two equations: $x - 1 = k + 2$ or $x - 1 = -(k + 2)$. Solving these gives $x = k + 3$ or $x = -k + 1$.

2. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -k$, then $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - k$. This gives two equations: $x - 1 = 2 - k$ or $x - 1 = -(2 - k)$. Solving these gives $x = k + 1$ or $x = -k + 3$.

So the four solutions are $x = k + 3$, $x = -k + 1$, $x = k + 1$, and $x = -k + 3$. 

For these to be distinct, we must have $k + 3 \neq -k + 1$, $k + 3 \neq k + 1$, $k + 3 \neq -k + 3$, $-k + 1 \neq k + 1$, $-k + 1 \neq -k + 3$, and $k + 1 \neq -k + 3$. 

Simplifying these gives $k \neq -1$, $k \neq 2$, and $k \neq 1$. The only value of $k$ that satisfies all these conditions is $k = 1$. Therefore, we have $\frac{m}{100} = 1$, which gives $m = 100$.

So there is only one value of $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions, and that value is $100$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ is $1$. The answer is: $1$

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. For the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ to have 4 distinct solutions, the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be equivalent to 2. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ will have four distinct solutions when it equals a number greater than or equal to 2.

2. Therefore, we need to solve the equation $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. Multiply both sides by 100 to get $m = 200$.

3. Thus, there is only one positive integer value of $m$ that satisfies the condition, and that is 200.

So the answer is: $200$.
