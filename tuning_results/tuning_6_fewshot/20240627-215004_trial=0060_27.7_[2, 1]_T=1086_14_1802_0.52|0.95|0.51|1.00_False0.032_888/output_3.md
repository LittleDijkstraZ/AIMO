**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many square units are in the area of the triangle whose vertices are the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the curve $y = (x-3)^2 (x+2)$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we need to find where this curve intersects the $x$ and $y$ axes.  If $y=0$, then $(x-3)^2(x+2)=0$, which has solutions of $x=3$ and $x=-2$.  If $x=0$, then $y=(-3)^2(2)=18$.  So, the curve has two $x$-intercepts and one $y$-intercept.  The length of the base along the $x$-axis is $3-(-2)=5$.  The height from this base is equal to the $y$-intercept, 18.  The area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 5\cdot 18=\boxed{45}$. The answer is $\boxed{45}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



To solve this problem, we first need to understand the given equation and the constraints it imposes on the variables x and y. The equation is:

$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$

This equation is equal to zero if either of the two factors is zero. Therefore, we have two sets of constraints:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first set of constraints:

1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$
2. From $\vert x \vert = 8$, we have $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
3. From $\vert y \vert = 8$, we have $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.
4. From $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, we have the following 4 possibilities:
   - If $x = 8$ and $y = 2$,
   - If $x = 8$ and $y = -10$,
   - If $x = -8$ and $y = 10$,
   - If $x = -8$ and $y = -2$.

For the second set of constraints:

1. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$
2. From $\vert x \vert = 8$, we have $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
3. From $\vert y \vert = 8$, we have $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.
4. From $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, we have the following 4 possibilities:
   - If $x = 2$ and $y = -8$,
   - If $x = 10$ and $y = 8$,
   - If $x = -8$ and $y = -10$,
   - If $x = -2$ and $y = 8$.

So, the points that satisfy the constraints are:

(8, 2), (8, -10), (-8, 10), (-8, -2), (2, -8), (10, 8), (-8, -10), (-2, 8).

These points form a polygon in the coordinate plane. To find the area of this polygon, we can use the Shoelace formula. The Shoelace formula is used to find the area of a polygon given the coordinates of its vertices. The formula is:

$$A = \frac{1}{2} \vert (x_1y_2 + x_2y_3 + \dots + x_ny_1) - (y_1x_2 + y_2x_3 + \dots + y_nx_1) \vert$$

Applying the Shoelace formula to the given points, we get:

$$A = \frac{1}{2} \vert (8*2 + 8*(-10) + (-8)*10 + (-8)*(-2) + 2*(-8) + (-10)*8 + (-10)*(-8) + 10*8) - ((2)*8 + (-10)*(-8) + 10*8 + (-2)*(-8) + (-8)*2 + 8*(-10) + (-8)*(-10) + 8*(-8)) \vert$$

$$A = \frac{1}{2} \vert (16 - 80 - 80 + 16 - 16 + 80 - 80 + 80) - (16 + 80 + 80 - 16 - 16 - 80 + 80 - 64) \vert$$

$$A = \frac{1}{2} \vert (-128 - (-128)) \vert$$

$$A = \frac{1}{2} \vert 0 \vert$$

$$A = 0$$

However, this result is not possible because the polygon is not degenerate (it has a non-zero area). There must be a mistake in our calculations. Let's retrace our steps and find the mistake.

Upon reexamination, we realize that the Shoelace formula should not yield zero for a non-degenerate polygon. The mistake is in the application of the Shoelace formula. The Shoelace formula is used to find the area of a polygon given the coordinates of its vertices, but we have not correctly ordered the vertices.

The correct ordering of the vertices should be:

(8, 2), (8, -10), (-8, 10), (-8, -2), (2, -8), (10, 8), (-8, -10), (-2, 8).

Now, let's apply the Shoelace formula again:

$$A = \frac{1}{2} \vert (8*2 + 8*(-10) + (-8)*10 + (-8)*(-2) + 2*(-8) + 10*8 + (-8)*(-10) + (-2)*8) - ((2)*8 + (-10)*(-8) + 10*8 + (-2)*(-8) + (-8)*2 + 8*(-10) + (-8)*(-10) + 8*(-8)) \vert$$

$$A = \frac{1}{2} \vert (16 - 80 - 80 + 16 - 16 + 80 - 80 + 16) - (16 + 80 + 80 - 16 - 16 - 80 + 80 - 64) \vert$$

$$A = \frac{1}{2} \vert (-160 - (-160)) \vert$$

$$A = \frac{1}{2} \vert 0 \vert$$

$$A = 0$$

Again, we get zero area, which is not possible. The mistake is in the ordering of the vertices. The correct ordering should be:

(8, 2), (8, -10), (-8, 10), (-8, -2), (2, -8), (10, 8), (-8, -10), (-2, 8).

Now, let's apply the Shoelace formula again:

$$A = \frac{1}{2} \vert (8*2 + 8*(-10) + (-8)*10 + (-8)*(-2) + 2*(-8) + 10*8 + (-8)*(-10) + (-2)*8) - ((2)*8 + (-10)*(-8) + 10*8 + (-2)*(-8) + (-8)*2 + 8*(-10) + (-8)*(-10) + 8*(-8)) \vert$$

$$A = \frac{1}{2} \vert (16 - 80 - 80 + 16 - 16 + 80 - 80 + 16) - (16 + 80 + 80 -

## QUESTION 3 - 1 
- TIME_SPENT : 564 secs

1_
**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_ 2= (-16,2).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that
\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as
\[\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1.\]Find $h + k + a + b.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

**Solution:** 



This problem involves understanding the properties of absolute values and how they interact with equations and inequalities. The key to solving this problem is to recognize that the product of two factors is zero if and only if at least one of the factors is zero. This allows us to break down the problem into separate cases to solve.

The first factor is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. This factor equals to zero if and only if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These two equations represent a square with side length $20$ centered at the origin.

The second factor is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. This factor equals to zero if and only if both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These two equations represent a square with side length $16$ centered at the origin.

The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for. The side length of the smaller square is the minimum of the lengths of the sides of the larger square, which is $8$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of the smaller square, which is $8^2 = 64$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $64$. The answer is: $64$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Find the number of 10-tuples $(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{10})$ of real numbers such that
\[(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2 = \frac{1}{11}.\]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,
\begin{align*}
&[(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + \dots + 1^2 + 1^2)][(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2] \\
&\ge [(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + (x_2 - x_3) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10}]^2 = 1.
\end{align*}From the given condition, we have equality, so by the equality condition for Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[\frac{1 - x_1}{1} = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{1} = \frac{x_2 - x_3}{1} = \dots = \frac{x_9 - x_{10}}{1} = \frac{x_{10}}{1}.\]Let
\[d = 1 - x_1 = x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_3 = \dots = x_9 - x_{10} = x_{10}.\]Then
\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so
\[(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_{10}) = \left( \frac{10}{11}, \frac{9}{11}, \frac{8}{11}, \dots, \frac{1}{11} \right).\]In particular, there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

"Find the number of 10-tuples $(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{10})$ of real numbers such that

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. Therefore, either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

The first term is zero when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These two equations represent two lines in the plane, and their intersection forms a square with side length 20. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.

The second term is zero when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These two equations represent four lines in the plane, and their intersection forms a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

However, the intersection of the two squares is a smaller square with side length 8 and area $8^2 = 64$.

The area of the convex polygon formed by the union of the two squares is the sum of their areas minus the area of the intersection. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $400 + 256 - 64 = 592$.

**Problem:** 
"Find the number of 10-tuples $(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{10})$ of real numbers such that
\[(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2 = \frac{1}{11}.\]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,
\begin{align*}
&[(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + \dots + 1^2 + 1^2)][(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2] \\
&\ge [(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + (x_2 - x_3) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10}]^2 = 1.
\end{align*}From the given condition, we have equality, so by the equality condition for Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[\frac{1 - x_1}{1} = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{1} = \frac{x_2 - x_3}{1} = \dots = \frac{x_9 - x_{10}}{1} = \frac{x_{10}}{1}.\]Let
\[d = 1 - x_1 = x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_3 = \dots = x_9 - x_{10} = x_{10}.\]Then
\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so
\[(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_{10}) = \left( \frac{10}{11}, \frac{9}{11}, \frac{8}{11}, \dots, \frac{1}{11} \right).\]In particular, there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

Let's first consider the first term $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This term is equal to zero when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, and $(0, -10)$.

Now let's consider the second term $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This term is equal to zero when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(8, -8)$.

The intersection of the rectangle and the square is the convex polygon that encloses the points satisfying the given equation. The vertices of the convex polygon are the intersection points of the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, $x - y = -10$, $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These intersection points are $(8, 2)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(2, 8)$, $(-2, 8)$, $(2, -8)$, and $(-2, -8)$.

The convex polygon is a octagon. To find the area of the octagon, we can divide it into two congruent squares of side length 6 (the difference between the distances 8 and 2) and four congruent right triangles with legs of length 6. The area of each square is $6^2 = 36$, and the area of each right triangle is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot 6 \cdot 6 = 18$. So the total area of the octagon is $2 \cdot 36 + 4 \cdot 18 = 72 + 72 = 144$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 144. The answer is: $144$

Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.
The first term is zero when $|\pm x \pm y| = 10$ and the second term is zero when $|\pm x| = 8$ or $|\pm y| = 8$.
The first equation represents a square with side length 20, and the second equation represents a square with side length 16.
The intersection of these two squares forms a convex polygon, which is the area we are looking for.
To find the area of this polygon, we can simply find the area of each square and subtract the area of the intersection.
The area of the first square is $20^2 = 400$, and the area of the second square is $16^2 = 256$.
The intersection of the two squares is a smaller square with side length 8 (since the intersection is formed by the points that satisfy both $|\pm x \pm y| = 10$ and $|\pm x| = 8$ or $|\pm y| = 8$), so its area is $8^2 = 64$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $400 + 256 - 64 = 592$.
The answer is: $592$

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



To solve this problem, we first need to understand that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, we can break down the equation into two separate equations:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first equation, both terms must be zero:

1. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$
2. $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$ which implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$

These two equations represent a square with side length 20 centered at the origin.

For the second equation, both terms must be zero:

1. $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$
2. $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$ which implies $\vert y \vert = 8$

These two equations represent a square with side length 16 centered at the origin.

The intersection of these two squares is a square with side length 8 centered at the origin. The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 64. The answer is: $64$

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero, or the second term is zero, or both are zero.

2. The first term is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, and this term equals zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy this equation form a square with side length 20.

3. The second term is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$, and this term equals zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy this equation form a square with side length 16.

4. Therefore, the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the original equation are those that lie in the intersection of these two squares. The intersection of the two squares is another square, but this time with side length 8 (the smaller of the two side lengths).

5. To find the area of this square, we simply square the side length: $8^2 = 64$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 64 square units. The answer is: $64$

\end{align*}From the given condition, we have equality, so by the equality condition for Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[\frac{1 - x_1}{1} = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{1} = \frac{x_2 - x_3}{1} = \dots = \frac{x_9 - x_{10}}{1} = \frac{x_{10}}{1}.\]Let
\[d = 1 - x_1 = x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_3 = \dots = x_9 - x_{10} = x_{10}.\]Then
\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so
\[(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_{10}) = \left( \frac{10}{11}, \frac{9}{11}, \frac{8}{11}, \dots, \frac{1}{11} \right).\]In particular, there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = \pm 10$.
If $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x - y = \pm 10$.
If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$, which implies $x = \pm 8$.
If $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $y = \pm 8$.

The solutions to these equations are the vertices of the convex polygon.

The vertices of the polygon are:
$(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(2, 8)$, $(-2, 8)$, $(2, -8)$, $(-2, -8)$.

To find the area of the polygon, we can divide it into four right triangles with legs of length 16 and 8. The area of each triangle is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot 16 \cdot 8 = 64$, so the total area of the polygon is $4 \cdot 64 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units.
The answer is: $256$

Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Let $w$ be the width of each of the identical rectangles. Since $PQ=3w$, $RS=2x$ and $PQ=RS$ (because $PQRS$ is a rectangle), then $2x = 3w$, or $$w=\frac{2}{3}x.$$ Therefore, the area of each of the five identical rectangles is $$x\left(\frac{2}{3}x\right)=\frac{2}{3}x^2.$$ Since the area of $PQRS$ is 4000 and it is made up of five of these identical smaller rectangles, then $$5\left(\frac{2}{3}x^2\right)=4000$$ or $$\frac{10}{3}x^2 = 4000$$ or $x^2 = 1200$ or $x \approx 34.6$ which, when rounded off to the nearest integer, is $\boxed{35}.$ The answer is $\boxed{35}$

**Solution:**


The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$.

Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So the square is formed with side length of 16 units.

The area of the square is then $16^2 = 256$.
