**Problem:** 
"For certain ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ of real numbers, the system of equations
\[\begin{aligned} ax+by&=1 \\ x^2 + y^2 &= 50  \end{aligned}\]has at least one solution, and each solution is an ordered pair $(x,y)\,$ of integers. How many such ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ are there?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The graph of $ax+by=1$ is a line, while the graph of $x^2+y^2=50$ is a circle centered at the origin. Therefore, $(a, b)$ satisfies the conditions if and only if the line and circle intersect at least once, and they intersect only at lattice points (points with integer coordinates).

Knowing this, it makes sense to look for lattice points on the circle whose equation is $x^2+y^2=50$. Testing cases, we find that there are twelve lattice points on the circle: $(\pm 1, \pm 7)$, $(\pm 7, \pm 1)$, and $(\pm 5, \pm 5)$ (where the two $\pm$ signs in each pair are independent of each other).

There are $\tbinom{12}{2} = 66$ pairs of these points, and each pair determines a line. However, the graph of $ax+by=1$ can never pass through the origin $(0, 0)$, since if $x=y=0$, then $ax+by=0 \neq 1$. Therefore, the six pairs which consist of diametrically opposed points are invalid, since the line through them passes through the origin. This corrects our count to $66 - 6 = 60$.

In addition, for each of the twelve points, there is a line tangent to the circle at that point, so that the only solution to the system is that one point. This brings the final total to $60 + 12 = \boxed{72}$. The answer is $\boxed{72}$

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


The steps to solve the problem are as follows:

1. We need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.
2. We know that the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, can take on the values of $\frac{m}{100}$, $0$, and $-\frac{m}{100}$.
3. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have four distinct solutions if and only if $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$.
4. This simplifies to $0 < m < 200$.
5. The positive integers $m$ in this range are the integers from $1$ to $199$.
6. However, we need to count the number of these integers that make the equation have exactly four distinct solutions.
7. For each $m$, we need to solve the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ to find the number of solutions.
8. This equation is equivalent to two separate equations: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.
9. For each of these equations, we can split the absolute value into two cases: $x-1 \geq 0$ and $x-1 < 0$.
10. Solving these cases for each equation gives us the number of solutions for each $m$.
11. We can then count the number of $m$ that give us exactly four solutions.

The sympy code to do this is as follows:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Abs, solveset, S

def count_solutions():
    x, m = symbols('x m')
    count = 0
    for m_val in range(1, 200):
        equation1 = Abs(Abs(x - 1) - 2) - m_val / 100
        equation2 = Abs(Abs(x - 1) - 2) + m_val / 100
        solutions1 = solveset(equation1, x, domain=S.Reals)
        solutions2 = solveset(equation2, x, domain=S.Reals)
        if len(solutions1) == 4 and len(solutions2) == 4:
            count += 1
    return count

result = count_solutions()
print(result)
```

Unfortunately, the code above doesn't work as expected. The reason is that the equations $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$ are not equivalent to the original equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. Instead, they are equivalent to the system of equations \[\begin{cases} \vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100} \\ \vert x-1 \vert -2 \neq -\frac{m}{100} \end{cases}\] and \[\begin{cases} \vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100} \\ \vert x-1 \vert -2 \neq \frac{m}{100} \end{cases}\] respectively. This system of equations is more complicated to solve, and it is not guaranteed that it will always give us the correct number of solutions.

However, we can still solve the problem by analyzing the original equation directly. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have four distinct solutions if and only if $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. This simplifies to $0 < m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ in this range are the integers from $1$ to $199$. For each $m$, we need to solve the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ to find the number of solutions. This equation is equivalent to two separate equations: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$. For each of these equations, we can split the absolute value into two cases: $x-1 \geq 0$ and $x-1 < 0$. Solving these cases for each equation gives us the number of solutions for each $m$. We can then count the number of $m$ that give us exactly four solutions.

However, this approach is still not guaranteed to work correctly. The equations $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$ are not equivalent to the original equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. Instead, they are equivalent to the system of equations \[\begin{cases} \vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100} \\ \vert x-1 \vert -2 \neq -\frac{m}{100} \end{cases}\] and \[\begin{cases} \vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100} \\ \vert x-1 \vert -2 \neq \frac{m}{100} \end{cases}\] respectively. This system of equations is more complicated to solve, and it is not guaranteed that it will always give us the correct number of solutions.

Therefore, the problem cannot be solved directly using sympy, and other methods need to be used. However, by analyzing the original equation directly, we can conclude that the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions is exactly $199$. The answer is $\boxed{199}$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many integers are solutions to the equation $$(x-2)^{(25-x^2)}=1?$$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
We need some basic facts from number theory: $a^0 = 1$ for any $a,$ $1^b = 1$ for any $b,$ and $(-1)^c = 1$ if $c$ is an even integer. Unless the base is a complex number (which is excluded since we are looking for integer solutions), there are no other ways to get an RHS of $1.$ Thus, either the exponent is zero $($giving the equation $25 - x^2 = 0),$ the base is $1$ $($giving $x -2 = 1),$ or the base is $-1$ and the exponent is even $($giving the simultaneous equations $x - 2 = -1$ and $25 - x^2 = 2n$ for some integer $n).$ Solving the first equation gives $x = \pm 5,$ and solving the second gives $x = 3.$ The third equation implies that $x = 1,$ in which case $25 - x^2 = 24$ is indeed even, so $x = 1$ is a valid solution. In all, there are $\boxed{4}$ integer solutions. The answer is $\boxed{4}$

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we can start by analyzing the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}.\] 

The right-hand side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be positive, so $m$ must be a positive integer.

The left-hand side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, is a function that takes a real number $x$ and returns a non-negative real number. This function has a graph that is a series of "V"s. Each "V" occurs at $x = 1 \pm 2 = -1, 3$. The function equals 0 when $x$ is in the interval $[-1, 3]$, and it equals $\vert x - 1 \vert - 2$ when $x < -1$ or $x > 3$.

Therefore, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is the height of one of the "V"s in the graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. The heights of the "V"s in the graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ are all numbers from 0 to 2, inclusive. Therefore, the only possible value of $m$ is such that $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, which gives $m = 200$.

So the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is $m = 200$. The answer is: $1$

Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Any solution to this equation must make the numerator of the left-hand side zero, while keeping the denominator non-zero. The numerator is zero when $x$ is one of the numbers $1, 2, 3, \dots, 100.$ However, for any value in this list that is a perfect square, the denominator will also be zero, so that value of $x$ will not be a root. Therefore, we want to find the number of integers in the list $1, 2, \dots, 100$ which are not perfect squares. The perfect squares in the list are $1^2, 2^2, \dots, 10^2,$ so there are $10$ perfect squares, and \[100 - 10 = \boxed{90}\]integers which are not perfect squares. The answer is $\boxed{90}$

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we need to find the value of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly four distinct solutions. 

First, we can simplify the equation by multiplying both sides by 100 to get rid of the fraction: $100 \cdot \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = m$. 

This equation has four distinct solutions when the right-hand side is a number between 100 and 199, inclusive. 

To see why, consider the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. This function takes on all values between 0 and 3, inclusive. Therefore, the equation $f(x) = m/100$ has four distinct solutions when $m/100$ is a number between 1 and 3, inclusive. Multiplying both sides by 100 gives the range of $m$ values we are looking for: $100 \le m \le 199$.

So, the value of $m$ that satisfies the given condition is any integer in the range $[100, 199]$. However, we are asked to find the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy this condition. 

The number of positive integers in this range is simply the difference between the largest and smallest values plus one: $199 - 100 + 1 = 100$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions is 100.
The answer is: $100$

**Problem:** 
"Let \[f(x) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
-x + 3 & \text{if } x \le 0, \\
2x - 5 & \text{if } x > 0.
\end{array}
\right.\]How many solutions does the equation $f(f(x)) = 4$ have?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
To solve the equation $f(f(x)) = 4,$ we first find the values $x$ such that $f(x) = 4.$

Either $f(x) = -x + 3$ (for $x \le 0$) or $f(x) = 2x - 5$ (for $x > 0$). If $-x + 3 = 4,$ then $x = -1.$ Note that this value satisfies $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = 4,$ then $x = 9/2.$ Note that this value satisfies $x > 0.$ Therefore, the solutions to $f(x) = 4$ are $x = -1$ and $x = 9/2.$

Next, we solve for the values $x$ such that $f(x) = -1.$ If $-x + 3 = -1,$ then $x = 4.$ This value does not satisfy $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = -1,$ then $x = 2.$ This value satisfies $x > 0.$

Finally, we solve for the values $x$ such that $f(x) = 9/2.$ If $-x + 3 = 9/2,$ then $x = -3/2.$ This value satisfies $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = 9/2,$ then $x = 19/4.$ This value satisfies $x > 0.$

Therefore, the equation $f(f(x)) = 4$ has the solutions $x = 2,$ $-3/2,$ and $19/4,$ for a total of $\boxed{3}$ solutions. The answer is $\boxed{3}$

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. 

We know that the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a graph that is a series of V's. Each "V" represents a range of $m$ values for which the equation has a certain number of solutions. Specifically, the equation has:

- 0 solutions when $m < 0$,
- 2 solutions when $0 \le m < 200$,
- 4 solutions when $200 \le m < 400$, and
- 2 solutions when $m \ge 400$.

Therefore, the only value of $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is when $200 \le m < 400$. The number of positive integers in this range is $200$.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $1$. The answer is: $1$

In summary, the value of $m$ that makes the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have $4$ distinct solutions is $200$. The number of such values is $1$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $1$.
