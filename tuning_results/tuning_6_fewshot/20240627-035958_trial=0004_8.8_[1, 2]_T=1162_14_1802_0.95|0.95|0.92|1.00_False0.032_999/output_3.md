Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, we need to understand the condition $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. In both cases, the only way this equation can be zero is if the argument of the absolute value equals zero. That gives us two systems of equations:

1. $x + y = 0$ and $x - y = 0$, which gives $x = y = 0$.
2. $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$, which gives four points: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

Now, let's analyze the second condition:

1. If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then the only solution is $(x, y) = (0, 0)$.
2. If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then the only solutions are $(x, y) = (8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

Now we have all the vertices of the polygon: $(0, 0)$, $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$. To find the area of the polygon, we can use the formula for the area of a polygon given its vertices. In this case, it's a square with side length 16. So the area is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



If the expression equals to 0, one of the expressions in the product should be 0.

So we have 2 cases:

1. Either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first case, we have $|x+y| = 10$ and $|x-y| = 10$. This gives us a square with side length 20, so its area is $400$.

For the second case, we have $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$, which gives us a square with side length 16, so its area is $256$.

Since these two cases are non-overlapping, the area of the convex polygon formed by the intersection of these two regions is the sum of the areas of the two squares, which is $400 + 256 = 656$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    # area of the square formed by |x+y| = 10 and |x-y| = 10
    square1_area = 400

    # area of the square formed by |x| = 8 and |y| = 8
    square2_area = 256

    # area of the convex polygon
    polygon_area = square1_area + square2_area

    return polygon_area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 656

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
656
```
The area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{656}$.
The answer is: $656$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.
Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$.
Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
The polygon is a square with side length 16.
The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is equal to zero if and only if either one of the factors is equal to zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
For the first factor to be equal to zero, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.
For the second factor to be equal to zero, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.
The intersection points of these lines are the vertices of the polygon. We can find these vertices by solving the system of equations formed by the intersections of the lines.
The resulting polygon is a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
So the area of the convex polygon is 256.
The answer is: $256$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Find the number of 10-tuples $(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{10})$ of real numbers such that
\[(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2 = \frac{1}{11}.\]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,
\begin{align*}
&[(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + \dots + 1^2 + 1^2)][(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2] \\
&\ge [(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + (x_2 - x_3) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10}]^2 = 1.
\end{align*}From the given condition, we have equality, so by the equality condition for Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[\frac{1 - x_1}{1} = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{1} = \frac{x_2 - x_3}{1} = \dots = \frac{x_9 - x_{10}}{1} = \frac{x_{10}}{1}.\]Let
\[d = 1 - x_1 = x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_3 = \dots = x_9 - x_{10} = x_{10}.\]Then
\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so
\[(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_{10}) = \left( \frac{10}{11}, \frac{9}{11}, \frac{8}{11}, \dots, \frac{1}{11} \right).\]In particular, there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


The sympy-based approach for solving the problem would be as follows:

1. First, we need to recognize that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Thus, the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if and only if at least one of the following two equations is satisfied:
   a. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
   b. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
2. For equation a., it is satisfied if and only if both $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle.
3. For equation b., it is satisfied if and only if both $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So we get four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square.
4. The intersection of the rectangle and the square is the convex polygon that we are looking for. The vertices of this polygon are the intersections of the lines $x + y = \pm 10$, $x - y = \pm 10$, $x = \pm 8$, and $y = \pm 8$. These intersections can be found by solving the systems of equations. The resulting polygon is a square with side length 10 (the shorter diagonal of the rectangle).
5. The area of this square is the square of the side length, which is $10^2 = 100$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. If the product of two numbers is 0, one of the numbers must be zero. Thus, we have two cases:

   a) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
   b) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

2. For case a), we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$, and $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$. Solving these equations, we get four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

3. For case b), we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = 8$ or $x = -8$, and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. Solving these equations, we get four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

4. The eight lines from cases a) and b) form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256.
The answer is: $256$.
