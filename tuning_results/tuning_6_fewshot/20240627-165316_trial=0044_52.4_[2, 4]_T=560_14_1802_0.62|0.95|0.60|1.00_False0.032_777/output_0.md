**Problem:** 
"The graph of the quadratic $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ is a parabola that passes through the points $(-1,7)$, $(5,7)$, and $(6,10)$.  What is the $x$-coordinate of the vertex of the parabola?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
We could substitute the points into the equation $y = ax^2 + bx + c$, solve for $a$, $b$, and $c$, and then complete the square to find the coordinates of the vertex.

However, a much faster way is to recognize that two of the points, namely $(-1,7)$ and $(5,7)$, have the same $y$-coordinate.  Therefore, these two points are symmetric about the parabola's axis of symmetry.  The axis must pass through the midpoint of the segment connecting these two symmetric points, so the axis must pass through $\left(\frac{-1+5}{2},\frac{7+7}{2}\right)$, which is $(2,7)$.  Therefore, the axis of symmetry is a vertical line through $(2,7)$.  This line is the graph of the equation $x=2$.  The axis of symmetry also passes through the vertex of the parabola, so the $x$-coordinate of the vertex is $\boxed{2}$. The answer is $\boxed{2}$

**Problem**
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

CODE RESULTS 2*(18*k - l + 4)/k

2*(18*k - l + 4)/k
```
The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $\boxed{\frac{2(18k - l + 4)}{k}}$. However, we know that the points of intersection are distance $6$ apart. Thus, the distance between the points of intersection is given by $\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} = 6$. Since the line $y = 4$ is horizontal, this simplifies to $|x_2 - x_1| = 6$. 

Now, let's use the fact that the solutions of the equation $k x^2 - 2k x + l - 4 = 0$ are $x_1$ and $x_2$. By Vieta's formulas, we know that $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1 x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$. Then, $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 4 x_1 x_2 = 4 - 4\frac{l - 4}{k} = \frac{16 - 4l + 16}{k} = \frac{32 - 4l}{k}$.

Setting this equal to $6^2 = 36$, we get $\frac{32 - 4l}{k} = 36$. Solving for $l$, we find $l = \frac{32 - 36k}{4}$.

Now, substituting this back into the sum of squares of distances, we get $sum\_of\_squares = \frac{2(18k - \frac{32 - 36k}{4} + 4)}{k} = \frac{2(72k - 32 + 36k + 16)}{k} = \frac{2(108k - 16)}{k} = \frac{2(108k - 16)}{k}$.

Finally, we can simplify this to $sum\_of\_squares = \frac{2(108k - 16)}{k} = \frac{216k - 32}{k}$.

However, we know that $k > 0$ and $l > 0$, so $108k - 16 > 0$. Therefore, $k > \frac{16}{108} = \frac{4}{27}$.

Since $k > 0$, we can divide both sides of the inequality $k > \frac{4}{27}$ by $k$, without changing the direction of the inequality. This gives $1 > \frac{4}{27k}$, which implies $27k > 4$, or $k > \frac{4}{27}$.

Now, we can substitute this back into the sum of squares of distances to get $sum\_of\_squares = \frac{216k - 32}{k} = \frac{216(\frac{4}{27}) - 32}{\frac{4}{27}} = \frac{32 - 32}{1} = 0$.

However, this doesn't make sense, as the sum of squares of distances should be positive. We must have made a mistake somewhere. Let's go back and check our work.

After re-evaluating our work, we realize that we made a mistake in our simplification of $(x_2 - x_1)^2$. We should have $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 4 x_1 x_2 = 4 - 4\frac{l - 4}{k} = \frac{4k - 4l + 16}{k} = \frac{20 - 4l}{k}$.

Setting this equal to $6^2 = 36$, we get $\frac{20 - 4l}{k} = 36$. Solving for $l$, we find $l = \frac{20 - 36k}{4}$.

Now, substituting this back into the sum of squares of distances, we get $sum\_of\_squares = \frac{2(18k - \frac{20 - 36k}{4} + 4)}{k} = \frac{2(72k - 20 + 36k + 16)}{k} = \frac{2(108k - 4)}{k}$.

Finally, we can simplify this to $sum\_of\_squares = \frac{2(108k - 4)}{k} = \frac{216k - 8}{k}$.

Again, we know that $k > 0$ and $l > 0$, so $108k - 4 > 0$. Therefore, $k > \frac{4}{108} = \frac{1}{27}$.

Since $k > 0$, we can divide both sides of the inequality $k > \frac{1}{27}$ by $k$, without changing the direction of the inequality. This gives $1 > \frac{1}{27k}$, which implies $27k > 1$, or $k > \frac{1}{27}$.

Now, we can substitute this back into the sum of squares of distances to get $sum\_of\_squares = \frac{216k - 8}{k} = \frac{216(\frac{1}{27}) - 8}{\frac{1}{27}} = \frac{8 - 8}{1} = 0$.

Again, this doesn't make sense, as the sum of squares of distances should be positive. We must have made another mistake somewhere. Let's re-evaluate our work.

After re-evaluating our work, we realize that we made a mistake in our substitution of $l$ into the sum of squares of distances. We should have substituted $l = \frac{32 - 36k}{4}$ into the sum of squares of distances, not $l = \frac{20 - 36k}{4}$.

Let's correct this and re-evaluate our work.

The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $\boxed{\frac{2(18k - l + 4)}{k}}$.
Now we need to find the relationship between $k$ and $l$ using the fact that the points $A$ and $B$ are distance 6 apart.
The distance between two points $(x1, y1)$ and $(x2, y2)$ is $\sqrt{(x2-x1)**2 + (y2-y1)**2}$.
Using the solutions to the equation as $x1$ and $x2$, and the fact that $y1 = y2 = 4$, we get:

Sorry for the confusion, let's correct the problem.

We know that the points $A$ and $B$ are distance 6 apart. This means the difference of the solutions to the equation is 6. So, we have:

$$x_2 - x_1 = 6$$

Substituting the solutions to the equation into this equation, we get:

$$solutions[1] - solutions[0] = 6$$

Now, let's solve for $l$ using this equation.

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

To solve this problem, we first need to find the $x$-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$. Since the parabola intersects the line $y = 4$, we can set $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$ and solve for $x$.

Let's denote the two solutions as $x_1$ and $x_2$, where $x_1 < x_2$. The distance between $A$ and $B$ is $x_2 - x_1 = \frac{2\sqrt{k(k - l + 4)}}{k}$, and this is given to be 6. Therefore, we have the equation $\frac{2\sqrt{k(k - l + 4)}}{k} = 6$.

Solving this equation for $l$, we get:
