**Problem:** 
"How many square units are in the area of the triangle whose vertices are the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the curve $y = (x-3)^2 (x+2)$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we need to find where this curve intersects the $x$ and $y$ axes.  If $y=0$, then $(x-3)^2(x+2)=0$, which has solutions of $x=3$ and $x=-2$.  If $x=0$, then $y=(-3)^2(2)=18$.  So, the curve has two $x$-intercepts and one $y$-intercept.  The length of the base along the $x$-axis is $3-(-2)=5$.  The height from this base is equal to the $y$-intercept, 18.  The area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 5\cdot 18=\boxed{45}$. The answer is $\boxed{45}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The given equation is equal to zero, which means that either of the two factors must be zero. This implies that one of the following conditions must hold:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x - y \vert = 10$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert y \vert = 8$.

The first two conditions give us lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, and the last two conditions give us lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$. The intersection points of these lines form a rectangle with side lengths of 10 and 16. Therefore, the area of the rectangle is $10 \times 16 = 160$. The answer is: $160$

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. Let's analyze each term separately.

For the first term, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, this can only happen if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm10$ and $x - y = \pm10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, and $(-10, 0)$.

For the second term, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, this can only happen if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm8$ and $y = \pm8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The polygon is a square with side length 10. To find its area, simply square the length of one of its sides: $10^2 = 100$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units. The answer is: $100$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So, the given equation is zero if and only if at least one of the following two equations is zero:

1. $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$
2. $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$

For the first equation to be zero, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These conditions define a square with side length 10. The vertices of the square are $((5,5), (5,-5), (-5,-5), (-5,5))$.

For the second equation to be zero, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These conditions define a square with side length 16. The vertices of the square are $((8,8), (8,-8), (-8,-8), (-8,8))$.

The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for. The vertices of the polygon are $((5,5), (5,-5), (-5,-5), (-5,5), (8,8), (8,-8), (-8,-8), (-8,8))$.

The area of a square with side length $a$ is $a^2$. So, the area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares, which is $10^2 + 16^2 = 100 + 256 = 356$.

However, we have made a mistake. The first square is completely contained in the second square, so their intersection is just the first square. The area of the convex polygon is the area of the first square, which is $10^2 = 100$.

The area of the convex polygon is 100.

The answer is: $100$

The script is not working as expected because the `integrate` function does not work with `Piecewise` functions. Let's try another approach.

Notice that the condition $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. The first equation is satisfied only when $x = y = \pm 10$ and the second equation is satisfied only when $x = y = \pm 8$. So the points satisfying the condition are $(8,8)$, $(-8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,-8)$, $(10,10)$, $(-10,10)$, $(10,-10)$, and $(-10,-10)$. These points form a square with side length $20$, so the area of the square is $20^2 = 400$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $400$.

The answer is $\boxed{400}$.
