**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Find the number of 10-tuples $(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{10})$ of real numbers such that
\[(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2 = \frac{1}{11}.\]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,
\begin{align*}
&[(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + \dots + 1^2 + 1^2)][(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2] \\
&\ge [(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + (x_2 - x_3) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10}]^2 = 1.
\end{align*}From the given condition, we have equality, so by the equality condition for Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[\frac{1 - x_1}{1} = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{1} = \frac{x_2 - x_3}{1} = \dots = \frac{x_9 - x_{10}}{1} = \frac{x_{10}}{1}.\]Let
\[d = 1 - x_1 = x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_3 = \dots = x_9 - x_{10} = x_{10}.\]Then
\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so
\[(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_{10}) = \left( \frac{10}{11}, \frac{9}{11}, \frac{8}{11}, \dots, \frac{1}{11} \right).\]In particular, there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


The given equation is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. The equation equals to zero if and only if both factors are equal to zero. 

The first factor $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ is equal to zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These two equations describe a square with side length 20.

The second factor $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ is equal to zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These two equations describe a square with side length 16.

Therefore, the points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying the given equation enclose a convex polygon which is the union of the two squares. The area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares.

The area of a square with side length $a$ is $a^2$, so the area of the first square is $20^2 = 400$, and the area of the second square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $400 + 256 = 656$.
The answer is: $656$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_ 2= (-16,2).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that
\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as
\[\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1.\]Find $h + k + a + b.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

The first term is zero when $|\pm x \pm y| - 10 = 0$, which simplifies to $|\pm x \pm y| = 10$. This equation represents a diamond shape centered at the origin with vertices at $(10,0)$, $(-10,0)$, $(0,10)$, and $(0,-10)$.

The second term is zero when $|\pm x| - 8 = 0$ or $|\pm y| - 8 = 0$, which simplifies to $|\pm x| = 8$ or $|\pm y| = 8$. These equations represent squares centered at the origin with side length 16, one square along the x-axis and one square along the y-axis.

The intersection of these shapes is the convex polygon formed by the points that satisfy both conditions. The area of this polygon is the sum of the areas of the squares minus the area of the diamond shape.

The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of the square along the x-axis is $16^2 = 256$ and the area of the square along the y-axis is also $16^2 = 256$. The total area of the squares is $256 + 256 = 512$.

The area of a diamond shape is base times height, where the base and height are both 20 (the distance between the vertices of the diamond shape). So the area of the diamond shape is $20 \times 20 / 2 = 200$.

The area of the convex polygon is the total area of the squares minus the area of the diamond shape, which is $512 - 200 = 312$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 312. The answer is: $312$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. 

The first expression is zero when either $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x - y| - 10 = 0$, which means $|x + y| = 10$ or $|x - y| = 10$. These are the equations of two lines passing through the origin at angles of $45^\circ$ and $135^\circ$ respectively.

The second expression is zero when either $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$, which means $|x| = 8$ or $|y| = 8$. These are the equations of two lines parallel to the x-axis at $y = 8$ and the y-axis at $x = 8$.

The intersection of these lines form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So the area of the convex polygon is 256.
