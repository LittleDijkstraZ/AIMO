Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 To solve this problem, we need to find the value of $f(100)$ based on the given conditions. 

First, let's try to find $f(1)$ using the second condition: $f(2*1) = 2*f(1) + 1$, so $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. But we also know that $f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = 1$, so $f(f(f(1))) = 1$. 

From $f(f(f(1))) = 1$, we have $f(f(1)) = 1$ because $f$ maps natural numbers to natural numbers. 

Then we can use the second condition again to find $f(1)$: $f(2*1) = 2*f(1) + 1$, so $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. Since $f(2) = 2$, we have $2 = 2f(1) + 1$, so $f(1) = 1/2$. But $f$ maps natural numbers to natural numbers, so we have a contradiction. 

However, let's go back to the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. For $n=1$, we have $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$, so $f(f(1))=1$. Then for $n=f(1)$, we have $f(f(f(f(1))))=8*f(1)-7=1$. Since $f(f(1))=1$, we have $f(1)=1$. 

Now we can use the second condition to find $f(2)$: $f(2*1) = 2*f(1) + 1$, so $f(2) = 2*1 + 1 = 3$. 

For $n=2$, the first condition gives $f(f(f(2)))=8*2-7=9$, so $f(f(2))=9$. Then for $n=f(2)$, we have $f(f(f(f(2))))=8*f(2)-7=9$. Since $f(f(2))=9$, we have $f(9)=9$. 

Now we can use the second condition to find $f(18)$: $f(2*9) = 2*f(9) + 1$, so $f(18) = 2*9 + 1 = 19$. 

For $n=18$, the first condition gives $f(f(f(18)))=8*18-7=135$, so $f(f(18))=135$. Then for $n=f(18)$, we have $f(f(f(f(18))))=8*f(18)-7=135$. Since $f(f(18))=135$, we have $f(135)=135$. 

Now we can use the second condition to find $f(270)$: $f(2*135) = 2*f(135) + 1$, so $f(270) = 2*135 + 1 = 271$. 

For $n=270$, the first condition gives $f(f(f(270)))=8*270-7=2153$, so $f(f(270))=2153$. Then for $n=f(270)$, we have $f(f(f(f(270))))=8*f(270)-7=2153$. Since $f(f(270))=2153$, we have $f(2153)=2153$. 

Now we can use the second condition to find $f(4306)$: $f(2*2153) = 2*f(2153) + 1$, so $f(4306) = 2*2153 + 1 = 4307$. 

For $n=4306$, the first condition gives $f(f(f(4306)))=8*4306-7=34441$, so $f(f(4306))=34441$. Then for $n=f(4306)$, we have $f(f(f(f(4306))))=8*f(4306)-7=34441$. Since $f(f(4306))=34441$, we have $f(34441)=34441$. 

Now we can use the second condition to find $f(68882)$: $f(2*34441) = 2*f(34441) + 1$, so $f(68882) = 2*34441 + 1 = 68883$. 

For $n=68882$, the first condition gives $f(f(f(68882)))=8*68882-7=551053$, so $f(f(68882))=551053$. Then for $n=f(68882)$, we have $f(f(f(f(68882))))=8*f(68882)-7=551053$. Since $f(f(68882))=551053$, we have $f(551053)=551053$. 

Now we can use the second condition to find $f(1102106)$: $f(2*551053) = 2*f(551053) + 1$, so $f(1102106) = 2*551053 + 1 = 1102107$. 

For $n=1102106$, the first condition gives $f(f(f(1102106)))=8*1102106-7=8816841$, so $f(f(1102106))=8816841$. Then for $n=f(1102106)$, we have $f(f(f(f(1102106))))=8*f(1102106)-7=8816841$. Since $f(f(1102106))=8816841$, we have $f(8816841)=8816841$. 

Now we can use the second condition to find $f(17633682)$: $f(2*8816841) = 2*f(8816841) + 1$, so $f(17633682) = 2*8816841 + 1 = 17633683$. 

For $n=17633682$, the first condition gives $f(f(f(17633682)))=8*17633682-7=141069453$, so $f(f(17633682))=141069453$. Then for $n=f(17633682)$,

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."

Assistant:

 Since the function $f$ is defined for all positive integers $n$, we can start by plugging in $n = 100$ into the second equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. This gives us $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$.

Now we know that $f(f(f(100))) = 8*100 - 7 = 793$. But from the first equation, we also know that $f(f(f(100))) = f(f(f(100))) = f(200)$. So we have $f(200) = 793$.

Substituting $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1 = 793$, we can solve for $f(100)$: $2f(100) = 792$, so $f(100) = 396$.

Therefore, $f(100) = 396$.

```python

    # From f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1, we know that f(200) = 2f(100) + 1
    # And from f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7, we know that f(f(f(100))) = 8*100 - 7 = 793

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



From the second equation, we can find $f(1)$ by setting $n = 1$:

$$f(2) = 2f(1) + 1.$$

Since $f(f(f(1)))= 8*1 - 7 = 1$, we can substitute $n = 1$ into the first equation to get
$$f(f(f(1))) = f(1) = 1.$$

So we have $f(2) = 2*1 + 1 = 3$.

Now substitute $f(2) = 3$ into the second equation with $n = 2$:

$$f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2*3 + 1 = 7.$$

Now substitute $f(4) = 7$ into the second equation with $n = 4$:

$$f(8) = 2f(4) + 1 = 2*7 + 1 = 15.$$

Now substitute $f(8) = 15$ into the second equation with $n = 8$:

$$f(16) = 2f(8) + 1 = 2*15 + 1 = 31.$$

Now substitute $f(16) = 31$ into the second equation with $n = 16$:

$$f(32) = 2f(16) + 1 = 2*31 + 1 = 63.$$

Notice a pattern here, it seems like $f(2^n) = 2^n - 1$. Let's prove it by induction.

Base case: For $n = 1$, we have $f(2) = 3 = 2^2 - 1$.

Inductive step: Assume that $f(2^k) = 2^k - 1$ for some positive integer $k$. We want to show that $f(2^{k+1}) = 2^{k+1} - 1$.

By the second equation, we have
$$f(2^{k+1}) = 2f(2^k) + 1.$$

By the induction hypothesis, this becomes
$$f(2^{k+1}) = 2(2^k - 1) + 1 = 2^{k+1} - 2 + 1 = 2^{k+1} - 1.$$

Thus, by induction, we have shown that $f(2^n) = 2^n - 1$ for all positive integers $n$.

Now we can find $f(100) = f(2^6 + 4) = f(2^6) + f(4)$.

By the result above, we have $f(2^6) = 2^6 - 1 = 63$.

And by the result we found earlier, we have $f(4) = 7$.

Therefore, $f(100) = 63 + 7 = 70$.

So the answer is $\boxed{70}$.

The Python code to verify this result would look like this:

```python

        return 2 * find_f(n // 2) + 1
    else:
        return find_f((n - 1) // 2)

f_100 = find_f(100)
print(f_100)

The value of $f(100)$ is not correct according to the given conditions.

Let's reevaluate the problem and revise the steps:

From the first equation, we have $f(f(f(1))) = 1$. Since $f(f(f(1))) = f(1)$, we have $f(1) = 1$.

Now substitute $f(1) = 1$ into the second equation with $n = 1$:

$$f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2*1 + 1 = 3.$$

Now substitute $f(2) = 3$ into the second equation with $n = 2$:

$$f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2*3 + 1 = 7.$$

Now substitute $f(4) = 7$ into the second equation with $n = 4$:

$$f(8) = 2f(4) + 1 = 2*7 + 1 = 15.$$

Now substitute $f(8) = 15$ into the second equation with $n = 8$:

$$f(16) = 2f(8) + 1 = 2*15 + 1 = 31.$$

Notice a pattern here, it seems like $f(2^n) = 2^n - 1$. Let's prove it by induction.

Base case: For $n = 1$, we have $f(2) = 3 = 2^2 - 1$.

Inductive step: Assume that $f(2^k) = 2^k - 1$ for some positive integer $k$. We want to show that $f(2^{k+1}) = 2^{k+1} - 1$.

By the second equation, we have
$$f(2^{k+1}) = 2f(2^k) + 1.$$

By the induction hypothesis, this becomes
$$f(2^{k+1}) = 2(2^k - 1) + 1 = 2^{k+1} - 2 + 1 = 2^{k+1} - 1.$$

Thus, by induction, we have shown that $f(2^n) = 2^n - 1$ for all positive integers $n$.

Now we can find $f(100) = f(2^6 + 4) = f(2^6) + f(4)$.

By the result above, we have $f(2^6) = 2^6 - 1 = 63$.

And by the result we found earlier, we have $f(4) = 7$.

Therefore, $f(100) = 63 + 7 = 70$.

So the answer is $\boxed{70}$.

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."

Assistant:


To solve this problem, we can start by plugging in $n = 1$ into the second equation to find $f(1)$.
$f(f(f(1))) = 8 \cdot 1 - 7 = 1$, so $f(f(f(1))) = 1$.
Then, $f(f(2)) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2 \cdot f(1) + 1 = 2 \cdot 1 + 1 = 3$, so $f(f(2)) = 3$.
Continuing, $f(6) = 2f(3) + 1$.
But we know from the first equation that $f(f(f(3))) = 8 \cdot 3 - 7 = 17$, so $f(3) = f(f(f(3))) = 17$.
Therefore, $f(6) = 2 \cdot 17 + 1 = 35$.
Finally, we can find $f(100)$ by repeatedly applying the second equation.
$f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$.
$f(400) = 2f(200) + 1 = 2(2f(100) + 1) + 1 = 4f(100) + 3$.
$f(800) = 2f(400) + 1 = 2(4f(100) + 3) + 1 = 8f(100) + 7$.
From the first equation, we have $f(f(f(100))) = 8 \cdot 100 - 7 = 793$, so $f(f(100)) = 793$.
Then, $f(800) = 793$.
Thus, $8f(100) + 7 = 793$, so $8f(100) = 786$ and $f(100) = \frac{786}{8} = 98.25$.
But $f(100)$ must be a natural number, so we must have made an error in our calculations.
Upon revisiting our work, we find that we have made an error in our application of the second equation.
We should have $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$ and $f(400) = 2f(200) + 1 = 2(2f(100) + 1) + 1 = 4f(100) + 3$, but we have incorrectly written this as $f(400) = 2(2f(100)) + 1 = 4f(100) + 1$.
Correcting this, we have $f(400) = 4f(100) + 3$.
$f(800) = 2f(400) + 1 = 2(4f(100) + 3) + 1 = 8f(100) + 7$.
From the first equation, we have $f(f(f(100))) = 8 \cdot 100 - 7 = 793$, so $f(f(100)) = 793$.
Then, $f(800) = 793$.
Thus, $8f(100) + 7 = 793$, so $8f(100) = 786$ and $f(100) = \frac{786}{8} = 98.25$.

Correcting this, we have $f(400) = 4f(100) + 3$.
$f(800) = 2f(400) + 1 = 2(4f(100) + 3) + 1 = 8f(100) + 7$.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We have two equations: $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.
2. From the second equation, we can find $f(1)$ by setting $n=1$: $f(2) = 2f(1)+1$.
3. However, we cannot directly find $f(1)$ from this equation.
4. We need to use the first equation to find a relationship between $f(f(f(1)))$ and $f(1)$. 
5. From the first equation, we set $n=f(1)$ to get $f(f(f(f(1)))) = 8f(1) - 7$.
6. But we know that $f(f(f(1))) = f(f(2))$ from the second equation.
7. And from the second equation, we have $f(f(2)) = 2f(f(1)) + 1$.
8. So we can substitute $f(f(2))$ in the equation $f(f(f(f(1)))) = 8f(1) - 7$ to get $2f(f(1)) + 1 = 8f(1) - 7$.
9. Simplify this to get $2f(f(1)) = 8f(1) - 8$, and then $2f(f(1)) = 8(f(1) - 1)$.
10. Divide both sides by 2 to get $f(f(1)) = 4(f(1) - 1)$.
11. Now we can see that $f(1)$ must be 2 because if we set $f(1) = 1$, we get $f(f(1)) = 0$, which is impossible because $f(f(1))$ is supposed to be equal to $8 - 7 = 1$.
12. So we have $f(1) = 2$.
13. Now we can use the second equation to find $f(2)$: $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2*2 + 1 = 5$.
14. Now we can use the first equation to find $f(f(f(1)))$ and $f(f(f(2)))$.
15. We have $f(f(f(1))) = f(f(2)) = f(5)$.
16. From the first equation, $f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = 1$.
17. So $f(5) = 1$.
18. Now we can continue to find $f(100)$ using the second equation: $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2*1 + 1 = 3$.

Therefore, the value of $f(100)$ is 3.
The answer is: $3$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, the function $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ means that applying the function $f$ three times to any number $n$ will result in $8n-7$.

Second, the function $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ means that when we double any number $n$ and apply the function $f$, the result is two times the value of the function at $n$ plus one.

Now, let's try to find $f(100)$ using these two conditions.

If we plug $n=50$ into the second condition, we have $f(100)=2f(50)+1$. 

But we also know from the first condition that $f(f(f(50)))=8*50-7=393$.

Let's try to find a function $f$ that satisfies these conditions. One possible function is $f(n)=2n-1$. 

Let's check if this function works:

- For the first condition, $f(f(f(n)))=f(f(2n-1))=f(2(2n-1)-1)=f(4n-3)=8n-7$, which matches the given condition.
- For the second condition, $f(2n)=2(2n-1)+1=4n-1$, which also matches the given condition.

So, $f(n)=2n-1$ is a possible function that satisfies the conditions.

Now, let's find $f(100)$ using this function:

$f(100) = 2*100 - 1 = 199$.

Therefore, $f(100) = 199$. Since this is a numerical value, the answer is $\boxed{199}$.

However, let's check it using the function:

$f(100) = 2*100 - 1 = 199$, which matches our result.
The answer is: $199$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Firstly, we know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, let's consider the case when $n = 1$. Then $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$, hence $f(1) = 1$. 

Also, we know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. 

Let's now calculate $f(2)$ using the second equation: $f(2)=2f(1)+1=2*1+1=3$. 

Knowing $f(1)$ and $f(2)$, we can calculate $f(3)$ using the first equation: $f(f(f(3)))=8*3-7=17$. As $f(f(f(3)))=f(f(2))=f(3)$, then $f(3)=17$.

Now let's calculate $f(4)$: $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2*3+1=7$.

And $f(5)$: $f(f(f(5)))=8*5-7=33$. As $f(f(f(5)))=f(f(4))=f(5)$, then $f(5)=33$.

By continuing this way, we can find $f(100)$. But it seems that calculating this by hand is not practical. So we can use a computer to do this for us.

Here is a Python script that calculates $f(100)$ using a recursive function:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def f(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    elif n % 2 == 0:
        return 2 * f(n // 2) + 1
    else:
        return 8 * n - 7

result = f(100)
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 775

```output

```
The value of $f(100)$ is $775$. The answer is: $775$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. Now if we put $f(n)$ instead of $n$ into this formula we get $f(f(f(f(n))))=f(8n-7)$. But from the other known formula $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, if we replace $n$ with $f(n)$ we have $f(2f(n))=2f(f(n))+1$, so $f(8n-7)=f(2(4n-3.5))=2f(4n-3.5)+1$.

Now if we take a look at the formula $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ again, replacing $n$ with $4n-3.5$ we have $f(8n-7)=2f(4n-3.5)+1$, and combining this with the previous equation we have $f(8n-7)=2f(4n-3.5)+1=2(2f(2n-1.75)+0.5)+1=4f(2n-1.75)+2+1=4f(2n-1.75)+3$. But we know from the initial formula that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, so replacing $n$ with $100$ we have $f(f(f(100)))=8*100-7=793$.

We can now substitute $n=100$ into the equation $f(f(f(n)))=4f(2n-1.75)+3$: $793 = 4f(2*100-1.75)+3 = 4f(198.25)+3$. Solving for $f(198.25)$ gives $f(198.25) = \frac{793-3}{4} = 197.5$. But this can't be right because $f(198.25)$ should be an integer.

Let's try to find a mistake. We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, so let's replace $n$ with $100$ in this formula, we have $f(f(f(100)))=8*100-7=793$. But this doesn't make sense because we don't know how to find $f(100)$ directly from this formula.

Let's try another way. From the formula $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can see that this is a recursive formula, and it's hard to directly solve for $f(100)$ from this formula. But we can try to find $f(100)$ by calculating $f(n)$ for smaller values of $n$ and observe the pattern.

Let's calculate the first few values of $f(n)$:

- $f(1) = 1$ (by setting $n=1$ in the formula $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$)
- $f(2) = 3$ (by setting $n=1$ in the formula $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$)
- $f(3) = 5$ (by setting $n=1.5$ in the formula $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$)
- $f(4) = 7$ (by setting $n=2$ in the formula $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$)
- $f(5) = 9$ (by setting $n=2.5$ in the formula $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$)

We can observe that $f(n)$ seems to be just $2n-1$ for all positive integers $n$. Let's check if this pattern holds:

- For $f(6) = 2*6-1 = 11$, we can check it by setting $n=3$ in the formula $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and we get $f(f(f(3)))=f(5)=11$.
- For $f(7) = 2*7-1 = 13$, we can check it by setting $n=3.5$ in the formula $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ and we get $f(7)=13$.

It seems like the pattern holds. Therefore, we can conclude that $f(n) = 2n - 1$ for all positive integers $n$. Now we can directly calculate $f(100) = 2*100 - 1 = 199$. But we need to verify this result with the given formulas.

Let's check if $f(100) = 199$ satisfies the given formulas:

- For the first formula $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, when $n=100$, we have $f(f(f(100)))=f(f(199))=f(397)=793$ (by setting $n=199$ in the formula $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ repeatedly), and $8*100-7=793$. So it's consistent with the formula.
- For the second formula $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, when $n=50$, we have $f(100)=2f(50)+1=2*99+1=199$, and this is exactly what we calculated. So it's consistent with the formula as well.

Therefore, $f(100) = 199$ is the correct solution.

Here is the entire Python code that demonstrates this process:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def f(n):
    return 2*n - 1

print(f(100))
```
```output

The answer is $\boxed{199}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The first condition gives us $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. We know that $f$ maps from $\mathbb{N}$ to $\mathbb{N}$, so we are looking for a function that when applied three times will give us $8n-7$.

The second condition gives us $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. This is a functional equation which will help us to find the function $f$.

First, let's try to find the value of $f(1)$. By substituting $n = 1$ in the second equation, we get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. Now, since $f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = -1$, and we know $f(f(f(1))) = f(f(2))$ (because $f(1)$ is 1), and $f(f(2)) = f(2)$ (because $f(2)$ is an input to $f$ again), we have $f(2) = -1$. Substituting $f(2) = -1$ into $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$, we get $-1 = 2f(1) + 1$, and solving for $f(1)$, we get $f(1) = -1$. But this is a contradiction because $f$ is supposed to map from $\mathbb{N}$ to $\mathbb{N}$, and $f(1)$ cannot be negative.

So, we must have made a mistake in our reasoning. Let's reconsider the first condition. We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, so if we set $n = 1$, we get $f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = 1$. Now, $f(f(f(1))) = f(f(1))$ (because $f(1)$ is an input to $f$ again), and $f(f(1)) = f(1)$ (because $f(1)$ is an input to $f$ again again), so we have $f(1) = 1$.

Now, substituting $f(1) = 1$ into the second equation, we get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2*1 + 1 = 3$. Then, substituting $f(2) = 3$ into the second equation again, we get $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2*3 + 1 = 7$. Then, substituting $f(4) = 7$ into the second equation again, we get $f(8) = 2f(4) + 1 = 2*7 + 1 = 15$.

We can observe a pattern here: $f(2^k) = 2^k + 2^{k-1} - 1$ for $k \geq 1$. We can prove this by induction. It's true for $k = 1$ because $f(2) = 3 = 2^1 + 2^{1-1} - 1$. Assume it's true for $k = n$, i.e., $f(2^n) = 2^n + 2^{n-1} - 1$. Then, $f(2^{n+1}) = 2f(2^n) + 1 = 2(2^n + 2^{n-1} - 1) + 1 = 2^{n+1} + 2^n - 1$. So, the formula is true for all $k$.

In particular, $f(100) = f(2^6 + 2^2) = f(2^6) + f(2^2)$ (by the second equation). Using the formula we derived, $f(2^6) = 2^6 + 2^{6-1} - 1 = 64 + 16 - 1 = 81$, and $f(2^2) = 2^2 + 2^{2-1} - 1 = 4 + 2 - 1 = 5$. So, $f(100) = f(2^6 + 2^2) = f(2^6) + f(2^2) = 81 + 5 = 86$.

So, the value of $f(100)$ is 86. The answer is: $86$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Step 1: Notice that $f(f(f(1)))=f(0)=8*1-7=1$. So, $f(1)=0$.

Step 2: Use the second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ with $n=1$, we get $f(2)=2f(1)+1=2*0+1=1$.

Step 3: Use the second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ with $n=2$, we get $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2*1+1=3$.

Step 4: Use the second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ with $n=4$, we get $f(8)=2f(4)+1=2*3+1=7$.

Step 5: Use the second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ with $n=8$, we get $f(16)=2f(8)+1=2*7+1=15$.

Step 6: Use the second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ with $n=16$, we get $f(32)=2f(16)+1=2*15+1=31$.

Step 7: Notice that $f(32)=31=8*4-7$, so we guess that $f(n)=2n-1$ for all positive integer $n$. 

Step 8: Check if $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. For all positive integer $n$, we have
$$f(f(f(n)))=f(f(2n-1))=f(2(2n-1)-1)=f(4n-3)=2(4n-3)-1=8n-7.$$
So, $f(n)=2n-1$ satisfies both conditions.

Step 9: Now we can calculate $f(100)=2*100-1=199$.

So the answer is: $f(100)=199$. To print the result, we simply print the integer 199.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def calculate_f_of_100():
    return 2*100 - 1

result = calculate_f_of_100()
