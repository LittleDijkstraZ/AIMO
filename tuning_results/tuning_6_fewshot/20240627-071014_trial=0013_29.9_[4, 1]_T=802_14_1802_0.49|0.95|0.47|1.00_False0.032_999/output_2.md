**Problem:** 
"For certain ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ of real numbers, the system of equations
\[\begin{aligned} ax+by&=1 \\ x^2 + y^2 &= 50  \end{aligned}\]has at least one solution, and each solution is an ordered pair $(x,y)\,$ of integers. How many such ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ are there?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The graph of $ax+by=1$ is a line, while the graph of $x^2+y^2=50$ is a circle centered at the origin. Therefore, $(a, b)$ satisfies the conditions if and only if the line and circle intersect at least once, and they intersect only at lattice points (points with integer coordinates).

Knowing this, it makes sense to look for lattice points on the circle whose equation is $x^2+y^2=50$. Testing cases, we find that there are twelve lattice points on the circle: $(\pm 1, \pm 7)$, $(\pm 7, \pm 1)$, and $(\pm 5, \pm 5)$ (where the two $\pm$ signs in each pair are independent of each other).

There are $\tbinom{12}{2} = 66$ pairs of these points, and each pair determines a line. However, the graph of $ax+by=1$ can never pass through the origin $(0, 0)$, since if $x=y=0$, then $ax+by=0 \neq 1$. Therefore, the six pairs which consist of diametrically opposed points are invalid, since the line through them passes through the origin. This corrects our count to $66 - 6 = 60$.

In addition, for each of the twelve points, there is a line tangent to the circle at that point, so that the only solution to the system is that one point. This brings the final total to $60 + 12 = \boxed{72}$. The answer is $\boxed{72}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



This problem involves the absolute value function and solving equations with multiple absolute values. We will use the property of absolute value that $|x| = a$ has solutions $x = a$ and $x = -a$. 

The equation $|\vert x-1 \vert -2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions. This means that the equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \pm \frac{m}{100}$ has two solutions each. 

We first solve the equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$. This simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. Then we have two cases:
1. $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 = -(2 + \frac{m}{100})$.
2. Solving the first equation from case 1 gives $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.
3. Solving the second equation from case 1 gives $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Now we solve the equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$. This simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. Again, we have two cases:
4. $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 = -(2 - \frac{m}{100})$.
5. Solving the first equation from case 4 gives $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
6. Solving the second equation from case 4 gives $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

We have found 6 solutions in total: $3 + \frac{m}{100}$, $-1 - \frac{m}{100}$, $3 - \frac{m}{100}$, $-1 + \frac{m}{100}$, $3$, and $-1$. The last two solutions are not valid since they do not depend on $m$. The other four solutions must be distinct, which means that the expressions $3 + \frac{m}{100}$, $-1 - \frac{m}{100}$, $3 - \frac{m}{100}$, and $-1 + \frac{m}{100}$ must be distinct. This implies that $\frac{m}{100}$ cannot be equal to $2$, since otherwise $3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $3 - \frac{m}{100}$ would be equal. Similarly, $\frac{m}{100}$ cannot be equal to $-2$, since otherwise $-1 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $-1 + \frac{m}{100}$ would be equal. Therefore, $m$ must be an integer such that $-200 < m < 200$ and $m \neq \pm 200$. The only such positive integer is $m = 200 - 2 = 198$.

So the only value of $m$ that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions is $m = 198$. The answer is: $198$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"For certain ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ of real numbers, the system of equations
\[\begin{aligned} ax+by&=1 \\ x^2 + y^2 &= 50  \end{aligned}\]has at least one solution, and each solution is an ordered pair $(x,y)\,$ of integers. How many such ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ are there?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The graph of $ax+by=1$ is a line, while the graph of $x^2+y^2=50$ is a circle centered at the origin. Therefore, $(a, b)$ satisfies the conditions if and only if the line and circle intersect at least once, and they intersect only at lattice points (points with integer coordinates).

Knowing this, it makes sense to look for lattice points on the circle whose equation is $x^2+y^2=50$. Testing cases, we find that there are twelve lattice points on the circle: $(\pm 1, \pm 7)$, $(\pm 7, \pm 1)$, and $(\pm 5, \pm 5)$ (where the two $\pm$ signs in each pair are independent of each other).

There are $\tbinom{12}{2} = 66$ pairs of these points, and each pair determines a line. However, the graph of $ax+by=1$ can never pass through the origin $(0, 0)$, since if $x=y=0$, then $ax+by=0 \neq 1$. Therefore, the six pairs which consist of diametrically opposed points are invalid, since the line through them passes through the origin. This corrects our count to $66 - 6 = 60$.

In addition, for each of the twelve points, there is a line tangent to the circle at that point, so that the only solution to the system is that one point. This brings the final total to $60 + 12 = \boxed{72}$. The answer is $\boxed{72}$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many distinct solutions are there to the equation $|x-7| = |x+1|$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
If $|x-7| = |x+1|$, then either $x-7 = x+1$ or $x-7 = -(x+1)$.  Simplifying $x-7=x+1$ gives $0=8$, which has no solutions, so no values of $x$ satisfy $x-7 = x+1$.  If $x-7 = -(x+1)$, then $x-7 = -x-1$, so $2x = 6$, which gives $x=3$.  So, there is $\boxed{1}$ solution.

Challenge: See if you can find a quick solution to this problem by simply thinking about the graphs of $y=|x-7|$ and $y=|x+1|$. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


We know that the equation $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.
The expression $|x-1| - 2$ can be either positive or negative.
If $|x-1| - 2 > 0$, then $|x-1| > 2$, which implies $x-1 > 2$ or $x-1 < -2$.
Solving these inequalities gives us $x > 3$ or $x < -1$.
If $|x-1| - 2 < 0$, then $|x-1| < 2$, which implies $-2 < x-1 < 2$.
Solving this inequality gives us $-1 < x < 3$.
So the equation $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when $x$ is in the interval $(-1, 3)$.
Now we need to find the values of $m$ for which the equation $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions in the interval $(-1, 3)$.
The expression $| |x-1| - 2 |$ can take on values from 0 to 4, so $\frac{m}{100}$ must be in the interval $(0, 4)$.
This means $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 4$, or $0 < m < 400$.
The positive integers $m$ in this interval are $1, 2, 3, \dots, 399$.
To find the number of these integers that make the equation have 4 distinct solutions, we can count the number of multiples of 100 in this interval.
There are 3 such multiples: 100, 200, and 300.
Therefore, there are 3 positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions.
The answer is: 3

**Solution:**


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $2$. This means $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which simplifies to $100 < m < 200$. The number of positive integers $m$ in this range is $200 - 100 - 1 = 99$.
