**Problem:** 
"Let $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_ 2= (-16,2).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that
\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as
\[\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1.\]Find $h + k + a + b.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!

**Solution:** 



First, we need to understand the given equation. The equation is equal to zero, which means that at least one of the factors must be zero. 

The factors are:
1. $(|x + y| - 10)^2$
2. $(|x - y| - 10)^2$
3. $(|x| - 8)^2$
4. $(|y| - 8)^2$

Each of these factors must be equal to zero for the equation to be true. This gives us the following equations:

1. $|x + y| = 10$
2. $|x - y| = 10$
3. $|x| = 8$
4. $|y| = 8$

The solutions to these equations are the points that satisfy the conditions. 

The solutions to $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$ are the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. The solutions to $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$ are the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersection points of these lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(8, 2)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, -2)$, and $(8, -2)$. The area of this rectangle is $16 \times 4 = 64$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 64. The answer is: $64$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many square units are in the area of the triangle whose vertices are the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the curve $y = (x-3)^2 (x+2)$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we need to find where this curve intersects the $x$ and $y$ axes.  If $y=0$, then $(x-3)^2(x+2)=0$, which has solutions of $x=3$ and $x=-2$.  If $x=0$, then $y=(-3)^2(2)=18$.  So, the curve has two $x$-intercepts and one $y$-intercept.  The length of the base along the $x$-axis is $3-(-2)=5$.  The height from this base is equal to the $y$-intercept, 18.  The area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 5\cdot 18=\boxed{45}$. The answer is $\boxed{45}$

**Solution:** 



This problem involves finding the area of a polygon formed by the intersection of two circles in the plane. The equation given is a product of two expressions, each of which is the square of the distance from a point $(x, y)$ to a certain point, minus a constant, set equal to zero. This means that the points satisfying the equation are precisely the points that are simultaneously on both circles.

The first expression is zero when $(x, y)$ is on a circle centered at $(0, 0)$ with radius 10, and the second expression is zero when $(x, y)$ is on a circle centered at $(8, 0)$ with radius 8. The intersection of these two circles forms a convex polygon, which is a square with side length 6 (since the distance between the centers of the circles is $\sqrt{8^2 + 8^2} = 8\sqrt{2}$, and the difference of the radii is $10 - 8 = 2$, so the side length of the square is $2 \times 3 = 6$).

The area of this square is $6^2 = 36$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 36.

Here is a Python script that calculates the area of the square:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def square_area():
    side_length = 6
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = square_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 36

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output

```
The area of the convex polygon is 36. The answer is $\boxed{36}$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Five identical rectangles are arranged to form a larger rectangle $PQRS$, as shown.  The area of $PQRS$ is $4000$.  What is the length, $x$, rounded off to the nearest integer? [asy]
real x = 1; real w = 2/3;

// Draw outer square and labels
pair s = (0, 0); pair r = (2 * x, 0); pair q = (3 * w, x + w); pair p = (0, x + w);

label("$S$", s, SW); label("$R$", r, SE); label("$Q$", q, NE); label("$P$", p, NW);

// Draw other segments

draw((0, w)--(2 * x, w));
draw((w, x + w)--(w, w)); draw((2 * w, x + w)--(2 * w, w));

// length labels
pair upper = (-0.1, x + w);
pair lower = (-0.1, w);
draw(lower--upper);
draw((-0.1 - 0.03, x + w)--(-0.1 + 0.03, x + w));
draw((-0.1 - 0.03, w)--(-0.1 + 0.03, w));
label("$x$", midpoint((-0.1, w)--(-0.1, x + w)), W);

pair left = (0, -0.1); pair right = (x, -0.1);
draw((0, -0.1 + 0.03)--(0, -0.1 - 0.03));
draw((x, -0.1 - 0.03)--(x, -0.1 + 0.03));
draw(left--right);
label("$x$", (x/2, -0.1), S);

[/asy]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Let $w$ be the width of each of the identical rectangles. Since $PQ=3w$, $RS=2x$ and $PQ=RS$ (because $PQRS$ is a rectangle), then $2x = 3w$, or $$w=\frac{2}{3}x.$$ Therefore, the area of each of the five identical rectangles is $$x\left(\frac{2}{3}x\right)=\frac{2}{3}x^2.$$ Since the area of $PQRS$ is 4000 and it is made up of five of these identical smaller rectangles, then $$5\left(\frac{2}{3}x^2\right)=4000$$ or $$\frac{10}{3}x^2 = 4000$$ or $x^2 = 1200$ or $x \approx 34.6$ which, when rounded off to the nearest integer, is $\boxed{35}.$ The answer is $\boxed{35}$

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


This problem requires a careful analysis of the conditions given in the equation. The equation is of the form $f(x, y) \cdot g(x, y) = 0$, which implies that either $f(x, y) = 0$ or $g(x, y) = 0$. 

The function $f(x, y) = ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$ equals zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives the vertices of the polygon as $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The function $g(x, y) = ((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ equals zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

The polygon formed by these vertices is a square with side length 20. Therefore, the area of the polygon is $20^2 = 400$. The answer is: $400$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

**Solution:** 


This problem involves understanding the behavior of absolute value functions and how they interact with multiplication. The expression is equal to zero if and only if both factors are zero. Therefore, we can break the problem into two separate cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that the points $(x, y)$ lie on a square with side length 20. The vertices of this square are $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, and $(-10, 0)$.

For the second case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that the points $(x, y)$ lie on a square with side length 16. The vertices of this square are $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The intersection of the two squares forms a smaller square with side length 8. The vertices of this square are $(0, 8)$, $(0, -8)$, $(8, 0)$, and $(-8, 0)$.

The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 64 square units.

**Solution:** 


This problem involves understanding the properties of absolute value functions and how they interact with multiplication. The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero, which implies that either one of the expressions is zero.

Let's consider the two expressions separately:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first expression to be zero, both terms must be zero:

$\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0 \implies \vert x + y \vert = 10$
$\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0 \implies \vert x - y \vert = 10$

This implies that the points $(x, y)$ must lie on a square with side length 20. The vertices of this square are $(10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, $(-10, 0)$, and $(0, -10)$.

For the second expression to be zero, both terms must be zero:

$\vert x \vert - 8 = 0 \implies \vert x \vert = 8 \implies x = 8$ or $x = -8$
$\vert y \vert - 8 = 0 \implies \vert y \vert = 8 \implies y = 8$ or $y = -8$

This implies that the points $(x, y)$ must lie on a square with side length 16. The vertices of this square are $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The intersection of the two squares is a smaller square with side length 8 and vertices at $(4, 4)$, $(4, -4)$, $(-4, 4)$, and $(-4, -4)$.

The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon formed by the intersection of the two squares is 64 square units. The answer is: $64$
