**Problem:** 
"What is the minimum value of the expression $x^2+y^2+2x-4y+8$ for real $x$ and $y$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Rearranging the expression, we have  \[x^2+2x+y^2-4y+8\]Completing the square in $x$, we need to add and subtract $(2/2)^2=1$. Completing the square in $y$, we need to add and subtract $(4/2)^2=4$. Thus, we have \[(x^2+2x+1)-1+(y^2-4y+4)-4+8 \Rightarrow (x+1)^2+(y-2)^2+3\]Since the minimum value of $(x+1)^2$ and $(y-2)^2$ is $0$ (perfect squares can never be negative), the minimum value of the entire expression is $\boxed{3}$, and is achieved when $x=-1$ and $y=2$. The answer is $\boxed{3}$

**Problem**
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



To solve this problem, we can use the method of completing the square. First, we rewrite the given expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $(x-2y)^2 - 3y^2$. Then we use the given condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ to get $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40 \Rightarrow |x-2y| + |x-y| = 40$. We know that $|a| + |b| = 40$ implies $a = b = 20$ or $a = -b = 20$. So we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $x - 2y = y - 2x = 20$. Solving this system of equations gives $x = 20$ and $y = 0$. Substituting these values into the expression $(x-2y)^2 - 3y^2$ gives $(20)^2 - 3(0)^2 = 400$.

Case 2: $x - 2y = -(y - 2x) = 20$. Solving this system of equations gives $x = 0$ and $y = -20$. Substituting these values into the expression $(x-2y)^2 - 3y^2$ also gives $(0)^2 - 3(-20)^2 = -1200$. However, this value is negative and we are looking for the minimum value of the expression which must be positive. So this case is not valid.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $400$. The answer is $\boxed{400}$.

**Problem:** 
"Find the minimum value of $2x^2 + 2y^2 + 5z^2 - 2xy - 4yz - 4x - 2z + 15$ over all real numbers $x,$ $y,$ $z.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
We can write the given expression as
\begin{align*}
&(x^2 - 4x + 4) + (x^2 - 2xy + y^2) + (y^2 - 4yz + 4z^2) + (z^2 - 2z + 1) + 10 \\
&= (x - 2)^2 + (x - y)^2 + (y - 2z)^2 + (z - 1)^2 + 10
\end{align*}The minimum value is then $\boxed{10},$ which occurs when $x = 2,$ $y = 2,$ and $z = 1.$ The answer is $\boxed{10}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
**Problem**
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


This problem requires a bit of algebraic manipulation and some insight to solve it efficiently.

First, let's rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $5(x^2-1.6xy+y^2)$. Now, we can complete the square inside the parentheses:

$5[(x^2-1.6xy+0.64y^2) + (y^2 - 1.6xy + 0.64x^2)] - 5*0.64(x^2+y^2)$.

This simplifies to $5[(x-0.8y)^2 + (y-0.8x)^2] - 2.56(x^2+y^2)$.

Now, let's analyze the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. By the triangle inequality, we know that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |(x-2y) - (y-2x)| = |x-y|$. So, we have $|x-y| = 40$.

By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have $(1+1)(x^2+y^2) \geq (x+y)^2$, which simplifies to $2(x^2+y^2) \geq (x+y)^2$. But we also have $(x-y)^2 = (x+y)^2 - 4xy$, so $4xy = (x+y)^2 - (x-y)^2 = (x+y+x-y)(x+y-x+y) = 40^2$. Thus, $x^2+y^2 = \frac{40^2}{4} = 400$.

Substituting this back into our expression $5[(x-0.8y)^2 + (y-0.8x)^2] - 2.56(x^2+y^2)$, we get $5[(x-0.8y)^2 + (y-0.8x)^2] - 2.56*400 = 5[(x-0.8y)^2 + (y-0.8x)^2] - 1024$.

Since $(x-0.8y)^2$ and $(y-0.8x)^2$ are both non-negative, the minimum value of the expression is achieved when both of them are $0$, which means $x = 0.8y$ and $y = 0.8x$. Solving this system of equations, we find that $x = y = \frac{20}{\sqrt{5}}$.

Substituting these values back into the expression $5[(x-0.8y)^2 + (y-0.8x)^2] - 1024$, we get $5[(0)^2 + (0)^2] - 1024 = -1024$.

However, this is not possible because the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is always non-negative. So, we must have made a mistake somewhere. Let's go back and reevaluate our steps.

Upon closer inspection, we realize that we made a mistake in our algebraic manipulation. The correct expression should be $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(x^2-1.6xy+y^2) = 5[(x-0.8y)^2 + (y-0.8x)^2]$.

Now, let's reevaluate the minimum value of the expression under the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. By the triangle inequality, we know that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |(x-2y) - (y-2x)| = |x-y|$. So, we have $|x-y| = 40$.

By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have $(1+1)(x^2+y^2) \geq (x+y)^2$, which simplifies to $2(x^2+y^2) \geq (x+y)^2$. But we also have $(x-y)^2 = (x+y)^2 - 4xy$, so $4xy = (x+y)^2 - (x-y)^2 = (x+y+x-y)(x+y-x+y) = 40^2$. Thus, $x^2+y^2 = \frac{40^2}{4} = 400$.

Substituting this back into our expression $5[(x-0.8y)^2 + (y-0.8x)^2]$, we get $5[(x-0.8y)^2 + (y-0.8x)^2]$.

Since $(x-0.8y)^2$ and $(y-0.8x)^2$ are both non-negative, the minimum value of the expression is achieved when both of them are $0$, which means $x = 0.8y$ and $y = 0.8x$. Solving this system of equations, we find that $x = y = \frac{20}{\sqrt{5}}$.

Substituting these values back into the expression $5[(x-0.8y)^2 + (y-0.8x)^2]$, we get $5[(0)^2 + (0)^2] = 0$.

So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $0$. The answer is: $0$
