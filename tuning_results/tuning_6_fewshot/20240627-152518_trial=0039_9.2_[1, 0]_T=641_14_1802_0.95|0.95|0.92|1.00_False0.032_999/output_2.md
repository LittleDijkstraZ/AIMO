**Problem:** 
"How many integers are solutions to the equation $$(x-2)^{(25-x^2)}=1?$$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
We need some basic facts from number theory: $a^0 = 1$ for any $a,$ $1^b = 1$ for any $b,$ and $(-1)^c = 1$ if $c$ is an even integer. Unless the base is a complex number (which is excluded since we are looking for integer solutions), there are no other ways to get an RHS of $1.$ Thus, either the exponent is zero $($giving the equation $25 - x^2 = 0),$ the base is $1$ $($giving $x -2 = 1),$ or the base is $-1$ and the exponent is even $($giving the simultaneous equations $x - 2 = -1$ and $25 - x^2 = 2n$ for some integer $n).$ Solving the first equation gives $x = \pm 5,$ and solving the second gives $x = 3.$ The third equation implies that $x = 1,$ in which case $25 - x^2 = 24$ is indeed even, so $x = 1$ is a valid solution. In all, there are $\boxed{4}$ integer solutions. The answer is $\boxed{4}$

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The number of distinct solutions of the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] is equal to $4$ if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $2$. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ oscillates between $1$ and $3$, and it takes the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ exactly $4$ times if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $2$.
Therefore, we have $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which implies $100 < m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are precisely the integers from $101$ to $199$, inclusive. To find the number of these integers, we subtract the smallest integer from the largest and then add $1$. This gives us $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $99$. The answer is: $99$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many solutions does the equation \[\frac{(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)\dotsm(x-100)}{(x-1^2)(x-2^2)(x-3^2)\dotsm(x-100^2)} = 0\]have for $x$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Any solution to this equation must make the numerator of the left-hand side zero, while keeping the denominator non-zero. The numerator is zero when $x$ is one of the numbers $1, 2, 3, \dots, 100.$ However, for any value in this list that is a perfect square, the denominator will also be zero, so that value of $x$ will not be a root. Therefore, we want to find the number of integers in the list $1, 2, \dots, 100$ which are not perfect squares. The perfect squares in the list are $1^2, 2^2, \dots, 10^2,$ so there are $10$ perfect squares, and \[100 - 10 = \boxed{90}\]integers which are not perfect squares. The answer is $\boxed{90}$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many distinct solutions are there to the equation $|x-7| = |x+1|$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
If $|x-7| = |x+1|$, then either $x-7 = x+1$ or $x-7 = -(x+1)$.  Simplifying $x-7=x+1$ gives $0=8$, which has no solutions, so no values of $x$ satisfy $x-7 = x+1$.  If $x-7 = -(x+1)$, then $x-7 = -x-1$, so $2x = 6$, which gives $x=3$.  So, there is $\boxed{1}$ solution.

Challenge: See if you can find a quick solution to this problem by simply thinking about the graphs of $y=|x-7|$ and $y=|x+1|$. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


To solve this problem, we need to analyze the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\]

This equation has 4 distinct solutions if and only if the right hand side, $\frac{m}{100}$, is equal to $2$.

This is because the left hand side, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, is a quantity that varies between $0$ and $4$, inclusive. It equals $0$ when $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$, which gives two solutions. It equals $2$ when $\vert x-1 \vert = 4$, which gives four solutions. And it equals $4$ when $\vert x-1 \vert = 6$, which gives two solutions. So the only way for the equation to have four distinct solutions is when the right hand side is equal to $2$.

Therefore, we need to solve the equation $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, which gives $m = 200$.

So the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is $200$.
The answer is: $200$

Here is a Python code to solve the problem:
```python

**Solution:**


The problem is asking for the value of $m$ such that the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions. 

The graph of $| |x - 1| - 2|$ is a "V" shape with the "points" of the V at $x = -1$ and $x = 3$. The height of the "V" is 2, and the equation has 4 distinct solutions when the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, is in the range $(0, 2)$. 

So, we need to find the value of $m$ such that $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Multiplying all sides of the inequalities by 100 gives $0 < m < 200$. The only integer value of $m$ in this range that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions is $m = 100$.

```python

def find_m():

**Solution:** 


The problem is asking for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

This is a piecewise function with four cases to consider:
1. If $x \geq 2$, then $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = x - 3$.
2. If $1 \geq x \geq 0$, then $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -x - 1$.
3. If $x \leq 0$, then $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -x - 3$.

So the equation becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be rewritten as:
1. If $x \geq 2$, then $x - 3 = \frac{m}{100} \Rightarrow x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$.
2. If $1 \geq x \geq 0$, then $-x - 1 = \frac{m}{100} \Rightarrow x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.
3. If $x \leq 0$, then $-x - 3 = \frac{m}{100} \Rightarrow x = -3 - \frac{m}{100}$.

For each of these cases, we want to find the number of positive integer values of $m$ such that the corresponding equation for $x$ has exactly four distinct solutions.

By graphing the four cases, we can see that the piecewise function has four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 1$. Thus, $m = 100$.

Therefore, there is only one value of $m$, namely $100$, that gives four distinct solutions.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def number_of_solutions():
    # The only value of m that gives four distinct solutions is m = 100.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let \[f(x) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
-x + 3 & \text{if } x \le 0, \\
2x - 5 & \text{if } x > 0.
\end{array}
\right.\]How many solutions does the equation $f(f(x)) = 4$ have?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
To solve the equation $f(f(x)) = 4,$ we first find the values $x$ such that $f(x) = 4.$

Either $f(x) = -x + 3$ (for $x \le 0$) or $f(x) = 2x - 5$ (for $x > 0$). If $-x + 3 = 4,$ then $x = -1.$ Note that this value satisfies $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = 4,$ then $x = 9/2.$ Note that this value satisfies $x > 0.$ Therefore, the solutions to $f(x) = 4$ are $x = -1$ and $x = 9/2.$

Next, we solve for the values $x$ such that $f(x) = -1.$ If $-x + 3 = -1,$ then $x = 4.$ This value does not satisfy $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = -1,$ then $x = 2.$ This value satisfies $x > 0.$

Finally, we solve for the values $x$ such that $f(x) = 9/2.$ If $-x + 3 = 9/2,$ then $x = -3/2.$ This value satisfies $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = 9/2,$ then $x = 19/4.$ This value satisfies $x > 0.$

Therefore, the equation $f(f(x)) = 4$ has the solutions $x = 2,$ $-3/2,$ and $19/4,$ for a total of $\boxed{3}$ solutions. The answer is $\boxed{3}$

**Solution:**


The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ represents a piecewise function with four cases to consider:

1. If $\vert x - 1 \vert - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$, then $\vert x - 1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two sub-cases:
   a. If $x - 1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, then $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.
   b. If $-(x - 1) = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, then $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

2. If $\vert x - 1 \vert - 2 = -\frac{m}{100}$, then $\vert x - 1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two sub-cases:
   a. If $x - 1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, then $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
   b. If $-(x - 1) = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, then $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions when the four values of $x$ are all different. This happens when $-1 < \frac{m}{100} < 3$, i.e., when $$-100 < m < 300.$$The positive integers in this range are $1, 2, \ldots, 299$, so the number of such positive integers $m$ is $299$.

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $2$. This is because the function $| |x-1|-2|$ has a V-shape with a minimum value of $1$ and a maximum value of $3$. So, for the equation to have four distinct solutions, the right-hand side of the equation must be strictly between these values. If $\frac{m}{100}$ is less than or equal to $1$, the equation has at most three solutions. If $\frac{m}{100}$ is greater than or equal to $2$, the equation has at least five solutions. So, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be strictly between $1$ and $2$, which implies $1<\frac{m}{100}<2$. This simplifies to $100<m<200$. The positive integers $m$ in this range are $101, 102, \ldots, 199$. To find the number of these integers, subtract the smallest from the largest and add $1$: $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$. So, the equation has $4$ distinct solutions for $99$ different values of $m$. Therefore, the answer is $99$.

However, we must ensure that the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ does not correspond to a situation where the two absolute values collapse into a single one. This happens when $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, so $m = 200$. But this value of $m$ is not in the range $101$ to $199$, so we don't need to exclude it.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions is $99$. The answer is: $99$

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $2$. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a triangular wave that oscillates between $0$ and $3$ with a step at $x=1$ and $x=3$. The equation will have $4$ solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ falls strictly between $1$ and $2$.

To find the values of $m$ that satisfy this condition, we can set up the inequality $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Multiplying all parts of the inequality by $100$ gives $100 < m < 200$. The positive integers in this range are the integers from $101$ to $199$. To count the number of these integers, we can subtract the smallest integer from the largest and then add $1$ (since both endpoints are included in the range). So the number of such integers is $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$. Therefore, the value of the unknown variable $m$ is $99$.
