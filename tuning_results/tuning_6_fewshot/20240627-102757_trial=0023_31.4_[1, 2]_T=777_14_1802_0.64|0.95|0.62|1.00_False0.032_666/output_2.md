**Problem:** 
"How many solutions does the equation \[\frac{(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)\dotsm(x-100)}{(x-1^2)(x-2^2)(x-3^2)\dotsm(x-100^2)} = 0\]have for $x$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Any solution to this equation must make the numerator of the left-hand side zero, while keeping the denominator non-zero. The numerator is zero when $x$ is one of the numbers $1, 2, 3, \dots, 100.$ However, for any value in this list that is a perfect square, the denominator will also be zero, so that value of $x$ will not be a root. Therefore, we want to find the number of integers in the list $1, 2, \dots, 100$ which are not perfect squares. The perfect squares in the list are $1^2, 2^2, \dots, 10^2,$ so there are $10$ perfect squares, and \[100 - 10 = \boxed{90}\]integers which are not perfect squares. The answer is $\boxed{90}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we need to find the value of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions.

1. First, we need to understand the graph of the function $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. This function is a "hockey stick" function, with the "sticks" at $x=1-2= -1$ and $x=1+2=3$. The height of the "sticks" is 2. So the function takes the value 0 for $x \in [-1, 3]$, and takes the value 2 for $x < -1$ and $x > 3$.

2. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have four distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is in the range $(0, 2)$. This means $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, or equivalently, $0 < m < 200$.

3. To find the value of $m$ that satisfies this condition, we can set $\frac{m}{100} = 1$, which gives $m = 100$. So the only value of $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is $m = 100$.

The value of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions is $100$.
The answer is: $100$.

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The number of distinct solutions to the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is $4$ if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ reaches its maximum value of $2$ at $4$ distinct points.

Setting $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, we can solve for $m$:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

def find_m():
    m = symbols('m')
    equation = Eq(m/100, 2)
    solution = solve(equation, m)
    return solution[0]

m = find_m()
print(m)
```

CODE RESULTS 200

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
200
```
The value of $m$ that makes the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have $4$ distinct solutions is $200$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy this condition is $1$. The answer is: $1$

**Problem**

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The number of distinct solutions of the equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ is equal to 4 if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 1$. This is because the function $| |x - 1| - 2 |$ is a "V" shape with the maximum value of 2 at $x = 1$, and it decreases to 0 as $x$ goes to $\pm \infty$. The equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100} = 1$, which gives $m = 100$. Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions, and that is $m = 100$. The answer is $\boxed{1}$.

**Solution:** 



We will use a sympy-based approach to solve this problem. We will first set up the equation and then iterate over the possible values of $m$ to find the ones that give us 4 distinct solutions.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve, Abs, N

def find_m():
    x = symbols('x')
    m = symbols('m', integer=True)
    num_solutions = 0

    for possible_m in range(1, 101):
        equation = Eq(Abs(Abs(x - 1) - 2), possible_m / 100)
        solutions = solve(equation, x)
        if len(solutions) == 4:
            num_solutions += 1

    return num_solutions

result = find_m()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 100

The value of $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is 1. However, this is not what the problem asks for. The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions. So, we need to iterate over the possible values of $m$ and count the ones that give us 4 distinct solutions.

After iterating over the possible values of $m$, we find that the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is 100.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many distinct solutions are there to the equation $|x-7| = |x+1|$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
If $|x-7| = |x+1|$, then either $x-7 = x+1$ or $x-7 = -(x+1)$.  Simplifying $x-7=x+1$ gives $0=8$, which has no solutions, so no values of $x$ satisfy $x-7 = x+1$.  If $x-7 = -(x+1)$, then $x-7 = -x-1$, so $2x = 6$, which gives $x=3$.  So, there is $\boxed{1}$ solution.

Challenge: See if you can find a quick solution to this problem by simply thinking about the graphs of $y=|x-7|$ and $y=|x+1|$. The answer is $\boxed{1}$
