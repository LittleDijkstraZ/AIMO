**Problem:** 
"Five identical rectangles are arranged to form a larger rectangle $PQRS$, as shown.  The area of $PQRS$ is $4000$.  What is the length, $x$, rounded off to the nearest integer? [asy]
real x = 1; real w = 2/3;

// Draw outer square and labels
pair s = (0, 0); pair r = (2 * x, 0); pair q = (3 * w, x + w); pair p = (0, x + w);
draw(s--r--q--p--cycle);
label("$S$", s, SW); label("$R$", r, SE); label("$Q$", q, NE); label("$P$", p, NW);

// Draw other segments
draw((x, 0)--(x, w));
draw((0, w)--(2 * x, w));
draw((w, x + w)--(w, w)); draw((2 * w, x + w)--(2 * w, w));

// length labels
pair upper = (-0.1, x + w);
pair lower = (-0.1, w);
draw(lower--upper);
draw((-0.1 - 0.03, x + w)--(-0.1 + 0.03, x + w));
draw((-0.1 - 0.03, w)--(-0.1 + 0.03, w));
label("$x$", midpoint((-0.1, w)--(-0.1, x + w)), W);

pair left = (0, -0.1); pair right = (x, -0.1);
draw((0, -0.1 + 0.03)--(0, -0.1 - 0.03));
draw((x, -0.1 - 0.03)--(x, -0.1 + 0.03));
draw(left--right);
label("$x$", (x/2, -0.1), S);

[/asy]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Let $w$ be the width of each of the identical rectangles. Since $PQ=3w$, $RS=2x$ and $PQ=RS$ (because $PQRS$ is a rectangle), then $2x = 3w$, or $$w=\frac{2}{3}x.$$ Therefore, the area of each of the five identical rectangles is $$x\left(\frac{2}{3}x\right)=\frac{2}{3}x^2.$$ Since the area of $PQRS$ is 4000 and it is made up of five of these identical smaller rectangles, then $$5\left(\frac{2}{3}x^2\right)=4000$$ or $$\frac{10}{3}x^2 = 4000$$ or $x^2 = 1200$ or $x \approx 34.6$ which, when rounded off to the nearest integer, is $\boxed{35}.$ The answer is $\boxed{35}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


The problem is asking for the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points that satisfy the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

The equation is equal to zero if either of the two factors is zero. So we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 \neq 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 \neq 0$.

For the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$. For the second case, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.

The four lines given by $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$ form a square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$. The area of this square is $(10\sqrt{2})^2 = 200$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $200$. The answer is: $200$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Find the number of 10-tuples $(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{10})$ of real numbers such that
\[(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2 = \frac{1}{11}.\]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,
\begin{align*}
&[(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + \dots + 1^2 + 1^2)][(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2] \\
&\ge [(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + (x_2 - x_3) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10}]^2 = 1.
\end{align*}From the given condition, we have equality, so by the equality condition for Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[\frac{1 - x_1}{1} = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{1} = \frac{x_2 - x_3}{1} = \dots = \frac{x_9 - x_{10}}{1} = \frac{x_{10}}{1}.\]Let
\[d = 1 - x_1 = x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_3 = \dots = x_9 - x_{10} = x_{10}.\]Then
\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so
\[(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_{10}) = \left( \frac{10}{11}, \frac{9}{11}, \frac{8}{11}, \dots, \frac{1}{11} \right).\]In particular, there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if and only if at least one of the factors is zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of a square with side length 20.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of a square with side length 16.

The area of a square with side length $s$ is $s^2$. So the area of the first square is $20^2 = 400$ and the area of the second square is $16^2 = 256$. The total area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of these two squares, which is $400 + 256 = 656$.
The answer is: $656$

Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

\[\frac{1 - x_1}{1} = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{1} = \frac{x_2 - x_3}{1} = \dots = \frac{x_9 - x_{10}}{1} = \frac{x_{10}}{1}.\]Let
\[d = 1 - x_1 = x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_3 = \dots = x_9 - x_{10} = x_{10}.\]Then
\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so

**Solution:** 



The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, which means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. 

Let's analyze each case:

1. If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = \pm 10$.
2. If $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x - y = \pm 10$.
3. If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$, which implies $x = \pm 8$.
4. If $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $y = \pm 8$.

The solutions to these equations are the vertices of the polygon. By plotting these lines on a graph, we can see that the polygon is a square with side length 16 (the sum of the absolute values of the x and y coordinates).

The area of a square is given by side length squared, so the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: 256

To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step.

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


The problem asks for the area of a polygon that is enclosed by the points that satisfy the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

The equation is equal to zero if either of the two factors is zero. This gives us two sets of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first set of equations, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which gives $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$. And $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives $x = 8$ or $x = -8$ and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

The intersection of these two sets of solutions gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -10)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -10)$.

For the second set of equations, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which gives $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$. And $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives $x = 8$ or $x = -8$ and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

The intersection of these two sets of solutions gives us the same vertices as before.

So the polygon is a square with side length $20$. The area of the square is $20^2 = 400$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $400$.

The answer is: $400$

**Solution:** 


The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. This expression is zero if and only if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This happens if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two lines in the coordinate plane, so they enclose a rectangle.

The second expression is $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This expression is zero if and only if both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This happens if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two circles in the coordinate plane, so they enclose a square.

The intersection of the rectangle and the square is the convex polygon that we are looking for. The side length of the square is 16 (since $\vert x \vert = 8$ means $-8 \leq x \leq 8$), and the diagonals of the rectangle are of length 20 (since $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ means $-10 \leq x + y \leq 10$ and $-10 \leq x - y \leq 10$). The diagonals of a rectangle are equal, so the rectangle is a square with side length 10.

The area of the convex polygon is the area of the square minus the area of the two triangles that make up the rectangle. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$, and the area of each triangle is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot 10^2 = 50$. So the area of the convex polygon is $256 - 2 \cdot 50 = 156$.

The answer is: $\boxed{156}$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many square units are in the area of the triangle whose vertices are the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the curve $y = (x-3)^2 (x+2)$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we need to find where this curve intersects the $x$ and $y$ axes.  If $y=0$, then $(x-3)^2(x+2)=0$, which has solutions of $x=3$ and $x=-2$.  If $x=0$, then $y=(-3)^2(2)=18$.  So, the curve has two $x$-intercepts and one $y$-intercept.  The length of the base along the $x$-axis is $3-(-2)=5$.  The height from this base is equal to the $y$-intercept, 18.  The area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 5\cdot 18=\boxed{45}$. The answer is $\boxed{45}$

**Solution:** 



1. First, we need to understand that the expression $A \cdot B = 0$ is true if and only if $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. So the given equation is satisfied if either of the two factors is zero.

2. The first factor is zero when $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x - y| - 10 = 0$. These equations simplify to $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

3. The second factor is zero when $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$. These equations simplify to $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

4. The intersection points of these lines are the vertices of the polygon. By plotting these lines, we find that the polygon is a square with side length 16.

5. The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

The answer is: $256$

The equation $A \cdot B = 0$ is true if and only if $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. So our task is to find the area of the two shapes defined by the equations $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$. These are the equations of two parallel lines. Similarly, the equation $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = \pm 10$. These are also the equations of two parallel lines.

The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$. These are the equations of two vertical lines. Similarly, the equation $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = \pm 8$. These are the equations of two horizontal lines.

Now we can draw the picture: the four lines $x + y = \pm 10$, $x - y = \pm 10$, $x = \pm 8$, and $y = \pm 8$ form a rectangle with side lengths 16 and 20.

The area of the rectangle is $16 \times 20 = 320$. So the area of the convex polygon is 320.

```python

    solutions2 = solve([Abs(x + y) - 10, -Abs(x - y) + 10, Abs(x) - 8, Abs(y) - 8])
    solutions3 = solve([Abs(x + y) - 10, Abs(x - y) - 10, -Abs(x) + 8, Abs(y) - 8])
    solutions4 = solve([Abs(x + y) - 10, Abs(x - y) - 10, Abs(x) - 8, -Abs(y) + 8])

    # Calculate the side lengths of the rectangle
    side1 = max([abs(sol[x] - sol[y]) for sol in solutions1])
    side2 = max([abs(sol[x] + sol[y]) for sol in solutions1])

    # Calculate the area of the rectangle
    area = side1 * side2

    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)

It seems there was a mistake in the calculation. Let's correct it.

The four lines $x + y = \pm 10$, $x - y = \pm 10$, $x = \pm 8$, and $y = \pm 8$ form a rectangle with side lengths 16 and 20.

The area of the rectangle is $16 \times 20 = 320$. So the area of the convex polygon is 320.

```python

def area_of_polygon():
    # The side lengths of the rectangle

**Problem:** 
"Find the number of 10-tuples $(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{10})$ of real numbers such that
\[(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2 = \frac{1}{11}.\]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,
\begin{align*}
&[(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + \dots + 1^2 + 1^2)][(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2] \\
&\ge [(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + (x_2 - x_3) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10}]^2 = 1.
\end{align*}From the given condition, we have equality, so by the equality condition for Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[\frac{1 - x_1}{1} = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{1} = \frac{x_2 - x_3}{1} = \dots = \frac{x_9 - x_{10}}{1} = \frac{x_{10}}{1}.\]Let
\[d = 1 - x_1 = x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_3 = \dots = x_9 - x_{10} = x_{10}.\]Then
\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so
\[(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_{10}) = \left( \frac{10}{11}, \frac{9}{11}, \frac{8}{11}, \dots, \frac{1}{11} \right).\]In particular, there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we first need to understand the properties of absolute value and the conditions under which the product of two expressions equals zero.

The equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

The product of two expressions is zero if and only if at least one of the expressions is zero. So, we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This can only happen if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$.

2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This can only happen if both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$.

The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 10 (the distance between the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, or the distance between the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$). The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 100.

The answer is: $100$

draw(left--right);
label("$x$", (x/2, -0.1), S);

[/asy]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Let $w$ be the width of each of the identical rectangles. Since $PQ=3w$, $RS=2x$ and $PQ=RS$ (because $PQRS$ is a rectangle), then $2x = 3w$, or $$w=\frac{2}{3}x.$$ Therefore, the area of each of the five identical rectangles is $$x\left(\frac{2}{3}x\right)=\frac{2}{3}x^2.$$ Since the area of $PQRS$ is 4000 and it is made up of five of these identical smaller rectangles, then $$5\left(\frac{2}{3}x^2\right)=4000$$ or $$\frac{10}{3}x^2 = 4000$$ or $x^2 = 1200$ or $x \approx 34.6$ which, when rounded off to the nearest integer, is $\boxed{35}.$ The answer is $\boxed{35}$

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


This problem is a bit complex and requires a deep understanding of absolute value and inequalities. However, we can simplify it by understanding that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to the system of equations:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0,$$
$$((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$
From the first equation, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving this system of equations, we find that the points are $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, and $(-5,-5)$.
From the second equation, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving this system of equations, we find that the points are $(8,0)$, $(0,8)$, $(-8,0)$, and $(0,-8)$.
The convex polygon formed by these points is a square with side length 10. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $10^2 = 100$.

**Problem:** 
"How many square units are in the area of the triangle whose vertices are the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the curve $y = (x-3)^2 (x+2)$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we need to find where this curve intersects the $x$ and $y$ axes.  If $y=0$, then $(x-3)^2(x+2)=0$, which has solutions of $x=3$ and $x=-2$.  If $x=0$, then $y=(-3)^2(2)=18$.  So, the curve has two $x$-intercepts and one $y$-intercept.  The length of the base along the $x$-axis is $3-(-2)=5$.  The height from this base is equal to the $y$-intercept, 18.  The area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 5\cdot 18=\boxed{45}$. The answer is $\boxed{45}$

**Solution:** 



This problem involves understanding the absolute value function and how to handle it in a mathematical context. The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero, which means either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. We can break this down into two separate cases.

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
The absolute value function splits into two cases:
- If $x + y \geq 0$, then $x + y = 10$.
- If $x + y < 0$, then $-(x + y) = 10$, which simplifies to $x + y = -10$.

Similarly, for $\vert x - y \vert = 10$:
- If $x - y \geq 0$, then $x - y = 10$.
- If $x - y < 0$, then $-(x - y) = 10$, which simplifies to $x - y = -10$.

These four equations represent the sides of a square with side length 10 units.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
Again, the absolute value function splits into two cases:
- If $x \geq 0$, then $x = 8$.
- If $x < 0$, then $-(x) = 8$, which simplifies to $x = -8$.

Similarly, for $\vert y \vert = 8$:
- If $y \geq 0$, then $y = 8$.
- If $y < 0$, then $-(y) = 8$, which simplifies to $y = -8$.

These four equations represent the sides of a square with side length 8 units.

The intersection of the two squares forms a smaller square with side length 6 units (since 10 - 8 = 2 and removing the corners of the larger square, we are left with a side length of 8 - 2 = 6 units).

The area of a square is given by side length squared, so the area of the convex polygon is $6^2 = 36$ square units.

The answer is: $36$

Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,
\begin{align*}
&[(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + \dots + 1^2 + 1^2)][(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2] \\
&\ge [(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + (x_2 - x_3) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10}]^2 = 1.
\end{align*}From the given condition, we have equality, so by the equality condition for Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[\frac{1 - x_1}{1} = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{1} = \frac{x_2 - x_3}{1} = \dots = \frac{x_9 - x_{10}}{1} = \frac{x_{10}}{1}.\]Let
\[d = 1 - x_1 = x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_3 = \dots = x_9 - x_{10} = x_{10}.\]Then
\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so
\[(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_{10}) = \left( \frac{10}{11}, \frac{9}{11}, \frac{8}{11}, \dots, \frac{1}{11} \right).\]In particular, there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Solution:** 


The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. This means that the points that satisfy the equation are either the points that satisfy the equation $|x+y| - 10 = 0$, $|x-y| - 10 = 0$, $|x| - 8 = 0$, or $|y| - 8 = 0$.

The equations $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x-y| - 10 = 0$ imply that $|x+y| = 10$ and $|x-y| = 10$. These are the equations of two squares with side length 20, centered at the origin, with one square lying along the line $y=x$ and the other along the line $y=-x$.

The equations $|x| - 8 = 0$ and $|y| - 8 = 0$ imply that $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. These are the equations of two squares with side length 16, centered at the origin, one along the x-axis and the other along the y-axis.

The intersection of these squares is a square with side length 16, centered at the origin. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So the area of the convex polygon is 256.
