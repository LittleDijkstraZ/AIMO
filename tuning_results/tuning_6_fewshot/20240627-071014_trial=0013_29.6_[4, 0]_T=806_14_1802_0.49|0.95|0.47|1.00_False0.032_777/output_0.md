**Problem:** 
"The graph of the quadratic $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ is a parabola that passes through the points $(-1,7)$, $(5,7)$, and $(6,10)$.  What is the $x$-coordinate of the vertex of the parabola?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
We could substitute the points into the equation $y = ax^2 + bx + c$, solve for $a$, $b$, and $c$, and then complete the square to find the coordinates of the vertex.

However, a much faster way is to recognize that two of the points, namely $(-1,7)$ and $(5,7)$, have the same $y$-coordinate.  Therefore, these two points are symmetric about the parabola's axis of symmetry.  The axis must pass through the midpoint of the segment connecting these two symmetric points, so the axis must pass through $\left(\frac{-1+5}{2},\frac{7+7}{2}\right)$, which is $(2,7)$.  Therefore, the axis of symmetry is a vertical line through $(2,7)$.  This line is the graph of the equation $x=2$.  The axis of symmetry also passes through the vertex of the parabola, so the $x$-coordinate of the vertex is $\boxed{2}$. The answer is $\boxed{2}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $\boxed{\frac{2(18k - l + 4)}{k}}$. However, we know that the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6. By the distance formula, we have $(B - A)^2 = (B^2 - A^2) = (2k)^2 = 4k^2$. But $(B - A)^2 = 6^2 = 36$, so $4k^2 = 36$ and $k^2 = 9$, which implies $k = 3$.

Substitute $k = 3$ into the expression for the sum of squares of distances, we get

The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $\frac{116}{3} - \frac{2l}{3}$. But we know that the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$, so the value of $l$ should make the discriminant of the quadratic equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$ equal to zero. The discriminant is $(2k)^2 - 4k(l - 4) = 4k^2 - 4kl + 16k$. But we know that $k = 3$, so the discriminant is $4*3^2 - 4*3*l + 16*3 = 36 - 12l + 48 = 84 - 12l$. Setting the discriminant equal to zero gives $84 - 12l = 0$, so $l = 7$.

Substitute $l = 7$ into the expression for the sum of squares of distances, we get

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $\mathcal{P}$ be the parabola in the plane determined by the equation $y = x^2.$  Suppose a circle $\mathcal{C}$ intersects $\mathcal{P}$ at four distinct points.  If three of these points are $(-28,784),$ $(-2,4),$ and $(13,169),$ find the sum of the distances from the focus of $\mathcal{P}$ to all four of the intersection points."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Let the four intersection points be $(a,a^2),$ $(b,b^2),$ $(c,c^2),$ and $(d,d^2).$  Let the equation of the circle be
\[(x - k)^2 + (y - h)^2 = r^2.\]Substituting $y = x^2,$ we get
\[(x - k)^2 + (x^2 - h)^2 = r^2.\]Expanding this equation, we get a fourth degree polynomial whose roots are $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ and $d.$  Furthermore, the coefficient of $x^3$ is 0, so by Vieta's formulas, $a + b + c + d = 0.$

We are given that three intersection points are $(-28,784),$ $(-2,4),$ and $(13,196),$ so the fourth root is $-((-28) + (-2) + 13) = 17.$

The distance from the focus to a point on the parabola is equal to the distance from the point to the directrix, which is $y = -\frac{1}{4}.$  Thus, the sum of the distances is
\[784 + \frac{1}{4} + 4 + \frac{1}{4} + 169 + \frac{1}{4} + 17^2 + \frac{1}{4} = \boxed{1247}.\] The answer is $\boxed{1247}$

The abscissas of points $A$ and $B$ are $(k - \sqrt{k(k - l + 4)})/k$ and $(k + \sqrt{k(k - l + 4)})/k$ respectively.

The distance between $A$ and $B$ is given as 6, so we have the equation
\[|(k + \sqrt{k(k - l + 4)})/k - (k - \sqrt{k(k - l + 4)})/k| = 6.\]
Simplifying this equation gives $2\sqrt{k(k - l + 4)}/k = 6$, or $\sqrt{k(k - l + 4)} = 3k$. Squaring both sides gives $k(k - l + 4) = 9k^2$, or $k - l + 4 = 9k$, or $l = -8k + 4$.

The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is given by
\[((k - \sqrt{k(k - l + 4)})/k)^2 + ((k + \sqrt{k(k - l + 4)})/k)^2.\]
Substituting $l = -8k + 4$ gives
\[((k - \sqrt{k(-7k + 4)})/k)^2 + ((k + \sqrt{k(-7k + 4)})/k)^2.\]
This simplifies to $2(k^2 + (-7k + 4))/k^2 = 2(8k^2 - 4k + 4)/k^2 = 2(8 - 4/k + 4/k^2) = 2(8 + 4/k^2)$.

Now we need to find the value of $k$ that makes this expression equal to a certain value. Let's denote the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin as $S$. We have the equation $2(8 + 4/k^2) = S$.

We can solve this equation numerically for different values of $k$ and $S$ to find the value of $k$ that makes the equation true.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve, N

def find_k():
    """Find the value of k that makes the equation true."""
    k, S = symbols('k S')
    equation = Eq(2 * (8 + 4/k**2), S)
    solution = solve(equation, k)
    return solution

k_values = find_k()
print(k_values)
```

CODE RESULTS [-2*sqrt(2)*sqrt(1/(S - 16)), 2*sqrt(2)*sqrt(1/(S - 16))]

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
[-2*sqrt(2)*sqrt(1/(S - 16)), 2*sqrt(2)*sqrt(1/(S - 16))]
```
The value of $k$ that makes the equation true is $2\sqrt{2}\sqrt{1/(S - 16)}$.

Now we can substitute this value of $k$ into the equation $2(8 + 4/k^2) = S$ to find the value of $S$.

```python

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve, N

def find_S():

    equation = Eq(2 * (8 + 4/k**2), S)
    solution = solve(equation, S)
    return N(solution[0])

## QUESTION 0 - 6

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"The graph of the quadratic $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ is a parabola that passes through the points $(-1,7)$, $(5,7)$, and $(6,10)$.  What is the $x$-coordinate of the vertex of the parabola?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
We could substitute the points into the equation $y = ax^2 + bx + c$, solve for $a$, $b$, and $c$, and then complete the square to find the coordinates of the vertex.

However, a much faster way is to recognize that two of the points, namely $(-1,7)$ and $(5,7)$, have the same $y$-coordinate.  Therefore, these two points are symmetric about the parabola's axis of symmetry.  The axis must pass through the midpoint of the segment connecting these two symmetric points, so the axis must pass through $\left(\frac{-1+5}{2},\frac{7+7}{2}\right)$, which is $(2,7)$.  Therefore, the axis of symmetry is a vertical line through $(2,7)$.  This line is the graph of the equation $x=2$.  The axis of symmetry also passes through the vertex of the parabola, so the $x$-coordinate of the vertex is $\boxed{2}$. The answer is $\boxed{2}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

CODE RESULTS 2*(18*k - l + 4)/k

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
2*(18*k - l + 4)/k
```
The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $2*(18*k - l + 4)/k$. However, we know that the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, and the equation of the parabola is $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$. The derivative of this equation with respect to $x$ is $2kx - 2k$, which represents the slope of the tangent line to the parabola at any point. Since the line $y=4$ is tangent to the parabola at points $A$ and $B$, the slope of the tangent line at these points is 0. Therefore, $2kx - 2k = 0$, which implies that $x = 1$. Substituting $x = 1$ into the equation of the parabola gives $y = k - 2k + l = l - k$. Since the line $y=4$ intersects the parabola at points $A$ and $B$, we have $l - k = 4$, or $l = k + 4$.

Substituting $l = k + 4$ into the equation for the sum of the squares of the distances gives:

```python

from sympy import symbols, solve, simplify, sqrt

    # Substitute l = k + 4 into the sum of squares of distances
