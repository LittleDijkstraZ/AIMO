**Problem:** 
"How many square units are in the area of the triangle whose vertices are the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the curve $y = (x-3)^2 (x+2)$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we need to find where this curve intersects the $x$ and $y$ axes.  If $y=0$, then $(x-3)^2(x+2)=0$, which has solutions of $x=3$ and $x=-2$.  If $x=0$, then $y=(-3)^2(2)=18$.  So, the curve has two $x$-intercepts and one $y$-intercept.  The length of the base along the $x$-axis is $3-(-2)=5$.  The height from this base is equal to the $y$-intercept, 18.  The area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 5\cdot 18=\boxed{45}$. The answer is $\boxed{45}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. 

The first expression is zero when $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x - y| - 10 = 0$. These equations simplify to $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, and $(0, -10)$.

The second expression is zero when $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$. These equations simplify to $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(8, -8)$.

The intersection of the two sets of lines is the set of points that satisfy both conditions. This intersection is the rectangle formed by the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$, but with the square cut out of it. The area of the square is $8^2 = 64$, and the area of the rectangle is $20 \times 20 = 400$. So the area of the convex polygon is $400 - 64 = 336$.

The python code to calculate the area of the convex polygon is:
```python

The area of the polygon is 0, which is not possible. There seems to be a mistake in the calculation. Let's re-examine the problem.

The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?

The given equation is satisfied when either of the two factors is zero.
For the first factor to be zero, either $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x - y| - 10 = 0$.
This implies that either $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$ or $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
Similarly, for the second factor to be zero, either $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$.
This implies that either $x = 8$ or $x = -8$ or $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

By solving these equations, we find the vertices of the polygon:
(10, 0), (-10, 0), (0, 10), (0, -10), (8, 0), (-8, 0), (0, 8), (0, -8).

The area of the polygon is the sum of the areas of the triangles formed by the vertices.
The area of a triangle with vertices $(x1, y1)$, $(x2, y2)$, $(x3, y3)$ is given by $0.5 * |x1(y2 - y3) + x2(y3 - y1) + x3(y1 - y2)|$.

By calculating the areas of the triangles formed by the vertices, we find that the total area of the polygon is 320 square units.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 320 square units. The answer is: 320

label("$x$", (x/2, -0.1), S);

[/asy]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Let $w$ be the width of each of the identical rectangles. Since $PQ=3w$, $RS=2x$ and $PQ=RS$ (because $PQRS$ is a rectangle), then $2x = 3w$, or $$w=\frac{2}{3}x.$$ Therefore, the area of each of the five identical rectangles is $$x\left(\frac{2}{3}x\right)=\frac{2}{3}x^2.$$ Since the area of $PQRS$ is 4000 and it is made up of five of these identical smaller rectangles, then $$5\left(\frac{2}{3}x^2\right)=4000$$ or $$\frac{10}{3}x^2 = 4000$$ or $x^2 = 1200$ or $x \approx 34.6$ which, when rounded off to the nearest integer, is $\boxed{35}.$ The answer is $\boxed{35}$

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The expression $AB=0$ is true if and only if $A=0$ or $B=0$. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The first two equations imply $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, respectively. The last two equations imply $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, respectively.
The solutions to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ are given by the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.
The solutions to $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ are given by the lines $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.
The solutions to $\vert x \vert = 8$ are given by the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.
The solutions to $\vert y \vert = 8$ are given by the lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.
The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 16. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$

**Solution:** 



This problem involves understanding the properties of absolute value and how it interacts with equations and inequalities. The equation given is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. We will consider each case separately.

1. For the first term to be zero, we have $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x - y| - 10 = 0$. This implies $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$. The absolute value equations can be rewritten as $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. This gives us a system of four equations:
   - $x + y = 10$
   - $x + y = -10$
   - $x - y = 10$
   - $x - y = -10$
   Solving these systems, we find the vertices of the polygon to be $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, and $(-10, 0)$.

2. For the second term to be zero, we have $|x| - 8 = 0$ and $|y| - 8 = 0$. This implies $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. The absolute value equations can be rewritten as $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us a system of four equations:
   - $x = 8$
   - $x = -8$
   - $y = 8$
   - $y = -8$
   Solving these systems, we find the vertices of the polygon to be $(8, 0)$, $(-8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, and $(0, -8)$.

Now, we can plot these points on a coordinate plane to visualize the polygon. The polygon is a square with side length 20 units (the distance between the points $(0, 10)$ and $(0, -10)$, or $(8, 0)$ and $(-8, 0)$, for example). To find the area of the square, we can use the formula for the area of a square, which is side length squared. The side length is 20 units, so the area of the square is $20^2 = 400$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 400 square units. The answer is: $400$

**Solution:**


The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, which means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. Let's analyze each term separately.

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which gives $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which gives $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x \vert = 8$, which gives $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

The solutions to these equations give us the vertices of the polygon: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(2, 8)$, $(-2, 8)$, $(2, -8)$, and $(-2, -8)$. These vertices form a square with side length 16. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"An ellipse is defined parametrically by
\[(x,y) = \left( \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t}, \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t} \right).\]Then the equation of the ellipse can be written in the form
\[Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0,\]where $A,$ $B,$ $C,$ $D,$ $E,$ and $F$ are integers, and $\gcd(|A|,|B|,|C|,|D|,|E|,|F|) = 1.$  Find $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F|.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
In the equation $y = \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\cos t$ to get
\[\cos t = \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3}.\]In the equation $x = \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\sin t$ to get
\[\sin t = \frac{1}{2} x (2 - \cos t) + 1 = \frac{1}{2} x \left( 2 - \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right) + 1 = 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)}.\]Since $\cos^2 t + \sin^2 t = 1,$
\[\left( \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right)^2 + \left( 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)} \right)^2 = 1.\]Multiplying both sides by $(2(y + 3))^2$ and expanding, it will simplify to
\[81x^2 - 36xy + 16y^2 - 108x + 240y + 900 = 0.\]Therefore, $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F| = 81 + 36 + 16 + 108 + 240 + 900 = \boxed{1381}.$ The answer is $\boxed{1381}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This means that the points that satisfy the equation are the points that satisfy any of the four conditions $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The points that satisfy $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ form a square with side length 10, the points that satisfy $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ form another square with side length 10, the points that satisfy $\vert x \vert = 8$ form a square with side length 16, and the points that satisfy $\vert y \vert = 8$ form another square with side length 16.
The intersection of these squares is the convex polygon that encloses the points that satisfy the equation.
The area of this convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the four squares, which is $10^2 + 10^2 + 16^2 + 16^2 = 100 + 100 + 256 + 256 = 712$.
The answer is: $712$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_ 2= (-16,2).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that
\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as
\[\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1.\]Find $h + k + a + b.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

The area of this polygon is 0, as the only points that satisfy the equation are the vertices of the polygon. The polygon is a square with side length 16 (since the absolute value of both x and y must be equal to 8 for the second term to equal zero, and the absolute value of both x+y and x-y must be equal to 10 for the first term to equal zero). The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$
