**Problem:** 
"If $x + 2y= 4$ and $xy = -8$, what is the value of $x^2 + 4y^2$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
We see that $(x + 2y)^2 = (x^2 + 4y^2) + 4xy = 4^2 = 16$. We want to find $x^2 + 4y^2$ and are given $xy = -8$. So, $x^2 + 4y^2 + 4xy = x^2 + 4y^2 + 4(-8) = 16$. It follows that $x^2 + 4y^2 = \boxed{48}$. The answer is $\boxed{48}$

**Problem**
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


This problem is a bit tricky to solve directly, but we can simplify it by using the fact that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is equivalent to $x^2 + y^2 = 40$. This is because $|x-2y| + |y-2x|$ is always equal to $5(x^2 + y^2)$, and we are given that this is equal to 40.

Now, we want to find the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ subject to the constraint $x^2 + y^2 = 40$. We can rewrite the expression as $5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy = 5*40 - 8xy = 200 - 8xy$.

To minimize this expression, we need to maximize the value of $8xy$. By the AM-GM inequality, we have $8xy \leq 2\sqrt{(8xy)^2} = 2\sqrt{64x^2y^2} = 2\sqrt{64(x^2 + y^2)^2/4} = 2\sqrt{64*40^2/4} = 2*40*4 = 320$.

Equality occurs when $x = 2y$ or $y = 2x$, which are equivalent to the original constraint. Therefore, the maximum value of $8xy$ is 320, and the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $200 - 320 = -120$.

However, this result doesn't make sense in the context of the problem, as the minimum value of a quadratic expression should be non-negative. We must have made a mistake in our reasoning.

Let's go back and re-examine the problem. We are asked to find the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, but we have a constraint that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. This constraint simplifies to $x^2 + y^2 = 40$, but this is not the correct constraint.

The correct constraint should be $|x-2y|^2 + |y-2x|^2 = 40^2$, which simplifies to $5(x^2 + y^2) = 40^2$, or $x^2 + y^2 = 40^2/5 = 320$.

Now, we want to find the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ subject to the constraint $x^2 + y^2 = 320$. We can rewrite the expression as $5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy = 5*320 - 8xy = 1600 - 8xy$.

To minimize this expression, we need to maximize the value of $8xy$. By the AM-GM inequality, we have $8xy \leq 2\sqrt{(8xy)^2} = 2\sqrt{64x^2y^2} = 2\sqrt{64(x^2 + y^2)^2/4} = 2\sqrt{64*320^2/4} = 2*80*8 = 1280$.

Equality occurs when $x = 2y$ or $y = 2x$, which are equivalent to the original constraint. Therefore, the maximum value of $8xy$ is 1280, and the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $1600 - 1280 = 320$.

So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 320.

**Problem:** 
"What is the minimum value of the expression $2x^2+3y^2+8x-24y+62$ for real $x$ and $y$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Rearranging the expression, we have  \[2x^2+8x+3y^2-24y+62\]We first complete the square in $x$. Factoring a 2 from the first two terms of the expression, we get  \[2(x^2+4x)+3y^2-24y+62\]In order for the expression inside the parenthesis to be a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(4/2)^2=4$ inside the parenthesis. Doing this, we have \[2(x^2+4x+4-4)+3y^2-24y+62 \Rightarrow 2(x+2)^2+3y^2-24y+54\]Now we complete the square in $y$. Factoring a 3 from the $y$ terms in the expression, we get \[2(x+2)^2+3(y^2-8y)+54\]In order for the expression inside the second parenthesis to be a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(8/2)^2=16$ inside the parenthesis. Doing this, we have \[2(x+2)^2+3(y^2-8y+16-16)+54 \Rightarrow 2(x+2)^2+3(y-4)^2+6\]Since the minimum value of $2(x+2)^2$ and $3(y-4)^2$ is $0$ (perfect squares can never be negative), the minimum value of the entire expression is $\boxed{6}$, and is achieved when $x=-2$ and $y=4$. The answer is $\boxed{6}$

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


This problem is a bit tricky to solve directly. However, we can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to solve it.

The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states that for any real numbers $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$ and $b_1, b_2, ..., b_n$, we have
\[(a_1^2 + a_2^2 + ... + a_n^2)(b_1^2 + b_2^2 + ... + b_n^2) \geq (a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 + ... + a_nb_n)^2.\]

Let's apply this inequality to our problem. Let $a_1 = x$, $a_2 = y$, $b_1 = 2$, and $b_2 = -1$. Then we have
\[(x^2 + y^2)((2)^2 + (-1)^2) \geq (x*2 + y*(-1))^2.\]
Simplifying the left side gives
\[(x^2 + y^2)(4 + 1) \geq (2x - y)^2,\]
\[(x^2 + y^2) * 5 \geq (2x - y)^2.\]

Now, let's look at the expression we want to minimize: $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$. We can rewrite this as
\[5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy = 5(x^2 + y^2) - 4(2x - y)^2 + 4(2x - y)^2 - 8xy.\]
Using the inequality we just derived, we can substitute $5(x^2 + y^2) \geq (2x - y)^2$:
\[5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy \geq (2x - y)^2 - 4(2x - y)^2 + 4(2x - y)^2 - 8xy = -3(2x - y)^2.\]

This means that $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is always greater than or equal to $-3(2x - y)^2$. Since $(2x - y)^2$ is always non-negative, $-3(2x - y)^2$ is always non-negative or zero. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is 0.

However, we also know from the given condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ that $x$ and $y$ cannot be arbitrary real numbers. So, we need to find the exact minimum value under this condition.

Let's go back to the given condition: $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. We can rewrite this as $|x-2y| = |2x-y| = 20$. Then we have two cases:
1. If $x - 2y \geq 0$ and $2x - y \geq 0$, then $x - 2y = 20$ and $2x - y = 20$. Solving this system of equations gives $x = 20$ and $y = 0$.
2. If $x - 2y < 0$ and $2x - y < 0$, then $x - 2y = -20$ and $2x - y = -20$. Solving this system of equations gives $x = 0$ and $y = 10$.

Now, let's substitute these values into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$:
For $x = 20$ and $y = 0$, we get $5(20^2) + 5(0^2) - 8(20)(0) = 2000$.
For $x = 0$ and $y = 10$, we get $5(0^2) + 5(10^2) - 8(0)(10) = 500$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ under the given condition is 500.
The answer is: $500$

**Solution:**


This problem is a bit tricky to solve directly, but we can simplify it by using the fact that $|x-2y| + |y-2x|$ is always equal to $0$. This is because $|x-2y| = |-(y-2x)|$, so the sum of the absolute values of two expressions is always equal to the absolute value of their sum. Therefore, $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |(x-2y) + (y-2x)| = |x-2y-y+2x| = |0| = 0$. However, this sum is given to be $40$, so there must be a mistake in our reasoning.

Let's go back and check our work. When we say $|x-2y| = |-(y-2x)|$, we are assuming that $x-2y$ and $y-2x$ have the same absolute value. This is not necessarily true. Instead, we should consider the cases where $x-2y$ and $y-2x$ have the same sign and the cases where they have opposite signs.

If $x-2y$ and $y-2x$ have the same sign, then $|x-2y| = |y-2x|$, and the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ becomes $2|x-2y| = 40$, so $|x-2y| = 20$. If $x-2y$ and $y-2x$ have opposite signs, then $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |x-2y - (y-2x)| = |x-2y-y+2x| = |0| = 0$, which contradicts the given condition. Therefore, we must have $|x-2y| = 20$ and $|y-2x| = 20$.

Now, let's substitute $y = 2x - 20$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
\begin{align*}
5x^2+5(2x-20)^2-8x(2x-20) &= 5x^2+5(4x^2-80x+400)-16x^2+160x \\
&= 5x^2+20x^2-400x+2000-16x^2+160x \\
&= 9x^2-240x+2000.
\end{align*}To find the minimum value of this expression, we can take the derivative with respect to $x$ and set it equal to zero:
\[18x-240 = 0 \implies x = \frac{240}{18} = \frac{40}{3}.\]Substituting this value of $x$ back into the equation $y = 2x - 20$, we get
\[y = 2\left(\frac{40}{3}\right) - 20 = \frac{80}{3} - 20 = \frac{20}{3}.\]Now, we can substitute these values of $x$ and $y$ back into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
\[5\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2+5\left(\frac{20}{3}\right)^2-8\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)\left(\frac{20}{3}\right) = \frac{8000}{9}.\]Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\frac{8000}{9}$.

However, we made a mistake in our reasoning earlier. The equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is actually true, not false, when we substitute $y = 2x - 20$. This is because $|x-2(2x-20)| + |2x-20-2x| = |x-4x+40| + |-20| = |-3x+40| + 20 = 3x-40+20 = 3x-20$. Setting this equal to $40$, we get $3x-20 = 40$, so $3x = 60$, and $x = 20$. Substituting this value of $x$ back into the equation $y = 2x - 20$, we get $y = 2(20) - 20 = 20$. Now, we can substitute these values of $x$ and $y$ back into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
\[5(20)^2+5(20)^2-8(20)(20) = 2000.\]Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $2000$.

However, this is not the correct answer. The mistake in our reasoning is that we assumed that $|x-2y| = |y-2x|$ when $x-2y$ and $y-2x$ have the same sign. This is not necessarily true. Instead, we should consider the cases where $x-2y$ and $y-2x$ have the same sign and the cases where they have opposite signs.

If $x-2y$ and $y-2x$ have the same sign, then $|x-2y| = |y-2x|$, and the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ becomes $2|x-2y| = 40$, so $|x-2y| = 20$. If $x-2y$ and $y-2x$ have opposite signs, then $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |x-2y - (y-2x)| = |x-2y-y+2x| = |0| = 0$, which contradicts the given condition. Therefore, we must have $|x-2y| = 20$ and $|y-2x| = 20$.

Now, let's substitute $y = 2x - 20$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
\begin{align*}
5x^2+5(2x-20)^2-8x(2x-20) &= 5x^2+5(4x^2-80x+400)-16x^2+160x \\
&= 5x^2+20x^2-400x+2000-16x^2+160x \\
&= 9x^2-240x+2000.
\end{align*}To find the minimum value of this expression, we can take the derivative with respect to $x$ and set it equal to zero:
\[18x-240 = 0 \implies x = \frac{240}{18} = \frac{40}{3}.\]Substituting this value of $x$ back into the equation $y = 2x - 20$, we get
\[y = 2\left(\frac{40}{3}\right) - 20 = \frac{80}{3} - 20 = \frac{20}{3}.\]Now, we can substitute these values of $x$ and $y$ back into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
\[5\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2+5\left(\frac{20}{3}\right)^2-8\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)\left(\frac{20}{3}\right) = \frac{8000

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 This problem involves the use of calculus and optimization techniques. The first step is to express the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ in a more convenient form. We can rewrite it as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$, which simplifies to $|x-2y| + |-1*(x-2y)| = 40$. This further simplifies to $|x-2y| + |x-2y| = 40$, or $2|x-2y| = 40$, and finally $|x-2y| = 20$.

Now, let's define a new variable $z = x - 2y$. Then, we have $|z| = 20$. This implies that $z = 20$ or $z = -20$. So, we have two cases to consider:

1. $x - 2y = 20$.
2. $x - 2y = -20$.

For each case, we can express $y$ in terms of $x$:

1. $y = \frac{x - 20}{2}$.
2. $y = \frac{x + 20}{2}$.

Now, we substitute these expressions for $y$ into the expression for $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:

1. $5x^2 + 5\left(\frac{x - 20}{2}\right)^2 - 8x\left(\frac{x - 20}{2}\right) = 5x^2 + \frac{5(x^2 - 40x + 400)}{4} - 4x^2 + 40x = \frac{5x^2}{4} - 10x^2 + 100x + 500 = \frac{5x^2 - 40x^2 + 400x + 2000}{4} = \frac{-35x^2 + 400x + 2000}{4}$.
2. $5x^2 + 5\left(\frac{x + 20}{2}\right)^2 - 8x\left(\frac{x + 20}{2}\right) = 5x^2 + \frac{5(x^2 + 40x + 400)}{4} - 4x^2 - 40x = \frac{5x^2}{4} + 10x^2 + 100x + 500 = \frac{5x^2 + 40x^2 + 400x + 2000}{4} = \frac{45x^2 + 400x + 2000}{4}$.

Now, we need to find the minimum value of these expressions. To do this, we can take the derivative with respect to $x$ and set it equal to zero:

1. $\frac{d}{dx}\left(\frac{-35x^2 + 400x + 2000}{4}\right) = \frac{-70x + 400}{4} = 0 \implies x = \frac{400}{70} = \frac{40}{7}$.
2. $\frac{d}{dx}\left(\frac{45x^2 + 400x + 2000}{4}\right) = \frac{90x + 400}{4} = 0 \implies x = -\frac{400}{90} = -\frac{40}{9}$.

We substitute these values of $x$ back into the expressions for $y$:

1. For $x = \frac{40}{7}$, $y = \frac{\frac{40}{7} - 20}{2} = \frac{40 - 140}{14} = -\frac{100}{14} = -\frac{50}{7}$.
2. For $x = -\frac{40}{9}$, $y = \frac{-\frac{40}{9} + 20}{2} = \frac{-40 + 180}{18} = \frac{140}{18} = \frac{70}{9}$.

Now, we substitute these values of $x$ and $y$ back into the expression for $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:

1. For $x = \frac{40}{7}$ and $y = -\frac{50}{7}$, $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5\left(\frac{40}{7}\right)^2 + 5\left(-\frac{50}{7}\right)^2 - 8\left(\frac{40}{7}\right)\left(-\frac{50}{7}\right) = \frac{8000}{49} + \frac{12500}{49} + \frac{16000}{49} = \frac{36500}{49}$.
2. For $x = -\frac{40}{9}$ and $y = \frac{70}{9}$, $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5\left(-\frac{40}{9}\right)^2 + 5\left(\frac{70}{9}\right)^2 - 8\left(-\frac{40}{9}\right)\left(\frac{70}{9}\right) = \frac{8000}{81} + \frac{24500}{81} + \frac{22400}{81} = \frac{54900}{81}$.

Comparing the two values, we find that the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\frac{36500}{49}$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\boxed{\frac{36500}{49}}$.
The answer is: $\boxed{\frac{36500}{49}}$

## QUESTION 1 - 8 
- TIME_SPENT : 304 secs

8_
**Example**

**Problem:** 
"If $x + 2y= 4$ and $xy = -8$, what is the value of $x^2 + 4y^2$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
We see that $(x + 2y)^2 = (x^2 + 4y^2) + 4xy = 4^2 = 16$. We want to find $x^2 + 4y^2$ and are given $xy = -8$. So, $x^2 + 4y^2 + 4xy = x^2 + 4y^2 + 4(-8) = 16$. It follows that $x^2 + 4y^2 = \boxed{48}$. The answer is $\boxed{48}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solve, simplify

def minimum_value():
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # Define the function and the constraint
    f = 5*x**2 + 5*y**2 - 8*x*y
    constraint = abs(x - 2*y) + abs(y - 2*x) - 40

    # Solve the constraint for y
    y_solution = solve(constraint, y)[0]

    # Substitute y in the function
    f_substituted = f.subs(y, y_solution)

    # Find the derivative of the function
    f_derivative = f_substituted.diff(x)

    # Find the critical points
    critical_points = solve(f_derivative, x)

    # Evaluate the function at the critical points
    min_value = min([f_substituted.subs(x, point) for point in critical_points])

    return simplify(min_value)

result = minimum_value()
print(result)
```
