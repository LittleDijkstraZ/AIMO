Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, we need to understand that the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. This means that the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be equal to 2. So we have $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, which gives $m = 200$.

2. Now we need to check if this value of $m$ indeed gives 4 distinct solutions. Substituting $m = 200$ into the equation, we get $| |x - 1| - 2| = 2$.

3. Solving this equation, we get two cases: $|x - 1| - 2 = 2$ and $|x - 1| - 2 = -2$.

4. For the first case, $|x - 1| - 2 = 2$ gives $|x - 1| = 4$. This gives us two more equations: $x - 1 = 4$ and $x - 1 = -4$. Solving these, we get $x = 5$ and $x = -3$.

5. For the second case, $|x - 1| - 2 = -2$ gives $|x - 1| = 0$, which gives $x = 1$.

6. So, the four distinct solutions are $x = 5$, $x = -3$, $x = 1$.

Therefore, the positive integer $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 200. The answer is: $200$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let \[f(x) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
-x + 3 & \text{if } x \le 0, \\
2x - 5 & \text{if } x > 0.
\end{array}
\right.\]How many solutions does the equation $f(f(x)) = 4$ have?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
To solve the equation $f(f(x)) = 4,$ we first find the values $x$ such that $f(x) = 4.$

Either $f(x) = -x + 3$ (for $x \le 0$) or $f(x) = 2x - 5$ (for $x > 0$). If $-x + 3 = 4,$ then $x = -1.$ Note that this value satisfies $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = 4,$ then $x = 9/2.$ Note that this value satisfies $x > 0.$ Therefore, the solutions to $f(x) = 4$ are $x = -1$ and $x = 9/2.$

Next, we solve for the values $x$ such that $f(x) = -1.$ If $-x + 3 = -1,$ then $x = 4.$ This value does not satisfy $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = -1,$ then $x = 2.$ This value satisfies $x > 0.$

Finally, we solve for the values $x$ such that $f(x) = 9/2.$ If $-x + 3 = 9/2,$ then $x = -3/2.$ This value satisfies $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = 9/2,$ then $x = 19/4.$ This value satisfies $x > 0.$

Therefore, the equation $f(f(x)) = 4$ has the solutions $x = 2,$ $-3/2,$ and $19/4,$ for a total of $\boxed{3}$ solutions. The answer is $\boxed{3}$

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 1 and 2. This is because the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, oscillates between $-3$ and $1$ as $x$ varies over the real numbers, and the absolute value of this expression is equal to $\frac{m}{100}$. Therefore, we must have $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which implies $100 < m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are exactly the integers from $101$ to $199$, inclusive. The number of such integers is $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$. So the equation has 4 distinct solutions for exactly 99 different values of $m$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many integers are solutions to the equation $$(x-2)^{(25-x^2)}=1?$$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
We need some basic facts from number theory: $a^0 = 1$ for any $a,$ $1^b = 1$ for any $b,$ and $(-1)^c = 1$ if $c$ is an even integer. Unless the base is a complex number (which is excluded since we are looking for integer solutions), there are no other ways to get an RHS of $1.$ Thus, either the exponent is zero $($giving the equation $25 - x^2 = 0),$ the base is $1$ $($giving $x -2 = 1),$ or the base is $-1$ and the exponent is even $($giving the simultaneous equations $x - 2 = -1$ and $25 - x^2 = 2n$ for some integer $n).$ Solving the first equation gives $x = \pm 5,$ and solving the second gives $x = 3.$ The third equation implies that $x = 1,$ in which case $25 - x^2 = 24$ is indeed even, so $x = 1$ is a valid solution. In all, there are $\boxed{4}$ integer solutions. The answer is $\boxed{4}$

**Solution:**


The number of distinct solutions of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $4$ if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is in the interval $(0, 2)$. Therefore, the only possible value for $m$ is $m = 200$.

The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $2$. However, this result contradicts the problem statement. It seems that we misunderstood the problem.

Let's reconsider the problem and re-examine the equation. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is in the interval $(0, 2)$. This means that $m$ must be a multiple of $100$ and less than $200$. The multiples of $100$ less than $200$ are $100$ and $200$. However, $200$ is not a valid value for $m$ because it would make $\frac{m}{100}$ equal to $2$, not in the interval $(0, 2)$. Therefore, the only valid value for $m$ is $100$.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $1$.

Let's correct the code:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def num_solutions():
    """For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"""

    # This means that m must be a multiple of 100 and less than 200
    # The multiples of 100 less than 200 are 100 and 200
    # However, 200 is not a valid value for m because it would make m/100 equal to 2, not in the interval (0, 2)
    # Therefore, the only valid value for m is 100
    m_values = [100]

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many solutions does the equation \[\frac{(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)\dotsm(x-100)}{(x-1^2)(x-2^2)(x-3^2)\dotsm(x-100^2)} = 0\]have for $x$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Any solution to this equation must make the numerator of the left-hand side zero, while keeping the denominator non-zero. The numerator is zero when $x$ is one of the numbers $1, 2, 3, \dots, 100.$ However, for any value in this list that is a perfect square, the denominator will also be zero, so that value of $x$ will not be a root. Therefore, we want to find the number of integers in the list $1, 2, \dots, 100$ which are not perfect squares. The perfect squares in the list are $1^2, 2^2, \dots, 10^2,$ so there are $10$ perfect squares, and \[100 - 10 = \boxed{90}\]integers which are not perfect squares. The answer is $\boxed{90}$

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


To solve this problem, we need to understand the properties of the absolute value function and how it affects the number of solutions of the given equation.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 1 and 2. This is because the expression on the left side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, will take the value of either $ \vert x-1 \vert -2$, if $\vert x-1 \vert -2 \geq 0$, or $-( \vert x-1 \vert -2)$ if $\vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0$. These two expressions are equal to $ \vert x-1 \vert -2$ and $2 - \vert x-1 \vert$ respectively.

The function $ \vert x-1 \vert -2$ is equal to 0 when $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$, which gives us two solutions: $x = 3$ and $x = -1$. The function $2 - \vert x-1 \vert$ is equal to 0 when $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$, which also gives us two solutions: $x = 3$ and $x = -1$. Therefore, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=0$ has 4 distinct solutions.

For $\frac{m}{100}$ to be strictly between 1 and 2, $m$ must be strictly between 100 and 200. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is $100$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def number_of_m():
    """For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"""
    m_values = range(100, 201)
    return len(m_values)

result = number_of_m()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 101

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
101
```

The code above finds the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. However, the range of $m$ values should be strictly between 100 and 200, not inclusive of 200. So, we need to exclude the value 200 from the range.

Let's modify the code to exclude the value 200:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def number_of_m():
    """For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"""
    m_values = range(100, 200)
    return len(m_values)

result = number_of_m()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 100

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
100
```

Now the code correctly calculates the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 100. The value of $m$ is 100.
The answer is: $\boxed{100}$

**Problem:** 
"Let \[f(x) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
-x + 3 & \text{if } x \le 0, \\
2x - 5 & \text{if } x > 0.
\end{array}
\right.\]How many solutions does the equation $f(f(x)) = 4$ have?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
To solve the equation $f(f(x)) = 4,$ we first find the values $x$ such that $f(x) = 4.$

Either $f(x) = -x + 3$ (for $x \le 0$) or $f(x) = 2x - 5$ (for $x > 0$). If $-x + 3 = 4,$ then $x = -1.$ Note that this value satisfies $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = 4,$ then $x = 9/2.$ Note that this value satisfies $x > 0.$ Therefore, the solutions to $f(x) = 4$ are $x = -1$ and $x = 9/2.$

Next, we solve for the values $x$ such that $f(x) = -1.$ If $-x + 3 = -1,$ then $x = 4.$ This value does not satisfy $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = -1,$ then $x = 2.$ This value satisfies $x > 0.$

Finally, we solve for the values $x$ such that $f(x) = 9/2.$ If $-x + 3 = 9/2,$ then $x = -3/2.$ This value satisfies $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = 9/2,$ then $x = 19/4.$ This value satisfies $x > 0.$

Therefore, the equation $f(f(x)) = 4$ has the solutions $x = 2,$ $-3/2,$ and $19/4,$ for a total of $\boxed{3}$ solutions. The answer is $\boxed{3}$

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


This problem is a bit complex and requires a deep understanding of absolute value equations and their solutions. However, we can solve it using a systematic approach.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $2$. This is because the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, can be $2$ or $-2$.

To find the value of $m$, we can multiply both sides of the equation by $100$ to get rid of the fraction:
\[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert= \frac{m}{100} \implies \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert \cdot 100 = m.\]
Setting $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert \cdot 100 = m = 2 \cdot 100 = 200$, we can see that $m = 200$ is the value that makes the equation have $4$ distinct solutions.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $1$. The answer is: $1$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, let's denote $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. The equation $f(x) = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between two consecutive values of $f(x)$. 

2. To find the consecutive values of $f(x)$, we need to find the minimum and maximum values of $f(x)$.

3. The function $f(x)$ reaches its minimum value of 0 when $x = 3$, and its maximum value of 3 when $x = -1$. So, the equation $f(x) = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 3$.

4. Multiplying all sides of the inequalities by 100, we get $0 < m < 300$.

5. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are 1, 2, ..., 299, so there are 299 such integers.

However, we need to find the number of these integers that make the equation $f(x) = \frac{m}{100}$ have 4 distinct solutions.

6. We know that $f(x)$ is a piecewise function:

   - If $x \ge 3$, then $f(x) = (x - 1) - 2 = x - 3$.
   - If $1 < x < 3$, then $f(x) = (x - 1) - 2 = x - 3$.
   - If $-1 \le x \le 1$, then $f(x) = \vert (x - 1) - 2 \vert = \vert x - 1 \vert + 2 = 3 - x$.
   - If $x \le -1$, then $f(x) = \vert (x - 1) - 2 \vert = \vert x - 1 \vert + 2 = 3 - x$.

7. From the piecewise function, we can see that $f(x)$ is a decreasing function for $x \le -1$ and $x \ge 3$, and an increasing function for $-1 \le x \le 1$.

8. Therefore, $f(x)$ reaches its minimum value of 0 when $x = 3$, and its maximum value of 3 when $x = -1$. So, the equation $f(x) = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 3$.

9. Multiplying all sides of the inequalities by 100, we get $0 < m < 300$.

10. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are 1, 2, ..., 299, so there are 299 such integers.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that make the equation $f(x) = \frac{m}{100}$ have 4 distinct solutions is 299.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def count_m():
    # The number of positive integers m that make the equation

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many integers are solutions to the equation $$(x-2)^{(25-x^2)}=1?$$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
We need some basic facts from number theory: $a^0 = 1$ for any $a,$ $1^b = 1$ for any $b,$ and $(-1)^c = 1$ if $c$ is an even integer. Unless the base is a complex number (which is excluded since we are looking for integer solutions), there are no other ways to get an RHS of $1.$ Thus, either the exponent is zero $($giving the equation $25 - x^2 = 0),$ the base is $1$ $($giving $x -2 = 1),$ or the base is $-1$ and the exponent is even $($giving the simultaneous equations $x - 2 = -1$ and $25 - x^2 = 2n$ for some integer $n).$ Solving the first equation gives $x = \pm 5,$ and solving the second gives $x = 3.$ The third equation implies that $x = 1,$ in which case $25 - x^2 = 24$ is indeed even, so $x = 1$ is a valid solution. In all, there are $\boxed{4}$ integer solutions. The answer is $\boxed{4}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



To solve this problem, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly $4$ distinct solutions.

We can start by analyzing the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. This equation will have $4$ distinct solutions when the right-hand side $\frac{m}{100}$ falls into an interval where the absolute value function has $4$ distinct solutions.

The function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a piecewise function that "bounces" up and down between $0$ and $4$. It equals $0$ when $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$, which gives $x = 3$ or $x = -1$. It equals $4$ when $\vert x-1 \vert = 6$, which gives $x = 7$ or $x = -5$. So the function "bounces" up and down between $0$ and $4$ as $x$ goes from $-5$ to $7$.

Therefore, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have $4$ distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ falls into the interval $(0, 4]$. This means $0 < \frac{m}{100} \leq 4$, or equivalently, $0 < m \leq 400$.

So we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ in the interval $(0, 400]$. The number of such integers is $400$.

However, we must exclude the values of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has less than $4$ distinct solutions. This happens when $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $0$ or $4$. The value $\frac{m}{100} = 0$ corresponds to $m = 0$, which is not a positive integer. The value $\frac{m}{100} = 4$ corresponds to $m = 400$.

So we have $400 - 1 = 399$ positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly $4$ distinct solutions.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly $4$ distinct solutions is $399$.

However, this result is incorrect. The problem is that we have counted the value $m = 0$ as a valid value, but this does not correspond to a valid solution of the equation. We need to exclude $m = 0$ from our count.

So the correct number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly $4$ distinct solutions is $399 - 1 = 398$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly $4$ distinct solutions is $398$.

The answer is: $398$

## QUESTION 2 - 12

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many solutions does the equation \[\frac{(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)\dotsm(x-100)}{(x-1^2)(x-2^2)(x-3^2)\dotsm(x-100^2)} = 0\]have for $x$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Any solution to this equation must make the numerator of the left-hand side zero, while keeping the denominator non-zero. The numerator is zero when $x$ is one of the numbers $1, 2, 3, \dots, 100.$ However, for any value in this list that is a perfect square, the denominator will also be zero, so that value of $x$ will not be a root. Therefore, we want to find the number of integers in the list $1, 2, \dots, 100$ which are not perfect squares. The perfect squares in the list are $1^2, 2^2, \dots, 10^2,$ so there are $10$ perfect squares, and \[100 - 10 = \boxed{90}\]integers which are not perfect squares. The answer is $\boxed{90}$
