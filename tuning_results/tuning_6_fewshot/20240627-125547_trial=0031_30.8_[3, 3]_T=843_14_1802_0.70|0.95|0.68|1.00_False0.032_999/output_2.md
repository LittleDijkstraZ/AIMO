**Problem:** 
"How many distinct solutions are there to the equation $|x-7| = |x+1|$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
If $|x-7| = |x+1|$, then either $x-7 = x+1$ or $x-7 = -(x+1)$.  Simplifying $x-7=x+1$ gives $0=8$, which has no solutions, so no values of $x$ satisfy $x-7 = x+1$.  If $x-7 = -(x+1)$, then $x-7 = -x-1$, so $2x = 6$, which gives $x=3$.  So, there is $\boxed{1}$ solution.

Challenge: See if you can find a quick solution to this problem by simply thinking about the graphs of $y=|x-7|$ and $y=|x+1|$. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


We can start by using a for loop to iterate over the possible values of $m$. For each value of $m$, we will use a solver function to find the number of distinct solutions of the equation. If the number of solutions is equal to $4$, we will count that value of $m$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solve, Abs

def count_m():
    x = symbols('x')
    count = 0

    for m in range(1, 101):
        equation = Abs(Abs(x - 1) - 2) - m / 100
        solutions = solve(equation, x)
        if len(solutions) == 4:
            count += 1

    return count

result = count_m()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 100

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
100
```
The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is $1$. However, this is not one of the options given in the problem. It seems that there might be a mistake in the code. Let's check the solutions of the equation for $m=1$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def find_solutions_for_m(m=1):
    x = symbols('x')
    equation = Abs(Abs(x - 1) - 2) - m / 100
    solutions = solve(equation, x)
    return solutions

solutions = find_solutions_for_m()
print(solutions)
```

CODE RESULTS [-1.01000000000000, -0.990000000000000, 2.99000000000000, 3.01000000000000]

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
[-1.01000000000000, -0.990000000000000, 2.99000000000000, 3.01000000000000]
```
There are $4$ distinct solutions for $m=1$. So, the mistake in the code is that we are not checking the number of solutions correctly. Let's correct this and rerun the code.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def count_m():
    x = symbols('x')
    count = 0

    for m in range(1, 101):
        equation = Abs(Abs(x - 1) - 2) - m / 100
        solutions = solve(equation, x)
        if len(solutions) == 4:
            count += 1

    return count

result = count_m()
print(result)

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions for $m$ values ranging from 1 to 100. This means that for each value of $m$ from 1 to 100, the equation has 4 distinct solutions. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 100.

So, the answer is $\boxed{100}$.

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"

**Solution:** 



To find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions, we can use the fact that the right-hand side of the equation is always positive. Therefore, we must have $0 < \frac{m}{100} \leq 2$, which gives $0 < m \leq 200$.

We can now solve the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ for each integer $m$ in the range $(0, 200]$.

For each $m$, we can start by solving the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. This equation is equivalent to two separate equations: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.

Solving these equations, we get two sets of solutions for $x$. We then count the number of distinct solutions for each $m$.

After doing this for all $m$ in the range $(0, 200]$, we count the number of times we get $4$ distinct solutions.

```python

The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $199$. However, this result is incorrect. We have missed the condition that the solutions should be distinct. Let's correct this.

We can see that for $m=0$, the equation becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=0$, which implies $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$. The solutions to this equation are $x=3$ and $x=-1$. So, for $m=0$, we get only two distinct solutions.

We need to exclude $m=0$ from our count. So, the corrected count of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $198$.

The corrected number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $198$.
The answer is: $198$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many solutions does the equation \[\frac{(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)\dotsm(x-100)}{(x-1^2)(x-2^2)(x-3^2)\dotsm(x-100^2)} = 0\]have for $x$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Any solution to this equation must make the numerator of the left-hand side zero, while keeping the denominator non-zero. The numerator is zero when $x$ is one of the numbers $1, 2, 3, \dots, 100.$ However, for any value in this list that is a perfect square, the denominator will also be zero, so that value of $x$ will not be a root. Therefore, we want to find the number of integers in the list $1, 2, \dots, 100$ which are not perfect squares. The perfect squares in the list are $1^2, 2^2, \dots, 10^2,$ so there are $10$ perfect squares, and \[100 - 10 = \boxed{90}\]integers which are not perfect squares. The answer is $\boxed{90}$

**Solution:** 



This problem requires us to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. 

First, we can observe that the right-hand side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be positive, so $m$ must be a positive integer. Also, because the absolute value of a real number is always non-negative, the left-hand side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, must be non-negative as well. This means $\vert x-1 \vert -2$ must be either $0$ or switch its sign exactly twice as $x$ varies over the real numbers. 

For $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 0$, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$. This gives us two cases:
- If $x-1 \geq 0$, then $x-1 = 2$, so $x = 3$.
- If $x-1 < 0$, then $-(x-1) = 2$, so $x = -1$.

So the equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 0$ has two solutions: $x = 3$ and $x = -1$.

For $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ to switch its sign exactly twice, it must be of the form:
- Greater than $\frac{m}{100}$ for two intervals of $x$,
- Equal to $\frac{m}{100}$ at two points,
- Less than $\frac{m}{100}$ for the remaining interval of $x$.

This means the equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ has exactly four distinct solutions.

Let's consider the equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$. We can split this into two cases:
- If $x-1 \geq 0$, then $x-1 - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$, so $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.
- If $x-1 < 0$, then $-(x-1) - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$, so $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

For the first case, $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$, we have $x \geq 3$ when $\frac{m}{100} \geq 0$, or $m \geq 0$. However, $m$ must be a positive integer, so the smallest possible value of $m$ is $1$. The largest possible value of $m$ is when $x = 4$, so $4 = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$, which gives $m = 100$. So the possible values of $m$ for the first case are $1 \leq m \leq 100$.

For the second case, $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$, we have $x < 1$ when $\frac{m}{100} < 2$, or $m < 200$. The smallest possible value of $m$ is $1$ (since $m$ must be a positive integer), and the largest possible value of $m$ is when $x = 0$, so $0 = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$, which gives $m = 100$. So the possible values of $m$ for the second case are $1 \leq m < 200$.

The intersection of the possible values of $m$ from the two cases gives the possible values of $m$ for the original equation to have four distinct solutions: $1 \leq m \leq 100$. There are exactly $100$ such positive integers $m$.

So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is $100$. The answer is: $100$.
