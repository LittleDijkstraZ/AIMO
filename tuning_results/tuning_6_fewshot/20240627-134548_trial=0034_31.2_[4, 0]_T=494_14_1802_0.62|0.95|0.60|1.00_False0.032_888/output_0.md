**Problem:** 
"The graph of the quadratic $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ is a parabola that passes through the points $(-1,7)$, $(5,7)$, and $(6,10)$.  What is the $x$-coordinate of the vertex of the parabola?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
We could substitute the points into the equation $y = ax^2 + bx + c$, solve for $a$, $b$, and $c$, and then complete the square to find the coordinates of the vertex.

However, a much faster way is to recognize that two of the points, namely $(-1,7)$ and $(5,7)$, have the same $y$-coordinate.  Therefore, these two points are symmetric about the parabola's axis of symmetry.  The axis must pass through the midpoint of the segment connecting these two symmetric points, so the axis must pass through $\left(\frac{-1+5}{2},\frac{7+7}{2}\right)$, which is $(2,7)$.  Therefore, the axis of symmetry is a vertical line through $(2,7)$.  This line is the graph of the equation $x=2$.  The axis of symmetry also passes through the vertex of the parabola, so the $x$-coordinate of the vertex is $\boxed{2}$. The answer is $\boxed{2}$

**Solution:** 



First, let's find the $x$-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$. Since the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$, we can set $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$ and solve for $x$. 

```python

from sympy import symbols, solve, sqrt

def find_x_coordinates():
    x, k, l = symbols('x k l')

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
[(k - sqrt(k*(k - l + 4)))/k, (k + sqrt(k*(k - l + 4)))/k]
```
Let's denote the solutions as $x_1$ and $x_2$, where $x_1 = \frac{k - \sqrt{k(k - l + 4)}}{k}$ and $x_2 = \frac{k + \sqrt{k(k - l + 4)}}{k}$. According to the problem, the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, so $|x_2 - x_1| = 6$. We can write this as $\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2} = 6$, or $\sqrt{\left(\frac{2\sqrt{k(k - l + 4)}}{k}\right)^2} = 6$. Simplifying, we get $\frac{2\sqrt{k(k - l + 4)}}{k} = 6$, or $\sqrt{k(k - l + 4)} = 3k$. Squaring both sides, we get $k(k - l + 4) = 9k^2$, or $k - l + 4 = 9k$, or $l = 8k - 4$.

Now, we want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. For point $A$, this is $\sqrt{x_1^2 + (4 - l)^2}$, and for point $B$, it's $\sqrt{x_2^2 + (4 - l)^2}$. We want to find $x_1^2 + x_2^2 + (4 - l)^2 + (4 - l)^2$.

Substituting $l = 8k - 4$, we get $x_1^2 + x_2^2 + (4 - (8k - 4))^2 + (4 - (8k - 4))^2 = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + (8k)^2 = (x_2 - x_1)^2 + 2x_1x_2 + 64k^2$.

We already know that $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 36$, and $x_1x_2 = \frac{(k - \sqrt{k(k - l + 4)})(k + \sqrt{k(k - l + 4)})}{k^2} = 1$. So, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $36 + 2*1 + 64k^2 = 38 + 64k^2$.

Now, we need to find the value of $k$ that minimizes this expression. Taking the derivative of $64k^2 + 38$ with respect to $k$ and setting it equal to zero, we get $128k = 0$, which implies $k = 0$. However, this doesn't make sense in the context of the problem, as $k > 0$. So, we must have made a mistake somewhere.

Let's go back and check our work. We found that $l = 8k - 4$, and we substituted this into the equation $k(k - l + 4) = 9k^2$. Let's substitute $l = 8k - 4$ directly into the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$:

$kx^2 - 2kx + 8k - 4 = 4$, or $kx^2 - 2kx + 8k = 8$.

This is a quadratic equation in $x$, and its discriminant must be nonnegative for it to have real solutions. The discriminant is $(-2k)^2 - 4*k*8k = 4k^2 - 32k^2 = -28k^2$, which is negative for all $k > 0$. This means that our assumption that the parabola intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points is incorrect.

Let's go back and reconsider the problem. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points if and only if the discriminant of the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$ is nonnegative. The discriminant is $(-2k)^2 - 4*k*(l - 4) = 4k^2 - 4k(l - 4) = 4k^2 - 4kl + 16k$. Setting this to be nonnegative, we get $4k^2 - 4kl + 16k \geq 0$, or $k^2 - kl + 4k \geq 0$. Multiplying both sides by 4, we get $4k^2 - 4kl + 16k \geq 0$, or $4k(k - l + 4) \geq 0$. Since $k > 0$, this implies $k - l + 4 \geq 0$, or $l \leq 8k - 4$.

Now, we want to minimize the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin, which is $x_1^2 + x_2^2 + (4 - l)^2 + (4 - l)^2 = (x_2 - x_1)^2 + 2x_1x_2 + 8l^2 - 16l + 32$. We already know that $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 36$, and $x_1x_2 = 1$. So, we want to minimize $36 + 2*1 + 8l^2 - 16l + 32 = 8l^2 - 16l + 70$.

Taking the derivative of $8l^2 - 16l + 70$ with respect to $l$ and setting it equal to zero, we get $16l - 16 = 0$, or $l = 1$. Since $l \leq 8k - 4$, we must have $1 \leq 8k - 4$, or $k \geq \frac{1}{4}$. The minimum value of $k$ is achieved when $k = \frac{1}{4}$, and in this case, $l = 1$.

Substituting $k = \frac{1}{4}$ and $l = 1$ into the sum of the squares of the distances, we get $36 + 2*1 + 8*1^2 - 16*1 + 32 = 36 + 2 + 8 - 16 + 32 = 48$.

Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is 48. The answer is $\boxed{48}$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"The graph of $y=ax^2 + bx + c$ is a parabola with vertical axis of symmetry.  The vertex of this parabola is $(2,3)$ and the parabola contains the point $(4,4)$.  Find the value of $y$ when $x=6$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Because the parabola has vertex $(2,3)$, it is the graph of  \[y=a(x-2)^2+3\] for some number $a$.  In order for the graph to contain the point $(4,4)$, we must also have  \[4=a(4-2)^2+3=4a+3,\] so $a=\frac14$, and our parabola is the graph of \[y=\frac14(x-2)^2 + 3.\] Setting $x=6$ in this gives us  \[y = \frac14(6-2)^2 + 3 = 4+3=\boxed{7}.\] The answer is $\boxed{7}$

**Problem**
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"

**Solution:** 



To solve this problem, we first need to find the x-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$. Since the parabola intersects the line $y = 4$, we can set $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$ and solve for x. Then, we know that the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, so we can use the formula $|x_2 - x_1| = 6$.

Next, we want to find the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin, which are $\sqrt{x_1^2 + 4}$ and $\sqrt{x_2^2 + 4}$, respectively. We want to find the sum of the squares of these distances, which is $(x_1^2 + 4) + (x_2^2 + 4)$.

We can use sympy to solve the equations and compute the result.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve, sqrt

def sum_of_squares_of_distances():
    x, k, l = symbols('x k l')

    # Equation of the parabola
    parabola = k*x**2 - 2*k*x + l - 4

    # Solve for x
    solutions = solve(parabola, x)
    x1, x2 = solutions

    # Distance from A and B to the origin
    distance_A = sqrt(x1**2 + 4)
    distance_B = sqrt(x2**2 + 4)

    # Sum of squares of distances
    sum_of_squares = (x1**2 + 4) + (x2**2 + 4)

    # Substitute the value of k and l into the equation
    sum_of_squares = sum_of_squares.subs({k: 1, l: 0})

    return sum_of_squares

result = sum_of_squares_of_distances()
print(result)
```
