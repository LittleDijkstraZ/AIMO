**Problem:** 
"How many solutions does the equation \[\frac{(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)\dotsm(x-100)}{(x-1^2)(x-2^2)(x-3^2)\dotsm(x-100^2)} = 0\]have for $x$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Any solution to this equation must make the numerator of the left-hand side zero, while keeping the denominator non-zero. The numerator is zero when $x$ is one of the numbers $1, 2, 3, \dots, 100.$ However, for any value in this list that is a perfect square, the denominator will also be zero, so that value of $x$ will not be a root. Therefore, we want to find the number of integers in the list $1, 2, \dots, 100$ which are not perfect squares. The perfect squares in the list are $1^2, 2^2, \dots, 10^2,$ so there are $10$ perfect squares, and \[100 - 10 = \boxed{90}\]integers which are not perfect squares. The answer is $\boxed{90}$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many distinct solutions are there to the equation $|x-7| = |x+1|$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
If $|x-7| = |x+1|$, then either $x-7 = x+1$ or $x-7 = -(x+1)$.  Simplifying $x-7=x+1$ gives $0=8$, which has no solutions, so no values of $x$ satisfy $x-7 = x+1$.  If $x-7 = -(x+1)$, then $x-7 = -x-1$, so $2x = 6$, which gives $x=3$.  So, there is $\boxed{1}$ solution.

Challenge: See if you can find a quick solution to this problem by simply thinking about the graphs of $y=|x-7|$ and $y=|x+1|$. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The number of solutions depends on the value of $m$.
For $m=200$, the equation becomes $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{200}{100}=2$. This equation has four distinct solutions.
For other values of $m$, the equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ will have either zero or two solutions.
Therefore, the only value of $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is $m=200$.
The answer is: $200$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let \[f(x) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
-x + 3 & \text{if } x \le 0, \\
2x - 5 & \text{if } x > 0.
\end{array}
\right.\]How many solutions does the equation $f(f(x)) = 4$ have?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
To solve the equation $f(f(x)) = 4,$ we first find the values $x$ such that $f(x) = 4.$

Either $f(x) = -x + 3$ (for $x \le 0$) or $f(x) = 2x - 5$ (for $x > 0$). If $-x + 3 = 4,$ then $x = -1.$ Note that this value satisfies $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = 4,$ then $x = 9/2.$ Note that this value satisfies $x > 0.$ Therefore, the solutions to $f(x) = 4$ are $x = -1$ and $x = 9/2.$

Next, we solve for the values $x$ such that $f(x) = -1.$ If $-x + 3 = -1,$ then $x = 4.$ This value does not satisfy $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = -1,$ then $x = 2.$ This value satisfies $x > 0.$

Finally, we solve for the values $x$ such that $f(x) = 9/2.$ If $-x + 3 = 9/2,$ then $x = -3/2.$ This value satisfies $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = 9/2,$ then $x = 19/4.$ This value satisfies $x > 0.$

Therefore, the equation $f(f(x)) = 4$ has the solutions $x = 2,$ $-3/2,$ and $19/4,$ for a total of $\boxed{3}$ solutions. The answer is $\boxed{3}$

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


This problem is a bit complex and requires a deep understanding of absolute value equations and their solutions.

However, we know that the equation $||x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly less than $2$ but strictly greater than $0$. This is because the expression on the left can vary between $0$ and $4$ for different values of $x$, and it takes on all values in between.

So we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. This translates to $0 < m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ in this range are $1, 2, ..., 199$. So the number of such $m$ is $199$.

So the answer is $199$. The answer is: $\boxed{199}$

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, we need to understand the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. This equation has 4 distinct solutions, which means that the right-hand side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, should be in the interval $(0, 2]$. The reason is that the absolute value of the left-hand side of the equation will be less than or equal to 2, so $\frac{m}{100}$ must be in the interval $(0, 2]$ to allow 4 distinct solutions.

Next, we want to find out how many positive integer values of $m$ will satisfy this condition. We can rewrite the inequality as $0 < \frac{m}{100} \leq 2$. Multiplying all sides by 100 gives $0 < m \leq 200$. So we need to find out how many positive integers fall into this range.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def count_positive_integers():
    m_values = list(range(1, 201))
    count = 0
    for m in m_values:
        if m > 0 and m <= 200:
            count += 1
    return count

result = count_positive_integers()

Therefore, the equation $f(f(x)) = 4$ has the solutions $x = 2,$ $-3/2,$ and $19/4,$ for a total of $\boxed{3}$ solutions. The answer is $\boxed{3}$

**Solution:** 



We can solve this problem by first analyzing the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. The right side $\frac{m}{100}$ is always positive, so the number of distinct solutions will be 4 only when $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. This is because the left side $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ can take on exactly 4 distinct values: 0, 1, 2, 3. If $\frac{m}{100} > 2$, then there will be more than 4 distinct solutions. If $\frac{m}{100} < 2$, then there will be fewer than 4 distinct solutions. So, we need to find the value of $m$ for which $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. Multiplying both sides by 100 gives $m = 200$. Therefore, the only value of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 200. The number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy this condition is 1. The answer is $\boxed{1}$.

First, we need to understand the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. This equation will have 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is in the range of $1$ to $2$. So $1 \leq \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which simplifies to $100 \leq m < 200$.

Now, we need to find the number of integers in this range. We can simply subtract the smallest integer in the range from the largest integer in the range and add 1. So the number of integers is $200 - 100 + 1 = 101$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 101.

The final answer is: 101.
