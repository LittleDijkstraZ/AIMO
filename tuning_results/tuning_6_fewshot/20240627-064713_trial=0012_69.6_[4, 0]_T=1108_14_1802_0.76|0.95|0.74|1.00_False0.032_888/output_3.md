Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Let $w$ be the width of each of the identical rectangles. Since $PQ=3w$, $RS=2x$ and $PQ=RS$ (because $PQRS$ is a rectangle), then $2x = 3w$, or $$w=\frac{2}{3}x.$$ Therefore, the area of each of the five identical rectangles is $$x\left(\frac{2}{3}x\right)=\frac{2}{3}x^2.$$ Since the area of $PQRS$ is 4000 and it is made up of five of these identical smaller rectangles, then $$5\left(\frac{2}{3}x^2\right)=4000$$ or $$\frac{10}{3}x^2 = 4000$$ or $x^2 = 1200$ or $x \approx 34.6$ which, when rounded off to the nearest integer, is $\boxed{35}.$ The answer is $\boxed{35}$

**Solution:** 



First, we need to understand the problem and the conditions given. The expression $f(x)g(x) = 0$ is satisfied if and only if $f(x) = 0$ or $g(x) = 0$. Thus, the given equation is equivalent to the system of equations:

1. $(|x+y| - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(|x-y| - 10)^2 = 0$
3. $(|x| - 8)^2 = 0$
4. $(|y| - 8)^2 = 0$

Each of these equations is satisfied if and only if the absolute value of the corresponding expression is zero, i.e., if and only if the corresponding expression is zero. Thus, the system of equations is equivalent to the system of equations:

1. $x+y = 0$
2. $x-y = 0$
3. $x = 8$
4. $y = 8$

The first two equations imply $x=y=0$, and the last two equations imply $x=8$ and $y=8$. Therefore, the solution to the system of equations is $(x, y) = (8, 8)$. This point satisfies all the given conditions, so the convex polygon is a single point, and its area is 0.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 0.
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    # The polygon is a single point, so its area is 0
    area = 0
    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 0

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
0
```
The area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{0}$.

Note: The problem statement seems to have a mistake, as the conditions given do not result in a non-zero area polygon. The conditions imply that the only point that satisfies all of them is $(8,8)$, which is a single point. The given conditions do not form a polygon with a non-zero area. It is possible that the problem was intended to ask for the area of the region enclosed by the curves $|x+y| = 10$, $|x-y| = 10$, $|x| = 8$, and $|y| = 8$, but even then the area would be 0, as the region enclosed by these curves is a single point.

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


The problem asks for the area of a convex polygon formed by the points that satisfy the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. 

The equation is equal to zero if either of the factors is zero. This gives us two sets of conditions:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first set of conditions, we have:

- $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
- $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
- $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

For the second set of conditions, we have:

- $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
- $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
- $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

By solving these conditions, we find that the points that satisfy the equation are:

- $(8, 2)$, $(8, -10)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, -10)$, $(2, 8)$, $(-10, 8)$, $(2, -8)$, and $(-10, -8)$.

These points form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_ 2= (-16,2).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that
\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as
\[\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1.\]Find $h + k + a + b.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

**Solution:** 


The problem statement asks for the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points that satisfy the given equation. 

The equation is: $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$

This equation is true if and only if either:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 \neq 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 \neq 0$
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 \neq 0$
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 \neq 0$

For cases 1 and 2, the only solutions are the points where $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$.
For cases 3 and 4, the only solutions are the points where $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

These points form a square with side length 20. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $20^2 = 400$.

The answer is: $400$

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, we need to understand the given equation: $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$

The product of two terms equals zero if and only if at least one of the terms is zero. Thus, we have two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8$

Similarly, we have two more cases for $y$:

3. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x - y \vert = 10$
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert y \vert = 8$

Now, let's analyze these cases:

1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10 \Rightarrow x + y = \pm 10$
2. $\vert x \vert = 8 \Rightarrow x = \pm 8$
3. $\vert x - y \vert = 10 \Rightarrow x - y = \pm 10$
4. $\vert y \vert = 8 \Rightarrow y = \pm 8$

The combinations of these equations give us a total of 4 vertices for the polygon: $(8, 0), (-8, 0), (0, 8), (0, -8)$.

Finally, we can calculate the area of the polygon. The polygon is a square with side length 8, so its area is $8^2 = 64$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 64. The answer is: $64$

Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. So we need to solve two systems of equations:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.

For the first system, we have:

1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ implies $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
2. $\vert x \vert = 8$ implies $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
3. $\vert y \vert = 8$ implies $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

For the second system, we have:

1. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ implies $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.

Now we can find the intersections of these lines to get the vertices of the polygon. There are 8 vertices: $(8, 2), (8, -2), (-8, 2), (-8, -2), (2, 8), (-2, 8), (2, -8), (-2, -8)$.

The polygon is a square with side length 16. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


The equation given is $0 = 0$, which is always true. This means that all points $(x, y)$ in the plane satisfy this equation. Therefore, the set of points satisfying this equation is the entire plane, and the "polygon" it encloses is actually the entire plane. However, the problem asks for the area of a convex polygon. The plane is not a polygon, but it can be thought of as a degenerate polygon with infinite sides. The area of such a polygon is not well-defined.

Therefore, the problem seems to have a misunderstanding of what a polygon is and what a convex polygon is. The set of points satisfying the given equation is the entire plane, not a polygon. 

However, if we interpret the problem as finding the area of the largest convex polygon that can be inscribed in a 16x16 square (since the distance from the origin to the nearest 8 along either the x or y axis is 8, and the absolute values of the x and y coordinates in the given equation ensure that the polygon is confined within a 16x16 square), then we can proceed with the calculation.

The largest convex polygon that can be inscribed in a 16x16 square is the square itself, so the area of the polygon is $16^2 = 256$.

So, if we take the problem as finding the area of the largest convex polygon that can be inscribed in a 16x16 square, the answer is 256.
The answer is $\boxed{256}$.

Since $PQ=3w$, $RS=2x$ and $PQ=RS$ (because $PQRS$ is a rectangle), then $2x = 3w$, or $$w=\frac{2}{3}x.$$ Therefore, the area of each of the five identical rectangles is $$x\left(\frac{2}{3}x\right)=\frac{2}{3}x^2.$$ Since the area of $PQRS$ is 4000 and it is made up of five of these identical smaller rectangles, then $$5\left(\frac{2}{3}x^2\right)=4000$$ or $$\frac{10}{3}x^2 = 4000$$ or $x^2 = 1200$ or $x \approx 34.6$ which, when rounded off to the nearest integer, is $\boxed{35}.$ The answer is $\boxed{35}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


The area of the polygon is 0, since the only points that satisfy the given equation are the point (8,8), which makes both the numerator and denominator of the fraction to be zero. Thus the area of the polygon is 0. 
The answer is $\boxed{0}$.

## QUESTION 3 - 10

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_ 2= (-16,2).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that
\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as
\[\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1.\]Find $h + k + a + b.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Rational, Abs, simplify

def calculate_area():
    # Define the variables
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # Define the equations
    equation1 = ((Abs(x + y) - 10)**2 + (Abs(x - y) - 10)**2)
    equation2 = ((Abs(x) - 8)**2 + (Abs(y) - 8)**2)

    # The points that satisfy the equation are the solutions of either equation1 = 0 or equation2 = 0
    # The solutions of equation1 = 0 are the points where |x + y| = 10 and |x - y| = 10
    # The solutions of equation2 = 0 are the points where |x| = 8 and |y| = 8
    # These points form a square with side length 16 (since |x| = 8 implies -8 <= x <= 8)
    # The area of the square is 16*16 = 256

    area = 256

    return area

result = calculate_area()
