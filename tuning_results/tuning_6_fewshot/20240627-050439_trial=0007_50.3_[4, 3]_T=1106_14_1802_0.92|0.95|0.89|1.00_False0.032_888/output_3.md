**Problem:** 
"Let $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_ 2= (-16,2).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that
\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as
\[\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1.\]Find $h + k + a + b.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


The problem is asking for the area of a polygon enclosed by the points that satisfy the given equation. The equation is a product of two terms, and it equals to zero. Therefore, either the first term equals to zero or the second term equals to zero. We will solve each term separately.

First term: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
This term equals to zero when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This represents a square with side length 20 and its center at the origin.

Second term: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
This term equals to zero when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This represents a square with side length 16 and its center at the origin.

The intersection of these two squares is the polygon we are looking for. The area of the polygon is the area of the smaller square, which is $16^2 = 256$. So the area of the polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we can start by understanding the properties of absolute value and the multiplication of two expressions. If the product of two expressions is zero, then at least one of the expressions must be zero. This gives us two separate cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm10$ and $x - y = \pm10$. Solving these four equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(8,2)$, $(8,-2)$, $(-8,2)$, and $(-8,-2)$.

From the second case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that $x = \pm8$ and $y = \pm8$. Solving these four equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

The points from both cases form a square with side length $16$. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So, the area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$.

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we first need to understand the conditions given in the equation. The equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. Therefore, either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. Let's examine each expression separately:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$: 
This expression is zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
From these two equations, we can deduce that $x = 0$ and $y = 0$. 

2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$: 
This expression is zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
From these two equations, we can deduce that $-8 \leq x \leq 8$ and $-8 \leq y \leq 8$.

Therefore, the points $\left(x, y\right)$ that satisfy the original equation are all points inside the rectangle formed by the points $(-8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(8, 8)$, and $(8, -8)$. The dimensions of this rectangle are $16 \times 16$, so its area is $256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon formed by the points that satisfy the equation is $256$. The answer is: $\boxed{256}$
