**Problem:** 
"How many square units are in the area of the triangle whose vertices are the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the curve $y = (x-3)^2 (x+2)$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we need to find where this curve intersects the $x$ and $y$ axes.  If $y=0$, then $(x-3)^2(x+2)=0$, which has solutions of $x=3$ and $x=-2$.  If $x=0$, then $y=(-3)^2(2)=18$.  So, the curve has two $x$-intercepts and one $y$-intercept.  The length of the base along the $x$-axis is $3-(-2)=5$.  The height from this base is equal to the $y$-intercept, 18.  The area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 5\cdot 18=\boxed{45}$. The answer is $\boxed{45}$

**Problem:** 
"Let $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_ 2= (-16,2).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that
\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as
\[\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1.\]Find $h + k + a + b.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

**Solution:** 



This problem requires understanding of absolute value function and properties of square root. The equation involves absolute value function, so we need to consider different cases for the absolute value expressions. The equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.

1. Solve the equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ for $x$ and $y$.
2. Solve the equation $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ for $x$ and $y$.
3. Solve the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ for $x$.
4. Solve the equation $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ for $y$.
5. The solutions from steps 1 to 4 form the vertices of the polygon.
6. Calculate the area of the polygon formed by these vertices.

Now, let's solve each step:

1. From $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which gives us two cases: $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.
2. From $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which gives us two cases: $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.
3. From $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$, which gives us two cases: $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.
4. From $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us two cases: $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.
5. By combining the cases from steps 1 to 4, we can find the vertices of the polygon.
6. To calculate the area of the polygon, we can use the formula for the area of a polygon given its vertices.

After calculating the area, we find that the area of the polygon is 128 square units. The answer is: $128$

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we can use the properties of absolute values and the concept of a polygon.
The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.
Let's consider the first expression: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
The sum of two squares is zero if and only if both squares are zero. So we have:
$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
The absolute value equations can be split into two cases:
1. $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$. Solving this system of equations gives $x = 10$ and $y = 0$.
2. $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$. Solving this system of equations gives $x = -10$ and $y = 0$.
These two points, $(10, 0)$ and $(-10, 0)$, are the vertices of the polygon.
Similarly, for the second expression $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives the vertices $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.
The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying the given equation are the vertices of a square with side length $20$.
The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 400. The answer is: $400$

**Problem:** 
"Five identical rectangles are arranged to form a larger rectangle $PQRS$, as shown.  The area of $PQRS$ is $4000$.  What is the length, $x$, rounded off to the nearest integer? [asy]
real x = 1; real w = 2/3;

// Draw outer square and labels

// Draw other segments

draw((0, w)--(2 * x, w));
draw((w, x + w)--(w, w)); draw((2 * w, x + w)--(2 * w, w));

// length labels
pair upper = (-0.1, x + w);
pair lower = (-0.1, w);
draw(lower--upper);
draw((-0.1 - 0.03, x + w)--(-0.1 + 0.03, x + w));
draw((-0.1 - 0.03, w)--(-0.1 + 0.03, w));
label("$x$", midpoint((-0.1, w)--(-0.1, x + w)), W);

pair left = (0, -0.1); pair right = (x, -0.1);
draw((0, -0.1 + 0.03)--(0, -0.1 - 0.03));
draw((x, -0.1 - 0.03)--(x, -0.1 + 0.03));
draw(left--right);
label("$x$", (x/2, -0.1), S);

[/asy]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Let $w$ be the width of each of the identical rectangles. Since $PQ=3w$, $RS=2x$ and $PQ=RS$ (because $PQRS$ is a rectangle), then $2x = 3w$, or $$w=\frac{2}{3}x.$$ Therefore, the area of each of the five identical rectangles is $$x\left(\frac{2}{3}x\right)=\frac{2}{3}x^2.$$ Since the area of $PQRS$ is 4000 and it is made up of five of these identical smaller rectangles, then $$5\left(\frac{2}{3}x^2\right)=4000$$ or $$\frac{10}{3}x^2 = 4000$$ or $x^2 = 1200$ or $x \approx 34.6$ which, when rounded off to the nearest integer, is $\boxed{35}.$ The answer is $\boxed{35}$

**Solution:** 


First, we notice that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to the system of equations:

$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0,$$
$$((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$

From the first equation, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving this system of equations, we find that the solutions are $(x, y) = (5, 5), (5, -5), (-5, 5), (-5, -5)$.

From the second equation, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving this system of equations, we find that the solutions are $(x, y) = (8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$.

The points $(5, 5), (5, -5), (-5, 5), (-5, -5), (8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$ form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $A \cdot B = 0$ is true if and only if $A=0$ or $B=0$. Thus, the given equation is satisfied if either $A = (|x+y| - 10)^2 + (|x-y| - 10)^2 = 0$ or $B = (|x| - 8)^2 + (|y| - 8)^2 = 0$.

For $A = 0$, we have $|x+y| = 10$ and $|x-y| = 10$. This implies that $x+y = \pm 10$ and $x-y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the four lines $y = x \pm 10$ and $y = -(x \pm 10)$.

For $B = 0$, we have $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So we get the four lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

The intersection points of these lines are the vertices of the polygon. By plotting these lines, we can see that the polygon is a square with side length 20. Thus, the area of the polygon is $20^2 = 400$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 400. The answer is: $400$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Find the number of 10-tuples $(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{10})$ of real numbers such that
\[(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2 = \frac{1}{11}.\]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,
\begin{align*}
&[(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + \dots + 1^2 + 1^2)][(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2] \\
&\ge [(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + (x_2 - x_3) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10}]^2 = 1.
\end{align*}From the given condition, we have equality, so by the equality condition for Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[\frac{1 - x_1}{1} = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{1} = \frac{x_2 - x_3}{1} = \dots = \frac{x_9 - x_{10}}{1} = \frac{x_{10}}{1}.\]Let
\[d = 1 - x_1 = x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_3 = \dots = x_9 - x_{10} = x_{10}.\]Then
\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so
\[(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_{10}) = \left( \frac{10}{11}, \frac{9}{11}, \frac{8}{11}, \dots, \frac{1}{11} \right).\]In particular, there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Solution:** 



We can start by noting that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. This means we can set each factor equal to zero and solve for the possible values of $x$ and $y$. 

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \implies \vert x + y \vert = 10 \implies x + y = \pm 10$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \implies \vert x - y \vert = 10 \implies x - y = \pm 10$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \implies \vert x \vert = 8 \implies x = \pm 8$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \implies \vert y \vert = 8 \implies y = \pm 8$.

From these equations, we can see that the possible values of $x$ and $y$ are:

- $x = 8, y = 2$ or $x = 8, y = -2$ or $x = -8, y = 2$ or $x = -8, y = -2$.
- $x = 10, y = 0$ or $x = -10, y = 0$.

Plotting these points on a coordinate plane, we find that they form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$.

**Solution:** 



The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. Let's consider each term separately.

For the first term, we have $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle.

For the second term, we have $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines also form a rectangle.

The intersection of the two rectangles is a square with side length 10 (the minimum of the lengths 10 and 8). Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $10^2 = 100$.

The answer is: $100$

The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. Hence, either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. 

The first expression is zero when $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. This simplifies to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these equations form a square with side length $20$.

The second expression is zero when $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which simplifies to $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us a square with side length $16$.

Therefore, the points that satisfy the given equation are those that lie either inside the square with side length $20$ or inside the square with side length $16$. The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon that encloses the points that satisfy the given equation.

The area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares minus the area of their intersection. The area of a square with side length $a$ is $a^2$.

The area of the square with side length $20$ is $20^2 = 400$. The area of the square with side length $16$ is $16^2 = 256$.

The intersection of the two squares is another square, this one with side length $8$ (the difference in the side lengths of the original two squares divided by $2$), so its area is $8^2 = 64$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $400 + 256 - 64 = 592$.
The answer is: $592$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many square units are in the area of the triangle whose vertices are the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the curve $y = (x-3)^2 (x+2)$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we need to find where this curve intersects the $x$ and $y$ axes.  If $y=0$, then $(x-3)^2(x+2)=0$, which has solutions of $x=3$ and $x=-2$.  If $x=0$, then $y=(-3)^2(2)=18$.  So, the curve has two $x$-intercepts and one $y$-intercept.  The length of the base along the $x$-axis is $3-(-2)=5$.  The height from this base is equal to the $y$-intercept, 18.  The area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 5\cdot 18=\boxed{45}$. The answer is $\boxed{45}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



1. First, we need to understand that the equation is equal to zero, which means that either the first term or the second term must be zero. This gives us two cases to consider.
2. For the first term to be zero, we have $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x - y| - 10 = 0$. This simplifies to $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$. The solutions to these equations form a square with side length 20.
3. For the second term to be zero, we have $|x| - 8 = 0$ and $|y| - 8 = 0$. This simplifies to $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. The solutions to these equations form a square with side length 16.
4. The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for. The area of this polygon is the area of the larger square minus the area of the smaller square.
5. The area of the larger square is $20^2 = 400$, and the area of the smaller square is $16^2 = 256$.
6. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $400 - 256 = 144$.

```
The error in the code above is due to the fact that Sympy's `solve` function is not designed to handle absolute value equations directly. Instead, we can solve the absolute value equations by considering the different cases for the absolute value expressions.

Let's modify the code to handle the absolute value equations:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    # Solve for the intersection of the two squares
    x, y = symbols('x y')
    # Case 1: |x + y| = 10
    solutions1 = solve([abs(x + y) - 10, abs(x) - 8, abs(y) - 8], (x, y))
    # Case 2: |x - y| = 10
    solutions2 = solve([abs(x - y) - 10, abs(x) - 8, abs(y) - 8], (x, y))

    # Combine the solutions from both cases
    solutions = solutions1 + solutions2

    # Calculate the area of the convex polygon
    area = 0
    for solution in solutions:
        # The area of a square is side_length^2
        area += 20**2 - 16**2

    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 0

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
0
```
The output of 0 is incorrect. This is likely due to the fact that the `solve` function is not handling the absolute value equations correctly. Let's modify the code to handle the absolute value equations manually:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    # Solve for the intersection of the two squares
    x, y = symbols('x y')
    # Case 1: |x + y| = 10
    solutions1 = [(x, -x - 10) for x in range(-10, 11)] + [(x, -x + 10) for x in range(-10, 11)]
    # Case 2: |x - y| = 10
    solutions2 = [(x, x - 10) for x in range(10, -11, -1)] + [(x, x + 10) for x in range(10, -11, -1)]

    # Combine the solutions from both cases
    solutions = solutions1 + solutions2

    # Calculate the area of the convex polygon
    area = 0
    for solution in solutions:
        # The area of a square is side_length^2
        area += 20**2 - 16**2

    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 12096

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
12096
```
The output of 12096 is incorrect. This is likely due to the fact that the absolute value equations are not being handled correctly, and the solutions are not being filtered correctly. Let's modify the code to handle the absolute value equations manually and filter the solutions:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    # Solve for the intersection of the two squares
    x, y = symbols('x y')
    # Case 1: |x + y| = 10
    solutions1 = [(x, -x - 10) for x in range(-10, 11)] + [(x, -x + 10) for x in range(-10, 11)]
    # Case 2: |x - y| = 10
    solutions2 = [(x, x - 10) for x in range(10, -11, -1)] + [(x, x + 10) for x in range(10, -11, -1)]

    # Combine the solutions from both cases
    solutions = solutions1 + solutions2

    # Filter the solutions to only include the ones that satisfy |x| = 8 and |y| = 8
    solutions = [(x, y) for (x, y) in solutions if abs(x) <= 8 and abs(y) <= 8]

    # Calculate the area of the convex polygon
    area = 0
    for solution in solutions:
        # The area of a square is side_length^2

    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
``````output

CODE RESULTS 4032

INTERMEDIATE OUT :

4032
```
The output of 4032 is still incorrect. This is likely due to the fact that the absolute value equations are not being handled correctly, and the filtering of the solutions is not being done correctly. Let's modify the code to handle the absolute value equations manually and filter the solutions using the correct conditions:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    # Solve for the intersection of the two squares
    x, y = symbols('x y')
    # Case 1: |x + y| = 10

    solutions2 = [(x, x - 10) for x in range(10, -11, -1)] + [(x, x + 10) for x in range(10, -11, -1)]

    # Combine the solutions from both cases
    solutions = solutions1 + solutions2

## QUESTION 3 - 12

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_ 2= (-16,2).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that
\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as
\[\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1.\]Find $h + k + a + b.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

**Solution:** 


This problem involves the concept of absolute value and inequalities. The absolute value function $|x|$ equals $x$ if $x \geq 0$ and $-x$ if $x < 0$. The equation is satisfied if either of the two factors is zero. 

Let's consider the first factor:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0.$$
This equation is satisfied if and only if both $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$. This implies that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the perpendicular bisectors of the line segments from $(0, 0)$ to $(10, 10)$ and from $(0, 0)$ to $(-10, 10)$, which are $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ respectively. These are two lines.

Similarly, for the second factor:
$$((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$
This equation is satisfied if and only if both $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. This implies that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the square with vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(8, -8)$.

The intersection of the two regions is a square with side length $10$. Therefore, the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


First, we need to understand that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These two equations represent two lines in the coordinate plane, and their intersection forms a square with side length 20. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.

The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which represents a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

However, the second case is not valid because the points in the square formed by the intersection of the two lines satisfy the original equation, while the points in the square formed by the second case do not. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 400.
The answer is: $400$
