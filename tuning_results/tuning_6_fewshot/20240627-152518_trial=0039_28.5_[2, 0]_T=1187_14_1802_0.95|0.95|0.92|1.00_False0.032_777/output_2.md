**Problem:** 
"How many integers are solutions to the equation $$(x-2)^{(25-x^2)}=1?$$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
We need some basic facts from number theory: $a^0 = 1$ for any $a,$ $1^b = 1$ for any $b,$ and $(-1)^c = 1$ if $c$ is an even integer. Unless the base is a complex number (which is excluded since we are looking for integer solutions), there are no other ways to get an RHS of $1.$ Thus, either the exponent is zero $($giving the equation $25 - x^2 = 0),$ the base is $1$ $($giving $x -2 = 1),$ or the base is $-1$ and the exponent is even $($giving the simultaneous equations $x - 2 = -1$ and $25 - x^2 = 2n$ for some integer $n).$ Solving the first equation gives $x = \pm 5,$ and solving the second gives $x = 3.$ The third equation implies that $x = 1,$ in which case $25 - x^2 = 24$ is indeed even, so $x = 1$ is a valid solution. In all, there are $\boxed{4}$ integer solutions. The answer is $\boxed{4}$

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. This is because the expression $| |x - 1| - 2|$ can take on the values $0$, $1$, $2$, or $3$ only, and it equals $2$ exactly when the equation has $4$ distinct solutions. Therefore, we can set up the equation $\frac{m}{100} = 2$ and solve for $m$. Multiplying both sides by $100$ gives $m = 200$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def find_m():
    """Find the value of m for which the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions."""
    m = 200
    return m

m = find_m()
print(m)
```

CODE RESULTS 200

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
200
```
The value of $m$ for which the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $200$. Therefore, $m = 200$. The answer is $\boxed{200}$.

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


To solve this problem, we first need to understand the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. This function is a piecewise linear function with four parts:
- For $x < -1$, the function is equal to $-(x-1) + 2 = -x + 3$.
- For $-1 \leq x < 1$, the function is equal to $-(x-1) - 2 = -x - 1$.
- For $1 \leq x < 3$, the function is equal to $(x-1) - 2 = x - 3$.
- For $x \geq 3$, the function is equal to $(x-1) + 2 = x + 1$.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have 4 distinct solutions if the right-hand side, $\frac{m}{100}$, is equal to the distance between two adjacent points where the function changes its slope.

The points where the function changes its slope are $-1, 1,$ and $3$. The distances between these points are $2$ and $2$. Therefore, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal to one of these distances.

So we have two possible values for $m$: $m = 200$ or $m = 400$. But since $m$ is a positive integer, the only valid value for $m$ is $200$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is $1$. The answer is: $1$

Assistant:

 The number of distinct solutions to the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ equals 4 if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ takes the value of 2 exactly four times. 

Therefore, we have $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, which gives $m = 200$.

    m = 200

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let \[f(x) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
-x + 3 & \text{if } x \le 0, \\
2x - 5 & \text{if } x > 0.
\end{array}
\right.\]How many solutions does the equation $f(f(x)) = 4$ have?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
To solve the equation $f(f(x)) = 4,$ we first find the values $x$ such that $f(x) = 4.$

Either $f(x) = -x + 3$ (for $x \le 0$) or $f(x) = 2x - 5$ (for $x > 0$). If $-x + 3 = 4,$ then $x = -1.$ Note that this value satisfies $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = 4,$ then $x = 9/2.$ Note that this value satisfies $x > 0.$ Therefore, the solutions to $f(x) = 4$ are $x = -1$ and $x = 9/2.$

Next, we solve for the values $x$ such that $f(x) = -1.$ If $-x + 3 = -1,$ then $x = 4.$ This value does not satisfy $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = -1,$ then $x = 2.$ This value satisfies $x > 0.$

Finally, we solve for the values $x$ such that $f(x) = 9/2.$ If $-x + 3 = 9/2,$ then $x = -3/2.$ This value satisfies $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = 9/2,$ then $x = 19/4.$ This value satisfies $x > 0.$

Therefore, the equation $f(f(x)) = 4$ has the solutions $x = 2,$ $-3/2,$ and $19/4,$ for a total of $\boxed{3}$ solutions. The answer is $\boxed{3}$

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


The key to solving this problem is to understand the graph of the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. The function $f(x)$ is a piecewise linear function that takes on the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ at exactly four distinct points. The graph of $f(x)$ is a "V" shape with two segments, each of slope $\pm 1$, and the "bottom" of the "V" is at $f(x) = 0$.

To have four distinct solutions to the equation $f(x) = \frac{m}{100}$, the value $\frac{m}{100}$ must fall strictly between the first and second "teeth" of the "V" shape. This means that $\frac{m}{100}$ must be strictly greater than $1$ and strictly less than $2$. Therefore, $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Multiplying all sides of the inequalities by $100$ gives $100 < m < 200$.

The problem asks for how many positive integers $m$ satisfy this inequality. Since $m$ must be a positive integer, we need to find how many positive integers are strictly between $100$ and $200$. This is simply $200 - 100 - 1 = 99$.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions is $99$. The answer is: $\boxed{99}$.

**Problem:** 
"How many distinct solutions are there to the equation $|x-7| = |x+1|$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
If $|x-7| = |x+1|$, then either $x-7 = x+1$ or $x-7 = -(x+1)$.  Simplifying $x-7=x+1$ gives $0=8$, which has no solutions, so no values of $x$ satisfy $x-7 = x+1$.  If $x-7 = -(x+1)$, then $x-7 = -x-1$, so $2x = 6$, which gives $x=3$.  So, there is $\boxed{1}$ solution.

Challenge: See if you can find a quick solution to this problem by simply thinking about the graphs of $y=|x-7|$ and $y=|x+1|$. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Solution:** 



In this problem, we are asked to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has four distinct solutions. 

The equation contains absolute values, and absolute value equations often have a case for each possible sign of the argument. This means we have four cases to consider:

1. $x-1 \geq 2$ and $x-1 \geq 0$, so $x \geq 3$. The equation then simplifies to $x-1-2=\frac{m}{100}$, or $x=3+\frac{m}{100}$.
2. $x-1 \geq 2$ and $x-1 < 0$, so $x < 1$. The equation then simplifies to $-(x-1)-2=\frac{m}{100}$, or $x=1-\frac{m}{100}$.
3. $x-1 < 2$ and $x-1 \geq 0$, so $1 \geq x \geq 0$. The equation then simplifies to $-(x-1)-2=\frac{m}{100}$, or $x=1+\frac{m}{100}$.
4. $x-1 < 2$ and $x-1 < 0$, so $x < 0$. The equation then simplifies to $x-1-2=\frac{m}{100}$, or $x=-1+\frac{m}{100}$.

These four cases yield four equations for $x$. Each of these equations must have exactly one solution in the domain of the original equation, which is $x \in \mathbb{R}$. This means that the four values of $x$ obtained from these four equations must be distinct.

By analyzing the four equations, we find that only the first and third cases yield solutions that are always positive for $x$. The second case yields a solution that is positive only when $\frac{m}{100} < 1$, or $m < 100$. The fourth case yields a solution that is positive only when $\frac{m}{100} > 1$, or $m > 100$. 

Therefore, the only way for the original equation to have four distinct solutions is if $m = 100$. 

So, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions. The answer is: $\boxed{1}$.

**Solution:** 



We can start by noting that the equation $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. Therefore, we need to solve the equation $| |x-1| - 2 | = 2$.

To solve this equation, we can break it into two cases:

Case 1: $|x-1| - 2 = 2$, then $|x-1| = 4$. This gives us two equations to solve: $x-1 = 4$ and $x-1 = -4$. The solutions to these equations are $x = 5$ and $x = -3$ respectively.

Case 2: $|x-1| - 2 = -2$, then $|x-1| = 0$. This gives us one equation to solve: $x-1 = 0$, and its solution is $x = 1$.

So, the four distinct solutions are $x = -3, 1, 5$. Therefore, the value of $m$ is $2 \cdot 100 = 200$. The answer is: $200$
