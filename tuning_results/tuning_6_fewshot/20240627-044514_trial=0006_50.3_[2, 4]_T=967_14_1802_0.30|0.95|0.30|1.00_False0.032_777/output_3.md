**Problem:** 
"Let $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_ 2= (-16,2).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that
\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as
\[\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1.\]Find $h + k + a + b.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

Let's consider the first term:
\[(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0.\]
This equation is satisfied if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This forms a square with side length 20, so the area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.

Now let's consider the second term:
\[(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0.\]
This equation is satisfied if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This forms a square with side length 16, so the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

The intersection of the two squares is a smaller square with side length 8 (the intersection of $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert x + y \vert = 10$), so the area of this square is $8^2 = 64$.

The area of the convex polygon formed by the union of the two squares is the sum of the areas of the two squares minus the area of their intersection:
\[400 + 256 - 64 = 592.\]
So the area of the convex polygon is 592. The answer is: $592$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The expression $A = ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if both of its factors are equal to zero.

2. The factor $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$.

3. The factor $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

4. The polygon is a square with side length 16. To find its area, we can use the formula for the area of a square, which is $side^2$. So the area of the polygon is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

**Solution:**


The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

The first term is zero when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two squares with side length 10, centered at the origin, with one square along the line $x = y$ and the other along the line $x = -y$.

The second term is zero when $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two squares with side length 16, centered at the origin, one along the x-axis and the other along the y-axis.

The intersection of these squares forms a regular octagon with side length 8. The area of a regular octagon with side length $a$ is given by the formula $2a^2(1 + \sqrt{2})$. Substituting $a = 8$ into the formula gives the area of the octagon as $2 \cdot 8^2(1 + \sqrt{2}) = 128(1 + \sqrt{2})$.

The area of the convex polygon is $128 + 128\sqrt{2}$. However, this is not a valid numerical answer. It seems that there was a mistake in the calculation. Let's re-examine the problem and the solution.

The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

The first term is zero when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two squares with side length 10, centered at the origin, with one square along the line $x = y$ and the other along the line $x = -y$.

The second term is zero when $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two squares with side length 16, centered at the origin, one along the x-axis and the other along the y-axis.

The intersection of these squares forms a regular octagon with side length 8. The area of a regular octagon with side length $a$ is given by the formula $2a^2(1 + \sqrt{2})$. Substituting $a = 8$ into the formula gives the area of the octagon as $2 \cdot 8^2(1 + \sqrt{2}) = 128(1 + \sqrt{2})$.

However, this result is not correct. The correct formula for the area of a regular octagon with side length $a$ is $2a^2(1 + \sqrt{2})$. Substituting $a = 8$ into the formula gives the area of the octagon as $2 \cdot 8^2(1 + \sqrt{2}) = 128(1 + \sqrt{2})$.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.

2. The first term is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, and this term equals zero if and only if both $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These conditions imply that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(0, 10)$, $(10, 0)$, $(0, -10)$, and $(-10, 0)$.

3. The second term is $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2$, and this term equals zero if and only if both $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So we get four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(8, -8)$.

4. The intersection of the two regions is the convex polygon formed by the intersection of the rectangle and the square. This polygon is a square with side length 10 (since the rectangle has side lengths 20 and the square has side lengths 16, and the square is inscribed in the rectangle).

5. The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side. So the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

**Solution:** 


The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.

The first term is zero when $|\pm x \pm y - 10| = 0$ and the second term is zero when $|\pm x| - 8 = 0$ or $|\pm y| - 8 = 0$.

The solutions to $|\pm x| - 8 = 0$ are $x = \pm 8$ and the solutions to $|\pm y| - 8 = 0$ are $y = \pm 8$.

The solutions to $|\pm x \pm y - 10| = 0$ are the lines $x + y = 10$, $x - y = 10$, $-x + y = 10$, and $-x - y = 10$.

The intersection points of these lines are $(8,2)$, $(8,-2)$, $(-8,2)$, and $(-8,-2)$.

The polygon formed by these points is a square with side length 8. The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 64. The answer is: $64$

**Solution:** 



This problem involves understanding the properties of absolute value and how it interacts with equations and inequalities. The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero, which means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. We will solve each case separately.

First, let's solve the equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.

Next, let's solve the equation $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.

Similarly, for the second expression, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ which implies $x = 8$ or $x = -8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$ which implies $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

Now, we need to find the intersection points of these lines and determine the vertices of the polygon. The lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, $x - y = -10$, $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$ form a square with side length 10. The vertices of this square are $(8, 2)$, $(8, -10)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -10)$.

The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_ 2= (-16,2).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that
\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as
\[\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1.\]Find $h + k + a + b.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. This means that the points that satisfy the equation are the union of the points that satisfy each expression separately.

The first expression is zero when either $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x - y| - 10 = 0$. These equations simplify to $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle.

The second expression is zero when either $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$. These equations simplify to $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines also form a rectangle.

The intersection of the two rectangles is the convex polygon that encloses the points that satisfy the equation. The sides of the polygon are the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. The length of the sides of the rectangle formed by the first expression is 20 (from $-10$ to $10$ in both $x + y$ and $x - y$), and the length of the sides of the rectangle formed by the second expression is 16 (from $-8$ to $8$ in both $|x|$ and $|y|$). Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the product of the lengths of its sides, which is $20 \times 16 = 320$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 320 square units. The answer is: $320$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

This means that the points satisfying the equation are those for which either $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The lines $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$ form a rectangle with side lengths 16 and 20. The area of this rectangle is $16 \times 20 = 320$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 320.

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. 

The first expression is zero when either $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x - y| - 10 = 0$. This implies $|x + y| = 10$ or $|x - y| = 10$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

The second expression is zero when either $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$. This implies $|x| = 8$ or $|y| = 8$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersection points of these lines are the vertices of the polygon: $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

The polygon is a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. 

The first expression is zero when either $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x-y| - 10 = 0$. These equations simplify to $|x+y| = 10$ and $|x-y| = 10$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x+y = 10$, $x+y = -10$, $x-y = 10$, and $x-y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle.

The second expression is zero when either $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$. These equations simplify to $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines also form a rectangle.

The intersection of the two rectangles is the convex polygon whose area we want to find. The sides of this rectangle are parallel to the x and y axes, and the lengths of the sides can be found by solving the equations $|x+y| = 10$, $|x-y| = 10$, $|x| = 8$, and $|y| = 8$. The lengths of the sides are 16 and 20, so the area of the rectangle is $16 \times 20 = 320$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 320.

    # Lengths of the sides of the rectangle
    side1 = 16
    side2 = 20
