**Problem:** 
"How many distinct solutions are there to the equation $|x-7| = |x+1|$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
If $|x-7| = |x+1|$, then either $x-7 = x+1$ or $x-7 = -(x+1)$.  Simplifying $x-7=x+1$ gives $0=8$, which has no solutions, so no values of $x$ satisfy $x-7 = x+1$.  If $x-7 = -(x+1)$, then $x-7 = -x-1$, so $2x = 6$, which gives $x=3$.  So, there is $\boxed{1}$ solution.

Challenge: See if you can find a quick solution to this problem by simply thinking about the graphs of $y=|x-7|$ and $y=|x+1|$. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The number of distinct solutions to the equation $| |x-1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $4$ if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $2$. Therefore, we have $m = 200$.

To confirm this, we can plot the graph of $| |x-1| - 2|$ and see that it intersects the line $y = \frac{m}{100}$ at $4$ distinct points when $m = 200$.

```python

    x = symbols('x')
    m_value = 200

    return m_value

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We are asked to find how many positive integers $m$ for the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

2. The number of solutions of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to the number of times the graph of $y = \frac{m}{100}$ intersects the graph of $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$.

3. The graph of $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a "V" shape with the vertex at $(1, 2)$ and the slopes of the two arms are $-1$ and $1$.

4. The graph of $y = \frac{m}{100}$ is a horizontal line at a height of $\frac{m}{100}$.

5. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions when the line $y = \frac{m}{100}$ intersects the graph of $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ at $4$ distinct points.

6. This happens when $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, so $100 < m < 200$.

7. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from $101$ to $199$, inclusive.

8. The number of such integers is $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$.

However, we need to check if $m=100$ or $m=200$ are valid solutions. For $m=100$, the equation becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{100}{100}$, which simplifies to $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=1$. This equation has $4$ solutions, so $m=100$ is a valid solution. For $m=200$, the equation becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{200}{100}$, which simplifies to $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=2$. This equation has $8$ solutions, so $m=200$ is not a valid solution.

9. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $99 + 1 = 100$.

The answer is: $100$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many integers are solutions to the equation $$(x-2)^{(25-x^2)}=1?$$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
We need some basic facts from number theory: $a^0 = 1$ for any $a,$ $1^b = 1$ for any $b,$ and $(-1)^c = 1$ if $c$ is an even integer. Unless the base is a complex number (which is excluded since we are looking for integer solutions), there are no other ways to get an RHS of $1.$ Thus, either the exponent is zero $($giving the equation $25 - x^2 = 0),$ the base is $1$ $($giving $x -2 = 1),$ or the base is $-1$ and the exponent is even $($giving the simultaneous equations $x - 2 = -1$ and $25 - x^2 = 2n$ for some integer $n).$ Solving the first equation gives $x = \pm 5,$ and solving the second gives $x = 3.$ The third equation implies that $x = 1,$ in which case $25 - x^2 = 24$ is indeed even, so $x = 1$ is a valid solution. In all, there are $\boxed{4}$ integer solutions. The answer is $\boxed{4}$

## QUESTION 2 - 11

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"For certain ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ of real numbers, the system of equations
\[\begin{aligned} ax+by&=1 \\ x^2 + y^2 &= 50  \end{aligned}\]has at least one solution, and each solution is an ordered pair $(x,y)\,$ of integers. How many such ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ are there?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The graph of $ax+by=1$ is a line, while the graph of $x^2+y^2=50$ is a circle centered at the origin. Therefore, $(a, b)$ satisfies the conditions if and only if the line and circle intersect at least once, and they intersect only at lattice points (points with integer coordinates).

Knowing this, it makes sense to look for lattice points on the circle whose equation is $x^2+y^2=50$. Testing cases, we find that there are twelve lattice points on the circle: $(\pm 1, \pm 7)$, $(\pm 7, \pm 1)$, and $(\pm 5, \pm 5)$ (where the two $\pm$ signs in each pair are independent of each other).

There are $\tbinom{12}{2} = 66$ pairs of these points, and each pair determines a line. However, the graph of $ax+by=1$ can never pass through the origin $(0, 0)$, since if $x=y=0$, then $ax+by=0 \neq 1$. Therefore, the six pairs which consist of diametrically opposed points are invalid, since the line through them passes through the origin. This corrects our count to $66 - 6 = 60$.

In addition, for each of the twelve points, there is a line tangent to the circle at that point, so that the only solution to the system is that one point. This brings the final total to $60 + 12 = \boxed{72}$. The answer is $\boxed{72}$

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



This problem involves the absolute value function and the equation has four distinct solutions. We can start by analyzing the absolute value function. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $2$, because the absolute value function makes the expression inside it non-negative. Therefore, we have $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which simplifies to $100 < m < 200$. 

The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from $101$ to $199$, inclusive. To count the number of these integers, we can subtract the smallest integer from the largest and then add $1$. So the number of positive integers $m$ is $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$.

Therefore, there are $99$ positive integers $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def count_positive_integers():
    smallest_integer = 101

result = count_positive_integers()
print(result)
```

The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is $99$. The answer is $\boxed{99}$.

**Problem:** 
"How many distinct solutions are there to the equation $|x-7| = |x+1|$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
If $|x-7| = |x+1|$, then either $x-7 = x+1$ or $x-7 = -(x+1)$.  Simplifying $x-7=x+1$ gives $0=8$, which has no solutions, so no values of $x$ satisfy $x-7 = x+1$.  If $x-7 = -(x+1)$, then $x-7 = -x-1$, so $2x = 6$, which gives $x=3$.  So, there is $\boxed{1}$ solution.

Challenge: See if you can find a quick solution to this problem by simply thinking about the graphs of $y=|x-7|$ and $y=|x+1|$. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Solution:** 



The problem asks us to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. We can start by considering the possible values of $\frac{m}{100}$. Since $m$ is a positive integer, $\frac{m}{100}$ can be any positive number. We can rewrite the equation as $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=k$, where $k=\frac{m}{100}$.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=k$ can have $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $k=1$. This is because the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, changes its sign at $x=1$ and $x=3$. For $k=1$, the equation has $4$ distinct solutions: $x=0$, $x=2$, $x=4$, and $x=6$. Therefore, the only value of $m$ that works is $m=100$.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $1$. The answer is: $1$

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The problem is asking for how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions. 

To solve this problem, we need to understand the graph of the function $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. The graph of this function is a V-shape with the "valleys" at $x = -1$ and $x = 3$. The height of the "valleys" is $2$. 

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is less than $2$ but greater than $0$. This means $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. 

To find the value of $m$ that satisfies this condition, we can multiply all parts of the inequality by $100$ to get $0 < m < 200$. 

Therefore, the positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition are $1, 2, 3, ..., 199$. There are $199$ such numbers.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $199$.
