**Problem:** 
"Five identical rectangles are arranged to form a larger rectangle $PQRS$, as shown.  The area of $PQRS$ is $4000$.  What is the length, $x$, rounded off to the nearest integer? [asy]
real x = 1; real w = 2/3;

// Draw outer square and labels
pair s = (0, 0); pair r = (2 * x, 0); pair q = (3 * w, x + w); pair p = (0, x + w);
draw(s--r--q--p--cycle);
label("$S$", s, SW); label("$R$", r, SE); label("$Q$", q, NE); label("$P$", p, NW);

// Draw other segments
draw((x, 0)--(x, w));
draw((0, w)--(2 * x, w));

// length labels
pair upper = (-0.1, x + w);
pair lower = (-0.1, w);
draw(lower--upper);
draw((-0.1 - 0.03, x + w)--(-0.1 + 0.03, x + w));
draw((-0.1 - 0.03, w)--(-0.1 + 0.03, w));
label("$x$", midpoint((-0.1, w)--(-0.1, x + w)), W);

pair left = (0, -0.1); pair right = (x, -0.1);
draw((0, -0.1 + 0.03)--(0, -0.1 - 0.03));
draw((x, -0.1 - 0.03)--(x, -0.1 + 0.03));
draw(left--right);
label("$x$", (x/2, -0.1), S);

[/asy]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Let $w$ be the width of each of the identical rectangles. Since $PQ=3w$, $RS=2x$ and $PQ=RS$ (because $PQRS$ is a rectangle), then $2x = 3w$, or $$w=\frac{2}{3}x.$$ Therefore, the area of each of the five identical rectangles is $$x\left(\frac{2}{3}x\right)=\frac{2}{3}x^2.$$ Since the area of $PQRS$ is 4000 and it is made up of five of these identical smaller rectangles, then $$5\left(\frac{2}{3}x^2\right)=4000$$ or $$\frac{10}{3}x^2 = 4000$$ or $x^2 = 1200$ or $x \approx 34.6$ which, when rounded off to the nearest integer, is $\boxed{35}.$ The answer is $\boxed{35}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.

The first expression is zero when either $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x - y| - 10 = 0$, which simplifies to $|x + y| = 10$ or $|x - y| = 10$. These are the equations of two lines in the plane.

The second expression is zero when either $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$, which simplifies to $|x| = 8$ or $|y| = 8$. These are the equations of two lines in the plane.

The intersection of these lines form a square with side length 16 (since $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$ imply that $|x| = 5$ and $|y| = 5$, and $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$ imply that the side length of the square is $8 + 8 = 16$).

The area of the square is therefore $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon formed by the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the given equation is 256.

    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_ 2= (-16,2).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that
\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as
\[\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1.\]Find $h + k + a + b.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



To solve this problem, we first need to understand that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, we can break down the equation into two separate equations:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first equation, both terms must be zero:

$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$

This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

For the second equation, both terms must be zero:

$(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

Combining these results, we find that the points that satisfy the original equation are those that lie on the squares with side length 16 centered at the origin. The intersection of these squares is a 8 by 8 square, so its area is $8^2 = 64$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 64. The answer is: $64$

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero, or the second term is zero, or both are zero.

2. The first term is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, and this term equals zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy this equation form a square with side length 20.

3. The second term is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$, and this term equals zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy this equation form a square with side length 16.

4. Therefore, the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the original equation are those that lie in the intersection of these two squares. The intersection of the two squares is another square, but this time with side length 8 (the smaller of the two squares' side lengths).

5. The area of a square is given by the square of its side length, so the area of the convex polygon is $8^2 = 64$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 64. The answer is: $64$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many square units are in the area of the triangle whose vertices are the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the curve $y = (x-3)^2 (x+2)$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we need to find where this curve intersects the $x$ and $y$ axes.  If $y=0$, then $(x-3)^2(x+2)=0$, which has solutions of $x=3$ and $x=-2$.  If $x=0$, then $y=(-3)^2(2)=18$.  So, the curve has two $x$-intercepts and one $y$-intercept.  The length of the base along the $x$-axis is $3-(-2)=5$.  The height from this base is equal to the $y$-intercept, 18.  The area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 5\cdot 18=\boxed{45}$. The answer is $\boxed{45}$

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


This problem is a bit complex, and it might be more efficient to solve it with a combination of mathematical reasoning and Python. However, it is not immediately clear how to go about solving it. Let's try to simplify the problem first.

The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is equal to zero if and only if either of the two factors is equal to zero. This gives us two sets of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first set of equations, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$. This gives us the vertices of a rectangle with side lengths 16 and 20.

For the second set of equations, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us the vertices of another rectangle with side lengths 16 and 20.

Therefore, the points that satisfy the original equation form a rectangle with side lengths 16 and 20. The area of this rectangle is $16 \times 20 = 320$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 320.

```python

def polygon_area():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    # Side lengths of the rectangle
    length = 16
    width = 20

    # Calculate the area of the rectangle
    area = length * width

    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

Assistant:

 The expression $A \cdot B = 0$ implies that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The solutions to each of these equations are:
- $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ gives $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = \pm 10$.
- $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ gives $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x - y = \pm 10$.
- $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ gives $\vert x \vert = 8$, which implies $x = \pm 8$.
- $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ gives $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $y = \pm 8$.

The solutions to these equations form a square with side length 16 (since the maximum and minimum values for $x$ and $y$ are 8 and -8). The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

The python code to calculate the area of the polygon is:
