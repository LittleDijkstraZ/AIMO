**Problem:** 
"For certain ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ of real numbers, the system of equations
\[\begin{aligned} ax+by&=1 \\ x^2 + y^2 &= 50  \end{aligned}\]has at least one solution, and each solution is an ordered pair $(x,y)\,$ of integers. How many such ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ are there?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The graph of $ax+by=1$ is a line, while the graph of $x^2+y^2=50$ is a circle centered at the origin. Therefore, $(a, b)$ satisfies the conditions if and only if the line and circle intersect at least once, and they intersect only at lattice points (points with integer coordinates).

Knowing this, it makes sense to look for lattice points on the circle whose equation is $x^2+y^2=50$. Testing cases, we find that there are twelve lattice points on the circle: $(\pm 1, \pm 7)$, $(\pm 7, \pm 1)$, and $(\pm 5, \pm 5)$ (where the two $\pm$ signs in each pair are independent of each other).

There are $\tbinom{12}{2} = 66$ pairs of these points, and each pair determines a line. However, the graph of $ax+by=1$ can never pass through the origin $(0, 0)$, since if $x=y=0$, then $ax+by=0 \neq 1$. Therefore, the six pairs which consist of diametrically opposed points are invalid, since the line through them passes through the origin. This corrects our count to $66 - 6 = 60$.

In addition, for each of the twelve points, there is a line tangent to the circle at that point, so that the only solution to the system is that one point. This brings the final total to $60 + 12 = \boxed{72}$. The answer is $\boxed{72}$

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions, we want to find the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy this condition.

Let's analyze the equation step by step:

1. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, then $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two cases:
   - If $x-1 \ge 0$, then $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.
   - If $x-1 < 0$, then $-(x-1) = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

2. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$, then $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two cases:
   - If $x-1 \ge 0$, then $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
   - If $x-1 < 0$, then $-(x-1) = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

For each value of $m$, we get four possible values for $x$: $3 + \frac{m}{100}$, $-1 + \frac{m}{100}$, $3 - \frac{m}{100}$, and $-1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

For these four values of $x$ to be distinct, none of them can be equal. This means that the four fractions $\frac{m}{100}$, $-\frac{m}{100}$, $\frac{m}{100} - 4$, and $-\frac{m}{100} - 4$ must all be different.

This means that $m$ cannot be a multiple of $100$, and $m$ cannot be equal to $200k$ for any integer $k$.

So we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ that are not multiples of $100$ and do not equal $200k$ for any integer $k$.

The first few such positive integers are $1, 3, 4, 9, 12, 16, 27, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, 121, 144, 169, 196, 225, 256, 289, 324, 361, 400, \ldots$.

It appears that these are the squares of integers that are not multiples of $10$. The largest such square less than or equal to $400$ is $19^2 = 361$, and the next such square is $20^2 = 400$, which is not in our list. So the positive integers $m$ that we are looking for are the squares of integers from $1$ to $19$, excluding the squares of multiples of $10$.

The number of such integers is $19 - 1 = 18$. So there are $18$ positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

The answer is: 18
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def count_m():
    """For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"""
    count = 0
    for m in range(1, 401):
        if m**0.5 % 1 == 0 and int(m**0.5) % 10 != 0:
            count += 1
    return count - 1

result = count_m()

It seems there was a mistake in the calculation. Let's recompute the number of positive integers $m$ that are not multiples of $100$ and do not equal $200k$ for any integer $k$. The first few such positive integers are $1, 3, 4, 9, 12, 16, 27, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, 121, 144, 169, 196, 225, 256, 289, 324, 361$. It appears that these are the squares of integers that are not multiples of $10$. The largest such square less than or equal to $400$ is $19^2 = 361$. So the positive integers $m$ that we are looking for are the squares of integers from $1$ to $19$. The number of such integers is $19$. So there are $19$ positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. The answer is: 19

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is less than $2$ but greater than $0$. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ oscillates between $0$ and $4$, and it is equal to $\frac{m}{100}$ exactly four times in this interval.

So we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Multiplying all sides of the inequalities by $100$ gives $0 < m < 200$. The number of positive integers in this interval is $200 - 1 = 199$. However, this count includes the value $m=200$, so we need to subtract $1$ to correct for this. The final answer is $199 - 1 = 198$.

Here is a Python code to calculate the number of positive integers $m$:

```python

def count_m():

**Problem:** 
"How many solutions does the equation \[\frac{(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)\dotsm(x-100)}{(x-1^2)(x-2^2)(x-3^2)\dotsm(x-100^2)} = 0\]have for $x$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Any solution to this equation must make the numerator of the left-hand side zero, while keeping the denominator non-zero. The numerator is zero when $x$ is one of the numbers $1, 2, 3, \dots, 100.$ However, for any value in this list that is a perfect square, the denominator will also be zero, so that value of $x$ will not be a root. Therefore, we want to find the number of integers in the list $1, 2, \dots, 100$ which are not perfect squares. The perfect squares in the list are $1^2, 2^2, \dots, 10^2,$ so there are $10$ perfect squares, and \[100 - 10 = \boxed{90}\]integers which are not perfect squares. The answer is $\boxed{90}$

The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $100$. However, we are asked to find for how many of these $m$ values the equation has exactly $4$ distinct solutions. This means we have to exclude the cases where the equation has less than $4$ solutions. 

We know that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has at most $4$ solutions because the left-hand side is a piecewise function with $4$ pieces. When $m=0$, the equation simplifies to $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=0$, which has only $2$ solutions. When $0<m\leq 2$, the equation has $4$ distinct solutions. When $2<m\leq 100$, the equation has $2$ distinct solutions.

So, the only $m$ values for which the equation has exactly $4$ distinct solutions are those in the range $0<m\leq 2$. There are $2$ such values, namely $1$ and $2$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly $4$ distinct solutions is $2$. The answer is $\boxed{2}$.

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we need to find the number of values of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly four distinct solutions.

First, let's analyze the equation. The expression on the left, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, is a piecewise function that takes on the value of $2-x+1=3-x$ when $x<1$, $2-1+2=3$ when $1\leq x \leq 3$, and $x-1-2=x-3$ when $x>3$. So the equation becomes:
1. $3-x = \frac{m}{100}$ for $x<1$,
2. $3 = \frac{m}{100}$ for $1\leq x \leq 3$,
3. $x-3 = \frac{m}{100}$ for $x>3$.

From these equations, we can solve for $x$ in each case:
1. $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ for $x<1$,
2. $x = 3$ for $1\leq x \leq 3$,
3. $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ for $x>3$.

The equation has four distinct solutions if and only if the solutions from the first and third cases intersect the intervals $x<1$ and $x>3$. This happens when $\frac{m}{100} < 2$, or $m < 200$, and $\frac{m}{100} > 2$, or $m > 200$. The only value of $m$ that satisfies both conditions is $m = 200$.

So the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly four distinct solutions when $m = 200$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is 1. The answer is: $1$
