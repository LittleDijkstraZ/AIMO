"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 This problem is a bit tricky to solve directly, but we can use some mathematical insights to simplify it. First, let's rewrite the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$. This simplifies to $|x-2y| + |-1*(x-2y)| = 40$, which further simplifies to $2|x-2y| = 40$, or $|x-2y| = 20$.

Now, let's define a new variable $z = x - 2y$. Then the equation $|x-2y| = 20$ becomes $|z| = 20$, which means $-20 \leq z \leq 20$. So, $-20 \leq x - 2y \leq 20$.

Next, let's consider the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite this as $5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x - 2y)^2 + 4xy] - 8xy = 5[z^2 + 4xy] - 8xy$.

Now, we want to minimize this expression. To do this, we can use the fact that $z = x - 2y$ and $z^2 = (x - 2y)^2 \geq 0$. This means that $z^2 + 4xy \geq 4xy$, so $5[z^2 + 4xy] - 8xy \geq 5*4xy - 8xy = 12xy$.

The minimum value of $12xy$ occurs when $xy$ is as large as possible. This happens when $x$ and $y$ have the same sign and $|x|$ and $|y|$ are as large as possible, given the constraint $-20 \leq x - 2y \leq 20$.

If $x$ and $y$ are both positive, then $x - 2y = 20$, which gives $x = 2y + 20$. Substituting this into the equation $z = x - 2y$, we get $z = 20$. Then, $y = \frac{x - 20}{2} = \frac{2y + 20 - 20}{2} = y$, which is consistent. So, the maximum possible value of $xy$ occurs when $x = 20$ and $y = 10$, giving $xy = 200$.

If $x$ and $y$ are both negative, then $x - 2y = -20$, which gives $x = 2y - 20$. Substituting this into the equation $z = x - 2y$, we get $z = -20$. Then, $y = \frac{x + 20}{2} = \frac{2y - 20 + 20}{2} = y$, which is consistent. So, the maximum possible value of $xy$ also occurs when $x = -20$ and $y = -10$, giving $xy = 200$.

Therefore, the maximum possible value of $xy$ is 200. Substituting this into the expression $12xy$, we get $12*200 = 2400$.

Finally, substituting this into the expression $5[z^2 + 4xy] - 8xy$, we get $5*(0) + 2400 - 8*200 = 2400 - 1600 = 800$.

So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 800. The answer is: $800$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"What is the minimum value of the expression $2x^2+3y^2+8x-24y+62$ for real $x$ and $y$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Rearranging the expression, we have  \[2x^2+8x+3y^2-24y+62\]We first complete the square in $x$. Factoring a 2 from the first two terms of the expression, we get  \[2(x^2+4x)+3y^2-24y+62\]In order for the expression inside the parenthesis to be a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(4/2)^2=4$ inside the parenthesis. Doing this, we have \[2(x^2+4x+4-4)+3y^2-24y+62 \Rightarrow 2(x+2)^2+3y^2-24y+54\]Now we complete the square in $y$. Factoring a 3 from the $y$ terms in the expression, we get \[2(x+2)^2+3(y^2-8y)+54\]In order for the expression inside the second parenthesis to be a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(8/2)^2=16$ inside the parenthesis. Doing this, we have \[2(x+2)^2+3(y^2-8y+16-16)+54 \Rightarrow 2(x+2)^2+3(y-4)^2+6\]Since the minimum value of $2(x+2)^2$ and $3(y-4)^2$ is $0$ (perfect squares can never be negative), the minimum value of the entire expression is $\boxed{6}$, and is achieved when $x=-2$ and $y=4$. The answer is $\boxed{6}$

To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


```python

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"What is the minimum value of the expression $x^2+y^2+2x-4y+8$ for real $x$ and $y$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Rearranging the expression, we have  \[x^2+2x+y^2-4y+8\]Completing the square in $x$, we need to add and subtract $(2/2)^2=1$. Completing the square in $y$, we need to add and subtract $(4/2)^2=4$. Thus, we have \[(x^2+2x+1)-1+(y^2-4y+4)-4+8 \Rightarrow (x+1)^2+(y-2)^2+3\]Since the minimum value of $(x+1)^2$ and $(y-2)^2$ is $0$ (perfect squares can never be negative), the minimum value of the entire expression is $\boxed{3}$, and is achieved when $x=-1$ and $y=2$. The answer is $\boxed{3}$
