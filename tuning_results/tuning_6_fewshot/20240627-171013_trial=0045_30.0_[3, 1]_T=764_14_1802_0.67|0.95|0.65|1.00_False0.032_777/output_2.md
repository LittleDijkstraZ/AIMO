**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many solutions does the equation \[\frac{(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)\dotsm(x-100)}{(x-1^2)(x-2^2)(x-3^2)\dotsm(x-100^2)} = 0\]have for $x$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Any solution to this equation must make the numerator of the left-hand side zero, while keeping the denominator non-zero. The numerator is zero when $x$ is one of the numbers $1, 2, 3, \dots, 100.$ However, for any value in this list that is a perfect square, the denominator will also be zero, so that value of $x$ will not be a root. Therefore, we want to find the number of integers in the list $1, 2, \dots, 100$ which are not perfect squares. The perfect squares in the list are $1^2, 2^2, \dots, 10^2,$ so there are $10$ perfect squares, and \[100 - 10 = \boxed{90}\]integers which are not perfect squares. The answer is $\boxed{90}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



To solve the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ for 4 distinct solutions, we need to find the values of $m$ for which the right-hand side $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $1$. This is because the absolute value function has a V-shape, and for it to equal a positive value twice, that value must be $1$.

So, we need to solve the equation $\frac{m}{100} = 1$, which gives $m = 100$. Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions, and that is $m = 100$. The answer is: $100$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many integers are solutions to the equation $$(x-2)^{(25-x^2)}=1?$$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
We need some basic facts from number theory: $a^0 = 1$ for any $a,$ $1^b = 1$ for any $b,$ and $(-1)^c = 1$ if $c$ is an even integer. Unless the base is a complex number (which is excluded since we are looking for integer solutions), there are no other ways to get an RHS of $1.$ Thus, either the exponent is zero $($giving the equation $25 - x^2 = 0),$ the base is $1$ $($giving $x -2 = 1),$ or the base is $-1$ and the exponent is even $($giving the simultaneous equations $x - 2 = -1$ and $25 - x^2 = 2n$ for some integer $n).$ Solving the first equation gives $x = \pm 5,$ and solving the second gives $x = 3.$ The third equation implies that $x = 1,$ in which case $25 - x^2 = 24$ is indeed even, so $x = 1$ is a valid solution. In all, there are $\boxed{4}$ integer solutions. The answer is $\boxed{4}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



We can start by setting up the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ and solving it for $x$. 

The left-hand side of the equation is a piecewise function:
- If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 \geq 0$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \vert x-1 \vert - 2$.
- If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = -( \vert x-1 \vert - 2) = 2 - \vert x-1 \vert$.

So we have two cases to consider:

1. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 \geq 0$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \vert x-1 \vert - 2$. The equation becomes $\vert x-1 \vert - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. This further simplifies to two equations: $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x-1 = -(2 + \frac{m}{100})$.

2. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = 2 - \vert x-1 \vert$. The equation becomes $2 - \vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. This further simplifies to two equations: $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x-1 = -(2 - \frac{m}{100})$.

Now, for each of these four equations, we need to find the number of distinct solutions. We can do this by plotting the left-hand side and the right-hand side of the equation and counting the number of intersection points.

After solving the problem and finding the number of distinct solutions for each equation, we can sum up the number of solutions and compare it to 4. If the sum is equal to 4, then the corresponding value of $m$ is a solution to the problem.

```python

    equation1 = Abs(x - 1) - 2 - m/100
    solutions += len(solveset(equation1, x, domain=S.Reals))

    # Case 2: x - 1 = -(2 + m/100)
    equation2 = Abs(x - 1) + 2 + m/100

We have encountered a problem in our code. The `solveset` function returns a `ConditionSet` object, which does not have a `len` method. We need to convert this object to a list before we can find its length. Let's modify our code accordingly:

```python

    solutions = 0

    solutions1 = solveset(equation1, x, domain=S.Reals)
    solutions += len(solutions1)

    # Case 2: x - 1 = -(2 + m/100)
    equation2 = Eq(Abs(x - 1) + 2, -m/100)
    solutions2 = solveset(equation2, x, domain=S.Reals)
    solutions += len(solutions2)

    # Case 3: x - 1 = 2 - m/100
    equation3 = Eq(Abs(x - 1) - (2 - m/100), 0)
    solutions3 = solveset(equation3, x, domain=S.Reals)
    solutions += len(solutions3)

    # Case 4: x - 1 = -(2 - m/100)
    equation4 = Eq(Abs(x - 1) + (2 - m/100), 0)
    solutions4 = solveset(equation4, x, domain=S.Reals)
    solutions += len(solutions4)

    return solutions

Again, we have encountered a problem in our code. The `solveset` function returns a `ConditionSet` object, which does not have a `len` method. We need to convert this object to a list before we can find its length. Let's modify our code accordingly:

## QUESTION 2 - 2

2_User:

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $3$. This is because the expression on the left side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, can take on any value in the interval $[1,3]$ and no value outside of this interval. Therefore, we want to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $1<\frac{m}{100}<3$, or equivalently, $100<m<300$. The number of positive integers in this range is $300-100-1=199$. So the answer is $\boxed{199}$.

Here is a Python code to calculate the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition:
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def count_m():
    lower_bound = 100
    upper_bound = 300
    return upper_bound - lower_bound - 1

result = count_m()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 199

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
199
```
So, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition is 199. The answer is: $199$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many solutions does the equation \[\frac{(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)\dotsm(x-100)}{(x-1^2)(x-2^2)(x-3^2)\dotsm(x-100^2)} = 0\]have for $x$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Any solution to this equation must make the numerator of the left-hand side zero, while keeping the denominator non-zero. The numerator is zero when $x$ is one of the numbers $1, 2, 3, \dots, 100.$ However, for any value in this list that is a perfect square, the denominator will also be zero, so that value of $x$ will not be a root. Therefore, we want to find the number of integers in the list $1, 2, \dots, 100$ which are not perfect squares. The perfect squares in the list are $1^2, 2^2, \dots, 10^2,$ so there are $10$ perfect squares, and \[100 - 10 = \boxed{90}\]integers which are not perfect squares. The answer is $\boxed{90}$

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, we notice that the expression inside the absolute value on the left hand side, $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|$, is always non-negative. This means that the right hand side $\frac{m}{100}$ must also be non-negative. This implies that $m$ must be a non-negative integer. But we are asked for positive integers, so we discard 0 and consider only positive integers.

2. The expression $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|$ can take values from 0 to 2. This is because $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|$ is equal to 0 when $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$, which gives us two solutions $x = 3$ and $x = -1$. Similarly, $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|$ is equal to 1 when $\vert x-1 \vert = 1$, which gives us one solution $x = 1$. Finally, $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|$ is equal to 2 when $\vert x-1 \vert = 0$, which gives us one solution $x = 1$. So the expression $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|$ can take values from 0 to 2.

3. Now, we want the equation $|\vert x-1 \vert -2| = \frac{m}{100}$ to have 4 distinct solutions. This can only happen when the right hand side $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to 1. So we must have $m = 100$.

So, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions, and that is $m = 100$. The answer is: $1$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"For certain ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ of real numbers, the system of equations
\[\begin{aligned} ax+by&=1 \\ x^2 + y^2 &= 50  \end{aligned}\]has at least one solution, and each solution is an ordered pair $(x,y)\,$ of integers. How many such ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ are there?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The graph of $ax+by=1$ is a line, while the graph of $x^2+y^2=50$ is a circle centered at the origin. Therefore, $(a, b)$ satisfies the conditions if and only if the line and circle intersect at least once, and they intersect only at lattice points (points with integer coordinates).

Knowing this, it makes sense to look for lattice points on the circle whose equation is $x^2+y^2=50$. Testing cases, we find that there are twelve lattice points on the circle: $(\pm 1, \pm 7)$, $(\pm 7, \pm 1)$, and $(\pm 5, \pm 5)$ (where the two $\pm$ signs in each pair are independent of each other).

There are $\tbinom{12}{2} = 66$ pairs of these points, and each pair determines a line. However, the graph of $ax+by=1$ can never pass through the origin $(0, 0)$, since if $x=y=0$, then $ax+by=0 \neq 1$. Therefore, the six pairs which consist of diametrically opposed points are invalid, since the line through them passes through the origin. This corrects our count to $66 - 6 = 60$.

In addition, for each of the twelve points, there is a line tangent to the circle at that point, so that the only solution to the system is that one point. This brings the final total to $60 + 12 = \boxed{72}$. The answer is $\boxed{72}$
