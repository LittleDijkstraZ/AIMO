**Problem:** 
"If $x + 2y= 4$ and $xy = -8$, what is the value of $x^2 + 4y^2$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
We see that $(x + 2y)^2 = (x^2 + 4y^2) + 4xy = 4^2 = 16$. We want to find $x^2 + 4y^2$ and are given $xy = -8$. So, $x^2 + 4y^2 + 4xy = x^2 + 4y^2 + 4(-8) = 16$. It follows that $x^2 + 4y^2 = \boxed{48}$. The answer is $\boxed{48}$

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"

 To solve this problem, we can first simplify the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ by completing the square. Then, we can use the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ to find the relationship between $x$ and $y$. Finally, we can substitute this relationship into the simplified expression and find the minimum value.

```python

```
The output is not what we expected. This is because the `Piecewise` function is not suitable for symbolic computation and it causes the `solve` function to fail. Let's try another approach.

From the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we can rewrite it as $|x-2y| = 40 - |y-2x|$. Since the absolute value function is always non-negative, we can square both sides to get rid of the absolute value:
\[(x - 2y)^2 = (40 - (y - 2x))^2.\]
Expanding both sides gives:
\[x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2 = 1600 - 80(y - 2x) + (y - 2x)^2.\]
Simplifying this equation gives:
\[5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = 1600.\]
So the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is $1600$.
The answer is: $1600$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"What is the minimum value of the expression $x^2+y^2+2x-4y+8$ for real $x$ and $y$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Rearranging the expression, we have  \[x^2+2x+y^2-4y+8\]Completing the square in $x$, we need to add and subtract $(2/2)^2=1$. Completing the square in $y$, we need to add and subtract $(4/2)^2=4$. Thus, we have \[(x^2+2x+1)-1+(y^2-4y+4)-4+8 \Rightarrow (x+1)^2+(y-2)^2+3\]Since the minimum value of $(x+1)^2$ and $(y-2)^2$ is $0$ (perfect squares can never be negative), the minimum value of the entire expression is $\boxed{3}$, and is achieved when $x=-1$ and $y=2$. The answer is $\boxed{3}$

**Problem**
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


To solve this problem, we can use the method of completing the square. First, we rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $(x^2-4xy+4y^2) + (y^2-4xy+4x^2) = (x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2$.

The condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ tells us that $x-2y$ and $y-2x$ are both multiples of $20$. Let's say $x-2y = 20a$ and $y-2x = 20b$, where $a$ and $b$ are integers. Then we have $x = 2y + 20a$ and $y = 2x + 20b$. Substituting the first equation into the second, we get $y = 2(2y+20a) + 20b$, which simplifies to $y = \frac{40a + 20b}{3}$. Substituting this back into the equation $x = 2y + 20a$, we get $x = 2\left(\frac{40a + 20b}{3}\right) + 20a = \frac{80a + 40b}{3} + 20a = \frac{140a + 40b}{3}$.

Now, we substitute these values of $x$ and $y$ into the expression $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2$:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, simplify

def minimum_expression_value():
    a, b = symbols('a b')
    x = 140*a/3 + 40*b/3
    y = 40*a/3 + 20*b/3
    expr = (x - 2*y)**2 + (y - 2*x)**2
    simplified_expr = simplify(expr)
    return simplified_expr

result = minimum_expression_value()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 400*a**2 + 400*(4*a + b)**2

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output

The expression $400*a^2 + 400*(4*a + b)^2$ is minimized when $a = 0$ and $b = 0$. Substituting these values into the expression, we get $400*0^2 + 400*(4*0 + 0)^2 = 0$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 0. The answer is: $0$

We see that $(x + 2y)^2 = (x^2 + 4y^2) + 4xy = 4^2 = 16$. We want to find $x^2 + 4y^2$ and are given $xy = -8$. So, $x^2 + 4y^2 + 4xy = x^2 + 4y^2 + 4(-8) = 16$. It follows that $x^2 + 4y^2 = \boxed{48}$. The answer is $\boxed{48}$

**Problem**
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


This problem requires a bit of algebraic manipulation and mathematical insight. The first step is to rewrite the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ using the property $|a| = |-a|$ to get $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$. This simplifies to $2|x-2y| = 40$, so $|x-2y| = 20$.

Now, consider the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite it as $\frac{1}{2}((x-2y)^2 + 4x^2 + 4y^2)$. Using the fact that $|x-2y| = 20$, we can substitute this into the expression to get $\frac{1}{2}(20^2 + 4x^2 + 4y^2)$. This simplifies to $200 + 2x^2 + 2y^2$.

Now, we want to minimize this expression. We know that the sum of squares of real numbers is always non-negative, so $2x^2 + 2y^2 \geq 0$. Therefore, to minimize the expression, we need to minimize the constant term $200$. The minimum value of the expression is therefore $200$.

So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $200$.
The answer is: $200$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Step 1: From the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we know that $x$ and $y$ must be real numbers. We can rewrite the equation as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$.

Step 2: Using the property of absolute values, we can rewrite the equation as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40 \Rightarrow |2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$.

Step 3: Now we can use the triangle inequality to simplify the equation. The triangle inequality states that $|a+b| \leq |a| + |b|$ for all real numbers $a$ and $b$. Applying this to our equation gives us $|2y-x| + |2x-y| \geq |(2y-x) + (2x-y)| = |y| = y$ (since $y$ is a real number).

Step 4: Therefore, we have $y \leq 40$. Similarly, we can show that $x \leq 40$.

Step 5: Now we need to find the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite this as $5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy$.

Step 6: By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we know that $(x^2+y^2)(1+1) \geq (x+y)^2$. Rearranging gives us $x^2+y^2 \geq \frac{(x+y)^2}{2}$.

Step 7: Substituting this into our expression gives us $5\frac{(x+y)^2}{2} - 8xy$.

Step 8: Now we need to minimize this expression. By the AM-GM inequality, we know that $\frac{x+y}{2} \geq \sqrt{xy}$. Rearranging gives us $xy \leq \frac{(x+y)^2}{4}$.

Step 9: Substituting this into our expression gives us $5\frac{(x+y)^2}{2} - 8\frac{(x+y)^2}{4} = \frac{3(x+y)^2}{4}$.

Step 10: Since $x$ and $y$ are both less than or equal to 40, we know that $x+y \leq 80$. Therefore, the minimum value of the expression is $\frac{3(80)^2}{4} = 4800$.

Step 11: So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 4800.

```python

**Problem**
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


To solve this problem, we can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. The inequality states that for any real numbers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ and $b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n$, we have
\[(a_1^2 + a_2^2 + \ldots + a_n^2)(b_1^2 + b_2^2 + \ldots + b_n^2) \geq (a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 + \ldots + a_nb_n)^2.\]

We can apply this inequality to our problem by setting $a_1 = x$, $a_2 = y$, $b_1 = 1$, and $b_2 = -2$. Then, we have
\[(x^2 + y^2)((1)^2 + (-2)^2) \geq (x*1 + y*(-2))^2.\]
Simplifying, we get
\[(x^2 + y^2)(1 + 4) \geq (x - 2y)^2,\]
\[5(x^2 + y^2) \geq (x - 2y)^2.\]

Now, let's substitute $x - 2y = a$ and $y - 2x = b$. Then, we have $x = \frac{a+2b}{5}$ and $y = \frac{2a-b}{5}$. Substituting these into the inequality, we get
\[5\left(\left(\frac{a+2b}{5}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{2a-b}{5}\right)^2\right) \geq a^2.\]
Simplifying, we get
\[5\left(\frac{a^2 + 4ab + 4b^2}{25} + \frac{4a^2 - 4ab + b^2}{25}\right) \geq a^2,\]
\[5\left(\frac{5a^2 + 5b^2}{25}\right) \geq a^2,\]
\[a^2 + b^2 \geq a^2,\]
\[b^2 \geq 0.\]
Since $b^2 \geq 0$ for all real numbers $b$, the inequality holds.

Now, let's substitute back $x - 2y = a$ and $y - 2x = b$. We have
\[5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = 5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy = 5\left(\left(\frac{a+2b}{5}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{2a-b}{5}\right)^2\right) - 8\left(\frac{a+2b}{5}\right)\left(\frac{2a-b}{5}\right).\]
Simplifying, we get
\[5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = \frac{5a^2 + 5b^2}{5} - \frac{8(a^2 - 2ab + 4b^2)}{25},\]
\[5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = a^2 + b^2 - \frac{8a^2 - 16ab + 32b^2}{25},\]
\[5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = a^2 + b^2 - \frac{24b^2 - 16ab}{25}.\]
Since $a^2 + b^2 \geq a^2$ and $b^2 \geq 0$, we have
\[5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy \geq a^2.\]
And since $a = x - 2y$, we have
\[5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy \geq (x - 2y)^2.\]
Finally, we are given that $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$. Since $x - 2y = a$ and $y - 2x = b$, we have $|a| + |b| = 40$. By the triangle inequality, we have $|a + b| \leq |a| + |b|$. Therefore,
\[|(x - 2y) + (y - 2x)| \leq |x - 2y| + |y - 2x|,\]
\[|-x - y| \leq 40,\]
\[|x + y| \leq 40.\]

Now, let's substitute $x = \frac{a+2b}{5}$ and $y = \frac{2a-b}{5}$ into $|x + y| \leq 40$. We get
\[\left|\frac{a+2b}{5} + \frac{2a-b}{5}\right| \leq 40,\]
\[\left|\frac{3a+b}{5}\right| \leq 40,\]
\[|3a + b| \leq 200.\]
Since $|a| + |b| = 40$, we have $|3a + b| = |3(a + b) - 2b| = |3(a + b)| - 2|b| \leq 3|a + b| + 2|b| = 3*40 + 2*40 = 200$. Therefore, we have
\[|3a + b| \leq 200.\]
And since $|3a + b| \leq 200$, we have
\[5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy \geq (x - 2y)^2 \geq 0.\]
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is $0$. However, this is not possible because we are given that $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$, and if $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = 0$, then $x = 2y$ and $y = 2x$, which would imply $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 0$, not $40$.

Therefore, we must have made a mistake in our reasoning. Let's go back and re-examine the problem.

Notice that in the inequality $5(x^2 + y^2) \geq (x - 2y)^2$, the right side of the inequality is $(x - 2y)^2$, which is always non-negative. Therefore, the minimum value of $5(x^2 + y^2)$ must be achieved when $(x - 2y)^2 = 0$, which implies $x = 2y$. Similarly, the minimum value of $5(y^2 + 2x^2 - 4xy)$ must be achieved when $(y - 2x)^2 = 0$, which implies $y = 2x$. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ must be achieved when $x = 2y$ and $y = 2x$.

Let's substitute $x = 2y$ and $y = 2x$ into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$. We get
\[5(2y)^2 + 5y^2 - 8(2y)(y) = 20y^2 + 5y^2 - 16y^2 = 9y^2.\]
Since $y = 2x$, we have
\[9y^2 = 9(2x)^2 = 36x^2.\]
Now, let's substitute $x = 2y$ into the equation $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$. We get

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"What is the minimum value of the expression $2x^2+3y^2+8x-24y+62$ for real $x$ and $y$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Rearranging the expression, we have  \[2x^2+8x+3y^2-24y+62\]We first complete the square in $x$. Factoring a 2 from the first two terms of the expression, we get  \[2(x^2+4x)+3y^2-24y+62\]In order for the expression inside the parenthesis to be a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(4/2)^2=4$ inside the parenthesis. Doing this, we have \[2(x^2+4x+4-4)+3y^2-24y+62 \Rightarrow 2(x+2)^2+3y^2-24y+54\]Now we complete the square in $y$. Factoring a 3 from the $y$ terms in the expression, we get \[2(x+2)^2+3(y^2-8y)+54\]In order for the expression inside the second parenthesis to be a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(8/2)^2=16$ inside the parenthesis. Doing this, we have \[2(x+2)^2+3(y^2-8y+16-16)+54 \Rightarrow 2(x+2)^2+3(y-4)^2+6\]Since the minimum value of $2(x+2)^2$ and $3(y-4)^2$ is $0$ (perfect squares can never be negative), the minimum value of the entire expression is $\boxed{6}$, and is achieved when $x=-2$ and $y=4$. The answer is $\boxed{6}$

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solve, simplify

def minimum_value():
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # Define the expressions
    expr1 = 5 * x**2 + 5 * y**2 - 8 * x * y
    expr2 = abs(x - 2 * y) + abs(y - 2 * x) - 40

    # Solve the equation expr2 = 0 for y
    y_sol = solve(expr2, y)[0]

    # Substitute the solution for y in expr1
    min_expr = expr1.subs(y, y_sol)

    # Find the minimum value by taking the derivative and setting it equal to zero
    min_value = min_expr.diff(x)
    x_sol = solve(min_value, x)[0]

    # Substitute the solution for x in the minimum expression
    min_value = min_expr.subs(x, x_sol)

    # Simplify the minimum value
    min_value = simplify(min_value)

    return min_value

result = minimum_value()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 800

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
800
```
The minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $800$. The answer is: $800$
