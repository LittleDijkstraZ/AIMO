**Problem:** 
"Let $f$ be a function taking the nonnegative integers to the positive integers such that $f(0) = f(1) = 1$ and
\[\frac{f(n) f(m + 1)}{f(m)} + \frac{f(n) f(n - m)}{f(n - m - 1)} = f(n + 1)\]for all nonnegative integers $n$ and $m,$ where $n \ge m + 1.$

Find the smallest nonnegative integer $n$ such that $f(n) > 10^6.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Setting $m = n - 1$ in the given functional equation, we get
\[\frac{f(n) \cdot f(n)}{f(n - 1)} + f(n) = f(n + 1),\]for all $n \ge 1.$  Then
\[\frac{f(n)}{f(n - 1)} + 1 = \frac{f(n + 1)}{f(n)}.\]Let $g(n) = \frac{f(n)}{f(n - 1)}$ for $n \ge 1.$  Then $g(1) = \frac{f(1)}{f(0)} = 1,$ and
\[g(n) + 1 = g(n + 1).\]Then $g(n) = n$ for all $n \ge 1.$  Hence,
\[g(n) g(n - 1) \dotsm g(2) g(1) = \frac{f(n)}{f(n - 1)} \cdot \frac{f(n - 1)}{f(n - 2)} \dotsm \frac{f(2)}{f(1)} \cdot \frac{f(1)}{f(0)},\]which simplifies to
\[n(n - 1) \dotsm (2)(1) = \frac{f(n)}{f(0)}.\]Therefore, $f(n) = n!$ for all $n \ge 1.$

Since $f(9) = 9! = 326880$ and $f(10) = 10! = 3628800,$ the smallest such $n$ is $\boxed{10}.$ The answer is $\boxed{10}$

**Problem**
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


To find $f(100)$, we can use the second condition $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. We can start by finding $f(50)$ using this condition.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def calculate_f_100():
    # Calculate f(50) using the second condition
    f_50 = 2 * f(25) + 1

    # Calculate f(25) using the second condition
    f_25 = 2 * f(12.5) + 1

    # Since f(n) is a function from natural numbers to natural numbers,
    # f(12.5) is not defined. So we use the first condition f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7
    f_12_5 = (8 * 12.5 - 7) / 8
    f_25 = 2 * f_12_5 + 1

    # Continue this process to find f(50)
    f_50 = 2 * f_25 + 1

    # Finally, find f(100) using the second condition
    f_100 = 2 * f_50 + 1

    return f_100

result = calculate_f_100()
print(result)
```

The function $f$ is not defined in the code. However, we can use the first condition $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$ to find $f(100)$.

Let's start by finding $f(100)$. We know that $f(f(f(100))) = 8*100 - 7 = 793$. Now we need to find the value of $f(f(100))$ and $f(100)$ such that $f(f(f(100))) = 793$.

We can use a loop to iterate through possible values of $f(f(100))$ and $f(100)$ until we find a pair that satisfies the equation $f(f(f(100))) = 793$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"The function $f(n)$ is defined on the positive integers such that $f(f(n)) = 2n$ and $f(4n + 1) = 4n + 3$ for all positive integers $n.$  Find $f(1000).$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Consider the expression $f(f(f(a))).$  Since $f(f(a)) = 2a,$ this is equal to $f(2a).$  But taking $n = f(a)$ in $f(f(n)) = 2n,$ we get
\[f(f(f(a))) = 2f(a).\]Hence,
\[f(2a) = 2f(a)\]for all positive integers $a.$

Then
\[f(1000) = 2f(500) = 4f(250) = 8f(125).\]Taking $n = 31$ in $f(4n + 1) = 4n + 3,$ we get
\[f(125) = 127,\]so $f(1000) = \boxed{1016}.$ The answer is $\boxed{1016}$

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we can start by setting $n = 1$ in the second equation to get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. Then, we can substitute $f(2)$ into the first equation to get $f(f(f(1))) = f(f(2)) = 8*1 - 7 = 1$. Since $f(f(f(1))) = 1$, we have $f(f(2)) = 1$. Then, substituting $f(2)$ into this equation gives $f(2f(1) + 1) = 1$. Since $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$, we have $f(f(2)) = 1$. Therefore, $f(2) = 3$.
Now, we can substitute $f(2) = 3$ into the second equation to get $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2*3 + 1 = 7$. Then, substituting $f(4)$ into the first equation gives $f(f(f(2))) = f(f(4)) = 8*2 - 7 = 9$. Since $f(f(f(2))) = 9$, we have $f(f(4)) = 9$. Then, substituting $f(4)$ into this equation gives $f(2f(2) + 1) = 9$. Since $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$, we have $f(7) = 9$.
Now, we can substitute $f(7) = 9$ into the second equation to get $f(14) = 2f(7) + 1 = 2*9 + 1 = 19$. Then, substituting $f(14)$ into the first equation gives $f(f(f(7))) = f(f(14)) = 8*7 - 7 = 56 - 7 = 49$. Since $f(f(f(7))) = 49$, we have $f(f(14)) = 49$. Then, substituting $f(14)$ into this equation gives $f(2f(7) + 1) = 49$. Since $f(14) = 2f(7) + 1$, we have $f(19) = 49$.
Finally, we can substitute $f(19) = 49$ into the second equation to get $f(38) = 2f(19) + 1 = 2*49 + 1 = 99$. Then, substituting $f(38)$ into the first equation gives $f(f(f(19))) = f(f(38)) = 8*19 - 7 = 152 - 7 = 145$. Since $f(f(f(19))) = 145$, we have $f(f(38)) = 145$. Then, substituting $f(38)$ into this equation gives $f(2f(19) + 1) = 145$. Since $f(38) = 2f(19) + 1$, we have $f(99) = 145$.
Therefore, $f(100) = f(99) = 145$. The answer is: $145$

## QUESTION 4 - 2

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $
f(n) =
\begin{cases}
n^2+1 & \text{if }n\text{ is odd} \\
\dfrac{n}{2} & \text{if }n\text{ is even}
\end{cases}.
$

For how many integers $n$ from 1 to 100, inclusive, does $f ( f (\dotsb f (n) \dotsb )) = 1$ for some number of applications of $f$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we note that if $n$ is a positive integer, then $f(n)$ is also a positive integer.  We claim that $f ( f (\dotsb f (n) \dotsb )) = 1$ for some number of applications of $f$ only for $n = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32,$ and $64.$  (In other words, $n$ must be a power of 2.)

Note that $f(1) = 2,$ so $f(f(1)) = f(2) = 1.$  If $n > 1$ is a power of 2, it is easy to see that repeated applications of $f$ on $n$ eventually reach 1.

Suppose $n$ is an odd positive integer, where $n > 1.$  Write $n = 2k + 1,$ where $k$ is a positive integer.  Since $n$ is odd,
\[f(n) = n^2 + 1 = (2k + 1)^2 + 1 = 4k^2 + 4k + 2 = 2(2k^2 + 2k + 1).\]Since $2k^2 + 2k$ is always even, $2k^2 + 2k + 1$ is always odd (and greater than 1), so $f(n)$ can never be a power of 2 when $n$ is odd and greater than 1.

Now, suppose $n$ is even.  For example, if $n = 2^3 \cdot 11,$ then
\[f(2^3 \cdot 11) = f(2^2 \cdot 11) = f(2 \cdot 11) = f(11),\]which we know is not a power of 2.

More generally, suppose $n = 2^e \cdot m,$ where $e$ is nonnegative and $m$ is odd.  Then
\[f(2^e \cdot m) = f(2^{e - 1} \cdot m) = f(2^{e - 2} \cdot m) = \dots = f(m).\]If $m = 1,$ then $n$ is a power of 2, and the sequence eventually reaches 1.  Otherwise, $f(m)$ is not a power of 2.  We also know that $f(m)$ is odd and greater than 1, $f(f(m))$ is not a power of 2 either, and so on.  Thus, the sequence can never reach 1.

Therefore, $n$ must be one of the $\boxed{7}$ values 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, or 64. The answer is $\boxed{7}$

**Solution:**


To find $f(100)$, we need to use the given equations. We can start by finding $f(f(100))$ using the second equation.

From the second equation, we have $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. So, $f(2 \cdot 50) = 2f(50) + 1$. That is, $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.

Now, we need to find $f(50)$. We can use the first equation to do this. We have $f(f(f(50))) = 8 \cdot 50 - 7 = 393$. Since $f(f(50)) = f(100)/2$, we can substitute this into the equation to get $f(f(50)) = 393/2$.

Now, we can substitute $f(50)$ into the equation $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$ to get $f(100) = 2 \cdot (393/2) + 1 = 393 + 1 = 394$.

So, $f(100) = 394$. The answer is: $394$

**Solution:**


To solve this problem, we need to find the value of $f(100)$ given the function $f$ that satisfies the conditions $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.

Let's start by finding the value of $f(1)$. From the second condition, we have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. But from the first condition, we also have $f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = -1$. Since $f(f(f(1))) = f(2)$, we have $f(2) = -1$. Substituting this into the second condition, we get $-1 = 2f(1) + 1$, which implies $f(1) = -1$.

Now we can find $f(100)$. We know that $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$. We also know that $f(f(f(100))) = 8*100 - 7 = 793$. Since $f(f(f(100))) = f(200)$, we have $f(200) = 793$. Substituting this into the equation $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$, we get $793 = 2f(100) + 1$, which implies $f(100) = \frac{793 - 1}{2} = 396$.

So, the value of $f(100)$ is 396. The answer is: $396$

**Solution:** 



To find $f(100)$, we can use the second condition $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ repeatedly.

First, we find $f(50)$:
\[f(50) = 2f(25) + 1.\]
Then, we find $f(25)$:
\[f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1.\]
But $12.5$ is not a positive integer, so we cannot use the second condition directly. We need to use the first condition $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$.

Let's set $n = 12.5$, then $f(f(f(12.5))) = 8*12.5 - 7 = 93$.
We know that $f(f(f(12.5))) = f(f(25))$, so $f(f(25)) = 93$.

Now, let's set $n = 25$ in the second condition, we get $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1 = 2*93 + 1 = 187$.

Finally, let's set $n = 50$ in the second condition, we get $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2*187 + 1 = 375$.

So, $f(100) = 375$. The answer is: $375$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $f$ be a function taking the nonnegative integers to the positive integers such that $f(0) = f(1) = 1$ and
\[\frac{f(n) f(m + 1)}{f(m)} + \frac{f(n) f(n - m)}{f(n - m - 1)} = f(n + 1)\]for all nonnegative integers $n$ and $m,$ where $n \ge m + 1.$

Find the smallest nonnegative integer $n$ such that $f(n) > 10^6.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Setting $m = n - 1$ in the given functional equation, we get
\[\frac{f(n) \cdot f(n)}{f(n - 1)} + f(n) = f(n + 1),\]for all $n \ge 1.$  Then
\[\frac{f(n)}{f(n - 1)} + 1 = \frac{f(n + 1)}{f(n)}.\]Let $g(n) = \frac{f(n)}{f(n - 1)}$ for $n \ge 1.$  Then $g(1) = \frac{f(1)}{f(0)} = 1,$ and
\[g(n) + 1 = g(n + 1).\]Then $g(n) = n$ for all $n \ge 1.$  Hence,
\[g(n) g(n - 1) \dotsm g(2) g(1) = \frac{f(n)}{f(n - 1)} \cdot \frac{f(n - 1)}{f(n - 2)} \dotsm \frac{f(2)}{f(1)} \cdot \frac{f(1)}{f(0)},\]which simplifies to
\[n(n - 1) \dotsm (2)(1) = \frac{f(n)}{f(0)}.\]Therefore, $f(n) = n!$ for all $n \ge 1.$

Since $f(9) = 9! = 326880$ and $f(10) = 10! = 3628800,$ the smallest such $n$ is $\boxed{10}.$ The answer is $\boxed{10}$

To find $f(100)$, we can use the second condition of the function $f$. We know that $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. Therefore, we can find $f(50)$ first, and then use it to find $f(100)$.

\[f(50) = 2f(25) + 1.\]

But we don't know $f(25)$ yet. We can find it by using the second condition again:
\[f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1.\]

But $12.5$ is not a natural number, so we cannot continue this way. Let's try the first condition of the function $f$:
\[f(f(f(25))) = 8 \cdot 25 - 7 = 173.\]

Since $f(f(f(25))) = 173$, we can set up the equation:
\[f(f(x)) = 173 \implies f(x) = f^{-1}(173).\]

We know that $f(f(x)) = 8x - 7$, so we can set up the equation:
\[8x - 7 = 173 \implies 8x = 180 \implies x = 22.5.\]

But $22.5$ is not a natural number, so we made a mistake somewhere. Let's go back and check our work.

We know that $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. So if we let $n = 12.5$, we get:
\[f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1.\]

But we know that $f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1$, so we can substitute this into our equation:
\[f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1 \implies f(25) = 2(f(12.5)) + 1.\]

This equation doesn't make sense, because we are trying to find the value of $f(12.5)$, which is not a natural number. Let's try a different approach.

We know that $f(f(f(25))) = 173$, so we can set up the equation:
\[f(f(x)) = 173 \implies f(x) = f^{-1}(173).\]

We know that $f(f(x)) = 8x - 7$, so we can set up the equation:

But we know that $f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1$, so we can substitute this into our equation:

"The function $f$ is defined on the set of integers and satisfies \[f(n)= \begin{cases}  n-3 & \mbox{if }n\ge 1000 \\  f(f(n+5)) & \mbox{if }n<1000. \end{cases}\]Find $f(84)$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Denote by (1) and (2) the two parts of the definition of $f$, respectively. If we begin to use the definition of $f$ to compute $f(84)$, we use (2) until the argument is at least $1000$: \[f(84) = f(f(89)) = f(f(f(94))) = \dots = f^N(1004)\](where $f^N$ denotes composing $f$ with itself $N$ times, for some $N$). The numbers $84, 89, 94, \dots, 1004$ form an arithmetic sequence with common difference $5$; since $1004 - 84 = 920 = 184 \cdot 5$, this sequence has $184 + 1 = 185$ terms, so $N = 185$.

At this point, (1) and (2) are both used: we compute \[\begin{aligned} f^N(1004) &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-1}(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-1}(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(1000) \\ &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(997) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1002) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(999) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1004). \end{aligned}\]Repeating this process, we see that \[f^N(1004) = f^{N-2}(1004) = f^{N-4}(1004) = \dots = f^3(1004).\](The pattern breaks down for $f^k(1004)$ when $k$ is small, so it is not true that $f^3(1004) = f(1004)$.) Now, we have \[f^3(1004) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^2(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^2(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(1000) \stackrel{(1)}{=} \boxed{997}.\] The answer is $\boxed{997}$

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


To solve this problem, we can use the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to find $f(100)$.
First, we can find $f(50)$ using the second condition: $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.
Then, we can find $f(25)$ using the second condition again: $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.
Continuing this process, we can find $f(12)$, $f(6)$, $f(3)$, and finally $f(1)$.
Using the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we can find $f(1)$: $f(f(f(1))) = 8(1) - 7 = 1$, so $f(1) = 1$.
Now we can use the second condition to find $f(3)$: $f(6) = 2f(3) + 1$. Since $f(1) = 1$, we have $f(3) = 2(1) + 1 = 3$.
Similarly, we can find $f(6) = 2f(3) + 1 = 2(3) + 1 = 7$, and $f(12) = 2f(6) + 1 = 2(7) + 1 = 15$.
Finally, we can find $f(25) = 2f(12) + 1 = 2(15) + 1 = 31$, and $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1 = 2(31) + 1 = 63$.
Now we can find $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2(63) + 1 = 127$.
Therefore, $f(100) = 127$.
The answer is: $127$

Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Consider the expression $f(f(f(a))).$  Since $f(f(a)) = 2a,$ this is equal to $f(2a).$  But taking $n = f(a)$ in $f(f(n)) = 2n,$ we get

\[f(125) = 127,\]so $f(1000) = \boxed{1016}.$ The answer is $\boxed{1016}$

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


To solve this problem, we need to find the value of $f(100)$ given the two conditions.

Let's start by applying the second condition to $f(100)$: $f(2 \cdot 50) = 2f(50) + 1$.

Now, we need to find the value of $f(50)$. We can use the second condition again: $f(2 \cdot 25) = 2f(25) + 1$.

Continuing this process, we find that $f(100)$ is a function of $f(25)$. To find the value of $f(25)$, we need to apply the first condition: $f(f(f(25))) = 8 \cdot 25 - 7 = 193$.

Since $f(f(f(25))) = 193$, we can set $f(25) = a$ and solve the equation $f(f(a)) = 193$.

Again, using the first condition, we have $f(f(a)) = 8a - 7$. Setting this equal to 193, we get $8a - 7 = 193$, which simplifies to $8a = 200$ and $a = 25$.

Now we can substitute $a = 25$ back into the equation $f(2 \cdot 25) = 2f(25) + 1$ to find $f(50)$: $f(50) = 2 \cdot 25 + 1 = 51$.

Finally, substituting $f(50) = 51$ into the equation $f(2 \cdot 50) = 2f(50) + 1$ to find $f(100)$: $f(100) = 2 \cdot 51 + 1 = 103$.

So, the value of $f(100)$ is 103.

The answer is: $103$

To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



First, we can see that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ implies that $f$ is an involution, meaning that applying the function three times returns the original value. This means that applying the function once returns the value to a fixed point of the function. 

From $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can see that the function is not linear. The only fixed point of this function is $f(1)=1$. 

By substituting $n=1$ into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we get $f(2)=2f(1)+1=3$. 

By substituting $n=2$ into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we get $f(4)=2f(2)+1=7$. 

By substituting $n=4$ into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we get $f(8)=2f(4)+1=15$. 

We can see a pattern here: $f(2^k)=2^k+1-2$. 

Now we can use this pattern to find $f(100)$. First, we express 100 as a sum of powers of 2: $100=64+32+4=2^6+2^5+2^2$. 

So, $f(100)=f(2^6+2^5+2^2)=f(2^6)+f(2^5)+f(2^2)=2^6+1-2+2^5+1-2+2^2+1-2=64-1+32-1+4-1=94$.

So, $f(100)=94$. The answer is: $94$

**Solution:** 



To solve this problem, we can start by setting $n = 1$ in the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. This gives us $f(f(f(1))) = 1$. Since $f(f(f(1))) = 1$, we can conclude that $f(1) = 1$.

Now, we can substitute $n = 1$ into the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2(1) + 1 = 3$.

Next, we can substitute $n = 2$ into the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to get $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2(3) + 1 = 7$.

Continuing this process, we can find that $f(8) = 15$, $f(16) = 31$, and so on. We can observe that $f(2^k) = 2^k - 1$ for all positive integers $k$.

Now, we can use this pattern to find $f(100)$. Since $100 = 2^2 \cdot 5^2$, we can write $100 = 2^2 \cdot 25$. We know that $f(2^k) = 2^k - 1$, so $f(2^2) = 3$ and $f(25) = 25 - 1 = 24$.

Using the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, we can find $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1 = 2(24) + 1 = 49$. Similarly, $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2(49) + 1 = 99$.

Therefore, $f(100) = 99$. The answer is: $99$

**Solution:** 



We can start by setting $n = 1$ in the second equation to get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. Since $f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = 1$, we have $f(1) = 1$. Substituting $f(1) = 1$ into the equation $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$, we get $f(2) = 2*1 + 1 = 3$.

Now, we can substitute $n = 2$ into the second equation to get $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2*3 + 1 = 7$.

Next, we substitute $n = 4$ into the second equation to get $f(8) = 2f(4) + 1 = 2*7 + 1 = 15$.

Continuing this process, we can find that $f(16) = 31$, $f(32) = 63$, and so on. We notice that $f(2^k) = 2^k - 1$ for all positive integers $k$.

Now, we can substitute $n = 100$ into the first equation. We notice that $100 = 2^6 + 2^2$. So, we can use the second equation to simplify $f(100)$ as follows:

$$f(100) = f(2^6 + 2^2) = f(f(f(2^6)) + f(2^2)) = f(f(2^6 - 1) + f(2^2)) = f(f(63) + f(4)) = f(63 + 7) = f(70).$$

We can continue this process to find that $f(70) = f(2*35) = 2f(35) + 1 = 2(f(2*17) + 1) + 1 = 2(2f(17) + 1 + 1) + 1 = 2(2(2f(8) + 1 + 1) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(2(2f(4) + 1 + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(2(2*7 + 1 + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(2(16) + 1) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(33) + 1) + 1 = 2(67) + 1 = 135$.

So, $f(100) = 135$. The answer is: $135$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"The function $f$ is defined on the set of integers and satisfies \[f(n)= \begin{cases}  n-3 & \mbox{if }n\ge 1000 \\  f(f(n+5)) & \mbox{if }n<1000. \end{cases}\]Find $f(84)$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Denote by (1) and (2) the two parts of the definition of $f$, respectively. If we begin to use the definition of $f$ to compute $f(84)$, we use (2) until the argument is at least $1000$: \[f(84) = f(f(89)) = f(f(f(94))) = \dots = f^N(1004)\](where $f^N$ denotes composing $f$ with itself $N$ times, for some $N$). The numbers $84, 89, 94, \dots, 1004$ form an arithmetic sequence with common difference $5$; since $1004 - 84 = 920 = 184 \cdot 5$, this sequence has $184 + 1 = 185$ terms, so $N = 185$.

At this point, (1) and (2) are both used: we compute \[\begin{aligned} f^N(1004) &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-1}(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-1}(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(1000) \\ &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(997) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1002) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(999) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1004). \end{aligned}\]Repeating this process, we see that \[f^N(1004) = f^{N-2}(1004) = f^{N-4}(1004) = \dots = f^3(1004).\](The pattern breaks down for $f^k(1004)$ when $k$ is small, so it is not true that $f^3(1004) = f(1004)$.) Now, we have \[f^3(1004) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^2(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^2(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(1000) \stackrel{(1)}{=} \boxed{997}.\] The answer is $\boxed{997}$

**Problem**
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we can start by substituting $n = 1$ into the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$ to get $f(f(f(1))) = 1$. Since $f(f(f(1))) = 1$, we have $f(f(1)) = 1$ or $f(1) = 1$.

Next, we substitute $n = 2$ into the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to get $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$. We can then substitute $f(2)$ using the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$ with $n = 1$ to get $f(f(1)) = 1$, so $f(1) = 1$. Therefore, $f(2) = f(f(1)) = 1$, and we have $f(4) = 2*1 + 1 = 3$.

We can continue this process to find $f(8)$, $f(16)$, and so on. We find that $f(8) = 15$, $f(16) = 29$, $f(32) = 55$, and so on. By observing the pattern, we can conjecture that $f(2^k) = 2^k - 1$ for all positive integers $k$.

Now, we want to find $f(100)$. We can express $100$ as $2^2 \cdot 5^2$. Since $f(2^k) = 2^k - 1$, we have $f(100) = f(2^2 \cdot 5^2) = f((2^2) \cdot (5^2)) = f(4 \cdot 25) = f(100)$.

By the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, we have $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$. Again by the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, we have $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$. Continuing this process, we find that $f(100) = 2(2(2(2f(5) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(2(2*1 + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(2*3 + 1) + 1) + 1 = 2(2*7 + 1) + 1 = 2*15 + 1 = 31$.

Therefore, $f(100) = 31$. The answer is: $31$

**Problem:** 
"The function $f(n)$ is defined on the positive integers such that $f(f(n)) = 2n$ and $f(4n + 1) = 4n + 3$ for all positive integers $n.$  Find $f(1000).$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Consider the expression $f(f(f(a))).$  Since $f(f(a)) = 2a,$ this is equal to $f(2a).$  But taking $n = f(a)$ in $f(f(n)) = 2n,$ we get
\[f(f(f(a))) = 2f(a).\]Hence,
\[f(2a) = 2f(a)\]for all positive integers $a.$

Then
\[f(1000) = 2f(500) = 4f(250) = 8f(125).\]Taking $n = 31$ in $f(4n + 1) = 4n + 3,$ we get
\[f(125) = 127,\]so $f(1000) = \boxed{1016}.$ The answer is $\boxed{1016}$

**Problem**
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


To solve this problem, we can start by applying the function $f$ to both sides of the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. This gives us $f(8n-7) = f(f(f(n)))$. But we know from the first condition that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, so we can substitute this in to get $f(8n-7) = 8n-7$.

Now, let's consider the second condition, $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. If we apply this to $f(8n-7)$, we get $f(8n-7) = 2f(4n-\frac{7}{2})+1$. But we know from the first condition that $f(8n-7) = 8n-7$, so we can substitute this in to get $8n-7 = 2f(4n-\frac{7}{2})+1$.

Solving this equation for $f(4n-\frac{7}{2})$ gives us $f(4n-\frac{7}{2}) = \frac{8n-8}{2} = 4n-4$.

Now, let's consider the second condition again, but this time with $n$ replaced by $\frac{n+3}{2}$. This gives us $f(2\cdot\frac{n+3}{2}) = 2f(\frac{n+3}{2})+1$, or $f(n+3) = 2f(\frac{n+3}{2})+1$.

If we substitute $n = 4$ into this equation, we get $f(7) = 2f(4)+1$. But we know from the first condition that $f(7) = 7$, so we can substitute this in to get $7 = 2f(4)+1$. Solving this equation for $f(4)$ gives us $f(4) = 3$.

Finally, let's substitute $n = 3$ into the equation $f(4n-\frac{7}{2}) = 4n-4$, which gives us $f(\frac{11}{2}) = 1$. But we know from the second condition that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, so if we substitute $n = \frac{11}{4}$ into this equation, we get $f(\frac{11}{2}) = 2f(\frac{11}{4})+1$. Since we know that $f(\frac{11}{2}) = 1$, we can substitute this in to get $1 = 2f(\frac{11}{4})+1$. Solving this equation for $f(\frac{11}{4})$ gives us $f(\frac{11}{4}) = 0$.

But we know from the second condition that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, so if we substitute $n = \frac{11}{8}$ into this equation, we get $f(\frac{11}{4}) = 2f(\frac{11}{8})+1$. Since we know that $f(\frac{11}{4}) = 0$, we can substitute this in to get $0 = 2f(\frac{11}{8})+1$. Solving this equation for $f(\frac{11}{8})$ gives us $f(\frac{11}{8}) = -\frac{1}{2}$. But this is a contradiction, because the function $f$ only takes natural number values.

Therefore, our initial assumption that $f(4n-\frac{7}{2}) = 4n-4$ must be incorrect. Let's try a different approach.

From the first condition, we have $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. If we apply the function $f$ again, we get $f(f(f(f(n))))=f(8n-7)$. But we know from the first condition that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, so we can substitute this in to get $f(f(8n-7))=8n-7$.

Now, let's consider the second condition, $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. If we apply this to $f(f(8n-7))$, we get $f(f(8n-7)) = 2f(f(4n-\frac{7}{2}))+1$. But we know from the first condition that $f(f(8n-7))=8n-7$, so we can substitute this in to get $8n-7 = 2f(f(4n-\frac{7}{2}))+1$.

Solving this equation for $f(f(4n-\frac{7}{2}))$ gives us $f(f(4n-\frac{7}{2})) = \frac{8n-8}{2} = 4n-4$.

Now, let's consider the second condition again, but this time with $n$ replaced by $\frac{n+3}{2}$. This gives us $f(2\cdot\frac{n+3}{2}) = 2f(\frac{n+3}{2})+1$, or $f(n+3) = 2f(\frac{n+3}{2})+1$.

If we substitute $n = 4$ into this equation, we get $f(7) = 2f(4)+1$. But we know from the first condition that $f(7) = 7$, so we can substitute this in to get $7 = 2f(4)+1$. Solving this equation for $f(4)$ gives us $f(4) = 3$.

Finally, let's substitute $n = 3$ into the equation $f(4n-\frac{7}{2}) = 4n-4$, which gives us $f(\frac{11}{2}) = 1$. But we know from the second condition that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, so if we substitute $n = \frac{11}{4}$ into this equation, we get $f(\frac{11}{2}) = 2f(\frac{11}{4})+1$. Since we know that $f(\frac{11}{2}) = 1$, we can substitute this in to get $1 = 2f(\frac{11}{4})+1$. Solving this equation for $f(\frac{11}{4})$ gives us $f(\frac{11}{4}) = 0$.

But we know from the second condition that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, so if we substitute $n = \frac{11}{8}$ into this equation, we get $f(\frac{11}{4}) = 2f(\frac{11}{8})+1$. Since we know that $f(\frac{11}{4}) = 0$, we can substitute this in to get $0 = 2f(\frac{11}{8})+1$. Solving this equation for $f(\frac{11}{8})$ gives us $f(\frac{11}{8}) = -\frac{1}{2}$.

Now, let's consider the second condition, $f

Let's think step by step:
Consider the expression $f(f(f(a))).$  Since $f(f(a)) = 2a,$ this is equal to $f(2a).$  But taking $n = f(a)$ in $f(f(n)) = 2n,$ we get

To solve this problem, we will first set up the function $f(n)$ using the given conditions. Then we will use this function to calculate $f(100)$.

The result is not an integer, which is not possible for a function from the natural numbers to the natural numbers. We must have made a mistake in our calculations. Let's go back and check our work.

Upon revisiting the problem, we realize that we misunderstood the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. This condition implies that $f$ is a function that applies itself three times to $n$ to get $8n-7$. This is not the same as $f(f(n))$ being a function of $n$. 

Let's reconsider the problem and try a different approach.

From the condition $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, we can express $f(n)$ as a function of $n$:
\[f(n) = \frac{f(2n) - 1}{2}.\]

Now, we can substitute $n = 2k$ into this expression to get:
\[f(2k) = \frac{f(4k) - 1}{2}.\]

Then, we can substitute this into the original condition $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to get:
\[f(4k) = 2f(2k) + 1 = 2\left(\frac{f(4k) - 1}{2}\right) + 1 = f(4k) - 1 + 1 = f(4k).\]

This implies that $f(4k) = f(4k)$ for all $k$, which is true but not very helpful. Let's try another approach.

From the condition $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, we can express $f(n)$ as a function of $n$:
\[f(n) = \frac{f(2n) - 1}{2}.\]

Now, we can substitute $n = \frac{k}{2}$ into this expression to get:
\[f\left(\frac{k}{2}\right) = \frac{f(k) - 1}{2}.\]

Then, we can substitute this into the original condition $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to get:
\[f(k) = 2f\left(\frac{k}{2}\right) + 1 = 2\left(\frac{f(k) - 1}{2}\right) + 1 = f(k) - 1 + 1 = f(k).\]
