**Example**

**Problem:** 
"For certain ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ of real numbers, the system of equations
\[\begin{aligned} ax+by&=1 \\ x^2 + y^2 &= 50  \end{aligned}\]has at least one solution, and each solution is an ordered pair $(x,y)\,$ of integers. How many such ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ are there?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The graph of $ax+by=1$ is a line, while the graph of $x^2+y^2=50$ is a circle centered at the origin. Therefore, $(a, b)$ satisfies the conditions if and only if the line and circle intersect at least once, and they intersect only at lattice points (points with integer coordinates).

Knowing this, it makes sense to look for lattice points on the circle whose equation is $x^2+y^2=50$. Testing cases, we find that there are twelve lattice points on the circle: $(\pm 1, \pm 7)$, $(\pm 7, \pm 1)$, and $(\pm 5, \pm 5)$ (where the two $\pm$ signs in each pair are independent of each other).

There are $\tbinom{12}{2} = 66$ pairs of these points, and each pair determines a line. However, the graph of $ax+by=1$ can never pass through the origin $(0, 0)$, since if $x=y=0$, then $ax+by=0 \neq 1$. Therefore, the six pairs which consist of diametrically opposed points are invalid, since the line through them passes through the origin. This corrects our count to $66 - 6 = 60$.

In addition, for each of the twelve points, there is a line tangent to the circle at that point, so that the only solution to the system is that one point. This brings the final total to $60 + 12 = \boxed{72}$. The answer is $\boxed{72}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


The first step to solve this problem is to rewrite the equation in a more manageable form. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be rewritten as $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=0.01m$. The solutions to the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=0$ are the points where the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ intersects the x-axis. This function has three "steps": it equals $\vert x-1 \vert -2$ when $\vert x-1 \vert > 2$, it equals $-( \vert x-1 \vert -2 )$ when $-2 \leq \vert x-1 \vert \leq 2$, and it equals $-(x-1) -2$ when $\vert x-1 \vert < -2$.

The graph of this function has three "steps" at $x = -1$, $x = 3$, and $x = 5$. The function equals $-1$ for $x < -1$, equals $1$ for $-1 \leq x \leq 3$, equals $-3$ for $3 < x < 5$, and equals $3$ for $x \geq 5$.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=0.01m$ therefore has four solutions when $0.01m = 1$, $0.01m = 3$, $0.01m = -1$, or $0.01m = -3$. This means $m$ can be $100$, $300$, $ -100$, or $-300$. However, $m$ must be a positive integer, so $m$ can only be $100$ or $300$. Therefore, there are $2$ possible values of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four solutions.
The answer is: $2$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many integers are solutions to the equation $$(x-2)^{(25-x^2)}=1?$$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
We need some basic facts from number theory: $a^0 = 1$ for any $a,$ $1^b = 1$ for any $b,$ and $(-1)^c = 1$ if $c$ is an even integer. Unless the base is a complex number (which is excluded since we are looking for integer solutions), there are no other ways to get an RHS of $1.$ Thus, either the exponent is zero $($giving the equation $25 - x^2 = 0),$ the base is $1$ $($giving $x -2 = 1),$ or the base is $-1$ and the exponent is even $($giving the simultaneous equations $x - 2 = -1$ and $25 - x^2 = 2n$ for some integer $n).$ Solving the first equation gives $x = \pm 5,$ and solving the second gives $x = 3.$ The third equation implies that $x = 1,$ in which case $25 - x^2 = 24$ is indeed even, so $x = 1$ is a valid solution. In all, there are $\boxed{4}$ integer solutions. The answer is $\boxed{4}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we first need to understand the structure of the equation. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions for $x$ when $\frac{m}{100}$ is an integer from 1 to 2. This is because the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, changes its sign at $x=1$ and $x=3$. Therefore, the equation has two solutions for $x$ in the interval $(-\infty,1)$, two solutions in the interval $(1,3)$, and no solutions in the intervals $(3,\infty)$. 

To find the values of $m$ that satisfy the condition, we can simply loop through the integers from 1 to 200 and count the number of distinct solutions for each value of $m$. If the number of solutions is 4, we add the corresponding value of $m$ to a list.

Here is the Python code to do this:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Eq, Abs, solveset, S

def count_solutions():
    x = symbols('x')
    m_values = []

    for m in range(1, 201):
        equation = Eq(Abs(Abs(x - 1) - 2), m / 100)
        solutions = solveset(equation, x, domain=S.Reals)
        num_solutions = len(solutions)
        
        if num_ solutions == 4:
            m_values.append(m)

    return m_values

result = count_solutions()
print(result)
```

## QUESTION 2 - 2

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let \[f(x) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
-x + 3 & \text{if } x \le 0, \\
2x - 5 & \text{if } x > 0.
\end{array}
\right.\]How many solutions does the equation $f(f(x)) = 4$ have?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
To solve the equation $f(f(x)) = 4,$ we first find the values $x$ such that $f(x) = 4.$

Either $f(x) = -x + 3$ (for $x \le 0$) or $f(x) = 2x - 5$ (for $x > 0$). If $-x + 3 = 4,$ then $x = -1.$ Note that this value satisfies $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = 4,$ then $x = 9/2.$ Note that this value satisfies $x > 0.$ Therefore, the solutions to $f(x) = 4$ are $x = -1$ and $x = 9/2.$

Next, we solve for the values $x$ such that $f(x) = -1.$ If $-x + 3 = -1,$ then $x = 4.$ This value does not satisfy $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = -1,$ then $x = 2.$ This value satisfies $x > 0.$

Finally, we solve for the values $x$ such that $f(x) = 9/2.$ If $-x + 3 = 9/2,$ then $x = -3/2.$ This value satisfies $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = 9/2,$ then $x = 19/4.$ This value satisfies $x > 0.$

Therefore, the equation $f(f(x)) = 4$ has the solutions $x = 2,$ $-3/2,$ and $19/4,$ for a total of $\boxed{3}$ solutions. The answer is $\boxed{3}$

**Solution:** 


We will now solve the problem step by step.

1. First, let's draw the graph of $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ and $y = \frac{m}{100}$ to get an idea of how many solutions there are.
2. We can see that the equation $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has four distinct solutions when $\frac{2}{100} < \frac{m}{100} < \frac{3}{100}$.
3. So we need to find how many positive integers $m$ satisfy this inequality.
4. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are $2 < m < 3$.
5. The only positive integer $m$ that satisfies this inequality is $m = 2$.

So the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions for $m = 2$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ is $1$. The answer is $\boxed{1}$.

Therefore, the equation $f(f(x)) = 4$ has the solutions $x = 2,$ $-3/2,$ and $19/4,$ for a total of $\boxed{3}$ solutions. The answer is $\boxed{3}$

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


This problem requires a deep understanding of absolute value functions and their graphs, as well as the ability to reason about the number of solutions of an equation based on its graphical representation.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, is equal to the value of the absolute value function at exactly four points.

The graph of the absolute value function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a series of V-shaped segments, with the top of each "V" at $y = \frac{m}{100}$.

For this equation to have four distinct solutions, the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must fall strictly between the second and third "V" of the graph, which corresponds to the interval $(1,3)$. Therefore, the value of $m$ must be in the interval $(100,300)$.

The only positive integer in this interval is $200$. Therefore, the only positive integer value of $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is $200$.

So, the answer is $1$.
```python

def count_solutions():

The only positive integer value of $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is $200$. So, there is $1$ such value. The answer is $\boxed{1}$.
