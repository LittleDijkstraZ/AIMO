**Problem:** 
"How many square units are in the area of the triangle whose vertices are the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the curve $y = (x-3)^2 (x+2)$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we need to find where this curve intersects the $x$ and $y$ axes.  If $y=0$, then $(x-3)^2(x+2)=0$, which has solutions of $x=3$ and $x=-2$.  If $x=0$, then $y=(-3)^2(2)=18$.  So, the curve has two $x$-intercepts and one $y$-intercept.  The length of the base along the $x$-axis is $3-(-2)=5$.  The height from this base is equal to the $y$-intercept, 18.  The area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 5\cdot 18=\boxed{45}$. The answer is $\boxed{45}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The given equation is a product of two equations, which is equal to zero. This means that either the first equation is zero or the second equation is zero.

The first equation is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. The square of a real number is always non-negative, so for the sum of two non-negative numbers to be zero, both numbers must be zero. This gives us two equations: $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

The second equation is $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. Similar to the first equation, this gives us two equations: $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

The solutions to the first set of equations form a square with side length 20 (since the difference of the absolute values of two numbers is 10, the numbers themselves must be 10 units apart on the number line), and the solutions to the second set of equations form a square with side length 16 (since the absolute values of two numbers are 8, the numbers themselves must be 8 units away from zero on the number line).

The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon that the solutions enclose. The area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares, which is $20^2 + 16^2 = 400 + 256 = 656$.
The answer is: 656

## QUESTION 3 - 1

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"An ellipse is defined parametrically by
\[(x,y) = \left( \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t}, \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t} \right).\]Then the equation of the ellipse can be written in the form
\[Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0,\]where $A,$ $B,$ $C,$ $D,$ $E,$ and $F$ are integers, and $\gcd(|A|,|B|,|C|,|D|,|E|,|F|) = 1.$  Find $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F|.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
In the equation $y = \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\cos t$ to get
\[\cos t = \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3}.\]In the equation $x = \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\sin t$ to get
\[\sin t = \frac{1}{2} x (2 - \cos t) + 1 = \frac{1}{2} x \left( 2 - \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right) + 1 = 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)}.\]Since $\cos^2 t + \sin^2 t = 1,$
\[\left( \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right)^2 + \left( 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)} \right)^2 = 1.\]Multiplying both sides by $(2(y + 3))^2$ and expanding, it will simplify to
\[81x^2 - 36xy + 16y^2 - 108x + 240y + 900 = 0.\]Therefore, $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F| = 81 + 36 + 16 + 108 + 240 + 900 = \boxed{1381}.$ The answer is $\boxed{1381}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied only when either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This means that the points that satisfy the equation must be on the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, $x - y = -10$, $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.
These lines form a square with side length 16.
The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256.
The answer is: $\boxed{256}$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Find the number of 10-tuples $(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{10})$ of real numbers such that
\[(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2 = \frac{1}{11}.\]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,
\begin{align*}
&[(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + \dots + 1^2 + 1^2)][(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2] \\
&\ge [(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + (x_2 - x_3) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10}]^2 = 1.
\end{align*}From the given condition, we have equality, so by the equality condition for Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[\frac{1 - x_1}{1} = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{1} = \frac{x_2 - x_3}{1} = \dots = \frac{x_9 - x_{10}}{1} = \frac{x_{10}}{1}.\]Let
\[d = 1 - x_1 = x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_3 = \dots = x_9 - x_{10} = x_{10}.\]Then
\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so
\[(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_{10}) = \left( \frac{10}{11}, \frac{9}{11}, \frac{8}{11}, \dots, \frac{1}{11} \right).\]In particular, there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. This equation is satisfied if either of the two factors is zero. 

The first factor is zero when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The second factor is zero when $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. 

The solutions to these equations are as follows:

1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ gives us the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.
2. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ gives us the lines $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.
3. $\vert x \vert = 8$ gives us the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.
4. $\vert y \vert = 8$ gives us the lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8),$ and $(-8, -8)$. The sides of the rectangle have lengths $16$ and $16$, so the area of the rectangle is $16 \times 16 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $256$.
The answer is: $256$.

Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Let $w$ be the width of each of the identical rectangles. Since $PQ=3w$, $RS=2x$ and $PQ=RS$ (because $PQRS$ is a rectangle), then $2x = 3w$, or $$w=\frac{2}{3}x.$$ Therefore, the area of each of the five identical rectangles is $$x\left(\frac{2}{3}x\right)=\frac{2}{3}x^2.$$ Since the area of $PQRS$ is 4000 and it is made up of five of these identical smaller rectangles, then $$5\left(\frac{2}{3}x^2\right)=4000$$ or $$\frac{10}{3}x^2 = 4000$$ or $x^2 = 1200$ or $x \approx 34.6$ which, when rounded off to the nearest integer, is $\boxed{35}.$ The answer is $\boxed{35}$

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


This problem is a mathematical problem that requires an analytical approach and not a programming one. However, if you still want to write a program to solve it, here's a possible approach:

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. These four equations can be solved to obtain the four vertices of the square: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$.

Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. These four equations can be solved to obtain the four vertices of the square: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The intersection of these two squares is a 4x4 square with side length 4, so its area is $4^2 = 16$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 16.

Here's a Python program that calculates the area of the convex polygon:

```python

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many square units are in the area of the triangle whose vertices are the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the curve $y = (x-3)^2 (x+2)$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we need to find where this curve intersects the $x$ and $y$ axes.  If $y=0$, then $(x-3)^2(x+2)=0$, which has solutions of $x=3$ and $x=-2$.  If $x=0$, then $y=(-3)^2(2)=18$.  So, the curve has two $x$-intercepts and one $y$-intercept.  The length of the base along the $x$-axis is $3-(-2)=5$.  The height from this base is equal to the $y$-intercept, 18.  The area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 5\cdot 18=\boxed{45}$. The answer is $\boxed{45}$

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The equation is satisfied if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This means that either $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The first two equations represent a square with side length 20 centered at the origin, and the last two equations represent a square with side length 16 centered at the origin.
The intersection of these squares is a square with side length 8 centered at the origin.
The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$.
So the area of the convex polygon is 64.
The answer is: 64

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many square units are in the area of the triangle whose vertices are the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the curve $y = (x-3)^2 (x+2)$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we need to find where this curve intersects the $x$ and $y$ axes.  If $y=0$, then $(x-3)^2(x+2)=0$, which has solutions of $x=3$ and $x=-2$.  If $x=0$, then $y=(-3)^2(2)=18$.  So, the curve has two $x$-intercepts and one $y$-intercept.  The length of the base along the $x$-axis is $3-(-2)=5$.  The height from this base is equal to the $y$-intercept, 18.  The area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 5\cdot 18=\boxed{45}$. The answer is $\boxed{45}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

    eq2 = ((absolute(x) - 8)**2 + (absolute(y) - 8)**2)

    # The points satisfy either eq1 = 0 or eq2 = 0
    # So we need to find the intersections of the curves defined by eq1 = 0 and eq2 = 0

    # Solve eq1 = 0
    solutions_eq1 = solve(eq1, (x, y))

    # The solutions of the system are the intersection of the solutions of eq1 = 0 and eq2 = 0
    solutions = set(solutions_eq1).intersection(set(solutions_eq2))

    # The area of the polygon is the sum of the areas of the triangles formed by each pair of points
    # Since the points are symmetric with respect to the x and y axes, we can just consider the first quadrant
    # and then multiply by 4

It seems like we have an error in our code. We are trying to import the absolute function from Sympy but it seems we have an error in our environment or setup. Let's try to correct it and run the code again.

    eq2 = ((Abs(x) - 8)**2 + (Abs(y) - 8)**2)

    # The points satisfy either eq1 = 0 or eq2 = 0
    # So we need to find the intersections of the curves defined by eq1 = 0 and eq2 = 0

It seems like we are still having an issue with our code. The error is saying it cannot solve the equation with a piecewise function. Let's try a different approach to solve this problem.

The given equation is a bit complex and it's hard to directly solve it. But we can simplify the problem a bit. The equation is satisfied by the points on the x and y axes that are at a distance of 10 units from the origin. This means the points are at (8, 0), (0, 8), (-8, 0), and (0, -8). These points form a square with side length of 16 units. The area of the square is side length squared, so it's $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the polygon is 256 square units. The answer is $\boxed{256}$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Find the number of 10-tuples $(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{10})$ of real numbers such that
\[(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2 = \frac{1}{11}.\]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,
\begin{align*}
&[(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + \dots + 1^2 + 1^2)][(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2] \\
&\ge [(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + (x_2 - x_3) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10}]^2 = 1.
\end{align*}From the given condition, we have equality, so by the equality condition for Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[\frac{1 - x_1}{1} = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{1} = \frac{x_2 - x_3}{1} = \dots = \frac{x_9 - x_{10}}{1} = \frac{x_{10}}{1}.\]Let
\[d = 1 - x_1 = x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_3 = \dots = x_9 - x_{10} = x_{10}.\]Then
\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so
\[(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_{10}) = \left( \frac{10}{11}, \frac{9}{11}, \frac{8}{11}, \dots, \frac{1}{11} \right).\]In particular, there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So, the given equation is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which is the equation of a square with side length 20 centered at the origin.

The equation $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which is also the equation of a square with side length 20 centered at the origin.

The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x \vert = 8$, which is the equation of a square with side length 16 centered at the origin.

The equation $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert y \vert = 8$, which is the equation of a square with side length 16 centered at the origin.

The intersection of these four squares is the square with side length 16 centered at the origin. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256.
