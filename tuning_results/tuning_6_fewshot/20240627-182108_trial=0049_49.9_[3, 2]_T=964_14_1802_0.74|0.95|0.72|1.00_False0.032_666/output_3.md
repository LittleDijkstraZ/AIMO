**Problem:** 
"Let $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_ 2= (-16,2).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that
\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as
\[\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1.\]Find $h + k + a + b.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Find the number of 10-tuples $(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{10})$ of real numbers such that
\[(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2 = \frac{1}{11}.\]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,
\begin{align*}
&[(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + \dots + 1^2 + 1^2)][(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2] \\
&\ge [(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + (x_2 - x_3) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10}]^2 = 1.
\end{align*}From the given condition, we have equality, so by the equality condition for Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[\frac{1 - x_1}{1} = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{1} = \frac{x_2 - x_3}{1} = \dots = \frac{x_9 - x_{10}}{1} = \frac{x_{10}}{1}.\]Let
\[d = 1 - x_1 = x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_3 = \dots = x_9 - x_{10} = x_{10}.\]Then
\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so
\[(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_{10}) = \left( \frac{10}{11}, \frac{9}{11}, \frac{8}{11}, \dots, \frac{1}{11} \right).\]In particular, there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.

The first expression is zero when $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. These equations simplify to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two lines that pass through the origin and have slopes $+1$ and $-1$. The region enclosed by these lines is a square with side length 20.

The second expression is zero when $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. These equations simplify to $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two lines that pass through the origin and have slopes $+1$ and $-1$. The region enclosed by these lines is a square with side length 16.

The intersection of the two regions is the square with side length 8, which is the smaller square. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of the larger square minus the area of the smaller square.

The area of a square is the square of the length of its side. Therefore, the area of the larger square is $20^2 = 400$, and the area of the smaller square is $8^2 = 64$. So the area of the convex polygon is $400 - 64 = 336$.

**Solution:** 



First, we need to understand the problem. The equation given is a product of two expressions squared, which means that either of the expressions must be zero for the entire equation to be zero. This gives us four conditions to consider:

1. $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x - y| - 10 = 0$.
2. $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x| - 8 = 0$.
3. $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ and $|y| - 8 = 0$.
4. $|x - y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x| - 8 = 0$.
5. $|x - y| - 10 = 0$ and $|y| - 8 = 0$.
6. $|x| - 8 = 0$ and $|y| - 8 = 0$.

For each condition, we can solve the absolute value equations to find the possible values of $x$ and $y$. Then, we can plot these points on a coordinate plane and connect them to form the polygon.

After plotting the points and connecting them, we find that the polygon is a square with side length 16. The area of a square is given by the square of the side length, so the area of the polygon is $16^2 = 256$.

```python

def square_area():
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

area = square_area()
print(area)

The area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$
