**Problem:** 
"How many distinct solutions are there to the equation $|x-7| = |x+1|$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
If $|x-7| = |x+1|$, then either $x-7 = x+1$ or $x-7 = -(x+1)$.  Simplifying $x-7=x+1$ gives $0=8$, which has no solutions, so no values of $x$ satisfy $x-7 = x+1$.  If $x-7 = -(x+1)$, then $x-7 = -x-1$, so $2x = 6$, which gives $x=3$.  So, there is $\boxed{1}$ solution.

Challenge: See if you can find a quick solution to this problem by simply thinking about the graphs of $y=|x-7|$ and $y=|x+1|$. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



To solve this problem, we need to find the value of $m$ for which the equation $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. 

First, let's analyze the equation $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$. This equation is equivalent to the following two equations: $|x-1| - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $|x-1| - 2 = -\frac{m}{100}$. 

For each of these equations, we can solve for $|x-1|$ and then for $x$. 

For $|x-1| - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$, we have $|x-1| = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which gives us two equations: $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x-1 = -(2 + \frac{m}{100})$. Solving these equations gives us $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$, respectively.

For $|x-1| - 2 = -\frac{m}{100}$, we have $|x-1| = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which gives us two equations: $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x-1 = -(2 - \frac{m}{100})$. Solving these equations gives us $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$, respectively.

So, the four distinct solutions are $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$, $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$, and $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

For these four solutions to be distinct, we need $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 + \frac{m}{100}$, $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 - \frac{m}{100}$, $3 - \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 + \frac{m}{100}$, and $3 - \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Simplifying these inequalities gives us $m \neq 0$, $m \neq 100$, and $m \neq 200$.

Therefore, the only possible value of $m$ is $m = 100$.

To confirm this, we can substitute $m = 100$ back into the original equation and check if it has 4 distinct solutions. The equation becomes $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{100}{100}$, which simplifies to $| |x-1| - 2 | = 1$. This equation has 4 distinct solutions: $x = 3$, $x = 3 - \frac{2}{3}$, $x = -1 + \frac{2}{3}$, and $x = -1$.

So, the value of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is $m = 100$. The answer is: $100$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many solutions does the equation \[\frac{(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)\dotsm(x-100)}{(x-1^2)(x-2^2)(x-3^2)\dotsm(x-100^2)} = 0\]have for $x$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Any solution to this equation must make the numerator of the left-hand side zero, while keeping the denominator non-zero. The numerator is zero when $x$ is one of the numbers $1, 2, 3, \dots, 100.$ However, for any value in this list that is a perfect square, the denominator will also be zero, so that value of $x$ will not be a root. Therefore, we want to find the number of integers in the list $1, 2, \dots, 100$ which are not perfect squares. The perfect squares in the list are $1^2, 2^2, \dots, 10^2,$ so there are $10$ perfect squares, and \[100 - 10 = \boxed{90}\]integers which are not perfect squares. The answer is $\boxed{90}$
