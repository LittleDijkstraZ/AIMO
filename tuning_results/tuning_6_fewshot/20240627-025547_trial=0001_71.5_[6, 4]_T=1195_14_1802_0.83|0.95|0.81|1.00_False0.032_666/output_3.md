**Example**

**Problem:** 
"An ellipse is defined parametrically by
\[(x,y) = \left( \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t}, \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t} \right).\]Then the equation of the ellipse can be written in the form
\[Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0,\]where $A,$ $B,$ $C,$ $D,$ $E,$ and $F$ are integers, and $\gcd(|A|,|B|,|C|,|D|,|E|,|F|) = 1.$  Find $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F|.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
In the equation $y = \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\cos t$ to get
\[\cos t = \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3}.\]In the equation $x = \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\sin t$ to get
\[\sin t = \frac{1}{2} x (2 - \cos t) + 1 = \frac{1}{2} x \left( 2 - \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right) + 1 = 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)}.\]Since $\cos^2 t + \sin^2 t = 1,$
\[\left( \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right)^2 + \left( 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)} \right)^2 = 1.\]Multiplying both sides by $(2(y + 3))^2$ and expanding, it will simplify to
\[81x^2 - 36xy + 16y^2 - 108x + 240y + 900 = 0.\]Therefore, $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F| = 81 + 36 + 16 + 108 + 240 + 900 = \boxed{1381}.$ The answer is $\boxed{1381}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ implies that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the four lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So we get the four lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$ form a square with side length $20$. The lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$ form a square with side length $16$.

The area of the polygon formed by the intersection of these squares is the area of the smaller square, which is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $256$.

    side_length_square1 = 20
    side_length_square2 = 16
    area_square1 = side_length_square1 ** 2
    area_square2 = side_length_square2 ** 2

The area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is $\boxed{256}$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $f(x,y) = ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied only when either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. These conditions translate to $x + y = \pm 10$, $x - y = \pm 10$, $x = \pm 8$, or $y = \pm 8$. These lines divide the plane into 16 regions.

Now let's plot these lines on the coordinate plane:
- $x + y = \pm 10$ are two parallel lines with slope $-1$, passing through $(0,10)$ and $(0,-10)$.
- $x - y = \pm 10$ are two parallel lines with slope $1$, passing through $(10,0)$ and $(-10,0)$.
- $x = \pm 8$ are two vertical lines at $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.
- $y = \pm 8$ are two horizontal lines at $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

These lines divide the coordinate plane into 16 regions, and the convex polygon is formed by the intersection of these regions. To find the area of this polygon, we can simply calculate the area of the rectangle formed by the intersections of the lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$, and subtract the areas of the four right triangles formed by the intersections of the lines $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$ with the rectangle.

The rectangle has side lengths 16 (from $-8$ to $8$ in both $x$ and $y$) and the four right triangles each have a base and height of 10 (from the intersections of $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$ with the lines $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$), so their combined area is $4 \times \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10 = 200$. The area of the rectangle is $16 \times 16 = 256$, so the area of the polygon is $256 - 200 = 56$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $56$.
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def calculate_area():
    # Calculate the side length of the rectangle
    side_length = 16

    # Calculate the area of the rectangle
    rectangle_area = side_length ** 2

    # Calculate the area of the four right triangles
    triangle_area = 4 * (0.5 * 10 * 10)

    # Calculate the area of the convex polygon
    polygon_area = rectangle_area - triangle_area

    return polygon_area

result = calculate_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 56.0

The area of the convex polygon is $56$. The answer is $\boxed{56}$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_ 2= (-16,2).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that
\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as
\[\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1.\]Find $h + k + a + b.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero, which means either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. Let's analyze these two cases separately.

1. If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = \pm 10$. This gives us two lines: $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.

2. If $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x - y = \pm 10$. This gives us two more lines: $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.

3. If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$, which implies $x = \pm 8$. This gives us two vertical lines: $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.

4. If $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $y = \pm 8$. This gives us two horizontal lines: $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

The intersection of these lines forms a rectangle with side lengths 16 and 20. The area of this rectangle is $16 \times 20 = 320$. So the area of the convex polygon is 320.

    # Side lengths of the rectangle
    length = 20
    width = 16

    # Calculate the area of the rectangle
    area = length * width

**Solution:** 


This problem can be solved by noting that the expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This simplifies to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The solutions are given by the intersections of these lines and the absolute value functions can be replaced with piecewise linear functions.
After plotting the lines and identifying the vertices of the polygon, we can calculate the area using basic geometry.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:


The problem statement asks us to find the area of a convex polygon formed by the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the given equation. The equation is:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$

The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the equation is satisfied if either:

1. $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$, or
2. $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

For the first case, we have:
$$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0.$$
This is only possible if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, which are the diagonals of a rectangle.

For the second case, we have:
$$(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0.$$
This is only possible if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$, which are the sides of the rectangle.

Therefore, the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the given equation form a rectangle with vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$. The length of each side of the rectangle is 16, so the area of the rectangle is $16 \times 16 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The product of two numbers is zero if and only if both numbers are zero. Therefore, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The second equation is equivalent to $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This describes a square with side length $16$ and vertices at $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,-8)$, and $(-8,8)$.

The first equation is equivalent to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This describes a pair of orthogonal lines, $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, and their symmetric counterparts with respect to the origin.

The intersection of the square and the lines is the convex polygon we are interested in. By plotting these on a graph, we find that this polygon is actually a square with side length $8$.

The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $64$.

The python code to calculate the area of the polygon is simple:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    # Define the side length of the square
    side_length = 8

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The expression $A = ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if either $ ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$ or $ ((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

The first equation is satisfied if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means that the points $(x, y)$ are on a square with side length of 20.

The second equation is satisfied if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means that the points $(x, y)$ are on a square with side length of 16.

Therefore, the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equation are those that lie on the union of these two squares. The area of the convex polygon formed by these points is the sum of the areas of these two squares.

Using the formula for the area of a square ($side^2$), the area of the first square is $20^2 = 400$, and the area of the second square is $16^2 = 256$. The sum of these areas is the area of the convex polygon formed by the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equation: $400 + 256 = 656$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 656.

To solve this problem in Python, we can simply calculate the sum of the areas of the two squares:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def calculate_area():
    side1 = 20
    side2 = 16
    area1 = side1**2
    area2 = side2**2
    total_area = area1 + area2
    return total_area

result = calculate_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 656

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
656
```
The area of the convex polygon is 656. The answer is: $656$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, we need to understand the given equation. The equation is equal to zero, which means that either the first part of the equation is zero, or the second part of the equation is zero. This gives us two separate systems of equations to solve.

2. For the first system of equations, we have $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x-y| - 10 = 0$. Solving these equations gives us $x+y = \pm 10$ and $x-y = \pm 10$. These four lines form a square with side length 20.

3. For the second system of equations, we have $|x| - 8 = 0$ and $|y| - 8 = 0$. Solving these equations gives us $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. These four lines form a square with side length 16.

4. To find the area of the convex polygon, we need to find the area of the square formed by the first system of equations and add it to the area of the square formed by the second system of equations.

5. The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of the first square is $20^2 = 400$ and the area of the second square is $16^2 = 256$.

6. Adding these two areas together gives us the total area of the convex polygon: $400 + 256 = 656$.

The area of the convex polygon is 656. The answer is: $656$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, which means either of the terms must be zero. This gives us two sets of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first set of equations, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, and $(-10, 0)$.

For the second set of equations, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The polygon formed by these vertices is a square with side length 10. Therefore, the area of the polygon is $10^2 = 100$.

The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We are asked to find the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points that satisfy the equation. 

2. The equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.

3. Let's consider each expression separately:

   - For the first expression, $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x - y| - 10 = 0$. This implies $|x + y| = 10$ or $|x - y| = 10$. The absolute value equations can be split into two separate equations: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, or $x - y = -10$. These equations represent the sides of a square with side length 10.
   
   - For the second expression, $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$. This implies $|x| = 8$ or $|y| = 8$. The absolute value equations can be split into two separate equations: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, or $y = -8$. These equations represent the sides of a square with side length 8.

4. The intersection of these squares forms a larger square with side length 10 and a smaller square with side length 8. The convex polygon we are looking for is the area enclosed by the larger square minus the area enclosed by the smaller square.

5. The area of a square is given by side length squared. So, the area of the larger square is $10^2 = 100$ and the area of the smaller square is $8^2 = 64$.

6. The area of the convex polygon is the difference of these two areas: $100 - 64 = 36$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $36$. The answer is: $36$
