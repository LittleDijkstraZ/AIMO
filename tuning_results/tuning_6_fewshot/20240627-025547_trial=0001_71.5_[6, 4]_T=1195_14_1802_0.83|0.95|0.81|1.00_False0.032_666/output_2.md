Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Step 1: Understand the problem

The problem asks us to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

Step 2: Recognize the equation as a piecewise function

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is a piecewise function, and its graph is made up of four line segments. The number of solutions of the equation is equal to the number of times the graph of $\frac{m}{100}$ intersects the graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$.

Step 3: Analyze the graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$

The graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a "V" shape with its lowest point at $(1, 2)$ and its two arms extending upwards.

Step 4: Find the values of $m$ for which the graph of $\frac{m}{100}$ intersects the graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ exactly 4 times.

We can see that the graph of $\frac{m}{100}$ intersects the graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ exactly 4 times when $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 1$. This implies that $0 < m < 100$. The only positive integer in this range is $m = 1$.

So, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

The answer is: $1$

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is given as $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, and we want to find out for how many positive integers $m$ this equation has $4$ distinct solutions.

The number of solutions of the equation depends on the value of $\frac{m}{100}$, because the absolute value function splits into two cases based on the value inside the absolute value. Specifically, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have four distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is in the interval $(0,2)$. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a "V" shape with the vertex at $(1,2)$. So we need to find the number of multiples of $1/100$ in the interval $(0,2)$.

To find the number of multiples of $1/100$ in the interval $(0,2)$, we can multiply the endpoints of the interval by $100$:
- $0 \times 100 = 0$
- $2 \times 100 = 200$

Now we need to find the number of integers in the interval $(0,200)$. This is simply $200 - 0 - 1 = 199$.

So there are 199 positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

Now let's write the entire script to accomplish this:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def count_multiples():
    lower_bound = 0 * 100
    upper_bound = 2 * 100
    number_of_multiples = upper_bound - lower_bound - 1
    return number_of_multiples

result = count_multiples()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 199

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
199
```
The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $199$. However, the question asks for a positive integer answer. 

Therefore, the final numerical answer is $199$. The answer is: $199$

The number of distinct solutions of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $4$ if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $1$. Thus, $m$ should be $100$. So the answer is $\boxed{1}$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many integers are solutions to the equation $$(x-2)^{(25-x^2)}=1?$$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
We need some basic facts from number theory: $a^0 = 1$ for any $a,$ $1^b = 1$ for any $b,$ and $(-1)^c = 1$ if $c$ is an even integer. Unless the base is a complex number (which is excluded since we are looking for integer solutions), there are no other ways to get an RHS of $1.$ Thus, either the exponent is zero $($giving the equation $25 - x^2 = 0),$ the base is $1$ $($giving $x -2 = 1),$ or the base is $-1$ and the exponent is even $($giving the simultaneous equations $x - 2 = -1$ and $25 - x^2 = 2n$ for some integer $n).$ Solving the first equation gives $x = \pm 5,$ and solving the second gives $x = 3.$ The third equation implies that $x = 1,$ in which case $25 - x^2 = 24$ is indeed even, so $x = 1$ is a valid solution. In all, there are $\boxed{4}$ integer solutions. The answer is $\boxed{4}$

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


This problem involves understanding the absolute value function and how to count the number of distinct solutions.
The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions.
We know that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is equivalent to two cases:
1. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ or
2. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.

Let's solve these two cases separately:

1. For the first case, $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two sub-cases:
   a. $x - 1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$, and
   b. $-(x - 1) = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

2. For the second case, $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two sub-cases:
   a. $x - 1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, and
   b. $-(x - 1) = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

For the four solutions to be distinct, we need the following conditions to hold:
1. $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 + \frac{m}{100}$,
2. $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq 3 - \frac{m}{100}$,
3. $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 - \frac{m}{100}$,
4. $-1 + \frac{m}{100} \neq 3 - \frac{m}{100}$,
5. $-1 + \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Simplifying these conditions, we get:
1. $2 \neq 0$, which is true,
2. $2\frac{m}{100} \neq 0$, which implies $m \neq 0$,
3. $4 \neq \frac{m}{100}$, which implies $400 \neq m$,
4. $-2 \neq 4$, which is true,
5. $-2 \neq -2$, which is not true.

From these conditions, we can see that $m$ must be a positive integer such that $0 < m < 400$. Therefore, the number of such positive integers $m$ is $399$.
The answer is $\boxed{399}$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let \[f(x) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
-x + 3 & \text{if } x \le 0, \\
2x - 5 & \text{if } x > 0.
\end{array}
\right.\]How many solutions does the equation $f(f(x)) = 4$ have?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
To solve the equation $f(f(x)) = 4,$ we first find the values $x$ such that $f(x) = 4.$

Either $f(x) = -x + 3$ (for $x \le 0$) or $f(x) = 2x - 5$ (for $x > 0$). If $-x + 3 = 4,$ then $x = -1.$ Note that this value satisfies $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = 4,$ then $x = 9/2.$ Note that this value satisfies $x > 0.$ Therefore, the solutions to $f(x) = 4$ are $x = -1$ and $x = 9/2.$

Next, we solve for the values $x$ such that $f(x) = -1.$ If $-x + 3 = -1,$ then $x = 4.$ This value does not satisfy $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = -1,$ then $x = 2.$ This value satisfies $x > 0.$

Finally, we solve for the values $x$ such that $f(x) = 9/2.$ If $-x + 3 = 9/2,$ then $x = -3/2.$ This value satisfies $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = 9/2,$ then $x = 19/4.$ This value satisfies $x > 0.$

Therefore, the equation $f(f(x)) = 4$ has the solutions $x = 2,$ $-3/2,$ and $19/4,$ for a total of $\boxed{3}$ solutions. The answer is $\boxed{3}$

**Solution:** 



To solve this problem, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions.

Let's first understand the structure of the equation. The expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a double absolute value function. It can take on any value greater than or equal to zero and less than or equal to 2. Therefore, the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must also be in the interval $[0, 2]$. This implies that $0 \leq \frac{m}{100} \leq 2$, which simplifies to $0 \leq m \leq 200$.

Now, we know that for a given $m$, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is a value that the double absolute value function can take on in the interval $(0, 2)$. This occurs exactly when $m$ is in the interval $(0, 200)$.

However, we are asked to find the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy this condition. The number of positive integers in the interval $(0, 200)$ is simply 199.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions is 199. The answer is $\boxed{199}$.

The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has $4$ distinct solutions.

To solve this problem, we can start by considering the possible forms of the equation. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. 

We can solve for $m$ by multiplying both sides of the equation by $100$, resulting in $m = 200$. Therefore, the only positive integer value of $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is $m = 200$. 

So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is $1$.
The answer is: $1$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"For certain ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ of real numbers, the system of equations
\[\begin{aligned} ax+by&=1 \\ x^2 + y^2 &= 50  \end{aligned}\]has at least one solution, and each solution is an ordered pair $(x,y)\,$ of integers. How many such ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ are there?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The graph of $ax+by=1$ is a line, while the graph of $x^2+y^2=50$ is a circle centered at the origin. Therefore, $(a, b)$ satisfies the conditions if and only if the line and circle intersect at least once, and they intersect only at lattice points (points with integer coordinates).

Knowing this, it makes sense to look for lattice points on the circle whose equation is $x^2+y^2=50$. Testing cases, we find that there are twelve lattice points on the circle: $(\pm 1, \pm 7)$, $(\pm 7, \pm 1)$, and $(\pm 5, \pm 5)$ (where the two $\pm$ signs in each pair are independent of each other).

There are $\tbinom{12}{2} = 66$ pairs of these points, and each pair determines a line. However, the graph of $ax+by=1$ can never pass through the origin $(0, 0)$, since if $x=y=0$, then $ax+by=0 \neq 1$. Therefore, the six pairs which consist of diametrically opposed points are invalid, since the line through them passes through the origin. This corrects our count to $66 - 6 = 60$.

In addition, for each of the twelve points, there is a line tangent to the circle at that point, so that the only solution to the system is that one point. This brings the final total to $60 + 12 = \boxed{72}$. The answer is $\boxed{72}$

**Solution:** 


The first step to solve this problem is to rewrite the equation in a more manageable form. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be rewritten as $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=0.01m$. The solutions to the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=0$ are the points where the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ intersects the x-axis. This function has three "steps": it equals $\vert x-1 \vert -2$ when $\vert x-1 \vert > 2$, it equals $-( \vert x-1 \vert -2 )$ when $-2 \leq \vert x-1 \vert \leq 2$, and it equals $-(x-1) -2$ when $\vert x-1 \vert < -2$.

The graph of this function has three "steps": a constant value of $-2$ for $x < -1$, a linear function with a slope of $1$ for $-1 \leq x \leq 3$, and a constant value of $2$ for $x > 3$. Therefore, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=0.01m$ has four distinct solutions when $0.01m$ is equal to the height of the step, which is $2$. So $m$ must equal $200$.

So the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions is $200$. The answer is $\boxed{200}$.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, we need to understand the function $f(x) = | |x - 1| - 2 |$. This function has a graph which is V-shaped, with the point of each V at $x = 1 \pm 2$. Thus, the function takes value of 0 for $1 - 2 \le x \le 1 + 2$, or $ -1 \le x \le 3$, and takes value of 2 for $x < -1$ and $x > 3$.

2. Now we want to solve the equation $f(x) = \frac{m}{100}$ for four distinct solutions. Since $0 \le \frac{m}{100} \le 2$, we know that $0 < m \le 200$.

3. The equation $f(x) = \frac{m}{100}$ has four solutions exactly when $\frac{m}{100}$ falls into the range $(0, 2)$. This is because the function $f(x)$ is 0 at three points and 2 at another three points, and $\frac{m}{100}$ must be able to reach these values.

4. Therefore, the number of such positive integers $m$ is the number of integers from 1 to 200 that is less than 200 and greater than 0. This is simply 200.

5. But we are asked for the number of such $m$ that makes the equation have exactly four solutions. Since $\frac{m}{100}$ must be in the range $(0, 2)$, $m$ must be in the range $(0 \times 100, 2 \times 100)$, or $(0, 200)$. 

6. The positive integers in this range are exactly the integers from 1 to 199. So the number of such $m$ is 199.

The entire Python code for solving this problem would be:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def count_m():
    # Define the range of m
    lower_bound = 1
    upper_bound = 199

    # Count the number of integers in the range
    count = upper_bound - lower_bound + 1

    return count

result = count_m()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 199

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
199
```
The number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation has exactly four solutions is 199. Thus, the final answer is 199. The answer is $\boxed{199}$.
