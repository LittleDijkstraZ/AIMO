Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, let's convert the absolute value equation into a piecewise function:

If $\vert x - 1 \vert - 2 \geq 0$, then $\vert \vert x - 1 \vert - 2 \vert = \vert x - 1 \vert - 2$.
If $\vert x - 1 \vert - 2 < 0$, then $\vert \vert x - 1 \vert - 2 \vert = -( \vert x - 1 \vert - 2) = 2 - \vert x - 1 \vert$.

This means we have two cases to solve:

1) $\vert x - 1 \vert - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$,
2) $2 - \vert x - 1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$.

Now, let's solve these two cases separately.

Case 1: $\vert x - 1 \vert - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$.
Solving this gives $\vert x - 1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$,
and then $x - 1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x - 1 = -2 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Case 2: $2 - \vert x - 1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$.
Solving this gives $\vert x - 1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$,
and then $x - 1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ or $x - 1 = -2 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Now, we need to find out for which values of $m$ these equations have $4$ distinct solutions.

After solving these equations, we will get $8$ equations in total. For each equation, we can calculate the number of distinct solutions. If the number of distinct solutions for that equation is $4$, then we count this $m$ as a valid value.

After trying all possible values of $m$ from $1$ to $100$, we count the valid values. The final result is the total number of valid values for $m$.

Here's the Python code to solve the problem:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solve

def number_of_solutions(m):
    x = symbols('x')
    # Case 1
    equation1 = solve(abs(x - 1) - 2 - m/100, x)
    # Case 2
    equation2 = solve(2 - abs(x - 1) - m/100, x)
    # Combine all solutions
    equations = equation1 + equation2
    # Remove duplicates
    equations = list(set(equations))
    # Count the number of distinct solutions
    return len(equations)

count = 0
for m in range(1, 101):
    if number_of_solutions(m) == 4:
        count += 1
print(count)
```

CODE RESULTS 100

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
100
```

The number of such $m$ is $100$. The answer is: $100$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



We are given an equation with absolute value and a fraction, and we need to find for how many positive integers $m$ the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

First, we know that $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be rewritten as $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=0.01m$. 

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=0.01m$ can have four distinct solutions if $0.01m=2$, $0.01m=1$, or $0.01m=0$.

Now, let's solve these equations:

1. If $0.01m=2$, then $m=\frac{2}{0.01}=200$.
2. If $0.01m=1$, then $m=\frac{1}{0.01}=100$.
3. If $0.01m=0$, then $m=\frac{0}{0.01}=0$.

However, we are only interested in positive integers $m$, so we discard $m=0$. 

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $2$.

The answer is $2$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We have the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ and it should have 4 distinct solutions.
2. First, we need to understand that the right-hand side, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be positive because the absolute value of a quantity cannot be negative. Therefore, $m$ must be a positive integer.
3. For $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ to be equal to a positive number, it must be greater than or equal to 0. Thus, $\vert x-1 \vert -2 \geq 0$, which implies $\vert x-1 \vert \geq 2$. This gives us two cases: $x-1 \geq 2$ or $x-1 \leq -2$.
4. For $x-1 \geq 2$, we get $x \geq 3$. And for $x-1 \leq -2$, we get $x \leq -1$.
5. So the solution set for $x$ is $x \leq -1$ or $x \geq 3$. Now we need to find the values of $m$ that make the equation have 4 distinct solutions.
6. To do this, we can use Python and the sympy library to solve the equation numerically for each possible value of $m$ and count the number of distinct solutions.
7. After trying all possible values of $m$ from 1 to 100, we find that for $m=20$, the equation has 4 distinct solutions.

Now let's write the Python code to find the value of $m$:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Abs, solve

def find_m():
    x, m = symbols('x m')
    equation = Abs(Abs(x - 1) - 2) - m / 100
    solutions = []

    for i in range(1, 101):
        equation_i = equation.subs(m, i)
        solutions_i = solve(equation_i, x)
        # Count the number of distinct solutions
        if len(set(solutions_i)) == 4:
            return i

result = find_m()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 1

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
1
```
However, we have made a mistake in our approach. We have misunderstood the problem. We were looking for the value of $m$ that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions, not for the value of $m$ that makes the equation have exactly 4 solutions.

Let's correct our approach:

1. We have the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ and it should have 4 distinct solutions.
2. If we set $\frac{m}{100}$ to be equal to the value of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ when it has 4 distinct solutions, we can find the value of $m$.
3. From the graph of $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, we can see that $y$ is equal to $\frac{3}{2}$ when it has 4 distinct solutions.
4. Therefore, we have $\frac{m}{100} = \frac{3}{2}$, and solving for $m$ gives $m = 150$.

So the value of $m$ that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions is 150. The numerical answer is 150. The answer is: $150$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. Find the four solutions for a particular $m$ value.
2. Write a sympy script to test the number of distinct solutions for different $m$ values.

        solutions = solve(equation, x)

        if len(set(solutions)) == 4:

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We are given the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ and asked to find for how many positive integers $m$ it has exactly 4 distinct solutions.

2. In order to solve this equation, we need to consider the number of times the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ equals $\frac{m}{100}$. The function $f(x)$ will have 4 distinct solutions if it equals $\frac{m}{100}$ twice (since the absolute value function is symmetric and thus, it will intersect the line $y = \frac{m}{100}$ twice if the absolute value of the maximum and minimum of the function is greater than $\frac{m}{100}$).

3. The function $f(x)$ takes its maximum value at $x=3$ and minimum value at $x=-1$. Therefore, for $f(x)$ to intersect the line $y = \frac{m}{100}$ twice, the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must lie in the interval $(0, 3)$. Thus, $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 3$, which simplifies to $0 < m < 300$.

4. Therefore, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ in the interval $(0, 300)$. This is simply the number of positive integers from 1 to 299, which can be found by subtracting the smallest integer from the largest and adding 1. So the number of positive integers $m$ is $299 - 1 + 1 = 299$.

5. However, we need to find the number of values of $m$ for which $f(x)$ intersects the line $y = \frac{m}{100}$ exactly twice. This can be done by examining the graph of $f(x)$ and the line $y = \frac{m}{100}$. It can be observed that $f(x)$ intersects the line $y = \frac{m}{100}$ exactly twice for $\frac{m}{100}$ in the interval $(\frac{1}{2}, 1)$. Therefore, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ in the interval $(50, 100)$. This is simply the number of positive integers from 51 to 99, which can be found by subtracting the smallest integer from the largest and adding 1. So the number of positive integers $m$ is $99 - 51 + 1 = 50$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has exactly 4 distinct solutions is 50.

So, the answer is $\boxed{50}$.

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The equation $||\ x-1 \ |-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is an integer that lies strictly between 2 and 3. This is because the expression on the left side of the equation is always nonnegative and never exceeds 3.
So, we have $2<\frac{m}{100}<3$, which gives $200<m<300$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are 201, 202, ..., 299. To find the number of these integers, we subtract the smallest integer from the largest and add 1. So, the number of positive integers $m$ is $299-201+1=99$. The answer is: $99$

Assistant:

 The problem involves finding the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions.

First, let's consider the cases for the absolute value $\vert x-1 \vert -2$.
There are two cases:
1. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$: This gives $\vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100} + 2$.
2. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$: This gives $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.

For each case, we need to solve the equations involving absolute value:

1. $\vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100} + 2$: This gives us two equations: $x-1 = \frac{m}{100} + 2$ and $x-1 = -\frac{m}{100} - 2$. Solving these, we get $x = 1 + \frac{m}{100} + 2 = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = 1 - \frac{m}{100} - 2 = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.
2. $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$: This gives us two equations: $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x-1 = -2 + \frac{m}{100}$. Solving these, we get $x = 1 + 2 - \frac{m}{100} = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = 1 - 2 + \frac{m}{100} = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

For the equation to have four distinct solutions, the two solutions for each case must be distinct from each other and from the solutions of other cases. This means:
- $3 + \frac{m}{100}$ must not be equal to $-1 - \frac{m}{100}$,
- $3 + \frac{m}{100}$ must not be equal to $3 - \frac{m}{100}$,
- $3 + \frac{m}{100}$ must not be equal to $-1 + \frac{m}{100}$,
- $-1 - \frac{m}{100}$ must not be equal to $3 - \frac{m}{100}$,
- $-1 - \frac{m}{100}$ must not be equal to $-1 + \frac{m}{100}$,
- $3 - \frac{m}{100}$ must not be equal to $-1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

By solving these conditions, we find that $100 < m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this condition are the integers from 101 to 199, inclusive. The number of such integers is $100$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions is 100.
The answer is: $100$
