Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Step 1: To solve the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, we need to consider the cases when the inner absolute value is positive and when it's negative.

Step 2: If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 \geq 0$, we can simplify the equation to $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, which gives us $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Step 3: Solving this further gives us two cases: $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x-1 = -(2 + \frac{m}{100})$.

Step 4: If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0$, we can simplify the equation to $-( \vert x-1 \vert -2) = \frac{m}{100}$, which gives us $ \vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Step 5: Solving this further gives us two cases: $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x-1 = -(2 - \frac{m}{100})$.

Step 6: To have 4 distinct solutions, we need to choose the right $m$ such that the four solutions we get from the above cases are distinct.

Step 7: We can use a loop to test different values of $m$ and count the number of distinct solutions.

Step 8: Here is the Python code to implement this:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Abs, solveset, S

def count_distinct_solutions():
    x, m = symbols('x m')
    count = 0
    for m_value in range(1, 101):  # test m from 1 to 100
        equation1 = Abs(x - 1) - 2 - m_value / 100
        equation2 = Abs(x - 1) - 2 + m_value / 100
        solutions1 = solveset(equation1, x, domain=S.Reals)
        solutions2 = solveset(equation2, x, domain=S.Reals)
        total_solutions = solutions1.union(solutions2)
        if len(total_solutions) == 4:  # if there are 4 distinct solutions
            count += 1
    return count

result = count_distinct_solutions()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 100

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
100
```

Step 9: After running the code, we find that the equation has 4 distinct solutions for $\boxed{100}$ values of $m$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition is 100.
The answer is: 100

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. To have four distinct solutions for the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal to $2$.

2. To find the value of $m$, we multiply both sides of the equation by $100$: $m=2*100$, hence $m=200$.

So, the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions is $m=200$.

Therefore, the answer is: $1$.

But wait, there's a mistake in the logic of the problem. The value of $\frac{m}{100}$ should not necessarily be equal to $2$. It should be clear that the absolute value function creates two cases, either $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ or $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$. The sum of the number of solutions of these two cases should be $4$.

Let's correct the logic and solve the problem again:

1. For $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, we know that the right side should be greater than or equal to $0$. So $\frac{m}{100} \geq 0$, which implies $m \geq 0$.

2. We also know that the absolute value function creates two cases, either $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ or $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.

3. The number of solutions of the equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = a$ is $3$ if $0 < a < 2$, $4$ if $a = 2$, $2$ if $2 < a < 4$, and $0$ if $a \geq 4$.

4. Therefore, to have four distinct solutions, $\frac{m}{100}$ should be equal to $2$, hence $m=200$.

The corrected solution is that the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions is $m=200$. Thus, the value of the unknown variable $m$ is $200$. The answer is: $200$. However, the question asks for the number of such positive integers $m$, which should be a positive integer. In our case, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the given condition is $1$. The answer is: $1$.

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We know that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. This means that the value $\frac{m}{100}$ must be chosen in a way that it creates 4 different values inside the absolute value expressions.

2. Let's set $\frac{m}{100}$ to $k$. So we have $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=k$.

3. The absolute value expression $\vert x-1 \vert -2$ can be either positive or negative. This gives us two equations to solve:

   a. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = k$ and
   b. $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = k$.

4. We can solve these equations step by step:

   a. $\vert x-1 \vert = k+2$ implies that $x-1 = k+2$ or $x-1 = -(k+2)$, which simplifies to $x = k+3$ or $x = -k+1$.
   
   b. $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = k$ implies that $-x+1 +2 = k$, or $-x+1 = -k-2$, which simplifies to $x = 1-k-2 = -k-1$ or $x = 1+k+2 = k+3$.

5. We can see that the solutions $x = -k+1$ and $x = -k-1$ are the same, so we can ignore one of them. Also, the solutions $x = k+3$ appear twice, so we can also ignore one of them.

6. The 4 distinct solutions are then given by $x = -k+1$, $x = -k-1$, and $x = k+3$.

7. For these solutions to be distinct, we need $-k+1 \neq -k-1$ and $-k+1 \neq k+3$ and $-k-1 \neq k+3$.

8. Solving these inequalities gives us $k \neq 1$ and $k \neq \frac{1}{2}$ and $k \neq -2$.

9. We are looking for the positive integer values of $k$ that satisfy these inequalities. The only such value is $k=1$.

10. Substituting $k=1$ back into the equation $\frac{m}{100}=k$ gives us $m=100$.

So, the positive integer value of $m$ that makes the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have 4 distinct solutions is $100$.

The answer is: $100$
