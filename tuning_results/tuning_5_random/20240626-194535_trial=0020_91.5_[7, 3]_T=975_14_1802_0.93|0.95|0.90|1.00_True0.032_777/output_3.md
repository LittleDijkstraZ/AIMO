Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The expression equals zero if either of the factors equals zero.
The first factor equals zero if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
The second factor equals zero if $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
These conditions define a rectangle with vertices at $(8,8)$, $(-8,8)$, $(-8,-8)$, and $(8,-8)$.
To find the area of this rectangle, we can multiply its length and width.
The length is $16$ (from $-8$ to $8$ in the x or y direction) and the width is also $16$ (from $-8$ to $8$ in the other direction).
So the area of the rectangle is $16 \times 16 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Step 1: Firstly, we need to understand that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if at least one of the following two conditions holds:

- $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
- $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

Step 2: If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x = 0$ and $y = 0$.

Step 3: If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $-8 \leq x \leq 8$ and $-8 \leq y \leq 8$.

Step 4: Therefore, the points that satisfy the original equation are all the points in the square with vertices at $(-8, -8), (-8, 8), (8, -8),$ and $(8, 8)$.

Step 5: The area of this square is $16 \times 16 = 256$.

The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, we see that the product of two terms is zero if and only if at least one of them is zero. So, we have two cases to consider:

   a) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10$.
   
   b) $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x - y \vert = 10$.

   c) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8$.
   
   d) $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert y \vert = 8$.

2. Now, let's solve each case:

   a) $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ implies that $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
   
   b) $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ implies that $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
   
   c) $\vert x \vert = 8$ implies that $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
   
   d) $\vert y \vert = 8$ implies that $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

3. By solving these systems of equations, we find that the points that satisfy the conditions are: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(2, 8)$, $(2, -8)$, $(-2, 8)$, and $(-2, -8)$. These points form a square with side length 16.

4. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$

The problem involves a system of equations and inequalities, and the goal is to find the area of the region that satisfies all the conditions.

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. This gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersection of these lines form a square with side length 10 (from $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x = \pm 8$), so the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100.

```python

The area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{100}$. The answer is: $100$.

 This problem requires a deep understanding of absolute value and inequalities, as well as the properties of squares and square roots. It is not a straightforward computation problem that can be solved by writing a few lines of code. Instead, it requires analytical thought and critical thinking to solve the problem correctly.

The area of the convex polygon is approximately $58.16$. However, as previously mentioned, this problem requires a deep understanding of absolute value and inequalities, as well as the properties of squares and square roots. It is not a straightforward computation problem that can be solved by writing a few lines of code. Instead, it requires analytical thought and critical thinking to solve the problem correctly. The area of the polygon is actually $100\pi - 256$, which is approximately $58.159265358979326$. The value you get from your code is not correct because you're calculating the area of a circle with radius 10 minus the area of a square with side length 16. However, the problem is asking for the area of the polygon enclosed by the points that satisfy the given equation, which is not a circle with radius 10 minus a square with side length 16. The correct solution to this problem requires a more in-depth understanding of the properties of absolute value and inequalities. The correct answer is $100\pi - 256$, which is approximately $58.159265358979326$.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



We are given a complicated equation involving absolute values. But if we analyze it, we can see that it equals to zero if and only if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or both $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$.

The solutions of $|x + y| = 10$ are all points on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$, and the solutions of $|x| = 8$ are all points on the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$, and the solutions of $|y| = 8$ are all points on the lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

So we are looking for the intersection of these lines. The intersection of $x + y = 10$ and $x = 8$ is the point $(8, 2)$, the intersection of $x + y = 10$ and $y = 8$ is the point $(2, 8)$, the intersection of $x + y = -10$ and $x = 8$ is the point $(8, -18)$, and the intersection of $x + y = -10$ and $y = 8$ is the point $(-2, 8)$. The intersection of $x = 8$ and $x = -8$ is just the point $(-8, 0)$, and the intersection of $y = 8$ and $y = -8$ is just the point $(0, -8)$.

So the polygon is a square with side length 16, and its area is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$.
