Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This can only happen if $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$. Similarly, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So, the vertices of the polygon are $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, $(-8,-8)$, $(10,0)$, $(0,10)$, $(-10,0)$, and $(0,-10)$. These vertices form a square with side length $16$. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, notice that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to the union of the following two sets of points:

1. $\left(x, y\right)$ such that $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $\left(x, y\right)$ such that $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. This is the equation of a square with side length 20 centered at the origin.

From $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This is the equation of a square with side length 20 centered at the origin, but with its diagonals aligned with the x and y axes.

From $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert x \vert = 8$, which gives us two vertical lines at $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.

From $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us two horizontal lines at $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

The intersection of the two sets of points described above forms a 8 by 16 rectangle. To find its area, we simply multiply its length and width: $8 \times 16 = 128$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 128 square units.
The answer is: $128$

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. Therefore, either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

For the first term to be zero, either $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x - y| - 10 = 0$. This means $|x+y| = 10$ or $|x - y| = 10$. The solutions to these equations are all the points on the lines $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.

For the second term to be zero, either $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$. This means $|x| = 8$ or $|y| = 8$. The solutions to these equations are all the points on the lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(\pm 8, \pm 8)$, and sides parallel to the coordinate axes. The length and width of the rectangle are both 16 units, so the area of the rectangle is $16 \times 16 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    # The sides of the rectangle are 16 units long
    side_length = 16

    # The area of the rectangle is the square of the side length
    area = side_length ** 2

    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is $\boxed{256}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. If a product is equal to zero, then one of the factors must be zero. This translates to two separate cases:

   a) $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$
   b) $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$

2. In each case, the equation is a square of a difference equaling zero. That means the absolute value expressions must be equal to zero. And the absolute value of a number is zero if and only if the number is zero. So we get:

   a) $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$
   b) $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$

3. The second case translates to two lines in the xy-plane: x = 8 and y = 8. The first case translates to two squares in the xy-plane, centered at the origin with side length 20.

4. The intersection of these four lines forms a square with side length 8 (the smaller of the two), so the area is $8^2 = 64$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 64 square units. The Python code to solve this problem would be a one-liner:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

print(64)
```

The answer is $\boxed{64}$.
