Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The condition given in the problem is a product of two expressions equal to zero, which means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, and it equals to zero if and only if both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This is a square with side length $20$ centered at the origin, so its area is $400$.

The second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$, and it equals to zero if and only if both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This is a square with side length $16$ centered at the origin, so its area is $256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares, which is $400 + 256 = 656$. The value $656$ is a positive integer and it is the solution to the problem.

Here is the Python code to calculate the area of the convex polygon:
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def calculate_area():
    # The areas of the two squares
    area1 = 400
    area2 = 256

    # Calculate the total area
    total_area = area1 + area2

    return total_area

result = calculate_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 656

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
656
```
The area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{656}$.
The answer is: $656$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to two separate equations: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

2. Each of these equations simplifies to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

3. Solving these equations further gives us the coordinates of the vertices of the polygon: $(8,0)$, $(-8,0)$, $(0,8)$, and $(0,-8)$.

4. To find the area of the polygon, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle and subtract the areas of the four right triangles formed by the origin and the vertices of the rectangle.

5. The rectangle has side lengths of 16 (for both the width and height) so its area is $16 \times 16 = 256$.

6. Each right triangle has a base and height of 8, so its area is $\frac{1}{2} \times 8 \times 8 = 32$. Since there are 4 such triangles, their total area is $4 \times 32 = 128$.

7. Finally, subtracting the total area of the triangles from the area of the rectangle gives us the area of the polygon: $256 - 128 = 128$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 128. The answer is: $\boxed{128}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is: $ ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0 $

This equation is satisfied if either of the two factors is zero. That is, one of the following two conditions must hold:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first condition to be true, both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$, which gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

For the second condition to be true, both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$, which gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

These lines enclose a rectangle with side lengths 16 and 20, so its area is $16 \times 20 = 320$. The answer is: $320$

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, we have a product of two expressions equal to zero, which means that each expression must be zero. So we have two sets of equations: $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$, $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$, and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.

2. Solving each equation, we get: $x + y = 10$, $x - y = 10$, $x = 8$, and $y = 8$. From the first two equations, we get $x = 5$ and $y = 5$. So the points are $(8, 8)$, $(5, 5)$.

3. Plotting these points in a coordinate plane, we see that they form a square with side length $8 - 5 = 3$. The area of the square is $3^2 = 9$.

4. The area of the convex polygon formed by these points is $9$.

Now let's write the Python script to calculate the area:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    side_length = 8 - 5
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 9

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output

```
The area of the convex polygon is $9$. The answer is: $\boxed{9}$.

1. First, notice that for the product of two numbers to be zero, one of them must be zero. So, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
3. If $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
4. If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$, which implies $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
5. If $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.
6. Now, we can plot these lines and find the intersections. The lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, $x - y = -10$, $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$ enclose a convex polygon.
7. To find the area of this polygon, we can use the shoelace formula. The vertices of the polygon are (8, 2), (8, -2), (2, 8), (-2, 8), (-8, 2), (-8, -2), (-2, -8), and (2, -8).
8. Applying the shoelace formula, we get the area as $\frac{1}{2} \vert (8*2 + 8*8 + 2*(-2) + (-2)*(-8) - 8*(-2) - 8*2 - 2*8 - (-2)*(-8)) \vert = 128$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $128$. The answer is: $128$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The expression $f(x, y) = ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if both factors are equal to zero. The factors are:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ which implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ or $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ which implies $\vert y \vert = 8$ or $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

These equations represent a set of lines in the coordinate plane. Their intersection will form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So the area of the convex polygon formed by the points satisfying the equation is $100$. The answer is: $100$

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The equation in the problem is a product of two expressions equal to zero. According to the zero product property, this means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.

2. Let's set each expression equal to zero and solve for $(x, y)$:
   a. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ gives $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
   b. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ gives $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
   c. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ gives $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
   d. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ gives $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

3. We can find the intersection points of these equations to obtain the vertices of the polygon.

4. Then, we can calculate the area of the polygon using the shoelace formula or other methods.

Let's start by finding the intersection points:

Intersection of $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ gives $x = 10$, $y = 0$.
Intersection of $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$ gives $x = 0$, $y = 10$.
Intersection of $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$ gives $x = -10$, $y = -20$.
Intersection of $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$ gives $x = -10$, $y = 0$.
Intersection of $x + y = 10$ and $x = 8$ gives $x = 8$, $y = 2$.
Intersection of $x + y = 10$ and $x = -8$ gives $x = -8$, $y = 18$.
Intersection of $x + y = -10$ and $x = 8$ gives $x = 8$, $y = -18$.
Intersection of $x + y = -10$ and $x = -8$ gives $x = -8$, $y = -2$.
Intersection of $x - y = 10$ and $x = 8$ gives $x = 8$, $y = -2$.
Intersection of $x - y = 10$ and $x = -8$ gives $x = -8$, $y = -18$.
Intersection of $x - y = -10$ and $x = 8$ gives $x = 8$, $y = 2$.
Intersection of $x - y = -10$ and $x = -8$ gives $x = -8$, $y = 18$.
Intersection of $x = 8$ and $y = 8$ gives $x = 8$, $y = 8$.
Intersection of $x = 8$ and $y = -8$ gives $x = 8$, $y = -8$.
Intersection of $x = -8$ and $y = 8$ gives $x = -8$, $y = 8$.
Intersection of $x = -8$ and $y = -8$ gives $x = -8$, $y = -8$.

5. The intersection points are: (0, 10), (10, 0), (-10, -20), (-10, 0), (8, 2), (8, -18), (-8, 18), (-8, -2), (8, -2), (8, 18), (-8, 2), and (-8, -18), (8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), and (-8, -8).

6. We can plot these points on a graph to visualize the polygon.

7. The polygon is a square with side length 20 units. The area of the square is $20^2 = 400$.

The area of the convex polygon is 400 square units. The answer is: $400$

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, we need to understand the given equation and recognize that it equals to zero. This means that at least one of the terms in the product must be zero.
2. Therefore, we can split the problem into two cases:
   a. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
   b. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
3. For the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that all points $(x, y)$ that satisfy these equations lie on a square with side length 10.
4. For the second case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that all points $(x, y)$ that satisfy these equations lie on a square with side length 16.
5. The intersection of these two squares forms a smaller square, which is the convex polygon we are looking for.
6. The side length of the smaller square is the minimum of the side lengths of the two squares, which is 10.
7. The area of the square is given by the square of the side length, so the area of the convex polygon is $10^2 = 100$.

The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The given equation is $ ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. 

For the product of two numbers to be zero, one of the numbers must be zero. So we have two cases:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. 

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. 

From case 1, we have two squares equal to $10^2$, so $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the square as $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0)$. 

From case 2, we have two squares equal to $8^2$, so $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the square as $(8, 0), (-8, 0), (0, 8), (0, -8)$. 

The convex polygon formed by the union of these two squares is a 8x10 rectangle. 

The area of the rectangle is $8 \times 10 = 80$. So the area of the convex polygon is 80 square units.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Abs

def polygon_area():
    # x and y are the coordinates of the points in the polygon

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We have a system of equations. The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of them is zero. Therefore, we need to solve two systems of equations: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

2. For the first system, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This system represents a square with side length 10, centered at the origin.

3. For the second system, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This system represents a square with side length 16, centered at the origin.

4. The intersection of the two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for. The area of the convex polygon is the area of the smaller square, which is $(10)^2 = 100$.

Now, let's write the python code to calculate the area:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    side_length = 10
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

The area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The given equation is a product of two terms, and this product equals to zero. This means that at least one of the terms must be zero. 

So we have two systems of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
2. Either of the terms can be zero.

In the first system, we get:

1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$
2. Solving these absolute value equations gives us the vertices of the polygon.

Now let's calculate the vertices:

From $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, we have $x + y = \pm 10$.
From $\vert x \vert = 8$, we have $x = \pm 8$.
From $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, we have $x - y = \pm 10$.
From $\vert y \vert = 8$, we have $y = \pm 8$.

By solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon: $(8, 2), (8, -2), (-8, 2), (-8, -2), (2, 8), (2, -8), (-2, 8), (-2, -8)$.

Now we can calculate the area of the polygon formed by these vertices. The polygon is a square with side length $16$, so the area is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The expression is equal to zero if and only if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

2. Each of these equations is satisfied when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

3. Solving for $x$ and $y$ in these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon:

   - $(8,0)$, $(0,8)$, $(-8,0)$, $(0,-8)$, $(8,18)$, $(18,8)$, $(-8,-18)$, $(-18,-8)$, $(8,-18)$, $(18,-8)$, $(-8,18)$, $(-18,8)$.

4. To find the area of the polygon, we can use the shoelace formula. The coordinates of the vertices, taken in order, are: $(8,0)$, $(0,8)$, $(-8,0)$, $(0,-8)$, $(8,18)$, $(18,8)$, $(-8,-18)$, $(-18,-8)$, $(8,-18)$, $(18,-8)$, $(-8,18)$, $(-18,8)$, and then again $(8,0)$.

5. The shoelace formula states that if the coordinates of the vertices of a polygon are $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), \dots, (x_n, y_n)$, then the area of the polygon is given by:

$$
\frac{1}{2} \vert (x_1y_2 + x_2y_3 + \dots + x_ny_1) - (y_1x_2 + y_2x_3 + \dots + y_nx_1) \vert
$$

6. Applying the shoelace formula to the coordinates above, we find that the area of the polygon is 320 square units.

So the area of the convex polygon is $320$. The answer is: $320$

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

The problem asks for the area of a convex polygon enclosed by the points that satisfy the equation.
The equation is given as $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
For the product of two factors to be zero, either one of the factors must be zero. So we have two cases:
Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
This case implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square with side length 10: $(0, 0)$, $(10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, and $(10, 10)$.
Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This case implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square with side length 16: $(8, 0)$, $(-8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, and $(0, -8)$.
The convex polygon enclosed by the points that satisfy the equation is the union of these two squares. The side length of the larger square is 10, so its area is $10^2 = 100$. The side length of the smaller square is 16, so its area is $16^2 = 256$. The area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of these two squares: $100 + 256 = 356$.
The answer is: $356$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The expression equals 0 if either of the terms equals 0. Therefore, we have four cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 \neq 0$
3. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 \neq 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
4. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 \neq 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 \neq 0$
5. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 \neq 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
6. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 \neq 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 \neq 0$
7. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 \neq 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 \neq 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
8. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 \neq 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 \neq 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 \neq 0$

From case 1, we get the point (8, 8). For case 2 and case 3, we get the point (8, -8) and (-8, 8) respectively. For case 4, we get the point (8, -8) and (-8, 8) simultaneously. For case 5, 6, and 7, we get the point (0, 0). For case 8, there is no solution.

So the polygon is a square with side length 16. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The expression is equal to zero when either of the terms in the product is zero. So, we have two sets of equations:
   a) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
   b) $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$

2. From a) we get $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $-8 \leq x, y \leq 8$.
   From b) we get $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

3. Solving these absolute value equations, we get four vertices of the polygon: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$.

4. To find the area of the polygon, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle and subtract the areas of the four right triangles that make up the corners of the rectangle. The rectangle has dimensions $16 \times 16$, so its area is $256$. Each right triangle has base and height of $8$, so its area is $32$. The total area of the four triangles is $128$.

5. Therefore, the area of the polygon is $256 - 128 = 128$.

However, this result is not possible since the points must be inside the square with side length $16$. The correct solution should be the area of the square minus the area of the four right triangles. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$, and the area of each right triangle is still $32$. The total area of the four triangles is $128$. So, the correct area of the polygon is $256 - 128 = 128$.

However, we have made a mistake in step 3. The vertices of the polygon are not $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$. They should be $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -8)$. Let's correct that.

3. Solving these absolute value equations again, we get four vertices of the polygon: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

4. Now, we form a rectangle with dimensions $16 \times 8$. Its area is $128$. The four right triangles still have base and height of $8$, so their total area is still $128$.

5. Therefore, the area of the polygon is $128 - 128 = 0$.

This result is not possible either. The problem is that we are not considering the possibility that both terms in the product could be zero. Let's consider that case.

6. If both terms in the product are zero, then we have:
   a) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
   b) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

7. From a) we get $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
   From b) we get $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $-8 \leq x, y \leq 8$.

8. Solving these absolute value equations, we get that the only solution is $(x, y) = (8, 2)$, which is the same as before. So, this case doesn't give us any new information.

9. However, we have another possibility: both terms in the product could be zero because of the absolute values. In this case, we have:
   a) $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$
   b) $x = 8$ and $y = 2$

10. From b) we get $y = 2$. Substituting this into a) we get $x + 2 = 10$, so $x = 8$. This is the same solution we already found.

11. So, we have only one solution $(x, y) = (8, 2)$. This means the polygon is actually a line segment from $(8, 2)$ to $(8, -2)$, and its area is zero.

However, this result is not possible either. The problem is that we are not considering the possibility that both terms in the product could be zero. Let's consider that case.

12. If both terms in the product are zero, then we have:
   a) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
   b) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

13. From a) we get $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
   From b) we get $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $-8 \leq x, y \leq 8$.

14. Solving these absolute value equations, we get that the only solution is $(x, y) = (8, 2)$, which is the same as before. So, this case doesn't give us any new information.

First, we have a product of two terms equal to zero, which means either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. So, we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x - y \vert = 10$
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8$
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert y \vert = 8$

From the above cases, we can see that the points satisfying the equation are on a square with side length 16 (since $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ implies $-8 \leq x, y \leq 8$, and the distances between $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ imply a square with side length 16).

The area of a square with side length 16 is $16^2 = 256$. So, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

So, the answer is $\boxed{256}$.

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.

The first term is zero when $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x - y| - 10 = 0$. These equations imply that $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$. The solutions to these equations are all points in the form of $(x, y)$ where the sum or the difference of $x$ and $y$ is equal to $10$ or $-10$. These points form a square with side length $20$.

The second term is zero when $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$. These equations imply that $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. The solutions to these equations are all points in the form of $(x, y)$ where $x$ is equal to $8$ or $-8$ or $y$ is equal to $8$ or $-8$. These points form a square with side length $16$.

The intersection of the two squares is the convex polygon that encloses the points satisfying the given equation. The area of this convex polygon is the area of the smaller square, which is $(20)^2 = 400$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $400$. The answer is: $400$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, note that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So, the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is equivalent to:

$$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad (\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0.$$

The first equation can never be true because the square of a real number is always non-negative, and the sum of two non-negative numbers can never be zero. So we only need to consider the second equation:

$$(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0.$$

Again, this equation can only be true if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = 8$ or $x = -8$, and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. So the points that satisfy the equation form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

## QUESTION 3 - 21 
- TIME_SPENT : 1259 secs

21_User:

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The equation is equal to zero if either of the terms is zero. So, we have two cases:

   a) $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$
   
   This is only possible if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square.

   b) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
   
   This is only possible if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square.

2. Solving the system of equations gives us the vertices of the square:

   - For the first case, we have $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, which gives us the vertex $(5, 5)$. Similarly, we can find the other three vertices: $(5, -5)$, $(-5, 5)$, and $(-5, -5)$.
   
   - For the second case, we have $x = 8$ and $y = 8$, which gives us the vertex $(8, 8)$. Similarly, we can find the other three vertices: $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

3. The square formed by these vertices has side length 10 (from the first case) or 16 (from the second case). But since the square formed by the first case has side length 10, which is smaller than the side length 16 of the square formed by the second case, the square formed by the first case is the one we are interested in.

4. The area of the square with side length 10 is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 100.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    # The side length of the square is 10
    side_length = 10

    # The area of the square is side_length^2
    area = side_length ** 2

    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 100

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
100
```
The area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{100}$.
