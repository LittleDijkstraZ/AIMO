Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The problem states that the points $(x, y)$ satisfying the equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. The only way for the product of two numbers to be zero is if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. Solving these equations gives $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$, and $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$. These four lines form a square with side length 10.

2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. Solving these equations gives $x = 8$ or $x = -8$, and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. These four lines form a square with side length 16.

The convex polygon is the intersection of these two squares, which is also a square with side length 10. The area of a square is given by the side length squared, so the area of the convex polygon is $10^2 = 100$.

The answer is: $100$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



We are given the equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

The product of two numbers equals zero if and only if at least one of the numbers equals zero. Hence, we have two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

For case 1, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us the rectangle with vertices $(-8, -8), (-8, 8), (8, 8),$ and $(8, -8)$.

For case 2, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us the rectangle with vertices $(-8, 8), (-8, -8), (8, -8),$ and $(8, 8)$.

Thus, the points satisfying the given equation encloses a rectangle with side lengths 16 and 16. The area of this rectangle is $16 \times 16 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    # The side lengths of the rectangle
    length = 16
    width = 16

    # Calculate the area of the rectangle
    area = length * width

    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is $\boxed{256}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, observe that the product of two expressions is zero if and only if at least one of the expressions is zero. So, we have two cases to consider:
    a) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
    b) $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

2. For the first case (a), we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us a square with side length 16.

3. For the second case (b), we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This also gives us a square with side length 16.

4. Therefore, the points satisfying the given equation enclose a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

Now, let's write a Python script to calculate the area:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def calculate_area():
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = calculate_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us a square with side length 10 units, and the vertices of the square are $(0,0), (10,0), (0,10)$ and $(10,10)$.
If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us a square with side length 8 units, and the vertices of the square are $(-8,-8), (8,-8), (-8,8)$ and $(8,8)$.
The intersection of the two squares is a smaller square with side length 6 units, and the vertices of the smaller square are $(-4,-4), (4,-4), (-4,4)$ and $(4,4)$.
To find the area of the convex polygon, we need to find the area of the larger square minus the area of the smaller square. The area of a square is side length squared. The side length of the larger square is 10 units, so its area is $10^2 = 100$. The side length of the smaller square is 6 units, so its area is $6^2 = 36$. The area of the convex polygon is $100 - 36 = 64$.
The answer is: $64$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is $0$ if and only if each of the two factors is $0$. Thus, we need to solve the following four equations:

1. $|x + y| - 10 = 0$
2. $|x - y| - 10 = 0$
3. $|x| - 8 = 0$
4. $|y| - 8 = 0$

Each of these equations simplifies to:

1. $|x + y| = 10$
2. $|x - y| = 10$
3. $|x| = 8$
4. $|y| = 8$

For equations 3 and 4, we have two cases for each equation:

3a. $x = 8$
3b. $x = -8$
4a. $y = 8$
4b. $y = -8$

Now, we can solve equations 1 and 2 graphically or algebraically. For example, consider equation 1:

$|x + y| = 10$
This equation represents a square with vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$. Similarly, we can find the solutions for equation 2, and the intersection of the solutions of equations 1 and 2 will give us the vertices of the polygon.

However, this is not a practical approach because it involves solving equations graphically or algebraically, which could be time-consuming and computationally intensive. Instead, let's simply observe that the four lines $|x + y| = 10$, $|x - y| = 10$, $|x| = 8$, and $|y| = 8$ form a square with side length $16$. Therefore, the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of them is zero. This means the points that satisfy the equation are those that make either 
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$$
or
$$((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$

For the first equation to be true, both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the conditions for a square with side length 10 and vertices at $(0,0)$, $(10,0)$, $(0,10)$ and $(10,10)$.

For the second equation to be true, both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This forms a square with side length 16 and vertices at $(-8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, $(8,-8)$ and $(8,8)$.

The intersection of these two squares is a square with side length 8 and vertices at $(0,0)$, $(8,0)$, $(0,8)$ and $(8,8)$. The area of this square is $8 \times 8 = 64$. The answer is: $64$
