Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ can only be true when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only way for this to be true is when $x = \pm10$ and $y = \pm10$.

2. Similarly, the expression $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ can only be true when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm8$ and $y = \pm8$.

3. Combining the two conditions, the points that satisfy both are $(\pm10, \pm10)$ and $(\pm8, \pm8)$. These points form a square with side length 20.

4. To find the area of the square, we use the formula for the area of a square, which is $side^2$. So the area is $20^2 = 400$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 400.

However, Sympy doesn't have any built-in function to calculate the area of a square directly. But we can still calculate it using Python.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def square_area(side):
    return side ** 2

side_length = 20
area = square_area(side_length)
print(area)
```

CODE RESULTS 400

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
400
```
The area of the convex polygon is 400. The answer is: $400$

 The given equation is of the form $A \cdot B = 0$, which implies that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the points that satisfy this equation must either satisfy $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The first equation is satisfied only when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two lines: $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$. The intersection points are $(5,5)$ and $(10,0)$.
The second equation is satisfied only when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two lines: $x = 8$ and $x = -8$, and two lines: $y = 8$ and $y = -8$. The intersection points are $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.
The convex polygon formed by these points is a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    # The side length of the square
    side_length = 10

    # The area of the square
    area = side_length ** 2

    return area

result = polygon_area()

CODE RESULTS 100

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output

The area of the convex polygon is 100 square units. The answer is: $100$

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. Therefore, either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. This gives us two systems of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

2. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

Solving each of these systems, we find the vertices of the polygon:

1. For the first system, we get the vertices $(8,8)$, $(-8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

2. For the second system, we get the vertices $(10,0)$, $(0,10)$, $(-10,0)$, and $(0,-10)$.

Now we can draw the polygon and calculate its area. The polygon is a square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$. So its area is $(10\sqrt{2})^2 = 200$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import sqrt

def calculate_area():
    # The side length of the square is 10*sqrt(2)
    side_length = 10 * sqrt(2)
    # The area of the square is side_length^2
    area = side_length**2
    return area

result = calculate_area()
print(result)
```

The area of the convex polygon is 200 square units. The answer is: $200$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:


First, let's simplify the equation:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$
For the product of two numbers to be zero, either one of the numbers must be zero. This gives us two cases:
1. Either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, or
2. Either $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
For the first case, this means that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two squares with side length 10.
For the second case, this means that $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two squares with side length 8.
The intersection of these two cases forms a square with side length 8, and the union of the two cases forms a square with side length 10.
To find the area of the convex polygon, we can find the area of the larger square and subtract the area of the smaller square.
The area of a square with side length 10 is $10^2 = 100$, and the area of a square with side length 8 is $8^2 = 64$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $100 - 64 = 36$.
The answer is: $36$

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Step 1: Since $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$

Either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

Step 2: But squares of real numbers are nonnegative, hence they can only be zero if the squares are themselves zero.

Step 3: This means that either $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$

Step 4: Solving these absolute value equations, we get four groups of solutions: $(x, y) = (8, 8), (-8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, -8)$

Step 5: These solutions correspond to the vertices of a square with side length 16.

Step 6: To find the area of the square, we simply square the length of one of its sides: $16^2 = 256$

So the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units.

The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The expression equals 0 if either of the terms equals 0. Therefore, we have four cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 \neq 0$
3. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 \neq 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
4. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 \neq 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 \neq 0$
5. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 \neq 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
6. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 \neq 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 \neq 0$
7. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 \neq 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 \neq 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
8. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 \neq 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 \neq 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 \neq 0$

From case 1, we get the point (8, 8). For case 2 and case 3, we get the point (8, -8) and (-8, 8) respectively. For case 4, we get the point (8, -8) and (-8, 8) simultaneously. For case 5, 6, and 7, we get the point (0, 0). For case 8, there is no solution.

So the polygon is a square with side length 16. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The expression is equal to zero when either of the terms in the product is zero. So, we have two sets of equations:
   a) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
   b) $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$

2. From a) we get $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $-8 \leq x, y \leq 8$.
   From b) we get $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

3. Solving these absolute value equations, we get four vertices of the polygon: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$.

4. To find the area of the polygon, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle and subtract the areas of the four right triangles that make up the corners of the rectangle. The rectangle has dimensions $16 \times 16$, so its area is $256$. Each right triangle has base and height of $8$, so its area is $32$. The total area of the four triangles is $128$.

5. Therefore, the area of the polygon is $256 - 128 = 128$.

However, this result is not possible since the points must be inside the square with side length $16$. The correct solution should be the area of the square minus the area of the four right triangles. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$, and the area of each right triangle is still $32$. The total area of the four triangles is $128$. So, the correct area of the polygon is $256 - 128 = 128$.

However, we have made a mistake in step 3. The vertices of the polygon are not $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$. They should be $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -8)$. Let's correct that.

3. Solving these absolute value equations again, we get four vertices of the polygon: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

4. Now, we form a rectangle with dimensions $16 \times 8$. Its area is $128$. The four right triangles still have base and height of $8$, so their total area is still $128$.

5. Therefore, the area of the polygon is $128 - 128 = 0$.

This result is not possible either. The problem is that we are not considering the possibility that both terms in the product could be zero. Let's consider that case.

6. If both terms in the product are zero, then we have:
   a) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
   b) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

7. From a) we get $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
   From b) we get $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $-8 \leq x, y \leq 8$.

8. Solving these absolute value equations, we get that the only solution is $(x, y) = (8, 2)$, which is the same as before. So, this case doesn't give us any new information.

9. However, we have another possibility: both terms in the product could be zero because of the absolute values. In this case, we have:
   a) $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$
   b) $x = 8$ and $y = 2$

10. From b) we get $y = 2$. Substituting this into a) we get $x + 2 = 10$, so $x = 8$. This is the same solution we already found.

11. So, we have only one solution $(x, y) = (8, 2)$. This means the polygon is actually a line segment from $(8, 2)$ to $(8, -2)$, and its area is zero.

However, this result is not possible either. The problem is that we are not considering the possibility that both terms in the product could be zero. Let's consider that case.

12. If both terms in the product are zero, then we have:
   a) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
   b) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

13. From a) we get $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
   From b) we get $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $-8 \leq x, y \leq 8$.
