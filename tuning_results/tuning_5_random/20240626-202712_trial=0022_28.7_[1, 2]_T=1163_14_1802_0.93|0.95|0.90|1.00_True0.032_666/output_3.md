Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The product of two expressions is zero if and only if at least one of the expressions is zero. Therefore, we can consider two cases: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

2. Solving $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which gives us two lines: $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.

3. Similarly, solving $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which gives us two more lines: $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.

4. Solving $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert x \vert = 8$, which gives us two lines: $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.

5. Solving $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us two lines: $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

6. All these lines form a square with side length $20$. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $400$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols

def area_of_polygon():
    # The square has side length 20, so the area is 20^2
    area = 20**2
    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 400

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
400
```
The area of the convex polygon is $400$. The answer is: $400$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The given equation is a product of two quadratic expressions equaling to zero. Therefore, the equation is satisfied when either of the expressions equals zero.

For the first expression, we have:
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0\]
This implies that both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. Solving these we get $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ or $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.
This results in four lines: $y = 10 - x$, $y = x - 10$, $y = x + 10$, and $y = -(x - 10)$. These lines form a square with side length $20$ and vertices at $(0, 10)$, $(10, 0)$, $(0, -10)$, and $(-10, 0)$.

For the second expression, we have:
\[(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0\]
This implies that both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. Solving these we get $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
This results in four lines: $y = 8$, $y = -8$, $x = 8$, and $x = -8$. These lines form a square with side length $16$ and vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The convex polygon is the intersection of these two squares, which is a smaller square with side length $20 - 16 = 4$ and vertices at $(4, 4)$, $(4, -4)$, $(-4, 4)$, and $(-4, -4)$.

The area of this square is $4^2 = 16$. So the answer is $\boxed{16}$.
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import *

def polygon_area():
    # Side length of the smaller square
    side_length = 20 - 16

    # Area of the square
    area = side_length**2

    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 16

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
16
```
The area of the convex polygon is $16$ square units.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. Notice that a product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of them is zero. That means we can break down the problem into two separate equations: $ ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0 $ and $ ((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0 $.

2. For the first equation, $ ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0 $, it is only possible when both $ \vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0 $ and $ \vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0 $. Solving these two equations gives us $ x = y = \pm 10 $.

3. For the second equation, $ ((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0 $, it is only possible when both $ \vert x \vert - 8 = 0 $ and $ \vert y \vert - 8 = 0 $, which gives us $ x = y = \pm 8 $.

4. Therefore, the solution set is the set of points where $ x = y = \pm 10 $ and $ x = y = \pm 8 $. This forms a square with side length 20 (the difference between 10 and 8), so its area is $ 20^2 = 400 $.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solve

def calculate_area():
    # side length of the square
    side_length = 2 * (10 - 8)
    # area of the square
    area = side_length**2
    return area

area = calculate_area()
print(area)
```

It seems there was a mistake in the calculation, let's re-evaluate. The difference between 10 and 8 is 2, so the side length of the square should be 4 (not 16). Let's correct this:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def calculate_area():
    # side length of the square
    side_length = 2 * (10 - 8)
    # area of the square
    area = side_length**2

area = calculate_area()

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, we see that the product of two terms is zero if and only if at least one of them is zero. So, we have two cases to consider:

   a) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10$.
   
   b) $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x - y \vert = 10$.

   c) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8$.
   
   d) $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert y \vert = 8$.

2. Now, let's solve each case:

   a) $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ implies that $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
   
   b) $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ implies that $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
   
   c) $\vert x \vert = 8$ implies that $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
   
   d) $\vert y \vert = 8$ implies that $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

3. By solving these systems of equations, we find that the points that satisfy the conditions are: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(2, 8)$, $(2, -8)$, $(-2, 8)$, and $(-2, -8)$. These points form a square with side length 16.

4. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This means that either $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The equations $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$ represent four lines in the coordinate plane, which form a square with side length 16.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. This expression is zero if and only if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) = 0$. This means that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only way this can happen is if $x = y = 5$ or $x = -y = -5$.

The second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. This expression is zero if and only if both $(\vert x \vert - 8) = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8) = 0$. This means that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The only way this can happen is if $x = 8$ or $x = -8$, and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

So the points that satisfy the equation are the vertices of a square with side length 10, centered at the origin. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

The first term is zero when $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x - y| - 10 = 0$. These simplify to $|x+y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle.

The second term is zero when $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$. These simplify to $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines also form a rectangle.

The intersection of the two rectangles is the convex polygon that encloses the points satisfying the given equation. The side lengths of this rectangle are $20$ (the difference between $10$ and $-10$) in both the x and y directions. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $20 \times 20 = 400$.

The Python code to calculate the area of the convex polygon is:
```python
