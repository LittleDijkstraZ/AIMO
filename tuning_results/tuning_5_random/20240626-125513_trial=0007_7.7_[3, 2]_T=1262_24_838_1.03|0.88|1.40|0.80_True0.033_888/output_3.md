Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. So, we have two cases to consider.

2. For the first case, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This is a square with side length 20, so the area is $20^2 = 400$.

3. For the second case, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This is a square with side length 16, so the area is $16^2 = 256$.

4. To find the area of the convex polygon formed by the union of these two squares, we simply add the areas of the two squares: $400 + 256 = 656$.

The answer is: $656$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



We have the equation $f(x, y) = 0$, where $f(x, y) = ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$.

From the equation, we see that $f(x, y) = 0$ if and only if either $g(x, y) = (\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $h(x, y) = (\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From $g(x, y) = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of a square with side length $20$.

From $h(x, y) = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of a square with side length $16$.

The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for. It's a square with side length $8$ (the smaller square from $h(x, y) = 0$). The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$.

So the area of the convex polygon is $64$.

The answer is: $64$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The given equation is a product of two terms, each of which is a square of a difference. The product is zero if and only if at least one of the terms is zero. Therefore, the points that satisfy the equation are those that make each of the terms zero.

The term $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ is zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which gives us two lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.

The term $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ is zero if and only if $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which gives us two lines $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.

The term $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ is zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$, which gives us two lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.

The term $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2$ is zero if and only if $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us two lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$. The area of this rectangle is $16 \times 16 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points that satisfy the given equation is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either one of the terms must be zero. 

For the first term, we have $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. 

For the second term, we have $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

From the first term, we have four lines: $x + y = \pm10$ and $x - y = \pm10$. From the second term, we have four more lines: $x = \pm8$ and $y = \pm8$. These lines form a square with side length 16.

To find the area of this square, we simply square the length of one side: $16^2 = 256$. So the area of the convex polygon is 256.

The Python code to compute the area is:
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length**2
    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output

The area of the convex polygon is $256$.
The answer is: $256$

 The given equation is of the form $A \cdot B = 0$, which implies that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the points that satisfy this equation must either satisfy $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The first equation is satisfied only when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two lines: $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$. The intersection points are $(5,5)$ and $(10,0)$.
The second equation is satisfied only when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two lines: $x = 8$ and $x = -8$, and two lines: $y = 8$ and $y = -8$. The intersection points are $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.
The convex polygon formed by these points is a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    # The side length of the square
    side_length = 10

    # The area of the square
    area = side_length ** 2

    return area

result = polygon_area()

The area of the convex polygon is 100 square units. The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is satisfied when either of the two factors is zero. We have two cases:

1) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
This means that the points must lie on the lines $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.

2) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
This means that the points must lie on the lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 16.
The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256.

To compute this in Python, we can simply calculate $16^2$:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is $\boxed{256}$.
