Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either one of them must be zero for the whole equation to be zero. This means we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first case, both terms must be zero, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$, and $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$. Solving these four equations gives us the vertices of the square.

For the second case, both terms must be zero, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = 8$ or $x = -8$, and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. Solving these four equations gives us the vertices of the square.

The vertices of the square are $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$. This square has side length $16$, so its area is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The equation given in the problem is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.

For the first term to be zero, we have:
1. $|x + y| - 10 = 0$, which implies $|x + y| = 10$. This means $x + y = \pm 10$.
2. $|x - y| - 10 = 0$, which implies $|x - y| = 10$. This means $x - y = \pm 10$.

For the second term to be zero, we have:
1. $|x| - 8 = 0$, which implies $|x| = 8$. This means $x = \pm 8$.
2. $|y| - 8 = 0$, which implies $|y| = 8$. This means $y = \pm 8$.

The points that satisfy these conditions are the vertices of a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10 \times 10 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units.
The answer is: $100$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The given equation is $0$ when either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

2. Each of these equations is equal to $0$ when the absolute value expressions are equal to $10$ or $8$. This gives us the following system of equations:
   - $\vert x + y \vert = 10$
   - $\vert x - y \vert = 10$
   - $\vert x \vert = 8$
   - $\vert y \vert = 8$

3. The solutions to these equations are the vertices of the polygon. We can find these vertices by considering all possible combinations of signs for the absolute value expressions.

4. Once we have the vertices, we can find the area of the polygon by using the Shoelace formula or by dividing the polygon into triangles and using their coordinates.

Now, let's actually solve this problem. First, we find the vertices of the polygon:

- For $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, the vertices are $(8,2)$, $(8,-2)$, $(-8,2)$, and $(-8,-2)$.
- For $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, the vertices are $(2,8)$, $(2,-8)$, $(-2,8)$, and $(-2,-8)$.
- For $\vert x \vert = 8$, the vertices are $(8,0)$, $(-8,0)$.
- For $\vert y \vert = 8$, the vertices are $(0,8)$, $(0,-8)$.

The vertices of the polygon are then: $(8,2)$, $(8,-2)$, $(-8,2)$, $(-8,-2)$, $(2,8)$, $(2,-8)$, $(-2,8)$, $(-2,-8)$, $(8,0)$, $(-8,0)$, $(0,8)$, and $(0,-8)$.

Now, we can draw the polygon and find its area. The polygon is a square with side length $16$, so its area is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$.

2. Each of these equations is zero when its argument is zero, i.e., when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

3. The solutions to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ are the lines $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$ in the $xy$-plane.

4. The solutions to $\vert x \vert = 8$ are the lines $x = \pm 8$, and the solutions to $\vert y \vert = 8$ are the lines $y = \pm 8$.

5. The intersection points of these lines are the vertices of the polygon.

6. We can find these vertices by solving the equations $x + y = \pm 10$, $x - y = \pm 10$, $x = \pm 8$, and $y = \pm 8$.

7. The vertices of the polygon are $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(2, 8)$, $(-2, 8)$, $(2, -8)$, and $(-2, -8)$.

8. The polygon is a square with side length 16.

9. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

The area of the polygon is 256.
The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The problem is asking for the area of a polygon. The given equation is zero, which means either of the terms inside the multiplication must be zero. 

This breaks down into four cases:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first case, we have:
1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$
2. $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$

These equations describe a square with side length 16 (since $\vert x \vert = 8$ means $x$ is between -8 and 8). Therefore, the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the polygon is 256. Now we just need to write a python script to calculate this:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $\boxed{256}$.
