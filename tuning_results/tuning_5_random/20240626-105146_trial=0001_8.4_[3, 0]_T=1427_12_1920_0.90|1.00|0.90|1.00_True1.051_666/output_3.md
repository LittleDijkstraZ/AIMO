Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The problem statement asks for a numerical value of the area of the polygon enclosed by the points that satisfy the equation. However, the equation itself is a bit complicated. But we notice that the equation equals to zero, which means the only way for the equation to be zero is when both terms are zero. Therefore, we have two separate cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these systems of equations, we get the four points $(5, 5)$, $(5, -5)$, $(-5, 5)$, and $(-5, -5)$.

For the second case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So we get the four points $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

Now we need to visualize these points and determine the shape of the polygon enclosed by them. By plotting these points, we can see that they form a square with side length 10. Therefore, the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 100.

```python

def calculate_area():
    # Define the variables
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # Set up the equations

    eq2 = Eq(abs(x - y) - 10, 0)
    eq3 = Eq(abs(x) - 8, 0)
    eq4 = Eq(abs(y) - 8, 0)

    # Solve the equations
    solutions1 = solve((eq1,eq2), (x, y))
    solutions2 = solve((eq3,eq4), (x, y))

    # Get the vertices of the polygon
    vertices = solutions1 + solutions2

    # Calculate the area of the square

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The problem involves a product of two terms equal to zero, which means either of the terms can be zero. The terms are $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2$.

For the first term to be zero, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.

For the second term to be zero, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = 8$ or $x = -8$ and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

The points that satisfy these conditions are:
- For $x + y = 10$: $(8, 2), (2, 8), (-8, 18), (18, -8)$.
- For $x + y = -10$: $(-8, -2), (-2, -8), (8, -18), (-18, 8)$.
- For $x = 8$: $(8, 2), (8, -2), (8, 18), (8, -18)$.
- For $x = -8$: $(-8, 2), (-8, -2), (-8, 18), (-8, -18)$.
- For $y = 8$: $(2, 8), (-2, 8), (18, 8), (-18, 8)$.
- For $y = -8$: $(2, -8), (-2, -8), (18, -8), (-18, -8)$.

These points form a square with side length 16. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)

The area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{256}$. The answer is $\boxed{256}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of them is zero. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to the system of equations:

1. $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$
2. $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$

From the first equation, we get $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$, and solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, -2)$, and $(-8, 2)$.

From the second equation, we get $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$, and solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$.

The four vertices of the convex polygon are the intersections of these two squares: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, -2)$, and $(-8, 2)$. This is a square with side length $8\sqrt{2}$, and its area is $(8\sqrt{2})^2 = 128$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 128.

Now, let's write the python script:
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import sqrt

def area_of_polygon():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    side_length = 8*sqrt(2)
    area = side_length**2
    return area

result = area_of_polygon()

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The condition of the problem is a product of two expressions equal zero. This means either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.
2. We know that a product of two expressions is zero if and only if at least one of the expressions is zero. Therefore, we have two cases:
   a. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
   b. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
3. For the first case, both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ should be zero. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations, we obtain four lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.
4. For the second case, both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2$ should be zero. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these four equations, we obtain four lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.
5. The intersections of these lines form a rectangle with vertices $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$.
6. The area of this rectangle is $(8 - (-8)) \times (8 - (-8)) = 16 \times 16 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $256$.

Please note that the provided solution is a possible approach to solve this problem. It is not the only method and may not be the most efficient one. The key here is to understand the structure of the problem and how to break it down into manageable parts. You can also try other methods and see which one works best for you. The main goal is to find the right approach and solve the problem effectively.The `sympy` library does not directly solve this problem, but it can be used for symbolic computation and manipulation. However, this problem does not need symbolic computation or manipulation as such. Instead, it requires logical thinking and problem-solving skills. In this case, Python and basic arithmetic can be used to find the solution.
The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, notice that the whole product is zero if and only if at least one of the factors is zero. Therefore we have two cases:

1) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$

2) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first case, we get $\vert x + y \vert = 10 \quad \text{and} \quad \vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies that $x = \pm 10, y = 0$ or $x = 0, y = \pm 10$.

For the second case, we get $\vert x \vert = 8 \quad \text{and} \quad \vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that $x = \pm 8, y = \pm 8$.

So the polygon is a square with side length 10+8 = 18, and its area is $18^2 = 324$. The answer is: 324

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



We are given an equation and are asked to find the area of the polygon enclosed by the points that satisfy the equation.

First, we need to understand that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Thus, the given equation is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

Next, we solve each of these equations:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which gives two lines: $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which gives two lines: $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x \vert = 8$, which gives two lines: $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives two lines: $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

The lines divide the plane into 9 regions, and we can determine the vertices of the polygon by considering the intersections of these lines:

1. Intersection of $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ gives $(5, 5)$.
2. Intersection of $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$ gives $(-5, 15)$.
3. Intersection of $x + y = 10$ and $x = 8$ gives $(8, 2)$.
4. Intersection of $x + y = 10$ and $x = -8$ gives $(-8, 18)$.
5. Intersection of $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$ gives $(-5, -15)$.
6. Intersection of $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$ gives $(5, -5)$.
7. Intersection of $x + y = -10$ and $x = 8$ gives $(8, -18)$.
8. Intersection of $x + y = -10$ and $x = -8$ gives $(-8, -2)$.
9. Intersection of $x = 8$ and $y = 8$ gives $(8, 8)$.
10. Intersection of $x = 8$ and $y = -8$ gives $(8, -8)$.
11. Intersection of $x = -8$ and $y = 8$ gives $(-8, 8)$.
12. Intersection of $x = -8$ and $y = -8$ gives $(-8, -8)$.

The polygon is formed by connecting these vertices in a specific order. We can calculate its area using the shoelace formula. The vertices in counterclockwise order are $(5, 5)$, $(-5, 15)$, $(-8, 18)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(8, -8)$, $(8, 8)$, $(8, 2)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, $(-5, -15)$, $(5, -5)$, and $(5, 5)$.

The shoelace formula states that if the coordinates of the vertices of a polygon are $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), ..., (x_n, y_n)$ (in counterclockwise order), then the area of the polygon is given by 
$$\frac{1}{2} |(x_1y_2 + x_2y_3 + ... + x_ny_1) - (y_1x_2 + y_2x_3 + ... + y_nx_1)|.$$

Let's calculate the area using the shoelace formula:

$A = \frac{1}{2} |(5*15 - (-5)*5 + (-8)*18 - (-8)*(-2) + 8*(-8) - 8*8 + 8*2 - (-8)*8 + (-8)*(-8) - (-5)*(-15) + 5*(-5) - 5*5)$
$= \frac{1}{2} |(75 + 25 - 144 - 16 - 64 + 64 + 16 - 64 + 64 - 75 + 25 - 25)$
$= \frac{1}{2} |(-144 + 144)| = 0$.

However, this result is incorrect. The shoelace formula gives the area of the polygon formed by the line segments connecting the given points, but in this case, the vertices of the polygon do not form a simple closed polygon. The lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ intersect at $(5, 5)$, but they do not form a simple closed polygon because they are not connected at the other intersection point, $(5, -5)$. Similarly, the lines $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$ intersect at $(5, -5)$, but they do not form a simple closed polygon because they are not connected at the other intersection point, $(-5, -15)$.

Therefore, we need to consider the convex polygon formed by the vertices $(5, 5)$, $(-5, 15)$, $(-8, 18)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(8, -8)$, $(8, 8)$, and $(8, 2)$. This polygon is a hexagon. We can calculate its area using the formula for the area of a hexagon with vertices given by $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), ..., (x_6, y_6)$:

$$\text{Area} = \frac{3}{2} \sqrt{2(x_1y_2 + x_2y_3 + x_3y_4 + x_4y_5 + x_5y_6 + x_6y_1 - (y_1x_2 + y_2x_3 + y_3x_4 + y_4x_5 + y_5x_6 + y_6x_1))}.$$

Let's calculate the area using this formula:

$A = \frac{3}{2} \sqrt{2((5*15 + (-5)*18 + (-8)*(-2) + (-8)*(-8) + 8*2 + 8*5) - (5*(-5) + 15*(-8) + (-2)*(-8) + (-8)*8 + 2*8 + 5*5))}$
$= \frac{3}{2} \sqrt{2((75 - 90 + 16 - 64 + 16 + 40) - (-25 - 120 + 16 - 64 + 16 + 25))}$
$= \frac{3}{2} \sqrt{2(0)}$
$= 0$.

Again, this result is incorrect. The area of the hexagon is actually non-zero, but we made a mistake in calculating the area using the formula for the area of a hexagon. The correct formula should be:

$$\text{Area} = \frac{3}{2} \sqrt{(x_1y_2 + x_2y_3 + x_3y_4 + x_4y_5 + x_5y_6 + x_6y_1 - (y_1x_2 + y_2x_3 + y_3x_4 + y_4x_5 + y_5x_6 + y_6x_1))^2 - (x_1^2 + y_1^2)(x_2^2 + y_2^2)(x_3^2 + y_3^2)(x_4^2 + y_4^2)(x_5^2 +
