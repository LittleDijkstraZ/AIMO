Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ equals zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These two equations represent two squares with side length 10, and their intersection forms a square with side length 10. The same goes for the second factor $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

So the points that satisfy the original equation form a square with side length 10, and thus the area is $10^2 = 100$.

Let's write the Python code to calculate the area:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_square():
    side_length = 10
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = area_of_square()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 100

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
100
```
The area of the convex polygon is $100$ square units. The answer is: $100$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

 The equation given is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. For the product of two numbers to be zero, either one of the numbers must be zero. Therefore, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives the vertices of a square with side length 10, so the area is $10^2 = 100$.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives the vertices of a square with side length 16, so the area is $16^2 = 256$.

However, the first scenario is the only one that satisfies the conditions of the problem, because the second scenario implies that the absolute values of $x$ and $y$ are both equal to 8, which means that $x$ and $y$ must be either both positive or both negative. This would mean that the points lie on a line, not a square.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units. The answer is: $100$
