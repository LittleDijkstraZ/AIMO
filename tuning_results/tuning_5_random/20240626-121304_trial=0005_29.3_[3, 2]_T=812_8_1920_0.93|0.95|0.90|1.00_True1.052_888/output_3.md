 The given equation is a product of two terms, each of which is a sum of squares, equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero, or the second term is zero.

The term $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ is zero when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, and the term $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ is zero when $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two squares with side length 10, centered at the origin, with sides parallel to the axes. Their vertices are at the points $(5,5), (-5,5), (5,-5), (-5,-5), (5, -5), (-5, -5), (5, 5), (-5, 5)$.

The term $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ is zero when $\vert x \vert = 8$, and the term $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2$ is zero when $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two squares with side length 8, centered at the origin, with sides parallel to the axes. Their vertices are at the points $(4,4), (-4,4), (4,-4), (-4,-4)$.

The intersection of the two squares with side length 10 forms a square with side length 8. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of this square, which is $8^2 = 64$. The answer is: $64$

 The problem statement is incorrect. There is no mathematical problem to solve here.
The "polygon" mentioned is simply a square with side length 16.
The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The given equation is a product of two equations equal to zero, so we know that either the first equation is zero or the second equation is zero. This means that the points that satisfy the given equation are either on the curve defined by the first equation or the curve defined by the second equation. 

The curves are:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first curve, we have:
1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$.
2. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

From the equations $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$, we can deduce that the points lie on a square with side length 10 and vertices at $(\pm 8, 0)$ and $(0, \pm 8)$. Similarly, from the equations $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, we can deduce that the points also lie on a square with side length 10 and vertices at $(\pm 8, 0)$ and $(0, \pm 8)$. Therefore, the points that satisfy the given equation lie on the union of these two squares.

The area of each square is $10^2 = 100$. Since the two squares are identical and their intersection is a point, the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points that satisfy the given equation is the sum of the areas of the two squares, which is $2 \times 100 = 200$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $200$.
The answer is: $200$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $f(x, y) = ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ has a product of two terms equaling zero. This means that either the first term is zero, or the second term is zero.

The first term being zero implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$.

The second term being zero implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these four equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The polygon is a square with side length 16. To find its area, we simply square its side length: $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the polygon is 256.

```python

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The equation gives us a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression equals zero or the second expression equals zero.

2. Let's look at the first expression: $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$. This expression equals zero only when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. 

3. This gives us four equations: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. 

4. By solving these equations, we find the vertices of the polygon: $(5, 5)$, $(5, -5)$, $(-5, 5)$, and $(-5, -5)$.

5. Similarly, for the second expression, we have $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This expression equals zero only when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

6. This gives us four more equations: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. 

7. By solving these equations, we find the vertices of the polygon: $(8, 0)$, $(-8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, and $(0, -8)$.

8. Combining all the vertices, we have the polygon with vertices: $(5, 5)$, $(5, -5)$, $(-5, 5)$, $(-5, -5)$, $(8, 0)$, $(-8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, and $(0, -8)$.

9. Now we can calculate the area of the polygon. Using the formula for the area of a polygon with vertices given in coordinate form, we find the area to be 144 square units.

The answer is: $144$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The condition of the problem is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second one is zero.

2. Let's denote the first expression as $A = ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$ and the second one as $B = ((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. We have $A \cdot B = 0$, so either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$.

3. If $A = 0$, then $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This is possible only when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These equations describe a square with side length 10.

4. If $B = 0$, then $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This is possible only when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These equations describe a square with side length 16.

5. The convex polygon is the union of these two squares. Therefore, to find its area, we just need to add the areas of the two squares. The area of a square is the square of its side length, so the area of the first square is $10^2 = 100$ and the area of the second square is $16^2 = 256$.

6. Adding these two areas together gives the total area of the convex polygon: $100 + 256 = 356$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 356. The answer is: $356$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, notice that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to the following system of equations:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$,
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$,
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, and
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

Each of these equations represents a pair of lines in the $xy$-plane. 

1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ gives $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.
2. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ gives $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.
3. $\vert x \vert = 8$ gives $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.
4. $\vert y \vert = 8$ gives $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

This gives us a total of 8 lines, which when graphed, form a square with side length 16.

So, the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. The positive integer area of the convex polygon is 256.

The python script to solve the problem is:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    # The side length of the square is 16
    side_length = 16

    # The area of the square is side_length^2
    area = side_length**2

    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{256}$. The answer is: $256$
