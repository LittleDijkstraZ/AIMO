Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm10$ and $x - y = \pm10$. Solving these four equations, we get four vertices of the polygon: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$.

2. Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm8$ and $y = \pm8$. So the polygon is a square with side length 16.

3. To find the area of the square, we simply square the length of one side: $16^2 = 256$.

Now, let's write a python script to calculate the area:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

2. Solving these equations gives us the following:
   - $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$.
   - $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = \pm 10$.
   - $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$.
   - $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = \pm 8$.

3. Combining all these equations, we find that the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the original equation must lie on the following lines: $x + y = \pm 10$, $x - y = \pm 10$, $x = \pm 8$, and $y = \pm 8$.

4. These lines form a square with side length $20$.

5. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $400$.

The answer is: $400$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is: $0 = ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$

This equation is equivalent to: 

Either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

The only way the former can be true is if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two lines, so the solution set is the intersection of these lines, which form a rectangle with sides of length 20.

The latter can only be true if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which are the equations of two squares, so the solution set is also a rectangle with sides of length 16.

Taking the union of the two solution sets, we get a rectangle with sides of length 20 and 16. The area of this rectangle is $20 \times 16 = 320$.

However, this result seems to contradict the condition that the problem statement provides. We need to consider the absolute value function in the problem. The absolute value of a real number is either positive or zero, so the square of an absolute value is always nonnegative. Therefore, the only way for the product of two nonnegative numbers to be zero is if at least one of the numbers is zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. In other words, either $|x+y| = 10$ and $|x-y| = 10$ or $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$.

The solutions $|x+y| = 10$ and $|x-y| = 10$ form a rectangle with sides of length 20. The solutions $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$ form a square with sides of length 16. The union of these two solution sets is the required region.

The area of this region is the area of the rectangle plus the area of the square, which is $20 \times 16 + 16 \times 16 = 320 + 256 = 576$.

However, this result is not possible, because the absolute value of a real number is always nonnegative, so $|x+y| \geq 0$ and $|x-y| \geq 0$, which means that the only way for $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ to be true is if $|x+y| = 10$ and $|x-y| = 10$, which forms a rectangle with sides of length 20. Similarly, the only way for $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ to be true is if $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$, which forms a square with sides of length 16. The union of these two solution sets is the required region, which is the rectangle formed by $|x+y| = 10$ and $|x-y| = 10$.

The area of this region is the area of the rectangle, which is $20 \times 16 = 320$. However, this result is not possible, because the absolute value of a real number is always nonnegative, so $|x+y| \geq 0$ and $|x-y| \geq 0$, which means that the only way for $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ to be true is if $|x+y| = 10$ and $|x-y| = 10$, which forms a rectangle with sides of length 20. Similarly, the only way for $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ to be true is if $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$, which forms a square with sides of length 16. The union of these two solution sets is the required region, which is the rectangle formed by $|x+y| = 10$ and $|x-y| = 10$.

The area of this region is the area of the rectangle, which is $20 \times 16 = 320$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 320. The answer is: $320$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, we have a product of two expressions, which equals to zero. This implies that either the first expression equals to zero, or the second one equals to zero.

2. Let's denote the first expression as $A = (|x + y| - 10)^2 + (|x - y| - 10)^2$ and the second one as $B = (|x| - 8)^2 + (|y| - 8)^2$. So we have $A = 0$ or $B = 0$.

3. If $A = 0$, we have $(|x + y| - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(|x - y| - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$. These are the equations of two lines in the plane.

4. If $B = 0$, we have $(|x| - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(|y| - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. These are the equations of two circles in the plane.

5. The intersection of these lines and circles forms a polygon, which is a square with side length 10.

6. The area of the square is $10^2 = 100$.

Now, let's use Python to calculate the area:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def calculate_area():
    side_length = 10
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = calculate_area()
print(result)
```

The area of the convex polygon is $100$. The answer is: $100$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, notice that for the product of two numbers to be zero, one of them must be zero. So, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
3. If $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
4. If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$, which implies $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
5. If $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.
6. Now, we can plot these lines and find the intersections. The lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, $x - y = -10$, $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$ enclose a convex polygon.
7. To find the area of this polygon, we can use the shoelace formula. The vertices of the polygon are (8, 2), (8, -2), (2, 8), (-2, 8), (-8, 2), (-8, -2), (-2, -8), and (2, -8).
8. Applying the shoelace formula, we get the area as $\frac{1}{2} \left| (8*2 + 8*-2 + 2*8 - 2*-8 - 8*2 - 8*-2 - 2*8 + -2*-8) \right| = 128$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 128 square units. The answer is: $128$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 To solve this problem, we first analyze the given equation. The equation is equal to zero if and only if both terms are equal to zero. That is,
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$$
and
$$((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$
From the first equation, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.
From the second equation, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.
The intersection points of these lines are $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$. These points form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is $\boxed{256}$.
