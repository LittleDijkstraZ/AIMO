 The problem statement is not well-defined, as the equation provided does not represent a standard geometric shape or a combination of standard geometric shapes. However, if we take the equation as it is given, we can analyze the conditions for the equation to be true and deduce the area of the polygon formed by the points that satisfy the equation.

The equation is:
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]
For the product to be zero, one of the factors must be zero. So either:
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0\] or \[((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]
In the first case, we have:
\[(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0.\]
This is only possible when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives $x = y = \pm 5$.

In the second case, we have:
\[(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0.\]
This is only possible when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

So the points that satisfy the equation are $(\pm 5, \pm 5)$ and $(\pm 8, \pm 8)$. These points form a square with side length $10$, so the area of the polygon is $10^2 = 100$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $100$.

    # The points that satisfy the equation form a square with side length 10.
    side_length = 10

    # The area of the square is side_length^2.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. For the product of two numbers to be zero, one or both of the numbers must be zero. Therefore, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. 

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. These four lines form a square with side length 20.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. These four lines form a square with side length 16.

Therefore, the points that satisfy the given equation are those that lie in the square formed by the lines $x + y = \pm 10$, $x - y = \pm 10$, $x = \pm 8$, and $y = \pm 8$. The side length of this square is the larger of the two side lengths, which is 20. 

The area of a square with side length $s$ is $s^2$, so the area of the convex polygon is $20^2 = 400$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 400.

Here is a Python code to calculate the area:
```python

def polygon_area():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    side_length = max(20, 16)
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = polygon_area()

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, which equals zero if and only if both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only way for both of these equations to be true is if $x = 0$ and $y = 0$.

The second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$, which equals zero if and only if both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The only way for both of these equations to be true is if $x = 8$ or $x = -8$ and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

Therefore, the points that satisfy the given equation are $(0, 0)$, $(8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, and $(0, -8)$. These points form a square with side length 8. The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 64. The answer is: $64$

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, which means either one of the terms is zero. 

1. For the first term, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, both terms must be zero. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only way this can happen is if $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$. This gives us a square with side length 20.

2. For the second term, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, both terms must be zero. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The only way this can happen is if $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us a square with side length 16.

The area of the first square is $20^2 = 400$, and the area of the second square is $16^2 = 256$.

To find the area of the convex polygon, we need to subtract the area of the smaller square from the area of the larger square. The area of the convex polygon is $400 - 256 = 144$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $144$. The answer is: $144$

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.

If the first term is zero, we have $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us the rectangle with vertices at $(8, 10), (-8, 10), (-8, -10), (8, -10)$.

If the second term is zero, we have $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us the square with vertices at $(8, 8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8), (8, -8)$.

The intersection of the two shapes is the square, and the area of the square is $8^2 = 64$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 64. The answer is: $64$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. This expression will be zero if both $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x - y| - 10 = 0$. From these equations, we have $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$. The solutions to these equations are all the points $(x, y)$ that lie on the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, and $(0, -10)$.

The second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. This expression will be zero if both $|x| - 8 = 0$ and $|y| - 8 = 0$. From these equations, we have $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. The solutions to these equations are all the points $(x, y)$ that lie on the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The intersection of the two regions is the convex polygon formed by the intersection of the rectangle and the square. This polygon is a square with side length 8. The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$.

The answer is: $64$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:


The problem asks us to find the area of a polygon formed by the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

The equation is equal to zero if either of the two factors is zero. The first factor is zero when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two squares in the coordinate plane centered at $(0,0)$ with side length $20$. The second factor is zero when $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two squares in the coordinate plane centered at the origin with side length $16$.

The intersection of these squares forms a polygon. The area of this polygon can be found by subtracting the area of the smaller squares from the area of the larger squares. The side length of the larger squares is $20$, so their area is $20^2 = 400$. The side length of the smaller squares is $16$, so their area is $16^2 = 256$. The area of the polygon is then $400 - 2*256 = 400 - 512 = -112$. However, the area cannot be negative, so there must be an error in our calculation.

Upon further inspection, we realize that the intersection of the two squares is not a polygon, but rather a single square with side length $16$. The area of this square is indeed $256$. We must have made an error in calculating the area of the larger squares. The side length of the larger squares is actually $20$, so their area is $20^2 = 400$. The area of the polygon is then $400 - 256 = 144$.
The area of the polygon is 144. The answer is: $144$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The given equation is $ ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. 

For the product of two numbers to be zero, one of the numbers must be zero. So we have two cases:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. 

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. 

From case 1, we have two squares equal to $10^2$, so $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the square as $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0)$. 

From case 2, we have two squares equal to $8^2$, so $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the square as $(8, 0), (-8, 0), (0, 8), (0, -8)$. 

The convex polygon formed by the union of these two squares is a 8x10 rectangle. 

The area of the rectangle is $8 \times 10 = 80$. So the area of the convex polygon is 80 square units.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Abs

def polygon_area():
    # x and y are the coordinates of the points in the polygon
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # Case 1: (|x + y| - 10)^2 + (|x - y| - 10)^2 = 0
    case1 = ((Abs(x + y) - 10)**2 + (Abs(x - y) - 10)**2)
    # Case 2: (|x| - 8)^2 + (|y| - 8)^2 = 0
    case2 = ((Abs(x) - 8)**2 + (Abs(y) - 8)**2)

    # The polygon is the union of the solutions of case1 and case2
    # The solution of each case forms a square
    # The area of the polygon is the area of the rectangle formed by the union of these squares
    area = 8 * 10

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We have a system of equations. The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of them is zero. Therefore, we need to solve two systems of equations: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

2. For the first system, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This system represents a square with side length 10, centered at the origin.

3. For the second system, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This system represents a square with side length 16, centered at the origin.

4. The intersection of the two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for. The area of the convex polygon is the area of the smaller square, which is $(10)^2 = 100$.

Now, let's write the python code to calculate the area:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    side_length = 10
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area
