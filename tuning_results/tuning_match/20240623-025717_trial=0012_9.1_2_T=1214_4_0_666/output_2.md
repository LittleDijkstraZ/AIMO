 The given equation is $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. We want this equation to have $4$ distinct solutions.

We know that $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ must be a positive number since it's equal to $\frac{m}{100}$. This implies $m$ must be a positive integer.

Now, let's consider the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. We know that this function has the following $4$ piecewise forms:

1. If $x < 1$, then $f(x) = -(x - 1) - 2 = -x + 1 - 2 = -x - 1$.
2. If $1 \leq x < 3$, then $f(x) = (x - 1) - 2 = x - 1 - 2 = x - 3$.
3. If $x \geq 3$, then $f(x) = (x - 1) - 2 = x - 1 - 2 = x - 3$.

So, $f(x)$ is a "V" shape function with the "bottom" at $x = 1$, and the "walls" at $x = 3$ and $x = -1$. The height of the "walls" is $2$.

For the equation $f(x) = \frac{m}{100}$ to have $4$ distinct solutions, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be strictly between $0$ and $2$ (the height of the walls). Therefore, we have $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which implies $0 < m < 200$.

So, $m$ can be any positive integer from $1$ to $199$. Therefore, there are $199$ possible values for $m$. The value of $m$ that satisfies the given condition is $199$.
The answer is: $1$

 The problem is asking for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

First, we need to understand the structure of the equation. The absolute value function makes it non-linear, which can make solving it directly challenging. However, we can break down the equation into cases based on the value inside the absolute value.

Case 1: When $\vert x-1 \vert -2 \ge 0$, we have $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \vert x-1 \vert - 2$. So the equation becomes:
\[\vert x-1 \vert - 2 = \frac{m}{100}.\]
Rearranging terms gives us $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Case 2: When $\vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0$, we have $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = -( \vert x-1 \vert - 2) = - \vert x-1 \vert + 2$. So the equation becomes:
\[- \vert x-1 \vert + 2 = \frac{m}{100}.\]
Rearranging terms gives us $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Now, we can solve each case separately.

Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. This equation has two solutions:
\[x = 1 + 2 + \frac{m}{100} = 3 + \frac{m}{100} \quad \text{and} \quad x = 1 - 2 - \frac{m}{100} = -1 - \frac{m}{100}.\]
So, the equation has two distinct solutions.

Case 2: $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. This equation has two solutions:
\[x = 1 + 2 - \frac{m}{100} = 3 - \frac{m}{100} \quad \text{and} \quad x = 1 - 2 + \frac{m}{100} = -1 + \frac{m}{100}.\]
So, the equation also has two distinct solutions.

Therefore, for the original equation to have $4$ distinct solutions, we need to choose $m$ such that $2 < 2 + \frac{m}{100} < 3$ and $0 < 2 - \frac{m}{100} < 1$. The first inequality gives $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 1$, so $0 < m < 100$. The second inequality gives $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 1$, so $0 < m < 100$. Therefore, the only value of $m$ that satisfies both conditions is $m = 100$.

Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ that makes the equation have $4$ distinct solutions, and that is $m = 100$.
The answer is: $1$

Assistant:

 The equation given is $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, and we are asked to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions.

First, let's analyze the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.
The expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, can be positive or negative. This gives us two cases to consider:

Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$.
Case 2: $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.

For each case, we need to solve the equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$.

Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$.
$\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.
Now we have two subcases to consider:

Subcase 1.1: $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.
$x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Subcase 1.2: $-(x-1) = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.
$x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Case 2: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.
$\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Now we have two subcases to consider:

Subcase 2.1: $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
$x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Subcase 2.2: $-(x-1) = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
$x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

So, we have a total of four solutions: $3 + \frac{m}{100}$, $-1 + \frac{m}{100}$, $3 - \frac{m}{100}$, and $-1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

For these four solutions to be distinct, the fractions $\frac{m}{100}$ must not add or subtract to zero.
This means $m$ cannot be a multiple of 100.

Now we need to count the number of positive integers $m$ for which $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $-1$ and $3$.
This is equivalent to counting the number of positive integers $m$ for which $-100 < m < 300$.
The number of positive integers in this range is $300 - 100 - 1 = 199$.

However, we must exclude the multiples of 100 in this range, as those would result in degenerate solutions. There are 3 such numbers: $100, 200,$ and $300$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is $199 - 3 = 196$. The answer is: $196$

Assistant:


Step 1: Understand the problem
The problem is asking for how many positive integers $m$ does the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have $4$ distinct solutions.

Step 2: Analyze the equation
The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ involves absolute values, which means we need to consider two cases for each absolute value. This gives us a total of $2 \times 2 = 4$ cases to consider.

Step 3: Find the solutions for each case
For each case, we solve the equation and find the distinct solutions. Then we count the number of distinct solutions.

Step 4: Check the number of distinct solutions for each case
After solving the equation for each case and finding the distinct solutions, we check if the number of distinct solutions is $4$.

Step 5: Count the number of cases that give $4$ distinct solutions
After checking the number of distinct solutions for each case, we count the number of cases that give $4$ distinct solutions.

Step 6: Find the value of $m$
For each of the cases that give $4$ distinct solutions, we find the corresponding value of $m$ from the equation $\frac{m}{100}$.

Step 7: List the positive integers $m$
After finding the value of $m$ for each case, we list the positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition.

Step 8: Count the number of positive integers $m$
Finally, we count the number of positive integers $m$ that we found.

After performing these steps, we find that there is only one positive integer $m$ that satisfies the condition, which is $m = 200$. The answer is: $1$

 The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be rewritten as $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. The number of distinct solutions is determined by the value of $\frac{m}{100}$, and the number of solutions depends on the value of $\frac{m}{100}$.

Let's examine the possible cases:

1. If $\frac{m}{100}<1$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=0$, which implies that $\vert x-1 \vert =2$, and $x=3$ or $x=-1$. So there are only 2 solutions in this case.

2. If $1\leq \frac{m}{100}<2$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, and this equation has 4 solutions. This is the case we are interested in.

3. If $\frac{m}{100}\geq 2$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=2-\frac{m}{100}$, which implies that $\vert x-1 \vert =0$, and $x=1$. So there is only 1 solution in this case.

Therefore, the only possible value of $m$ that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions is when $1\leq \frac{m}{100}<2$. This means $100\leq m<200$. The positive integers in this range are the integers from $100$ to $199$, inclusive. The number of such integers is $100$.
The answer is: $100$

 The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

First, let's analyze the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.

The quantity $\frac{m}{100}$ is a positive number, which implies that the right-hand side of the equation is positive. The absolute value of a quantity is always non-negative, so for the equation to have a solution, the left-hand side must also be non-negative. This means $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert \ge 0$. 

The expression $\vert x-1 \vert -2$ can be positive, zero, or negative. 
- If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 > 0$, then $\vert x-1 \vert > 2$, which means $x-1 > 2$ or $x-1 < -2$. This gives us $x > 3$ or $x < -1$.
- If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 0$, then $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$, which means $x-1 = 2$ or $x-1 = -2$. This gives us $x = 3$ or $x = -1$.
- If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0$, then $\vert x-1 \vert < 2$, which means $-2 < x-1 < 2$. This gives us $-1 < x < 3$.

From the above analysis, we can see that the solutions to the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ must lie in the interval $(-1, 3)$.

Now, let's consider the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. The equation has four distinct solutions when the left-hand side equals $\frac{m}{100}$ exactly four times in the interval $(-1, 3)$.

This happens when $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to the distances between the points $-1$, $1$, and $3$ on the number line, which are $2$, $1$, and $2$, respectively. 

Therefore, we have $\frac{m}{100} = 1$. Solving for $m$ gives $m = 100$.

So, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. The value of $m$ is $100$.
The answer is: $1$
