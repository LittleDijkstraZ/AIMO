Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if either of the two factors is equal to zero.
For the first factor to be zero, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
For the second factor to be zero, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
These conditions define a set of lines in the $xy$-plane, and the points that satisfy these conditions are the intersections of these lines.
The lines $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$ form a square with side length 16.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon enclosed by these lines is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ equals zero if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. 

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations we get the vertices of the square: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$ and $(-8, -2)$.

The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$ and $(-8, -8)$.

Combining these two squares, we obtain a larger square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$. The area of this square is $(10\sqrt{2})^2 = 200$.
The answer is: $200$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So, in this equation, either $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$ or $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

If $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the distance between $(x, y)$ and $(-x, -y)$ is $10\sqrt{2}$ and the distance between $(x, y)$ and $(x, -y)$ is also $10\sqrt{2}$. This means that $(x, y)$ is on a square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$ and diagonals of length $20$. The area of this square is $(10\sqrt{2})^2 = 200$.

If $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means that $x$ is in the interval $[-8, 8]$ and $y$ is in the interval $[-8, 8]$. This means that $(x, y)$ is in a square with side length $16$ and area $256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is the maximum of the two areas, which is $256$. The answer is: $256$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Thus, the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies that $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ or $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$. The first case gives $x = y = 5$, and the second case gives $x = -y = 5$. So, these two points are $(5,5)$ and $(5,-5)$.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So, these four points are $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

Therefore, the polygon is a square with side length $10$. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation given is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. For the product of two numbers to be zero, either one of the numbers must be zero. This gives us two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The absolute values can be removed because both sides of the equations are nonnegative. This gives us the system of equations:
\[x + y = \pm 10, \quad x - y = \pm 10.\]
Solving this system of equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 2), (8, -2), (-8, -2), (-8, 2)$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. Again, the absolute values can be removed because both sides of the equations are nonnegative. This gives us the system of equations:
\[x = \pm 8, \quad y = \pm 8.\]
Solving this system of equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, -8), (-8, 8)$.

Combining the vertices from both cases, we find that the points satisfying the given equation enclose a 4x4 square with side length 8. The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$. The answer is: $64$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The given equation is equal to zero if and only if both of its factors are equal to zero. Thus, we have two sets of equations to solve:

1. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0 \implies \vert x + y \vert = 10$
2. $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0 \implies \vert x - y \vert = 10$
3. $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0 \implies \vert x \vert = 8$
4. $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0 \implies \vert y \vert = 8$

From equations (3) and (4), we get $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. 

For equation (1), we have two cases:
- If $x + y = 10$, then substituting $x = 8$ gives $y = 2$. Substituting $x = -8$ gives $y = 18$.
- If $x + y = -10$, then substituting $x = 8$ gives $y = -18$. Substituting $x = -8$ gives $y = -2$.

Similarly, for equation (2), we have two cases:
- If $x - y = 10$, then substituting $x = 8$ gives $y = -2$. Substituting $x = -8$ gives $y = -18$.
- If $x - y = -10$, then substituting $x = 8$ gives $y = 18$. Substituting $x = -8$ gives $y = 2$.

Thus, the vertices of the polygon are $(8,2)$, $(8,18)$, $(-8,-2)$, and $(-8,-18)$. Plotting these points on a coordinate plane and connecting them with line segments, we obtain a square with side length $20$. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$. 
The answer is: 400

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The expression equals zero if either of the terms equals zero.
The first term equals zero if either $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$.
The second term equals zero if either $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.
These give the following systems of equations:
$\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
Solving these equations gives the vertices of the polygon:
$(8, 0)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, $(-8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, $(0, -8)$, $(8, 8)$, and $(-8, 8)$.
Plotting these points and connecting them with line segments gives a square with side length 16.
The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
So the area of the convex polygon is 256.
The answer is: 256.

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, let's analyze the conditions given by the product of two expressions being zero. A product is zero if and only if at least one of the factors is zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
For the first expression to be zero, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. This means that either $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$. Similarly, for the second expression to be zero, we must have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means either $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
For the first expression to be zero, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means either $x = 8$ or $x = -8$. Similarly, for the second expression to be zero, we must have $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means either $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

Now, let's find the intersection points of these lines. The lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, $x - y = -10$, $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$ enclose a rectangle with side lengths 16 and 20. Therefore, the area of this rectangle is $16 \times 20 = 320$.
The answer is: $320$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression equals zero if either of the two factors equals zero.
The first factor equals zero if $|\pm x \pm y| - 10 = 0$.
This means $|\pm x \pm y| = 10$, or $\pm x \pm y = \pm 10$.
We can split this into four cases:
1) $x + y = 10$.
2) $x + y = -10$.
3) $x - y = 10$.
4) $x - y = -10$.
The second factor equals zero if $|\pm x| - 8 = 0$, or $|\pm y| - 8 = 0$.
This means $|\pm x| = 8$ or $|\pm y| = 8$.
We can split this into four cases:
5) $x = 8$.
6) $x = -8$.
7) $y = 8$.
8) $y = -8$.
The eight lines given by the above equations form a rectangle with side lengths $16$ and $20$. Therefore, the area of the polygon is $16 \times 20 = 320$. The answer is: $320$

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. This gives us two separate cases to consider:
Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This happens if and only if both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These equations represent two lines, $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. The intersection of these lines form a square with side length 10 and area 100.
Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This happens if and only if both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These equations represent two lines, $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. The intersection of these lines form a square with side length 16 and area 256.
The union of the two cases forms a rectangle with side lengths 16 and 20, and area $16 \times 20 = 320$. However, the points enclosed by the square formed in the first case are also enclosed by the square formed in the second case, so we are double counting them. The points enclosed by both squares form a square with side length 10, and area 100.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of the rectangle minus the area of the square, which is $320 - 100 = 220$. The answer is: $220$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The expression $A \cdot B = 0$ implies that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, for the expression given in the problem to equal zero, either

\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0\] or \[((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]

If the first equation equals zero, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations we get the vertices of the square to be $(0, 10), (10, 0), (0, -10),$ and $(-10, 0)$.

If the second equation equals zero, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these four equations we get the vertices of the square to be $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8),$ and $(-8, -8)$.

Plotting these points on the coordinate plane we find that the convex polygon is a square with side length $10$. Therefore, the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $A \cdot B = 0$ is true if either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, we have two separate cases to consider:
Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This can only be true if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$, which results in a rectangle with vertices at $(0, 10), (0, -10), (20, 0),$ and $(-20, 0)$.
Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This can only be true if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which results in a square with vertices at $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8),$ and $(-8, -8)$.
The intersection of these two regions is the convex polygon formed by the vertices of the square. The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$. The answer is: $64$.

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation is satisfied if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This implies that either $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
These conditions define a square with side length 16, which has an area of $16^2 = 256$. So the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$
