Certainly! let's derive the algebraic expression step by step:



1. The given equation is a product of two expressions equals to zero. This means that either the first expression equals to zero or the second expression equals to zero.
2. For the first expression: $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$. The sum of two squares can be zero only if each square is zero. So we have two conditions: $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. This gives us $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
3. For the second expression: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. Similar to the first expression, the sum of two squares can be zero only if each square is zero. So we have two conditions: $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. This gives us $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

From $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, we can deduce that the points must be in the square with side length 20 centered at the origin. From $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, we can deduce that the points must be in the square with side length 16 centered at the origin. The intersection of these two squares is a smaller square with side length 8 and area $64$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 64. Let's implement this in a Python program:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    # Side length of the smaller square
    side_length = 8

    # Area of the square
    area = side_length ** 2

    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 64

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
64
```

The area of the convex polygon is $64$. The answer is $\boxed{64}$.

Certainly! let's derive the algebraic expression step by step:


The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. For the product of two numbers to be zero, either one of them must be zero. Therefore, we have two cases:
Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, so $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us the lines $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.
Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, so $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us the lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
Combining these cases, we find that the lines form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

Now, let's write a Python code to compute the area:
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def square_area():
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = square_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is $\boxed{256}$.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Certainly! let's derive the algebraic expression step by step:



The given equation is 
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]

This equation is equal to zero if either of the two factors is zero. Therefore, we have two cases:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. In this case, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only way this can be true is if $x = y = 5$ or $x = -y = -5$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. In this case, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The only way this can be true is if $x = 8$ or $x = -8$, and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

Therefore, the four vertices of the polygon are $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(8,8)$, and $(-8,8)$. The polygon is a square with side length $10$, so its area is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$.

Certainly! let's derive the algebraic expression step by step:



The equation given is:

$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$

If the product of two numbers is zero, then either one of them is zero. So, we have two cases:

Case 1:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$$

This implies that both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which further implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only way both these conditions can be true is if $x = 0$ and $y = 0$.

Case 2:
$$((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$

This implies that both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which further implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The only way both these conditions can be true is if $-8 \leq x \leq 8$ and $-8 \leq y \leq 8$.

So, the points satisfying the given equation are either $(0, 0)$ or any point in the square with vertices at $(-8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(8, 8)$, and $(8, -8)$.

The area of this square is the side length squared, which is $16 \times 16 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$

Certainly! let's derive the algebraic expression step by step:



First, note that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Thus, we have two cases:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This gives us $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions are $x = 8, y = 2$ and $x = -8, y = -2$. These two points form a line segment.

Case 2: $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This gives us $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions are $x = 8, y = -2$ and $x = -8, y = 2$. These two points form a line segment.

Combining both cases, we find that the two line segments formed by the points $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$ enclose a convex polygon. The area of this polygon is the area of a square with side length $10$.

We can calculate this area as $10 \times 10 = 100$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $100$.

Here is a Python code to verify the answer:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    side_length = 10
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 100

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
100
```
The area of the convex polygon is $100$. The answer is: $100$.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

Certainly! let's derive the algebraic expression step by step:


First of all, the equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ can only equal $0$ if both the terms equal zero. Therefore, we get four sets of equations:

1. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10$
2. $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x - y \vert = 10$
3. $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8$
4. $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert y \vert = 8$

From these equations, we can deduce that the points that satisfy this system are $x = 8$, $y = 8$, $x = 8$, $y = -8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $x = -8$, $y = -8$. These points are the vertices of a square with side length $16$. To find the area, we can use the formula for the area of a square, which is side length squared, so the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$
