In order to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has $4$ distinct solutions, we need to understand the properties of the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. This function is a piecewise linear function with four pieces.

For each $m$, the equation $\frac{m}{100}$ represents a horizontal line in the plane. If this line intersects the graph of $f(x)$ at exactly $4$ points, then the $y$-coordinates of these points are all distinct.

We can visualize that for $m$ to be positive, the line $y = \frac{m}{100}$ must be above the $x$-axis. The maximum value of $f(x)$ is $3$ and the minimum value is $0$. Thus, the possible range of $\frac{m}{100}$ is from $0$ to $3$. So, $0 \leq \frac{m}{100} \leq 3$. Multiplying through by $100$ gives $0 \leq m \leq 300$.

Now we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ in this range such that the equation has $4$ distinct solutions. By analyzing the graph of $f(x)$, we can see that this happens exactly when $\frac{m}{100}$ falls strictly between the $y$-coordinates of the three "corners" of the graph. These $y$-coordinates are $0$, $1$, and $2$. Therefore, the possible values of $\frac{m}{100}$ are strictly between $1$ and $2$, so $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Multiplying through by $100$ gives $100 < m < 200$.

The positive integers in this range are the integers from $101$ to $199$, inclusive. To find the number of these integers, we can use the formula for the number of integers in an interval: $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has $4$ distinct solutions is $99$.


The answer is: $99$.

Approach:


The equation $| |x-1|-2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $2-1=1$ and $2+1=3$, i.e., $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 3$. 

This inequality is equivalent to $100 < m < 300$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from $101$ to $299$, inclusive. 

To count these integers, we subtract the smallest integer from the largest, and then add 1. 

Solution:
The number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the inequality $100 < m < 300$ is $299 - 101 + 1 = 199$.
The answer is: $\boxed{199}$.

To find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions, we need to consider the values of $m$ for which the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, can be interpreted as a "jump" or "gap" in the graph of the absolute value function.

The graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a "bump" function that has a maximum value of $2$ and a minimum value of $0$. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have $4$ distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the function, or when it is less than half of that difference.

So we have:

$$2 - 0 = 2$$

and

$$\frac{2}{2} = 1$$

So the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have $4$ distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100} = 1$. Solving for $m$ gives $m = 100$.

Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions, and that is $m = 100$. The answer is: $1$

Approach:



The number of distinct solutions of the equation $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ equals to $4$ means that the graph of the function $| |x-1| - 2 |$ intersects the line $y = \frac{m}{100}$ exactly four times. 

Let's first draw the graph of the function $| |x-1| - 2 |$. This function is a combination of two "V"s, with the vertices at $x=1$ and $x=3$. The "valley" of the first "V" is at $y=2$, and the "valley" of the second "V" is at $y=0$.

So, the line $y = \frac{m}{100}$ should fall into the gap between the two "V"s, intersect each of them once, and not intersect the x-axis. This means $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, so $0 < m < 200$.

Since $m$ is a positive integer, the possible values of $m$ are $1, 2, ..., 199$.

We need to count how many of these values of $m$ make the equation $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ have exactly $4$ solutions.

From the graph, we can see that this happens when $\frac{m}{100}$ falls into the interval $(0, 2)$. So, the number of such values of $m$ is $199$.

However, we have to subtract $1$ because $m=200$ doesn't satisfy the condition that the line $y = \frac{m}{100}$ doesn't intersect the x-axis. So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $198$.

The answer is $\boxed{198}$.

Approach:



The equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions means the right side $\frac{m}{100}$ is the distance between two 'jumps' of the absolute value function $| |x - 1| - 2|$. The 'jumps' occur when $|x - 1| - 2 = 0$ or $|x - 1| - 2 = 0$, which are $|x - 1| = 2$ and $|x - 1| = -2$. The latter equation $|x - 1| = -2$ has no solution because the absolute value of a number cannot be negative. So, we only need to consider $|x - 1| = 2$, which gives $x = 3$ or $x = -1$.

The distance between the two 'jumps' is $3 - (-1) = 4$. So, the right side of the equation $\frac{m}{100}$ should be equal to $4/2 = 2$. Therefore, $m = 2 * 100 = 200$. So, there is only one positive integer $m$ that makes the equation have four distinct solutions, which is $200$. So, the answer is $1$.
The answer is: $1$

Approach:



1. First, we need to understand the number of solutions of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. This equation has four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly less than $2$ but strictly greater than $0$. This is because the expression on the left side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, takes on all values in the interval $[0,2]$ and only at those values. 
2. Therefore, we have $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which gives $0 < m < 200$.
3. The number of positive integers $m$ in the range $(0, 200)$ is $199$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $199$.

The answer is: $199$.

Approach:

 To solve the problem, we need to find the value of $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly 4 distinct solutions.

First, we need to understand that the number of solutions of this equation depends on the value of $\frac{m}{100}$. The expression $\frac{m}{100}$ determines the "distance" between the vertical lines in the equation. The number of solutions corresponds to the number of times the graph of $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ intersects the line $y = \frac{m}{100}$.

The graph of $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a "V" shape with the lowest point at $y = 1$. The graph intersects the line $y = \frac{m}{100}$ at exactly 4 distinct points when $\frac{m}{100}$ is between 1 and 2 (inclusive).

This means that $1 \leq \frac{m}{100} \leq 2$. Multiplying all sides of the inequalities by 100 gives $100 \leq m \leq 200$.

Therefore, the value of $m$ that makes the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have exactly 4 distinct solutions is any integer from 100 to 200. The number of such integers is $200 - 100 + 1 = 101$.
The value of $m$ that makes the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have exactly 4 distinct solutions is any integer from 100 to 200. The number of such integers is $200 - 100 + 1 = 101$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly 4 distinct solutions is 101. The answer is: 101

Approach:

 We will first consider the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ and then analyze the number of solutions to the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.

For $\frac{m}{100}$ to be positive and an integer, $m$ must be a multiple of $100$. Also, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be positive and less than $2$, so $m$ must be less than $200$. Therefore, the possible values of $m$ are those multiples of $100$ from $100$ to $200$, inclusive.

For each value of $m$, we need to determine the number of solutions to the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. 

We know that $\frac{m}{100}$ is a positive number between $0$ and $2$. The left side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, can take on any value from $0$ to $2$. 

So, if $\frac{m}{100} = 1$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=1$. This equation has $4$ solutions.

If $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=2$. This equation also has $4$ solutions.

If $\frac{m}{100} < 1$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert<\frac{m}{100}$. This equation has $2$ solutions.

If $\frac{m}{100} > 2$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert>\frac{m}{100}$. This equation has $0$ solutions.

Therefore, the values of $m$ that result in $4$ solutions to the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ are $m=100$ and $m=200$. 

However, $m=200$ corresponds to the case where $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, which we have already counted. So, the only value of $m$ that gives $4$ distinct solutions is $m=100$.

Therefore, there is only $1$ positive integer $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. The answer is: $\boxed{1}$.

Approach:

 The number of solutions of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to the number of times the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ crosses the line $y=\frac{m}{100}$. 

We can see that the function $f(x)$ has a graph that consists of four segments of lines with slopes $\pm 1$ and $\pm -1$. The graph of $f(x)$ crosses the x-axis at $x=3$, $x=1$, and $x=-1$. This means that the function $f(x)$ will cross the line $y=\frac{m}{100}$ exactly four times if $\frac{m}{100}$ is between $1$ and $2$. This gives us $100 \cdot 1 < m < 100 \cdot 2$, or $100 < m < 200$.

The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are exactly the integers from $101$ to $199$, inclusive. The number of such integers is $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$.

So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 99.

The equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has $4$ distinct solutions,
which means the right side of the equation is strictly between $0$ and $3$.

From $0<\frac{m}{100}<3$, we can get $0<m<300$.

Since $m$ is a positive integer, $m$ can be any integer from $1$ to $299$.

Therefore, there are $299$ possible values for $m$.

The answer is $\boxed{299}$.

Approach:


To count the number of positive integer solutions $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions, we need to consider the possible values of $m$.

The right hand side $\frac{m}{100}$ must be between $0$ and $3$ because the absolute value of the left hand side is always between $0$ and $3$. This gives us the inequality $0 \leq \frac{m}{100} \leq 3$.

Multiplying all sides of the inequality by $100$ gives $0 \leq m \leq 300$.

We now need to find how many integer values of $m$ in the interval $0 \leq m \leq 300$ make the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have four distinct solutions.

By analyzing the number of solutions of the equation for different values of $m$, we find that the equation has four distinct solutions when $m$ is $100$, $200$, or $300$. So, there are 3 positive integer solutions for $m$.

Therefore, the number of positive integer solutions $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is 3. The answer is: 3

Assistant:

Approach:



First, we analyze the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\]

The left side of the equation is always non-negative, so the right side $\frac{m}{100}$ must be non-negative, which means $m \geq 0$.

Now, let's consider the absolute value function $\vert x - 1 \vert$. It splits into two cases:

1. If $x - 1 \geq 0$, then $\vert x - 1 \vert = x - 1$.
2. If $x - 1 < 0$, then $\vert x - 1 \vert = -(x - 1) = 1 - x$.

So we can rewrite the equation as:

1. If $x - 1 \geq 0$, i.e., $x \geq 1$, then we have $\vert x - 1 - 2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert x - 3 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$. This gives two equations:

   a. $x - 3 = \frac{m}{100} \Rightarrow x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$, and
   b. $-(x - 3) = \frac{m}{100} \Rightarrow x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.

2. If $x - 1 < 0$, i.e., $x < 1$, then we have $\vert 1 - x - 2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert -x - 1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, which is equivalent to $\vert x + 1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$. This gives two equations:

   a. $x + 1 = \frac{m}{100} \Rightarrow x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$, and
   b. $-(x + 1) = \frac{m}{100} \Rightarrow x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Now, we need to find the values of $m$ for which the equations in each case have $4$ distinct solutions.

For each case, we can plot the equations and count the number of distinct solutions by looking at the intersections. 

After analyzing the plots, we find that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is in the interval $(0, 2)$. This means $m$ is in the interval $(0, 200)$. The positive integers in this interval are $1, 2, ..., 199$, of which there are $199$.

So, there are $199$ positive integers $m$ such that the equation has $4$ distinct solutions. The answer is: $199$.
The answer is: $199$

Approach:


The number of distinct solutions to the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to 4 if and only if the value $\frac{m}{100}$ creates 4 "jumps" in the graph of the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. These jumps occur when $\frac{m}{100}=1$ and $\frac{m}{100}=3$. Thus, we want to find the values of $m$ that satisfy these conditions.

Solution:
First, we solve the equations $\frac{m}{100}=1$ and $\frac{m}{100}=3$ for $m$.
For $\frac{m}{100}=1$, we multiply both sides by $100$ to get $m=100$.
For $\frac{m}{100}=3$, we multiply both sides by $100$ to get $m=300$.
So, the values of $m$ that satisfy the conditions are $m=100$ and $m=300$.
Therefore, there are 2 positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions. The answer is: $\boxed{2}$

1. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly less than 2 but strictly greater than 0. 
2. This is because the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, can have a maximum value of 2 and a minimum value of 0. 
3. So, we are looking for the number of positive integers $m$ such that $0<\frac{m}{100}<2$. 
4. This translates to $0<m<200$. 
5. The number of positive integers in this range is 199.
