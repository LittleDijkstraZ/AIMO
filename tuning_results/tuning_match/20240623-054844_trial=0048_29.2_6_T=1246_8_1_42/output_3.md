"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, which means either of the expressions must be zero for the entire equation to be zero. This gives us two systems of absolute value equations to solve. The solutions to these systems of equations will be the vertices of the polygon. Then, we can find the area of the polygon using these vertices.

Step 1: Solve the system of absolute value equations $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
From the first equation, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which gives us two possibilities: $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$. Similarly, from the second equation, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which gives us two possibilities: $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.

Step 2: Solve the system of absolute value equations $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
From the first equation, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$, which gives us two possibilities: $x = 8$ or $x = -8$. Similarly, from the second equation, we have $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us two possibilities: $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

Step 3: Combine the solutions from the two systems of equations to find the vertices of the polygon.
We have the following combinations:
1. $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ gives $x = 10$ and $y = 0$.
2. $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$ gives $x = 0$ and $y = 10$.
3. $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$ gives $x = -10$ and $y = 0$.
4. $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$ gives $x = 0$ and $y = -10$.
5. $x + y = 10$ and $x = 8$ gives $y = 2$.
6. $x + y = 10$ and $x = -8$ gives $y = 18$.
7. $x + y = -10$ and $x = 8$ gives $y = -18$.
8. $x + y = -10$ and $x = -8$ gives $y = -2$.
9. $x - y = 10$ and $x = 8$ gives $y = -2$.
10. $x - y = 10$ and $x = -8$ gives $y = -18$.
11. $x - y = -10$ and $x = 8$ gives $y = 18$.
12. $x - y = -10$ and $x = -8$ gives $y = 2$.
13. $x = 8$ and $y = 8$ gives $x = 8$ and $y = 8$.
14. $x = 8$ and $y = -8$ gives $x = 8$ and $y = -8$.
15. $x = -8$ and $y = 8$ gives $x = -8$ and $y = 8$.
16. $x = -8$ and $y = -8$ gives $x = -8$ and $y = -8$.

Step 4: Identify the vertices of the polygon.
From the above combinations, we can see that the vertices of the polygon are:
$(10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(0, -10)$, $(8, 2)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

Step 5: Calculate the area of the polygon.
We can see that the polygon is a square with side length 20. The area of a square is given by side length squared, so the area of the polygon is $20^2 = 400$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 400. The answer is: 400

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:


The equation $A \cdot B = 0$ implies that either $A=0$ or $B=0$. Therefore, the given equation implies either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us a square with side length 10, and thus an area of $10^2 = 100$.

For the second case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us a square with side length 8, and thus an area of $8^2 = 64$.

However, since the points that satisfy both cases are the vertices of the two squares, the area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $100 + 64 = 164$.

The solution is: $164$.
The answer is: $\boxed{164}$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:

 The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is true if and only if either of the two expressions in the product is zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The first expression is equal to zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two lines in the coordinate plane.

The second expression is equal to zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of four lines in the coordinate plane.

The intersection points of these lines form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$.

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

Approach:

 The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations, we find that the points $(x, y)$ are $(-10, 0)$, $(10, 0)$, $(0, -10)$, and $(0, 10)$.

Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, so $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. These points are $(-8, 0)$, $(8, 0)$, $(0, -8)$, and $(0, 8)$.

The points that satisfy both equations are the four corner points of the square formed by the intersection of the two squares: $(-8, 0)$, $(8, 0)$, $(0, -8)$, and $(0, 8)$. The side length of this square is 16, so its area is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon formed by the intersection of the two squares is 256 square units.

The answer is: $256$.

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:

 The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either one of them must be zero. That means we need to solve two systems of equations to find the vertices of the polygon.

Let's start with the first expression:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0.$$
This equation is satisfied if and only if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which gives $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
Similarly, if $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which gives $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.

Now, we can solve these four systems of equations:
1. $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$. Solving these equations gives $x = 10$ and $y = 0$.
2. $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$. Solving these equations gives $x = 0$ and $y = 10$.
3. $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$. Solving these equations gives $x = -10$ and $y = 0$.
4. $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$. Solving these equations gives $x = 0$ and $y = -10$.

Now let's move to the second expression:
$$((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$
This equation is satisfied if and only if both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$, which gives $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
Similarly, if $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

Again, we can solve these four systems of equations:
5. $x = 8$ and $y = 8$.
6. $x = 8$ and $y = -8$.
7. $x = -8$ and $y = 8$.
8. $x = -8$ and $y = -8$.

Now we can find the coordinates of the vertices of the polygon by combining the solutions from the first and second expressions:
1. $(10, 0)$
2. $(0, 10)$
3. $(-10, 0)$
4. $(0, -10)$
5. $(8, 8)$
6. $(8, -8)$
7. $(-8, 8)$
8. $(-8, -8)$

These are the coordinates of the vertices of the polygon. The polygon is a square with side length 20, so its area is $20^2 = 400$.
The answer is: $400$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:

 The condition $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ implies that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. 

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0)$ and $(-10, 0)$. 

Similarly, if $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8)$ and $(-8, -8)$. 

The vertices of the polygon are $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0), (8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8)$ and $(-8, -8)$. Plotting these points on the coordinate plane and observing the pattern, we can see that these points form a square with side length $10$ units. 

The area of the square is side length squared, which is $10^2 = 100$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $100$ square units. The answer is: $100$

Approach:

 The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is equal to zero if either of the two factors is equal to zero. This gives us two sets of equations to solve:

1) $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$, $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$, and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.
2) $\vert x + y \vert - 10 \neq 0$, $\vert x - y \vert - 10 \neq 0$, $\vert x \vert - 8 \neq 0$, and $\vert y \vert - 8 \neq 0$.

For the first set of equations, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$. From these equations, we can deduce that $x = \pm8$ and $y = \pm8$. This gives us a total of 4 points: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

For the second set of equations, we can conclude that none of the absolute value expressions can be equal to zero. This means that none of the variables can be equal to zero. Therefore, the points we found are the only solutions to the equation.

Now we need to find the area of the convex polygon formed by these 4 points. We can see that these 4 points form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$

 The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if and only if either of the two factors is zero. This means that the points $\left(x, y\right)$ that satisfy this equation are those that satisfy either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. 

The first equation is satisfied if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of a square with side length 10 and area $10^2 = 100$.

The second equation is satisfied if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us a square with side length 16 and area $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the points $\left(x, y\right)$ that satisfy the original equation enclose a square with side length 10 and area 100. Hence, the area of this convex polygon is 100 square units. The answer is: $100$

The equation is equal to zero when either of the two factors is zero.

1) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$:

This means that both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This represents a square with side length 20 centered at the origin.

2) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$:

This means that both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This represents a square with side length 16 centered at the origin.

The convex polygon is the intersection of these two squares, which is another square with side length 8. The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$. So, the area of the convex polygon is 64.
The answer is $\boxed{64}$.

The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either of the expressions has to be zero for the product to be zero. So, we can solve the equation by setting each expression equal to zero and finding the corresponding $x$ and $y$ values.

Let's consider the first expression:

$$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0.$$

This equation is zero only when $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only way this can happen is when $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, and $(-5,-5)$.

Now, let's consider the second expression:

$$(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0.$$

This equation is zero only when $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The only way this can happen is when $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. But this case doesn't give us any new vertices, as the vertices we already found satisfy these conditions.

So, the vertices of the polygon are $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, and $(-5,-5)$. These form a square with side length $10$. The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side, so the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $\boxed{100}$

Approach:


The given equation is a product of two terms being equal to zero. So, either the first term $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$ or the second term $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

If the first term is zero, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that the points lie on a square with side length 10 units.

If the second term is zero, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that the points lie on a square with side length 16 units.

Therefore, the points satisfying the given equation are those that lie within the intersection of these two squares, which is another square with side length 8 units.

The area of a square is given by the square of the side length. So, the area of this square is $8^2 = 64$ square units.
The answer is: $64$

The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.

1. Let's consider the first expression, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. Since squares are always non-negative, the only way for this expression to be zero is if both terms are zero. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. For absolute values to be equal to a constant, the expressions inside the absolute values must be equal to the constant or its negation. Therefore, we have four equations:

   a) $x + y = 10$, b) $x + y = -10$, c) $x - y = 10$, and d) $x - y = -10$.

2. Similarly, for the second expression, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, leading to the four equations:

   e) $x = 8$, f) $x = -8$, g) $y = 8$, and h) $y = -8$.

3. Now, we need to find the intersection points of these equations to determine the vertices of the polygon. There are 16 possible combinations, but many of them are redundant or give the same point. After analyzing the intersections, we find that the polygon has 8 vertices, which form a square with side length 10.

4. To find the area of the square, we simply square the side length, giving us $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 100.
The answer is: $100$
