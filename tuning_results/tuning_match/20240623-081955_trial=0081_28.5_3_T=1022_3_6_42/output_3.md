Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The given equation is $ ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. 

The product of two terms is zero if and only if one of the terms is zero. So, we have two cases:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. 

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

From Case 1, we have $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$.

From Case 2, we have $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these four equations, we get the same vertices as before.

So, the vertices of the polygon are $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$.

Now, we can calculate the area of the polygon. It's a square with side length 10 units. So, the area is $10^2 = 100$ square units.

The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation given in the problem is:

$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$

This equation equals to zero if and only if either of the two factors equals to zero. Thus, we have two sets of equations:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From the first set of equations, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies $-8 \leq x, y \leq 8$.

From the second set of equations, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies $-8 \leq x, y \leq 8$.

So the points $\left(x, y\right)$ that satisfy the equation are those in the square with vertices $\left(-8, -8\right)$, $\left(8, -8\right)$, $\left(8, 8\right)$, and $\left(-8, 8\right)$.

The area of this square is the side length squared, which is $16^2 = 256$. So the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, simplify

def calculate_area():
    # The side length of the square is 16
    side_length = 16

    # The area of the square is the side length squared
    area = side_length**2

    return area

result = calculate_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The expression $AB = 0$ is equivalent to $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Thus the given equation is equivalent to $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

Each of the above equations implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, or $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The solutions to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ are given by the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.
The solutions to $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ are given by the lines $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.
The solutions to $\vert x \vert = 8$ are given by the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.
The solutions to $\vert y \vert = 8$ are given by the lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

Plotting these lines in the coordinate plane, we find that they form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So the area of the convex polygon is 256.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def calculate_area():
    # The side length of the square is 16
    side_length = 16

    # The area of the square is side_length^2
    area = side_length**2

    return area

result = calculate_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$
