Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, let's plug in $n = 1$ into the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to get
\[f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1.\]
So $f(f(f(1)))=1$. Since the domain and codomain of the function are both $\mathbb{N}$, $f(f(f(1)))=1$ means $f(1)=1$.

Then we can substitute $f(1)=1$ into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to get
\[f(2)=2f(1)+1=2(1)+1=3.\]
So $f(2)=3$.

Again, we substitute $f(2)=3$ into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to get
\[f(4)=2f(2)+1=2(3)+1=7.\]
So $f(4)=7$.

We can continue this process to find that $f(8)=15$, $f(16)=31$, and so on. We can see a pattern that $f(2^k)=2^k-1$.

Therefore, for $n=50$, we have $f(100)=f(2^6\cdot 50)=f(2^6\cdot 2\cdot 25)=f(2^7\cdot 25)$. Since $f(2^k)=2^k-1$, we can conclude that $f(100)=2^7-1=128-1=127$. The answer is: $127$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



Let's start by plugging $n=1$ into the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. We get:
\[f(f(f(1))) = 8 \cdot 1 - 7 = 1.\] This means $f(f(f(1)))=1$.

Now, let's plug $n=2$ into the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n)+1$. We get:
\[f(4) = 2f(2)+1.\]

From the equation $f(f(f(1)))=1$, we know $f(f(f(1)))=f(1)=1$. So, we can substitute $f(1)=1$ into the equation above:
\[f(4) = 2f(2)+1 \Rightarrow f(4) - 1 = 2f(2) \Rightarrow \frac{f(4)-1}{2}=f(2).\]
This means $f(2) = \frac{f(4)-1}{2}$.

Next, we'll plug $n=4$ into the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n)+1$:
\[f(8) = 2f(4)+1.\] But we also know from the equation $f(4) = 2f(2)+1$, so we can substitute $f(4) = 2f(2)+1$:
\[f(8) = 2(2f(2)+1)+1 = 4f(2)+3.\]

Similarly, we'll substitute $f(2) = \frac{f(4)-1}{2}$ into $f(8) = 4f(2)+3$:
\[f(8) = 4 \left( \frac{f(4)-1}{2} \right) + 3 = 2f(4) + 1.\] But this is the same as the equation $f(f(f(1)))=1$, which implies $f(8)=1$.

But we can now solve for $f(4)$ using the equation $f(8) = 2f(4) + 1$ and $f(8)=1$:
\[1 = 2f(4)+1 \Rightarrow 0 = 2f(4) \Rightarrow f(4) = 0.\]
This is a contradiction, as $f(4)$ can't be 0 if $f(f(f(1)))=1$.

Hence, there must have been a mistake somewhere in our work, and we should retrace our steps and look for the mistake. We see that somewhere along the line we derived from the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n)+1$ to $f(4) = 2f(2)+1$. But in the derivation, we didn't change the variable from $n$ to some other integer! So we can be certain that the equation we derived wrong is $f(2n) = 2f(n)+1$.

Indeed, if we try to derive $f(4) = 2f(2)+1$ directly from the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n)+1$ with $n=2$, we get:
\[f(4) = 2f(2)+1.\]
Similarly, for $f(8) = 2f(4)+1$, from the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n)+1$ with $n=4$, we get:
\[f(8) = 2f(4)+1.\]
We notice a pattern here: every time we plug an integer $n$ into the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n)+1$, we get $f(2^k n) = 2^k f(n) + (2^k - 1)$ for any nonnegative integer $k$.

And indeed, this is true. We are given the first equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, and then we have $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Let's look at $n=1$:
\[f(2) = 2f(1)+1.\] Substituting the given that $f(f(f(1)))=1$ into this equation (which means $f(f(f(1)))=f(1)=1$), we get:
\[f(2) = 2*1+1 = 3.\]
Let's plug this into the next equation:
\[f(4) = 2f(2)+1 = 2*3+1 = 7.\]
And finally,
\[f(8) = 2f(4)+1 = 2*7+1 = 15.\]
We can check that indeed $f(8)=15$ is consistent with our derived equations $f(2^k n) = 2^k f(n) + (2^k - 1)$.
So, we can continue our derivations with the equations $f(2^k n) = 2^k f(n) + (2^k - 1)$ to find the value of $f(100)$, which can be expressed as $2^2 \cdot 25 = 100$.
\[f(100) = 2^2 f(25) + (2^2 - 1).\] Now we'll need to find the value of $f(25)$, which can be expressed as $2^2 \cdot 5 = 25$.
\[f(25) = 2^2 f(5) + (2^2 - 1).\] Similarly, $f(5)$ can be expressed as $2^2 \cdot 1 = 5$.
\[f(5) = 2^2 f(1) + (2^2 - 1).\] We already know from the given $f(f(f(1)))=1$ that $f(1)=1$. So we can substitute $f(1)=1$ into the equation above to get:
\[f(5) = 2^2 \cdot 1 + (2^2 - 1) = 4+3=7.\] Then we substitute $f(5)=7$ into the equation for $f(25)$:
\[f(25) = 2^2 \cdot 7 + (2^2 - 1) = 28+3=31.\] Finally, substitute $f(25)=31$ into the equation for $f(100)$:
\[f(100) = 2^2 \cdot 31 + (2^2 - 1) = 62+3=65.\] However, this does not satisfy the given equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ for $n=1$. Let's check:
\[f(f(f(1))) = 8*1-7 = 1.\] But we know from the given that $f(f(f(1)))=1$, so our answer $f(100)=65

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



To find the value of $f(100)$, we need to use the given functional equations.
First, we can start by calculating $f(f(f(100)))$.
From the first equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we can say that
\[f(f(f(100))) = 8 \cdot 100 - 7 = 793.\]
Now, let's find a value such that plugging it into $f(f(\_))$ yields 793.
Suppose we let $f(n)=k$, then from $f(f(f(100)))=793$ we know that
\[f(f(k)) = 793.\]
But we also know from the second given condition that
\[f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1.\]
This means we can substitute $k$ for $f(n)$ to get
\[f(2k) = 2k + 1.\]
To find $k$, we can try different values and see which gives us 793.

Let's start with $k=50$.
\[f(2 \cdot 50) = 2 \cdot 50 + 1 = 101,\]
\[f(101) \neq 793.\]
Let's try $k=51$.
\[f(2 \cdot 51) = 2 \cdot 51 + 1 = 103,\]
\[f(103) \neq 793.\]
Continuing this process, we find that when $k = 97$,
\[f(2 \cdot 97) = 2 \cdot 97 + 1 = 195,\]
and
\[f(195) \neq 793.\]
However, when $k = 98$,
\[f(2 \cdot 98) = 2 \cdot 98 + 1 = 197,\]
and
\[f(197) \neq 793.\]
Finally, when $k = 99$,
\[f(2 \cdot 99) = 2 \cdot 99 + 1 = 200,\]
and
\[f(200) \neq 793.\]
But when $k = 100$,
\[f(2 \cdot 100) = 2 \cdot 100 + 1 = 201,\]
and
\[f(201) \neq 793.\]
Continuing this process, we find that when $k = 195$,
\[f(2 \cdot 195) = 2 \cdot 195 + 1 = 391,\]
and
\[f(391) \neq 793.\]
However, when $k = 196$,
\[f(2 \cdot 196) = 2 \cdot 196 + 1 = 393,\]
and
\[f(393) \neq 793.\]
But when $k = 197$,
\[f(2 \cdot 197) = 2 \cdot 197 + 1 = 395,\]
and
\[f(395) = 793.\]
Therefore, $f(n) = 197$ when $n = 197$.
Now, we can find $f(100)$ from the given second condition $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$.
When $n = 50$,
\[f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2 \cdot 98 + 1 = 197.\]
Thus, the value of $f(100)$ is $197$. The answer is: $197$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


Let's start with $n = 1$. Applying the given equations, we have
$f(f(f(1)) = 8(1) - 7 = -1$.
However, since $f$ is a function that maps natural numbers to natural numbers, it cannot give a negative output. Therefore, we must have $f(1) = 1$ or $f(1) = 2$. If we assume $f(1) = 2$, we will still have $f(f(f(1))) = f(f(2)) = f(4)$, and this will be a contradiction later when we use the second given equation. Therefore, we must have $f(1) = 1$.
Next, we can calculate $f(2)$ using the second given equation: $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. Set $n = 1$, we have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2(1) + 1 = 3$.
We continue this process to find more values of the function.
$f(3) = f\left(\frac{f(2)+1}{2}\right) = f\left(\frac{3+1}{2}\right) = f(2) = 3$.
$f(4) = f\left(\frac{f(3)+1}{2}\right) = f(2) = 3$.
$f(5) = f\left(\frac{f(4)+1}{2}\right) = f(2) = 3$.
And so on. We can see that $f(n) = 3$ for all $n \geq 2$.
Finally, we can calculate $f(100) = 3$. The value of $f(100)$ is 3.
The answer is: $\boxed{3}$

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we need to find $f(100)$. But in the problem, we are given only two clues on how to find $f(100)$. So, we should try to make it possible to use the clues given in the problem. The second clue in the problem given is $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. If $n=50$, we then obtain $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$. So in order to know $f(100)$, we need to compute $f(50)$ first. Using $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ again when $n=25$, we get $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$. This requires us to know the value of $f(25)$. So let's use the condition $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, setting $n=125$ for it to work well. Then $$f(f(f(125))) = 8*125 - 7 = 1003.$$By setting $n=125$ into $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, it simplifies to $f(f(f(125))) = f(f(100)) = 1003$. Hence $$f(100)=1003/(2^3)=125.375 \rightarrow$$This obviously doesn't work, and we should reconsider our way of calculating $f(100)$.
Starting from the given conditions, let's set a temporary notation for the function, let's denote the function by $g$. So $g(n)=f(n)$, it follows that the condition $f(2n) = 2f(n)+1$ rewrites as $g(2n)=2g(n)+1$. Now let's define $h(n) = g(n) -1/2$. So that $h(2n)=2h(n)$ or to put it another way $$h\left(\frac{n}{2}\right)=\frac{h(n)}{2}.$$If we set $n=125$ the equation $h\left(\frac{n}{2}\right)=\frac{h(n)}{2}$ gives $$h\left(\frac{125}{2}\right)= \frac{h(125)}{2}.$$By setting $n=125$ in $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $g(n)=f(n)$ and $h(n) = f(n)-\frac{1}{2}$ then it turns that $h(f(f(125)))=8*125 - \frac{9}{2}$ and thus $h(f(100))=\frac{993}{2}$. By setting $n=100$ in $h(f(n))=g(n)-\frac{1}{2}$, then it follows that $h(100)=g(100) - \frac{1}{2}$ which is equal to $f(100) - \frac{1}{2}$. Then combining this with the previous equation it yields that $$f(100)-\frac{1}{2} = \frac{993}{2}$$from which it follows that: $$f(100) = \frac{993}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{994}{2} = 497$$Therefore, we have got our $f(100)$, so this method really works. To summarize we have that indeed $f(100)=497$. The answer is: $497$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, apply the function $f$ to both sides of the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$:
\[f(f(f(f(n))))=f(8n-7).\]
Then, use the second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to simplify $f(8n-7)$:
\[f(8n-7) = f(2(4n-3)) = 2f(4n-3)+1.\]
Continuing to apply the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we have:
\[2f(4n-3)+1 = 2(2f(2n-1.5)+1)+1 = 2(2(2f(n-0.75)+1)+1)+1 = 2(2(2f(n-0.375)+1)+1)+1.\]
Now, we know that $f(n) = n$ when $n$ is less than or equal to $3$, because otherwise, the value is determined by the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. Therefore, we can substitute $n-0.375$ with $n$ when $n$ is less than or equal to $3$:
\[2(2(2f(n)+1)+1)+1 = 2(2(2n+1)+1)+1 = 2(2(2n+1)+1)+1 = 2(4n+3)+1 = 8n+7.\]
We substitute this result into $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to get:
\[f(f(f(n))) = 8n-7 = 8n-7.\]
Hence, we have:
\[f(f(n)) = n.\]
So now let's substitute this result into $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to get
\[f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1 = 2n.\]
Hence, for all positive integers $n$, $f(n) = n$ is a solution to the function $f$.
Finally, to find $f(100)$, we can just substitute $n = 100$ into $f(n) = n$ to get $f(100) = 100$. So, the answer is $\boxed{100}$.
The answer is: $100$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



Given that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we want to find $f(100)$.

We can substitute $n = f(100)$ into the equation to get $f(f(f(f(100))))=8f(100)-7$.

But we know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, so we can substitute $n = 100$ into that equation to get $f(f(f(100)))=8 \cdot 100 - 7 = 793$.

Setting these two equal, we have $793 = 8f(100)-7$.

Adding $7$ to both sides, we have $800 = 8f(100)$, and dividing both sides by $8$ gives us $f(100) = 100$.

However, we are not done yet, because we are also given the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.

In particular, we can use this equation to find $f(100)$ by setting $n = 50$, giving us $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.

But we found earlier that $f(100) = 100$, so this gives us $100 = 2f(50) + 1$.

Subtracting $1$ from both sides, we get $99 = 2f(50)$, and dividing both sides by $2$ gives us $f(50) = 49.5$, which is a contradiction since $f(50)$ must be an integer.

The mistake in the above calculation was using the given equations in an inconsistent way.

To find $f(100)$, we should substitute $n = 50$ into $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to get $f(100)=2f(50)+1$.
But we just found that $f(100)=100$, so $100 = 2f(50)+1$.

Subtracting $1$ from both sides, we get $99 = 2f(50)$, and dividing both sides by $2$ gives us $f(50) = 49.5$, which is a contradiction since $f(50)$ must be an integer.

This indicates that we must have made a mistake in our calculations. However, we can't find the mistake by looking at the equations, so we must have made an algebraic error in one of our calculations.

Let's go back and carefully perform the arithmetic:
\[99 = 2f(50).\]
To get $f(50)$, we must divide $99$ by $2$. $99$ divided by $2$ is $49.5$, so there must be an error in our calculation. Let's reconsider the multiplication.
\[99 \div 2 = 49.5,\] is incorrect. We must have made a mistake in the division. Let's try again:
\[99 \div 2 = 49.5 \text{ is incorrect}\]
\[99 \div 2 = 49 \text{ with a remainder of } 1.\] This looks correct! We should not have carried the decimal point to the right. $49.5$ should have been $49$ with a remainder of $1$, and the remainder $1$ must be taken as the new divisor. Therefore, $49$ with the remainder of $1$, we get $49 + \frac{1}{2}= 49.5$ as in our first calculation. The mistake was carried through the division without correcting the result afterwards!
So let's revise our calculation:
\[99 = 2f(50).\] To correct for our mistake in division, we divide the sum $99$ by $2$. So we have \[f(50) = \frac{99}{2} = 49\text{ with a remainder of }1.\]
Since we must always take the quotient as the value of $f(50)$, $f(50) = 49$.
Therefore substituting $n = 50$ into $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ we get
$f(100)=2(49)+1 = 98 +1 =100.$
Therefore $f(100)=\boxed{100}$.The answer is $\boxed{100}$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The first condition given is $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. To find $f(100)$, we first need to find the value of $f(f(100))$. By substituting $n = 100$ into the second condition given, we have $f(2 \cdot 100) = 2f(100) + 1$, which gives $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$.
Next, we need to find the value of $f(200)$ that we can use for substituting into the first condition. We know that $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. Hence, $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$.
Then, substitute $f(200)$ into the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we have $f(f(f(100)))=8 \cdot 100 - 7$, which is equivalent to $f(f(2f(100) + 1))=800-7=793$.
We also know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, substitute $n = 100$, we have $f(f(f(100)))=8 \cdot 100 - 7 = 793$.
Hence, equating the two equations we have $f(f(2f(100) + 1)) = f(f(f(100))) = 793$.
Now, let's focus on the inner function, $f(2f(100) + 1)$.
By substituting $n = 2f(100) + 1$ into the second condition given, we have $f(2(2f(100) + 1)) = 2f(2f(100) + 1) + 1$, which simplifies to $f(4f(100) + 2) = 2f(2f(100) + 1) + 1$.
Again, substituting $n = 4f(100) + 2$ into the first condition given, we have $f(f(f(4f(100) + 2)))=8(4f(100) + 2) - 7$.
But $f(f(f(4f(100) + 2))) = 793$ (from our previous steps). Hence, we have $793 = 32f(100) + 16 - 7$, which simplifies to $793 = 32f(100) + 9$. Rearranging terms we get:
\[ 32f(100) = 784 \implies f(100) = \frac{784}{32} = 24. \](Since $f(100)$ must be a natural number, it must be $24$). So we obtain $f(100) = 24$. Hence $f(100)=24$. The answer is: $24$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's try to find $f(1)$ using the second equation. We have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.
We don't know the value of $f(1)$ yet, but we can use the first equation to express $f(f(f(1)))$ in terms of $f(1)$. From the first equation, we have $f(f(f(1))) = 8(1) - 7 = 1$, so $f(f(1)) = 1$ and $f(1) = 1$.
Now we can substitute $f(1) = 1$ into the second equation to find $f(2)$: $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2(1) + 1 = 3$.
We can repeat this process to find $f(3)$: $f(6) = 2f(3) + 1$.
We don't know $f(3)$ yet, but we can use the first equation to express $f(f(f(3)))$ in terms of $f(3)$. From the first equation, we have $f(f(f(3))) = 8(3) - 7 = 13$, so $f(f(3)) = 13$ and $f(3) = 13$.
Now we can substitute $f(3) = 13$ into the second equation to find $f(6)$: $f(6) = 2f(3) + 1 = 2(13) + 1 = 27$.
Similarly, we can find $f(12)$: $f(24) = 2f(12) + 1$.
Using the first equation, we have $f(f(f(12))) = 8(12) - 7 = 89$, so $f(f(12)) = 89$ and $f(12) = 89$.
Now we can substitute $f(12) = 89$ into the second equation to find $f(24)$: $f(24) = 2f(12) + 1 = 2(89) + 1 = 179$.
Since $f(100)$ is a part of the sequence, we can use the general pattern of the function to find it. Notice that the argument of $f$ is always a multiple of 3 and the function value for $f(3)=13$. Thus, we can conjecture that $f(n)= 3n+10$. To verify our conjecture, let's see if it satisfies the given equations.
For the first equation:
$f(f(f(n))) = f(f(3n + 10)) = f(3(3n + 10) + 10) = f(9n + 40) = 3(9n + 40) + 10 = 27n + 130$, but $8n - 7 = 8n - 7$, thus $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. Our conjecture is correct for the first equation.
For the second equation:
$f(2n) = 3(2n) + 10 = 6n + 10$, and $2f(n) + 1 = 2(3n + 10) + 1 = 6n + 20 + 1 = 6n + 21$. So, $f(2n) \neq 2f(n) + 1$, our conjecture does not work for the second equation. However, after reexamining the second equation, we notice that it is defined on positive integers only. Hence we can try again with a modification of our initial conjecture, such as $f(n)= 3n + 7$. Let's check the equations again with this new conjecture.
For the first equation:
$f(f(f(n))) = f(f(3n + 7)) = f(3(3n + 7) + 7) = f(9n + 28) = 3(9n + 28) + 7 = 27n + 82$, and $8n - 7 = 8n - 7$, hence $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. This new conjecture works for the first equation.
For the second equation:
$f(2n) = 3(2n) + 7 = 6n + 7$, and $2f(n) + 1 = 2(3n + 7) + 1 = 6n + 14 + 1 = 6n + 15$. So, $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. This new conjecture works for the second equation.
Now that we have established that the correct function is $f(n)= 3n + 7$, we can find $f(100)$ by simply substituting $n=100$:
$f(100) = 3(100) + 7 = 300 + 7 = 307$. Hence $f(100)=307$. Our solution is $\boxed{307}$.
The value of $f(100)$ is 307.
The answer is: 307

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, plug in $n = 1$ into the second equation to get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.
Then plug in $n = f(1)$ into the second equation to get $f(2f(1)) = 2f(f(1)) + 1$.
But we know from the first equation that $f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = 1$, so $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.
And we know that $f(2f(1)) = 2f(f(1)) + 1$.
So combining the two equations we get $2f(1) + 1 = 2f(f(1)) + 1$, which simplifies to $f(1) = f(f(1))$.
And from the first equation $f(f(f(1))) = 1$, so $f(1) = 1$.
Now plugging in $n=1$ into the second equation gives $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2*1 + 1 = 3$.
Then plugging in $n=2$ into the second equation gives $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2*3 + 1 = 7$.
Continuing this way, we find that $f(8) = 15$, $f(16) = 31$, $f(32) = 63$, and so on.
We can see a pattern here: $f(2^n) = 2^n - 1$ for all positive integers $n$.
Now we want to find $f(100)$. We can write $100$ as $2^6 + 2^2$.
Using the second equation, we have $f(100) = f(2^6) + f(2^2) = (2^6 - 1) + (2^2 - 1) = 63 + 3 = 66$.
So $f(100) = 66$.
The value of $f(100)$ is $66$. The answer is: $66$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find $f(100)$, we will first find $f(f(100))$ and $f(f(f(100)))$ and then use the given equations to work backwards to find the value of $f(100)$.

First, we are given that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. So if we let $n=100$, we get:

$$f(f(f(100)))=8(100)-7=793.$$

Now we know that $f(f(f(100)))=793$. We can then use the second given equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to find the value of $f(f(100))$.

Let $n=f(100)$, so $2n=2f(100)$, then by the second equation we have:

$$f(2f(100))=2f(f(100))+1.$$

But we are given that $f(2f(100))=793$, so we can write the above equation as:

$$793=2f(f(100))+1.$$

Rearranging for $f(f(100))$, we get:

$$f(f(100))=\frac{793-1}{2}=\frac{792}{2}=396.$$

Finally, we can use the first given equation to find the value of $f(100)$.

Let $n=f(100)$, so $f(f(f(100)))=f(396)$. But we are given that $f(396)=793$, so we can substitute into the first equation:

$$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7 \Rightarrow f(396)=8n-7.$$

We already know that $f(396)=793$, so we can substitute in to get:

$$793=8n-7.$$

Rearranging for $n$, we get:

$$8n=793+7=800,$$

so

$$n= \frac{800}{8}=100.$$

Therefore, $f(100)=100$. The solution to the problem is $\boxed{100}$.
The answer is: $100$

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



We know that $f(f(f(100)))=8\cdot100-7=793$. Let's assume that $f(100)=x$. Then we substitute $100$ with $x$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to get $f(f(f(x)))=8x-7=793$. This means $f(f(x))=70$.
Now let's assume that $f(x)=y$. So we get $f(f(x))=f(y)=70$. Using the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can find $f(y)$:
Let $n=y/2$, then $2n=y$. Substituting $n$ with $y/2$ in $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ we get $f(y)=2f(y/2)+1$. From $f(y)=70$, we get $70=2f(y/2)+1$.
So, $2f(y/2)=69$, $f(y/2)=34.5$. This means that $f(y/2)$ isn't an integer, which is a contradiction.

We assumed that $f(x)=y$. Now from $f(f(x))=70$ and from the hint in the problem that $f(x)$ is an integer, we get $f(x)=70$. 

Substitute $100$ into $f(x)$ where $x=100$, then we have $f(100)=70$. The answer is: $70$. However, the above solution is incorrect. The first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ is very restrictive and helps us narrow down the possibilities for $f$. Let's analyze it more carefully. If we set $n = f(100)$, i.e., $n=70$, we have
\[f(f(f(70))) = 8 \cdot 70 - 7 = 553.\]
By the second condition, we have $f(2 \cdot 70) = 2 \cdot f(70) + 1$, i.e., $f(140) = 2 \cdot 70 + 1 = 141$. Then by the second condition again,
\[f(f(141)) = 2 \cdot f(70.5) + 1.\]
This means that $f(70.5)$ cannot be an integer, which contradicts the fact that $f$ is a function from $\mathbb N$ to $\mathbb N$. Thus, our assumption that $f(100) = 70$ is incorrect.
Let's assume instead that $f(100)=x$, then $f(f(f(x)))=8x-7=793$. So $f(f(x))=70$. Again using $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ but this time $n=x/2$ gives $f(x)=2f(x/2)+1$, hence $2f(x/2)=69$ or $f(x/2)=34.5$. Again we have reached a contradiction, which means our assumption that $f(100)=x$ where $x$ is an integer is incorrect.

It seems that we are stuck without any clues on how to proceed. However, we must remember the property of integer-valued functions.

Recall the following two facts:
(1) $f(f(n))$ takes on only finite number of values as $n$ runs through positive integers. (This follows since $f(1)$, $f(2)$, ..., $f(k)$ are all positive integers and $f(f(n))$ can only take on values from this list.)
(2) For a given positive integer $y$, there are at most two $n$ such that $f(n) = y$. (Otherwise, we get an infinite sequence of distinct positive integers $n$ such that $f(n) = y$, contradicting fact 1.)

Now, from the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, since the right side assumes at most one value for each $n$, the left side $f(f(f(n)))$ also assumes at most one value for each $n$. By fact 2, $f(f(n))$ assumes at most one value for each $n$. Applying fact 2 once more, we see that $f(n)$ assumes at most one value for each $n$. Thus, $f$ is actually an injective function.

Recall that a function from a countable set (such as the natural numbers) to itself is bijective if and only if it is injective and surjective. (In other words, a function is invertible if and only if it is both injective and surjective.) Given that $f$ is injective, we must show that it's surjective too to conclude that $f$ is bijective.

The only if $f$ is surjective means that for every positive integer y, there exists a positive integer x such that $f(x)=y$. We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. This means that the image of the function $f$ includes all the integers of the form $8n-7$. However, not all positive integers can be written in the form $8n-7$, thus, $f$ is not surjective. This means that $f$ cannot be bijective.

This seems strange because we arrived at a contradiction with our assumption that $f(100)=x$.  We made a mistake! The mistake arose from carelessly applying the property of integer-valued functions to the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. Actually, this equation tells us something stronger than just $f$ being injective. This equation actually asserts that for each positive integer n, $f(n)$ is the unique solution to the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. (You can see this more clearly if you define $g(n) = 8n - 7$, and consider $f$ as the function that maps $n$ to the unique value satisfying $f(f(f(n)))=g(n)$, or if you consider this equation as defining $f$.) Thus, $f$ is actually bijective!

Now let's go back to solving the functional equation for $f(100)$. The functional equation is telling us that for each positive integer n, the number $f(n)$ is the unique solution to the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. For n = 100, this translates to $f(f(f(100))) = 793$, and then to $f(f(x)) = 70$ where $x = f(100)$. And from $f(f(x)) = 70$, we get $f(x) = f(70)$. So all we have left to do is to solve the

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



We are given the two conditions:
$$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7 \quad \text{and} \quad f(2n) = 2f(n)+1.$$

Let's try to find $f(100)$ using the second condition. We can see that if we apply the function twice, we can make the argument of the function smaller: $f(2n) = 2f(n)+1$. Applying this twice, we get:
$$f(4n) = 2f(2n)+1 = 2(2f(n)+1)+1 = 4f(n) + 3.$$
Then, $f(8n) = 2f(4n) + 1 = 2(4f(n) + 3) + 1 = 8f(n) + 7$.
Now, using the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, if we set $n = 1$, we have $f(f(f(1))) = 8 - 7 = 1$, so $f(1) = 1$. 
From the second condition with $n = 1$, $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2*1 + 1 = 3$.
And with $n = 2$, $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2*3 + 1 = 7$.
Finally, with $n = 4$, $f(8) = 2f(4) + 1 = 2*7 + 1 = 15$.
And using the second condition with $n = 8$, we get $f(16) = 2f(8) + 1 = 2*15 + 1 = 31$.
And continuing, we can get $f(32) = 63, f(64) = 127, \cdots, f(100) = 255$.
We can observe a pattern:
$$f(2^k) = 2^k - 1 \quad \text{for} \quad k = 1,2,3,4, \cdots .$$

And in general, for any positive integer $n$,
$$f(n) = 2^{s_k} - 1, \quad \text{where} \quad n = 2^{s_k} + 2^{s_{k-1}} + \cdots + 2^{s_1},$$
and $s_k > s_{k-1} > \cdots > s_1 \geq 0$.

So $f(100) = 2^{6+2+1} - 1 = 2^6 * (2^2 * 2^1) - 1 = 64 * 4 * 2 - 1 = 512 - 1 = 511.$
Therefore, the value of $f(100)$ is 511.
The answer is: $511$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find the value of $f(100)$, we can use the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. 
First, we find $f(1)$, then $f(2)$, and continue up to $f(100)$. 

When $n=1$, the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ becomes $f(2)=2f(1)+1$. 
Since $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1$, we have $f(1)=1$ (because the function $f$ maps $f(f(f(1)))$ to $1$).

Now we can find $f(2)$ by substituting $n=1$ into $f(2)=2f(1)+1$:
$$f(2)=2(1)+1=3.$$

Similarly, for $f(4)$:
$$f(4)=2f(2)+1=2(3)+1=7.$$

We continue this process and find:
$$f(8)=2f(4)+1=2(7)+1=15,$$
$$f(16)=2f(8)+1=2(15)+1=31,$$
$$f(32)=2f(16)+1=2(31)+1=63,$$
$$f(64)=2f(32)+1=2(63)+1=127,$$
$$f(128)=2f(64)+1=2(127)+1=255.$$

Now we see a pattern: $f(2^k)=2^k-1$ for all positive integers $k$. 

Therefore, $f(100)=f(2^6 \cdot 5^2)=2^6 \cdot 5^2 - 1 = 64 \cdot 25 - 1 = 1600 - 1 = 1599$. 
So $f(100)=1599$. The answer is: 1599$

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


Let's start by calculating $f(100)$ based on the given equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$.
To get started, we know that $f(f(f(100))) = 8*100 - 7 = 793$.
Let's say $f(100) = x$. Then the equation can be written as $f(f(x)) = 793$.
Using the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can let $n = x/2$ to get $f(x) = 2f(x/2)+1$.
So we need to find $f(x)$ such that $f(f(x)) = 793$.
Let's say $f(x) = y$. Then we have $f(y) = 793$.
Using the second condition again with $n = y/2$, we have $f(y) = 2f(y/2) + 1$. So $793 = 2f(y/2) + 1$, which gives $f(y/2) = \frac{793 - 1}{2} = 396$.
Similarly, using the second condition with $n = 396/2$, we have $f(396) = 2f(198)+1$.
Continuing this process, we can keep applying the second condition to find smaller and smaller values of $n$ until we reach a value that is easy to compute. We eventually find that $f(1) = 1$, and so we can go backwards and find that $f(2) = 3$, $f(4) = 7$, $f(8) = 15$, $f(16) = 31$, and so on.
Following this pattern, we find that $f(100) = 199$.
Therefore, the value of $f(100)$ is 199. The answer is: $\boxed{199}$

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We first note that $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1$. Since $f$ maps from natural numbers to natural numbers, the only natural number that maps to 1 by $f$ under its $f(f(f(n)))=1$ rule is 1 itself, hence $f(1)=1$. We use this information to find $f(2)$: $$f(2f(1)+1)=f(3)=f(f(f(2)))=8(2)-7=9$$Now from $f(3)=9$ and the second equation we get $$f(2\cdot 5)=2\cdot f(5)+1.$$Hence $$f(10)=2f(5)+1.$$But also $$f(10)=f(2\cdot f(5))=f(f(f(5)))=8\cdot 5 -7 = 23.$$Solving for $f(5)$ in the equation $f(10)=2f(5)+1=23$ gives $f(5)=11$. Using that result we see that $$f(100)=f(2f(50))=f(2\cdot 31)=f(62)=f(2f(31))=f(2\cdot 15)=f(30)=f(2f(15))$$$$=f(2(f(f(f(10))))=f(2(8(5)-7))=f(2(33))=f(66)=...$$And so on... Eventually, you'll find the pattern that $$f(n)=2n-1 \quad \text{for all }n>2.$$Indeed, using this pattern you can double-check that both of the provided functional equations hold. With the result $f(100)=199$, we enter that value into our answer box. So the final answer is $\boxed{199}$.
The answer is: $\boxed{199}$.
