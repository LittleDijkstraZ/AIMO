Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Here's the step by step solution:



The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. This equation is satisfied only when both factors are zero. This gives us four conditions:

1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = \pm 10$.
2. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x - y = \pm 10$.
3. $\vert x \vert = 8$, which implies $x = \pm 8$.
4. $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $y = \pm 8$.

By solving these four conditions, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(8, 2), (8, -2), (-8, 2),$ and $(-8, -2)$. These vertices form a square with side length 16. The area of a square is given by the formula $side^2$, so the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $256$.

```python

def polygon_area():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

area = polygon_area()
print(area)
```

```output

```
The area of the convex polygon is $256$. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{256}$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Here's the step by step solution:



The expression $A \cdot B = 0$ is equivalent to either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. So in this case, we have either:

$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$$
or
$$((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$

If the first equation is zero, then we have:
$$\vert x + y \vert = 10, \quad \vert x - y \vert = 10.$$

This means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$, which simplifies to:
$$x = \pm 10, \quad y = \pm 10.$$

These are the coordinates of the vertices of a square with side length $20$.

If the second equation is zero, then we have:
$$\vert x \vert = 8, \quad \vert y \vert = 8.$$

This means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This forms a square with side length $16$.

Thus, the area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of these two squares. The area of a square with side length $a$ is $a^2$, so the total area is:
$$(20^2) + (16^2) = 400 + 256 = 656.$$
The answer is: 656

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Here's the step by step solution:



The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if both of its factors are equal to zero. That is, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get $x = y = 5$ or $x = -y = 5$. Similarly, if $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Combining these results, the points that satisfy the equation are $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, and $(-5,-5)$, and $(8,0)$, $(0,8)$, $(-8,0)$, and $(0,-8)$. These points form a square with side length $10$.

The area of the square is side length squared, so the area of the polygon is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: 100
```python

def area_of_polygon():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    side_length = 10
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

area = area_of_polygon()
print(area)
```

CODE RESULTS 100

The area of the polygon is $100$ square units. The answer is: $100$

Here's the step by step solution:



1. The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ can only be true if both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. This implies that $|x+y| = |x-y| = 10$.

2. The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ can only be true if both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $|x| = |y| = 8$.

3. The solutions of these equations are the points $(x,y)$ that lie on the square with vertices at $(\pm8,\pm8)$.

4. The area of this square is $8^2 \times 4 = 256$.

Here is a Python code to compute the area of the square:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def square_area():
    """Find the area of the square with vertices at $(\pm8,\pm8)$"""
    side_length = 8
    area = 4 * side_length**2
    return area

result = square_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon formed by the points satisfying the given conditions is $256$. So the numerical answer is $\boxed{256}$.
