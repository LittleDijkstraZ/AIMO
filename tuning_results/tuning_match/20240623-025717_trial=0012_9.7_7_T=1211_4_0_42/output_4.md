Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
To accomplish this, first list the problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge, and thens solve the problem step by step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 First, we have the function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ that satisfies the conditions:
1. $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ for all positive integers $n$.
2. $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ for all positive integers $n$.

We are asked to find the value of $f(100)$. To do this, we can use the second condition to find $f(200)$ and $f(400)$, and then use the first condition to find $f(f(f(400)))$, which will give us the value of $f(100)$.

First, using the second condition, we have:
\[f(2 \cdot 100) = 2f(100) + 1.\]
This simplifies to:
\[f(200) = 2f(100) + 1.\]
Then using the second condition again to find $f(400)$:
\[f(2 \cdot 200) = 2f(200) + 1.\]
This simplifies to:
\[f(400) = 2(2f(100) + 1) + 1 = 4f(100) + 3.\]

Now, we use the first condition to find $f(f(f(400)))$. Since $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we have:
\[f(f(f(400))) = 8 \cdot 400 - 7 = 3200 - 7 = 3193.\]
But $f(f(f(400))) = f(f(200))$ because $f(400) = 4f(100) + 3$. So we also have:
\[f(f(200)) = 3193.\]
Using the second condition to find $f(200)$:
\[f(2 \cdot 100) = 2f(100) + 1.\]
This simplifies to:
\[f(200) = 2f(100) + 1.\]
But $f(f(200)) = 3193$, so we have:
\[2f(100) + 1 = 3193.\]
Solving for $f(100)$, we get:
\[2f(100) = 3192 \implies f(100) = \frac{3192}{2} = 1596.\]

Finally, we find $f(100)$:
\[f(100) = 1596.\]

So, $f(100) = 1596$. The answer is: $\boxed{1596}$

The function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:
1. $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$.
2. $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.
We are to calculate $f(100)$.

First, let's use the second condition to find $f(200)$:
$f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$.

Then, let's use the second condition again to find $f(f(200))$:
$f(f(200)) = 2f(f(100)) + 1$.

Finally, let's use the first condition:
$f(f(f(100))) = 8*100 - 7 = 793$.
So $f(f(200)) = 793$.

Substituting $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$ into $f(f(200)) = 2f(f(100)) + 1$, we have:
$f(f(200)) = 2f(2f(100) + 1) + 1$.
Substituting $f(200) = 793$, we have:
$793 = 2f(2f(100) + 1) + 1$.
Rearranging the equation gives us:
$792 = 2f(2f(100) + 1)$.
Dividing both sides by 2 gives:
$396 = f(2f(100) + 1)$.

Now, let's substitute $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to find a pattern:
If $f(2f(100) + 1) = 396$, then $2f(100) + 1$ must be a number such that $f$ of that number equals 396.
We can try some numbers to see if $f(n) = 396$ for any $n$.
Let's try $n = 396$:
$f(396) = 396$.
But $f(396)$ should be equal to $2f(198) + 1$.
So we have:
$396 = 2f(198) + 1$.
Rearranging the equation gives us:
$395 = 2f(198)$.
Dividing both sides by 2 gives:
$197.5 = f(198)$.
But the function $f$ only takes natural numbers as input, so $f(198)$ cannot be a half number. Therefore, our assumption that $n = 396$ must be incorrect.

Let's try another number. Let's try $n = 198$:
$f(198) = 198$.
Then $f(198) = 2f(99) + 1$.
So $198 = 2f(99) + 1$.
Rearranging the equation gives us:
$197 = 2f(99)$.
Dividing both sides by 2 gives:
$98.5 = f(99)$.
Again, $f(99)$ cannot be a half number.

Let's try another number. Let's try $n = 99$:
$f(99) = 99$.
Then $f(99) = 2f(49.5) + 1$.
But $f(49.5)$ is not a valid input for the function $f$, since it is not a natural number.

Let's try another number. Let's try $n = 49.5$:
$f(49.5)$ is not a valid input for the function $f$, since it is not a natural number.

It seems like we're stuck in a loop. However, let's go back to the equation $792 = 2f(2f(100) + 1)$.
We can see that $2f(100) + 1$ must be an even number, because the product of $2$ and $f(2f(100) + 1)$ is even.
Let's try $n = 1$:
$f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 3$.
Then $2f(1) + 1$ is even.
So we can try $n = 2$:
$f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 7$.
Then $2f(2) + 1$ is even.
So we can try $n = 4$:
$f(8) = 2f(4) + 1 = 15$.
Then $2f(4) + 1$ is even.
We can see a pattern here: $f(2^n) = 2f(2^{n-1}) + 1 = 2^2f(2^{n-2}) + 2 + 1 = 2^3f(2^{n-3}) + 2^2 + 2 + 1 = \cdots = 2^n - 1$.
So $f(8) = 2^3 - 1 = 7$.
Let's check if this pattern holds for $n = 8$:
$f(16) = 2f(8) + 1 = 2*7 + 1 = 15$.
Then $2f(8) + 1$ is even.
So we can see that this pattern holds for all $n$.

Now let's use this pattern to find $f(100)$:
Since $100 = 2^2 * 25$, we have:
$f(100) = f(2^2 * 25) = 2^2f(25) - 1$.
Since $25 = 2^2 * 6.25$, but $6.25$ is not a natural number, this pattern does not work for $f(25)$.
However, we can use the pattern $f(2^n) = 2^n - 1$ for $n = 4$:
$f(8) = 2^3 - 1 = 7$.
Then $f(2*4) = 2f(4) + 1 = 2*7 + 1 = 15$.
And $f(2*8) = 2f(8) + 1 = 2*15 + 1 = 31$.
Continuing this pattern, we have:
$f(2^4) = 2^

Assistant:

 First, we need to use the given conditions to find the value of $f(100)$.

We start with $n=50$. Using the second condition, we have $f(f(100)) = 2f(50) + 1$.

Then, using the first condition with $n=f(50)$, we get $f(f(f(50))) = 8*50 - 7 = 393$.

But from the second condition, $f(f(f(50))) = f(f(100)) = 393$, so we have $f(f(100)) = 393$.

Substitute this into the equation $f(f(100)) = 2f(50) + 1$, we have $393 = 2f(50) + 1$.

Solving this equation for $f(50)$, we get $f(50) = \frac{393 - 1}{2} = 196$.

Now, substitute $n=50$ into the second condition again, we have $f(f(100)) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2*196 + 1 = 393$.

This result is consistent with our previous finding $f(f(f(50))) = 393$, so we can be confident that our calculation is correct.

Finally, substitute $n=100$ into the second condition, we have $f(f(200)) = 2f(100) + 1$.

Using the first condition with $n=200$, we get $f(f(f(200))) = 8*200 - 7 = 1593$.

But from the second condition, $f(f(f(200))) = f(f(200)) = 1593$, so we have $f(f(200)) = 1593$.

Substitute this into the equation $f(f(200)) = 2f(100) + 1$, we have $1593 = 2f(100) + 1$.

Solving this equation for $f(100)$, we get $f(100) = \frac{1593 - 1}{2} = 796$.

Therefore, the value of $f(100)$ is 796. The answer is: $796$

 The problem is to find the value of $f(100)$ given the function $f$ satisfies the following two conditions:
1. $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ for all positive integers $n$.
2. $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ for all positive integers $n$.

First, let's use the second condition to find $f(100)$. We know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. So if we let $n=50$, we get $f(100)=2f(50)+1$.

Now we need to find $f(50)$. We can use the second condition again with $n=25$, so $f(50)=2f(25)+1$.

Next, we need to find $f(25)$. We can use the second condition again with $n=12.5$, but $n$ must be a positive integer, so we cannot proceed this way.

However, we can use the first condition. If we let $n=25$, then $f(f(f(25)))=8*25-7=193$. From the first condition, we know that $f(f(f(25)))=f(193)$, so $f(193)=193$.

Now we can substitute $f(25)$ into the equation $f(50)=2f(25)+1$ to find $f(50)$. Since $f(25)$ is a number such that $f(f(f(25)))=193$, then by the first condition, we must have $f(25)=193$.

So $f(50)=2*193+1=387$.

Finally, we substitute $f(50)$ into the equation $f(100)=2f(50)+1$ to find $f(100)$. So $f(100)=2*387+1=775$.

Therefore, $f(100)=775$. The answer is: $775$

 The problem is defined by two conditions. The first one is $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and the second one is $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We need to find $f(100)$.

From the second condition, we can find $f(100)$ by setting $n = 50$, we get $f(2*50) = 2f(50) + 1$, so $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.

Now we substitute $n = 50$ into the first condition, we get $f(f(f(50))) = 8*50 - 7 = 393$. But we know that $f(f(f(50))) = f(f(100)) = f(2f(50) + 1)$.

Now we have an equation $f(2f(50) + 1) = 393$. To solve this equation, we can substitute $f(100)$ into the second condition, we get $f(2f(50) + 1) = 2f(f(50)) + 1$.

Comparing this with $f(2f(50) + 1) = 393$, we get $2f(f(50)) + 1 = 393$. Solving this equation, we find $f(f(50)) = 196$.

Again substitute $n = 50$ into the first condition, we get $f(f(f(50))) = 8*50 - 7 = 393$. So we have $f(196) = 393$.

Now we substitute $f(50)$ into the second condition, we get $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$. But we know that $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$ and $f(196) = 393$, so $f(50)$ must be such a number that $f(f(50)) = 196$.

From trial and error or by solving the equation $f(f(n)) = 196$, we find that $f(n) = 98$ is a solution. Therefore, $f(50) = 98$.

Finally, substitute $f(50) = 98$ into the equation $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$, we get $f(100) = 2*98 + 1 = 197$.

So $f(100) = 197$. The answer is: $197$.

The problem gives us two conditions for the function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$. The first one is $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and the second one is $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We are asked to find $f(100)$.

Let's start by finding $f(1)$. We can use the second condition with $n=1$, so $f(2)=2f(1)+1$. Since $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$, we know that $f(1)$ is the number that when taken through the function $f$ three times gives 1. So we have $f(f(f(1)))=1$. If we let $x = f(1)$, then from $f(f(f(1)))=1$ we get $f(f(x))=1$. Again using the second condition with $n=x$, we have $f(2x)=2f(x)+1$. So $f(2f(x))=2f(x)+1$. We know that $f(2f(x))=1$ (from $f(f(f(1)))=1$), so we get $1=2f(x)+1$, which implies $f(x)=0$. So $f(1)=0$.

Now we can find $f(2)$ using the second condition with $n=1$: $f(2)=2f(1)+1=2*0+1=1$.

Now we can find $f(4)$ using the second condition with $n=2$: $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2*1+1=3$.

Now we can find $f(8)$ using the second condition with $n=4$: $f(8)=2f(4)+1=2*3+1=7$.

Now we can find $f(16)$ using the second condition with $n=8$: $f(16)=2f(8)+1=2*7+1=15$.

We can see a pattern here. If we continue this process, we can find that $f(2^k)=2^k-1$ for all positive integers $k$. So $f(100)=f(2^6+2^2)=2^6-1+2*2^2-1=63+7=70$.

So, the value of $f(100)$ is 70. The answer is: $70$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
To accomplish this, first list the problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge, and thens solve the problem step by step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 First, let's list the problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge:

1. $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$: The function $f$ maps from the set of natural numbers to the set of natural numbers.
2. $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$: The function $f$ applied three times to $n$ is equal to $8n-7$.
3. $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$: If you apply the function $f$ to twice $n$, it is equal to twice $f(n)$ plus one.

To solve the problem, we need to find the value of $f(100)$. We can start by applying the second condition when $n=50$:
$$f(2 \cdot 50) = 2f(50) + 1 \implies f(100) = 2f(50) + 1.$$
Next, we can apply the second condition again when $n=25$:
$$f(2 \cdot 25) = 2f(25) + 1 \implies f(50) = 2f(25) + 1.$$
Now, we can apply the second condition once more when $n=12.5$:
$$f(2 \cdot 12.5) = 2f(12.5) + 1 \implies f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1.$$
Unfortunately, we cannot continue this process because $12.5$ is not a natural number, so we cannot directly use the second condition to find the value of $f(12.5)$.

However, we can use the first condition to find the value of $f(12.5)$. We know that $f(f(f(12.5)))=8(12.5)-7=87.5$. Also, $f(f(f(12.5)))=f(f(12.5))$. So, $f(f(12.5))=87.5$. Applying the second condition when $n=12.5$ again:
$$f(2 \cdot 12.5) = 2f(12.5) + 1 \implies f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1.$$
We can substitute $f(25)$ into the equation from $f(50)$:
$$f(50) = 2f(25) + 1 = 2(2f(12.5) + 1) + 1 = 4f(12.5) + 3.$$
And then substitute $f(50)$ into the equation from $f(100)$:
$$f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2(4f(12.5) + 3) + 1 = 8f(12.5) + 7.$$
We know from the first condition that $f(f(f(12.5)))=8(12.5)-7=87.5$, so $f(f(f(12.5)))=f(100)$. Hence, $8f(12.5) + 7=87.5$, and $f(12.5)=9$.

Finally, substitute $f(12.5)=9$ into the equation for $f(100)$:
$$f(100) = 8f(12.5) + 7 = 8 \cdot 9 + 7 = 72 + 7 = 79.$$
So, the value of $f(100)$ is $79$. The answer is:
$$79$$

Firstly, let's consider the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.
If we set $n=1$, we have $f(2)=2f(1)+1$.
Now, substituting $f(2)$ into the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we have $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$.
This implies that $f(f(2))=1$.
Substituting $f(2)=2f(1)+1$ into this equation, we get $f(2f(1)+1)=1$.
Now, we can use the second condition again to get $f(2f(1)+1)=2f(\frac{2f(1)+1}{2})+1=2f(f(1))+1=1$.
This implies that $2f(f(1))+1=1$, so $f(f(1))=0$.
Again using the first condition, we have $f(f(f(1)))=1$, so $f(0)=1$.

Now, substituting $n=2$ into the second condition, we have $f(4)=2f(2)+1$.
Using the value of $f(2)$ from before, we get $f(4)=2(2f(1)+1)+1=4f(1)+3$.
Substituting this into the first condition with $n=2$, we have $f(f(f(2)))=8*2-7=9$.
Substituting $f(2)=2f(1)+1$, we get $f(f(2f(1)+1))=9$.
Substituting $f(2f(1)+1)=1$, we get $f(1)=9$.

Now we have $f(0)=1$, $f(1)=9$, and $f(2)=2f(1)+1=19$.
We can continue this process to find $f(3)$, $f(4)$, and so on, until we find $f(100)$.
However, this process can be time-consuming, so we need a more systematic approach.

Notice that the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ suggests that the function $f$ is doubling its argument and then adding 1.
So let's assume that $f(n)=2n+k$, where $k$ is a constant.
Substituting this into the second condition, we have $f(2n)=2(2n+k)+1=4n+2k+1$.
This should equal $2f(n)+1=2(2n+k)+1=4n+2k+1$.
So our assumption that $f(n)=2n+k$ is correct.

Now, we can use the first condition to find the value of $k$.
We have $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$.
Substituting $f(n)=2n+k$, we get $f(f(2n+k))=8n-7$.
Substituting $f(2n+k)=4n+2k+1$, we get $f(4n+2k)=8n-7$.
Substituting $f(4n+2k)=2(4n+2k)+k=8n+4k+k=8n+5k$, we have $8n+5k=8n-7$.
This implies that $5k=-7$, so $k=-\frac{7}{5}$.
But $k$ should be a constant, so there seems to be a mistake.

Let's go back and reconsider our assumption that $f(n)=2n+k$.
Notice that we assumed that $k$ is a constant.
But in the second condition, we have $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.
If we let $f(n)=2n+k(n)$, where $k(n)$ is a function of $n$, then the equation becomes $2n+k(2n)=2(2n+k(n))+1$.
Simplifying, we get $2n+k(2n)=4n+2k(n)+1$.
Rearranging, we have $k(2n)-2k(n)=2n+1$.
This suggests that $k(n)$ is an increasing function.

Let's try a different approach.
Let's assume that $f(n)=2^a(n+b)$, where $a$ and $b$ are constants.
Substituting this into the second condition, we have $f(2n)=2^a(2n+b)=2(2^a(n+b))+1=2f(n)+1$.
This implies that $2^a=2$, so $a=1$.
Then we have $f(n)=2(n+b)=2n+2b$.
Substituting this into the first condition, we have $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$.
Substituting $f(n)=2n+2b$, we get $f(f(2n+2b))=8n-7$.
Substituting $f(2n+2b)=2(2n+2b)+2b=4n+4b+2b=4n+6b$, we have $f(4n+6b)=8n-7$.
Substituting $f(4n+6b)=2(4n+6b)+2b=8n+12b+2b=8n+14b$, we have $8n+14b=8n-7$.
This implies that $14b=-7$, so $b=-\frac{1}{2}$.
Finally, we have $f(n)=2(n-\frac{1}{2})=2n-1$.

Now, let's check if this solution satisfies both conditions.
For the first condition, we have $f(f(f(n)))=f(f(2n-1))=f(2(2n-1)-1)=f(4n-3)=8n-7$.
For the second condition, we have $f(2n)=2(2n-1)+1=4n-1$.
So both conditions are satisfied with $f(n)=2n-1$.

Finally, we can calculate $f(100)=2*100-1=199$.
The answer is: $199$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
To accomplish this, first list the problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge, and thens solve the problem step by step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 First, let's list the problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge:

1. The function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:
    a. $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$
    b. $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$
2. We need to calculate $f(100)$.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

Since we know $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we can set $n=100$ to get $f(f(f(100)))=8*100-7=793$.

Then, we know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Let's set $n=f(100)$ to get $f(2f(100))=2f(f(100))+1$. We already know $f(f(f(100)))=793$, so we can substitute this into the equation to get $f(2f(100))=2*793+1=1587$.

Now, let's set $n=f(100)/2$ in the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to get $f(f(100))=2f(f(100)/2)+1$. We know $f(f(f(100)))=793$, so we can substitute this into the equation to get $793=2f(f(100)/2)+1$. Solving for $f(f(100)/2)$ gives us $f(f(100)/2)=(793-1)/2=396$.

Finally, let's set $n=f(100)/4$ in the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to get $f(f(100)/2)=2f(f(100)/4)+1$. We know $f(f(100)/2)=396$, so we can substitute this into the equation to get $396=2f(f(100)/4)+1$. Solving for $f(f(100)/4)$ gives us $f(f(100)/4)=(396-1)/2=198$.

Now, we have $f(f(100)/4)=198$, and we also know that $f(f(f(100)))=793$. If we substitute $f(f(100))=793$ into the equation $f(f(f(100)))=8n-7$, we get $793=8n-7$, solving for $n$ gives us $n=(793+7)/8=100$.

So, we have found that $f(100)=100$. The value of $f(100)$ is 100. The answer is: $100$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."

First, we are given the function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ with two conditions:
1. $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ for all positive integers $n$.
2. $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ for all positive integers $n$.

We are asked to find the value of $f(100)$.

To solve this problem, we need to find a pattern or relationship between the function $f(n)$ and $n$. We can start by plugging in some values for $n$ into the given conditions and see if we can find a pattern.

Let's start with the second condition:
For $n=1$, we have $f(2)=2f(1)+1$.
For $n=2$, we have $f(4)=2f(2)+1$.
For $n=3$, we have $f(6)=2f(3)+1$.
And so on...

We can see a pattern here: $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. This implies that $f(n)$ is an increasing function.

Now let's try the first condition:
For $n=1$, we have $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1$. This implies that $f(f(1))=1$, since $f(1)$ is the only value that makes $f(f(f(1)))=1$.

Let's set $f(1)=a$. Then we have $f(a)=1$.

Now we can substitute $f(1)=a$ into the second condition:
$f(2)=2f(1)+1=2a+1$.
$f(4)=2f(2)+1=2(2a+1)+1=4a+3$.
$f(8)=2f(4)+1=2(4a+3)+1=8a+7$.
And so on...

We can see that $f(2^k)=2^k a + (2^k - 1)$.

Now let's use the first condition to find the value of $a$.
For $n=1$, we have $f(f(f(1)))=1$.
Substituting $f(1)=a$, we have $f(f(a))=1$.
Substituting $f(a)=1$, we have $f(1)=1$.
So $a=1$.

Therefore, $f(n)=2^k - 1$ for $n=2^k$.

Now we can find $f(100)$.
$100 = 2^6 \cdot 5$, so $f(100)=f(2^6)=2^6 - 1 = 64 - 1 = 63$.

So, $f(100)=63$. The answer is: $63$

Assistant:

 The problem gives us two conditions to work with:
1. $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$
2. $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$

To find $f(100)$, we need to use these conditions in an efficient manner. Let's first try to find $f(1)$, because we can use the second condition with $n=1$ to find it: $f(2)=2f(1)+1$. But we don't know $f(1)$ yet, so we can't solve this equation directly. However, we can use the first condition with $n=1$ to get $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$, which means $f(f(1))$ is the only value that $f$ maps to 1. 

Now, let's try to find $f(2)$ using the second condition with $n=2$: $f(4)=2f(2)+1$. But we don't know $f(2)$ yet, so we can't solve this equation directly. However, we know that $f(f(1))=1$, so we can substitute $f(2)$ in the second condition with $n=1$: $f(2)=2f(1)+1$. Combining these two equations, we have:
\[f(4)=2(2f(1)+1)+1=4f(1)+3.\]

Now we can use the first condition with $n=2$: $f(f(f(2)))=8*2-7=9$. We know $f(f(1))=1$, so $f(f(2))=9$ implies $f(2)=9$. Then we substitute $f(2)=9$ into the equation $f(4)=4f(1)+3$:
\[9=4f(1)+3.\]
Solving this equation gives us $f(1)=1.5$. But this contradicts with the fact that $f(n)$ is a natural number for all positive integers $n$, so our assumption that $f(1)=1.5$ must be wrong.

Let's try another approach. We know that $f(f(1))=1$, so if $f(1)$ is a natural number, then $f(1)$ must be 1. Then we substitute $f(1)=1$ into the second condition with $n=1$: $f(2)=2f(1)+1=3$. We can substitute $f(2)=3$ into the equation $f(4)=4f(1)+3$:
\[f(4)=4*1+3=7.\]

Now we can use the first condition with $n=4$: $f(f(f(4)))=8*4-7=27$. We know $f(f(2))=9$ and $f(f(1))=1$, so $f(f(4))=27$ implies $f(4)=27$. Then we substitute $f(4)=27$ into the equation $f(8)=2f(4)+1=55$.

Finally, we can use the first condition with $n=100$: $f(f(f(100)))=8*100-7=793$. We know $f(f(4))=27$ and $f(f(8))=55$, so $f(f(f(100)))=793$ implies $f(100)=793$. Therefore, $f(100)=793$.
The answer is: $793$.

 First, let's denote $f(100)$ as $x$. We want to find the value of $x$.

From the second equation, we can express $f(f(100)) = f(x)$ as $f(x) = 2f(50) + 1$.

Again from the second equation, we can express $f(f(x)) = f(2f(50) + 1)$ as $f(2f(50) + 1) = 2f(f(50)) + 1$.

Then we substitute the first equation into the above equation, we get $f(2f(50) + 1) = 2(8*50-7) + 1 = 2(400-7) + 1 = 2*393 + 1 = 787$.

Again from the second equation, we can express $f(f(f(100))) = f(787)$ as $f(787) = 2f(393.5) + 1$. But $f(n)$ is defined only for natural numbers, so $393.5$ must be wrong.

Then we look at the first equation again. If we let $n = f(50)$, then $f(f(f(50))) = 8*50 - 7 = 393$. So $f(393) = 2f(50) + 1$.

Again from the second equation, we can express $f(f(393)) = f(2f(50) + 1)$ as $f(2f(50) + 1) = 2f(f(50)) + 1$.

Then we substitute $f(393) = 2f(50) + 1$ into the above equation, we get $f(2f(50) + 1) = 2*f(393) + 1 = 2*(2f(50) + 1) + 1 = 4f(50) + 3$.

But we know $f(2f(50) + 1) = 787$, so $787 = 4f(50) + 3$, which simplifies to $4f(50) = 784$, and further simplifies to $f(50) = 196$.

Then from the second equation, we can express $f(f(50)) = f(196)$ as $f(196) = 2f(98) + 1$.

Again from the second equation, we can express $f(f(196)) = f(2f(98) + 1)$ as $f(2f(98) + 1) = 2f(f(98)) + 1$.

Then we substitute the first equation into the above equation, we get $f(2f(98) + 1) = 2(8*98-7) + 1 = 2(784-7) + 1 = 2*777 + 1 = 1555$.

But we know $f(2f(50) + 1) = 787$, so $787 = 1555$, which is a contradiction.

However, we made a mistake in our derivation. We should not have substituted $393.5$ into the second equation. We should have realized that $f(393)$ is not defined because $393$ is not a natural number. 

Let's start over.

From the first equation, if we let $n = f(50)$, then $f(f(f(50))) = 8*50 - 7 = 393$. So $f(393) = f(f(f(50))) = 393$.

Then from the second equation, we can express $f(f(393)) = f(2f(50) + 1)$ as $f(2f(50) + 1) = 2f(f(50)) + 1 = 2*393 + 1 = 787$.

But we know $f(2f(50) + 1) = 787$, so $787 = 787$. This is consistent with our previous derivation.

So we have $f(100) = x = f(50) = 196$. The final numerical answer is $196$. The answer is: $196$.

First, let's list the problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge:

1. The function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the conditions $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ for all positive integers $n$.
2. We are asked to calculate $f(100)$.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

We want to find $f(100)$, so we can use the second condition to find $f(200)$:
$$f(200) = 2f(100) + 1.$$

Then, we can use this result to find $f(400)$:
$$f(400) = 2f(200) + 1 = 2(2f(100) + 1) + 1 = 4f(100) + 3.$$

Finally, we can use the first condition to find $f(f(f(100)))$:
$$f(f(f(100))) = 8 \cdot 100 - 7 = 793.$$

Substituting $n = 100$ into the first condition, we have:
$$f(f(f(100))) = f(f(f(100))) = 793.$$

And from the second condition, we have:
$$f(2 \cdot 100) = 2f(100) + 1.$$

Substituting $n = 100$ into this equation, we have:
$$f(200) = 2f(100) + 1.$$

And then substituting $n = 200$ into this equation, we have:
$$f(400) = 2f(200) + 1 = 2(2f(100) + 1) + 1 = 4f(100) + 3.$$

We have three equations and three unknowns: $f(100)$, $f(200)$, and $f(400)$. We can solve these equations simultaneously to find $f(100)$.

From the first condition, we have $f(f(f(100))) = 793$, and from the second condition, we have $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$ and $f(400) = 4f(100) + 3$.

Substituting $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$ into $f(400) = 4f(100) + 3$, we get:
$$f(400) = 4f(100) + 3 = 2(2f(100) + 1) + 1 = 2f(200) + 1.$$

Simplifying this equation, we get:
$$4f(100) + 3 = 2(2f(100) + 1) + 1,$$
$$4f(100) + 3 = 4f(100) + 3.$$

This equation does not provide any new information, so we cannot use it to solve for $f(100)$. However, we can substitute $f(f(f(100))) = 793$ into $f(f(f(100))) = f(400)$ to get:
$$793 = f(400).$$

And we know that $f(400) = 4f(100) + 3$, so we can solve for $f(100)$:
$$793 = 4f(100) + 3,$$
$$790 = 4f(100),$$
$$f(100) = \frac{790}{4} = 197.5.$$

But this is not possible because $f(100)$ must be a natural number. Therefore, our assumption that $f(f(f(100))) = 793$ must be incorrect.

Let's try another approach. We know that $f(f(f(100))) = 793$, and from the second condition, we have $f(2 \cdot 100) = 2f(100) + 1$. Substituting $n = 100$ into this equation, we have:
$$f(200) = 2f(100) + 1.$$

And then substituting $n = 200$ into this equation, we have:
$$f(400) = 2f(200) + 1 = 2(2f(100) + 1) + 1 = 4f(100) + 3.$$

From the first condition, we have $f(f(f(100))) = 793$, so:
$$f(f(f(100))) = f(400) = 793.$$

Comparing this with $f(400) = 4f(100) + 3$, we can solve for $f(100)$:
$$793 = 4f(100) + 3,$$
$$790 = 4f(100),$$
$$f(100) = \frac{790}{4} = 197.5.$$

But this is not possible because $f(100)$ must be a natural number. Therefore, our assumption that $f(f(f(100))) = 793$ must be incorrect.

However, we can notice that $793 = 8 \cdot 100 - 7$, so we can substitute $n = 100$ into the first condition:
$$f(f(f(100))) = 8 \cdot 100 - 7 = 793.$$

Comparing this with $f(f(f(100))) = f(400)$, we can solve for $f(400)$:
$$f(400) = 793.$$

And from the second condition, we have $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$. We can substitute $f(400) = 793$ into this equation:
$$793 = 2f(200) + 1,$$
$$792 = 2f(200),$$
$$f(200) = \frac{792}{2} = 396.$$

And we know that $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$, so we

Assistant:

 First, we know that the function $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.
We want to find the value of $f(100)$.

Let's first use the second equation to find $f(100)$.
We know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, so we can substitute $n=50$ to get $f(100)=2f(50)+1$.
We don't know $f(50)$ yet, so we need to find that first.

Again using the second equation, we can substitute $n=25$ to get $f(50)=2f(25)+1$.
Similarly, we can substitute $n=12$ to get $f(25)=2f(12)+1$.
Finally, we substitute $n=6$ to get $f(12)=2f(6)+1$.
We can continue this process until we reach a value we know, which is $f(1)$.

Assuming $f(1)=x$, we have:
$f(6)=2x+1$,
$f(12)=2(2x+1)+1=4x+3$,
$f(25)=2(4x+3)+1=8x+7$,
$f(50)=2(8x+7)+1=16x+15$,
$f(100)=2(16x+15)+1=32x+31$.

From the first equation, we know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$.
Substituting $n=1$, we get $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1$, so $f(f(f(1)))=1$ implies $f(f(1))=1$ since $f$ is a function.
We can then use the second equation to find $f(1)$.
We know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, so we can substitute $n=\frac{1}{2}$ to get $f(1)=2f(\frac{1}{2})+1$.
But we don't know $f(\frac{1}{2})$ yet.
However, we know that $f(f(f(1)))=1$, so $f(f(1))=1$, and $f(f(f(1)))=1$ implies $f(1)=1$ since $f$ is a function.

Now we can substitute $f(1)=1$ into the equation $f(100)=32x+31$ to get $f(100)=32(1)+31=63$.
So $f(100)=63$. The answer is: $63$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
To accomplish this, first list the problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge, and thens solve the problem step by step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

First, let's list the problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge:

1. The function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the conditions $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.
2. We need to find the value of $f(100)$.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

We are given that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. By setting $n=1$, we get $f(f(f(1)))=8-7=1$. Since $f(1)=m$, we get $f(m)=1$.

Now, applying the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can find that $f(2)=2f(1)+1=2m+1$.

By setting $n=m$ in the first condition, we get $f(f(f(m)))=8m-7$. Since $f(m)=1$, we have $f(f(1))=8m-7$. But we already know that $f(1)=m$, so we get $f(m)=8m-7$.

Now, substitute $f(m)=1$ into the equation $f(m)=8m-7$, we get $1=8m-7$, which gives $m=\frac{8}{7}$. But $m$ should be a positive integer, so we must have made a mistake in our reasoning.

Let's go back and check our work. We know that $f(f(f(1)))=1$. By setting $n=2$ in the second condition, we get $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2(2m+1)+1=4m+3$.

Now, applying the first condition with $n=2$, we get $f(f(f(2)))=8*2-7=9$. Since $f(2)=2m+1$, we have $f(2m+1)=9$. Substituting $f(2m+1)=9$ into the equation $f(4)=9$, we get $9=4m+3$, which gives $m=1$.

Now, we can check our work by substituting $m=1$ into the equations. We have $f(1)=1$, $f(2)=3$, $f(3)=f(f(1))=1$, $f(4)=5$, $f(5)=f(f(2))=9$, $f(6)=11$, and so on. It seems our reasoning is correct.

Finally, we are asked to find the value of $f(100)$. Since $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can find that $f(100)=2f(50)+1=2(2f(25)+1)+1=4(2f(12.5)+1)+1=8f(6.25)+5$.

However, we know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ is only applicable for even $n$. Since $6.25$ is not an even number, we cannot directly apply this formula.

Let's try another approach. We know that $f(f(f(1)))=1$, $f(f(f(2)))=9$, $f(f(f(4)))=17$, and so on. The pattern seems to be that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. This is consistent with our first condition.

Now, we want to find $f(100)$. We can find that $f(100)=f(f(f(50)))=8*50-7=393$.

So, the value of $f(100)$ is 393.
The answer is: $393$

We are given two conditions:

1. $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$
2. $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$

We want to find $f(100)$.

First, we can use the second condition to find $f(100)$ if we can find $f(50)$.

Using the second condition again, we have $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.

Now we need to find $f(50)$. We can use the second condition again to find $f(25)$:

$f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.

To find $f(25)$, we can use the first condition with $n=25$:

$f(f(f(25))) = 8*25 - 7 = 200 - 7 = 193$.

But we know $f(f(f(25))) = f(50)$, so $f(50) = 193$.

Substituting this back into the equation for $f(100)$, we have:

$f(100) = 2*193 + 1 = 386 + 1 = 387$.

So $f(100) = 387$.
The answer is: $387$
