Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


For the equation $ \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ to have 4 distinct solutions, there should be 4 points where the graph $y= \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ intersects with the line $y=\frac{m}{100}$. Looking at the graph of $y= \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, we can see that only the horizontal lines in the range $0<\frac{m}{100}\leq 2$ will intersect the graph at 4 points. So, $0 < m \leq 200$. Now we just need to count the number of positive integers in this range. The positive integers from 1 to 200 inclusive, inclusive are 200 numbers in total. So, the value of $m$ is 200.

However, the question asks for the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the given condition, which corresponds to the count of positive integers from 1 to 200 (inclusive), so there are actually 200 such positive integers.
So, the value of $m$ is 200.
The number of possible values for $m$ is 200.
The value of the unknown variable $m$ is 200. The answer is: $200$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.
We know that $\frac{m}{100}$ is positive, so $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ must be positive.
This means that $\vert x-1 \vert -2$ must be either positive or negative.
Let's consider the case when $\vert x-1 \vert -2 > 0$.
Solving this inequality, we get $\vert x-1 \vert > 2$, which implies $x-1 > 2$ or $x-1 < -2$.
This gives us two more cases to consider:
1. If $x-1 > 2$, then $x > 3$.
2. If $x-1 < -2$, then $x < -1$.
Now let's consider the case when $\vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0$.
Solving this inequality, we get $\vert x-1 \vert < 2$, which implies $-2 < x-1 < 2$.
This gives us another case to consider: $-1 < x < 3$.
Combining all the cases, we have the following solution set for the equation: $\{x: x < -1 \text{ or } -1 < x < 1 \text{ or } 1 < x < 3 \text{ or } x > 3\}$.
To have 4 distinct solutions, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be such that it splits the solution set into 4 disjoint intervals.
This occurs when $\frac{m}{100}=1$, giving us the solution set $\{x: x < 0 \text{ or } 0 < x < 1 \text{ or } 1 < x < 2 \text{ or } x > 2\}$.
So, the only value of $m$ that works is $m=100$.
Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 1. The answer is: $\boxed{1}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. This is because the expression on the left hand side $| |x - 1| - 2 |$ can take on any value from $0$ to $2$ (inclusive) for some real number $x$.
We can simplify the inequality $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$ to $0 < m < 200$. The positive integers in this range are the positive integers from $1$ to $199$, inclusive. So there are $199$ positive integers that satisfy the given condition. The answer is: $199$. The value of $m$ is not specified, but any positive integer from 1 to 199 will work to create a quartic equation with 4 distinct solutions in $x$. The value of $m$ is a hint that was included to guide the solver through the problem but it is not necessary to find the solution. The answer is: $\boxed{199}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The equation $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}=2$. This is because $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|$ is equal to 2 when there are 4 distinct solutions.

So, $\frac{m}{100}=2$ implies $m=200$. Therefore, the only positive integer $m$ that satisfies the condition is 200. Hence the answer is 1. The answer is $\boxed{1}$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions,
which means that $\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal to either $1$ or $3$.
If $\frac{m}{100}=1$, then $m=100$.
If $\frac{m}{100}=3$, then $m=300$.
Therefore, the only possible values for $m$ are $100$ and $300$. Hence, there are $2$ positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition. The answer is: 2

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions means the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must equal to 2. This is because $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ can only be 2 to produce 4 distinct solutions.

If $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=2$, then we have two cases:

Case 1: $\vert x-1 -2 \vert =2 \Rightarrow \vert x-3 \vert =2$. 
For this equation to be true, we have $x-3=2$ or $x-3=-2$, which gives us $x=5$ or $x=1$.

Case 2: $\vert x-1 +2 \vert =2 \Rightarrow \vert x+1 \vert =2$. 
For this equation to be true, we have $x+1=2$ or $x+1=-2$, which gives us $x=1$ or $x=-3$.

However, we notice that the solutions $x=1$ are repeated in both cases, so we only count it once. The four distinct solutions to the original equation are $x=1$, $x=5$, and $x=-3$.

We are asked to find the value of $m$. Recall that we set the right side of the equation equal to 2 to produce 4 distinct solutions. Therefore, $2=\frac{m}{100}$ and we can solve for $m$ to get $m=200$.

Therefore, the only positive integer $m$ that satisfies the condition is $m=200$. Thus, the final answer is 1.
The value of $m$ is 200.
The answer is: $1$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $||x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ is $2$. This is because the equation $||x-1|-2|=2$ will have 4 distinct solutions. 
To see this, first solve the equation $|x-1|-2=2$ to get $|x-1|=4$. This splits into two cases: $x-1=4$ or $x-1=-4$. Solving these gives $x=5$ or $x=-3$. 
Second, solve the equation $|x-1|-2=-2$ to get $|x-1|=0$. This gives us one more solution, $x=1$. 
So, we have found the solutions $x=-3,1,5$.
Therefore, the value of $m$ is $2*100=200$.
Hence, the only positive integer value of $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is $m=200$. So the answer is $\boxed{1}$.
The value of $m$ is 200. The number 1 is a positive integer and it is the only value that satisfies the condition. So the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is $m=200$. Hence the number of possible values for $m$ is 1.
The answer is: $1$
