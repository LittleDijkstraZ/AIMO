Here's the step by step solution:



Step 1: Simplify the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
Using the property $|a-b| = |b-a|$, we can rewrite the equation as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$.
Then, $|x-2y| - |2y-x| = 0$, which implies $|x-2y| = |2y-x|$.
This means $x-2y = 2y-x$ or $x-2y = -(2y-x)$.
Solving these two cases, we get $x=2y$ or $x=y$.

Step 2: Substitute the results from Step 1 into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.
If $x=2y$, then the expression becomes $5(2y)^2+5y^2-8(2y)y = 20y^2+5y^2-16y^2 = 9y^2$.
If $x=y$, then the expression becomes $5y^2+5y^2-8y^2 = 2y^2$.

Step 3: Analyze the results from Step 2.
We want to find the minimum value of the expression, so we need to find the minimum value of $9y^2$ and $2y^2$.
Since $y$ can be any real number, both $9y^2$ and $2y^2$ are always nonnegative.
Therefore, the minimum value of $9y^2$ and $2y^2$ is $0$.
But neither of these cases gives a minimum value of the expression equal to $0$.
So we must have made a mistake somewhere.

Step 4: Revisit the original equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
We realized that we made a mistake in Step 1. The correct equation should be $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$.
But this equation is always true for all real numbers $x$ and $y$.
So the original equation is actually an identity, not a restriction on $x$ and $y$.

Step 5: Revisit the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.
Now we need to find the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ for all real numbers $x$ and $y$.
We can rewrite the expression as $(5x^2-8xy+5y^2) = (5x^2-10xy+5y^2) + 2xy = (5(x-y)^2) + 2xy$.
Since $(x-y)^2 \ge 0$ for all real numbers $x$ and $y$, $5(x-y)^2 \ge 0$.
And $2xy$ can be any real number.
Therefore, the minimum value of the expression is achieved when $x=y=0$, and the minimum value is $0$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $0$.

The answer is: $0$

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Here's the step by step solution:



1. First, we can rewrite the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$, which simplifies to $2|x-2y| = 40$, or $|x-2y| = 20$.

2. From the equation $|x-2y| = 20$, we have two cases: $x - 2y = 20$ or $x - 2y = -20$. We can solve these two cases separately.

3. For the first case $x - 2y = 20$, we can solve for $y$ in terms of $x$: $y = \frac{x}{2} - 10$.

4. Substitute $y = \frac{x}{2} - 10$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get:
\[5x^2 + 5\left(\frac{x}{2} - 10\right)^2 - 8x\left(\frac{x}{2} - 10\right).\]

5. Simplify the expression, we get:
\[5x^2 + 5\left(\frac{x^2}{4} - 10x + 100\right) - 4x^2 + 40x = \frac{x^2}{4} + 40x + 500.\]

6. For the second case $x - 2y = -20$, we can solve for $y$ in terms of $x$: $y = \frac{x}{2} + 10$.

7. Substitute $y = \frac{x}{2} + 10$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get:
\[5x^2 + 5\left(\frac{x}{2} + 10\right)^2 - 8x\left(\frac{x}{2} + 10\right).\]

8. Simplify the expression, we get:
\[5x^2 + 5\left(\frac{x^2}{4} + 10x + 100\right) - 4x^2 - 40x = \frac{x^2}{4} - 40x + 500.\]

9. Now, we need to find the minimum value of the expression $\frac{x^2}{4} + 40x + 500$ and $\frac{x^2}{4} - 40x + 500$.

10. To find the minimum value of a quadratic function $ax^2 + bx + c$, we can use the formula $x = -\frac{b}{2a}$. For the function $\frac{x^2}{4} + 40x + 500$, we have $a = \frac{1}{4}$ and $b = 40$, so $x = -\frac{40}{2*\frac{1}{4}} = -40$. Substitute $x = -40$ into the function, we get the minimum value as $-40^2/4 + 40*(-40) + 500 = -400 + 500 = 100$.

11. For the function $\frac{x^2}{4} - 40x + 500$, we have $a = \frac{1}{4}$ and $b = -40$, so $x = -\frac{-40}{2*\frac{1}{4}} = 40$. Substitute $x = 40$ into the function, we get the minimum value as $-40^2/4 - 40*40 + 500 = -400 + 500 = 100$.

12. Therefore, the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 100.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Here's the step by step solution:



Step 1: First, we need to find the relationship between $x$ and $y$ from the given condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.

Step 2: By the triangle inequality, we know that $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$ for all real numbers $a$ and $b$. Therefore, $|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |(x-2y) + (y-2x)| = |-x - y| = |-(x+y)| = |x+y|$.

Step 3: From the given condition, we have $|x+y| = 40$.

Step 4: Now, we want to find the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite this expression as $\frac{1}{2}((5x-4y)^2+(5y-4x)^2)$.

Step 5: By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we know that $(a_1^2+a_2^2)(b_1^2+b_2^2) \geq (a_1b_1+a_2b_2)^2$ for all real numbers $a_1, a_2, b_1, b_2$. Therefore, we have $((5x)^2+(4y)^2)((4x)^2+(5y)^2) \geq ((5x)(4x)+(4y)(5y))^2 = (20x^2+20y^2)^2$.

Step 6: Simplifying, we get $(25x^2+16y^2)(16x^2+25y^2) \geq (20x^2+20y^2)^2$.

Step 7: Expanding both sides, we have $400x^4+1000x^2y^2+400y^4 \geq 400x^4+400y^4+800x^2y^2$.

Step 8: Simplifying, we get $200x^2y^2 \geq 0$.

Step 9: Since $x^2y^2$ is always non-negative, we have $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = \frac{1}{2}((5x-4y)^2+(5y-4x)^2) \geq 0$.

Step 10: Now, we need to minimize $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the condition $|x+y| = 40$. From the condition $|x+y| = 40$, we have $x+y = \pm 40$. Without loss of generality, we can assume $x+y = 40$.

Step 11: By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have $(1^2+1^2)((5x)^2+(5y)^2) \geq ((5x)(1)+(5y)(1))^2 = (5x+5y)^2$. Simplifying, we get $(2)(25x^2+25y^2) \geq (5x+5y)^2$.

Step 12: Substituting $x+y = 40$, we have $(2)(25x^2+25(40-x)^2) \geq (5x+5(40-x))^2$.

Step 13: Simplifying, we get $50x^2+50(40-x)^2 \geq (10x+200-10x)^2 = 400^2$.

Step 14: Dividing both sides by 100, we have $5x^2+5(40-x)^2 \geq 1600$.

Step 15: Expanding and simplifying, we get $5x^2+5(1600-80x+x^2) \geq 1600$, which simplifies to $10x^2-400x+8000 \geq 1600$.

Step 16: Subtracting 1600 from both sides, we have $10x^2-400x+6400 \geq 0$.

Step 17: Dividing both sides by 10, we get $x^2-40x+640 \geq 0$.

Step 18: Completing the square, we have $(x-20)^2+400 \geq 0$.

Step 19: Since $(x-20)^2$ is always non-negative, we have $5x^2+5y^2-8xy \geq 0$.

Step 20: Substituting $x+y = 40$, we get $y = 40 - x$. Therefore, we have $5x^2+5(40-x)^2-8x(40-x)$.

Step 21: Expanding and simplifying, we get $5x^2+5(1600-80x+x^2)-320x+8x^2$.

Step 22: Simplifying further, we have $5x^2+8000-400x+5x^2-320x+8x^2$.

Step 23: Combining like terms, we get $18x^2-720x+8000$.

Step 24: To minimize this expression, we take the derivative with respect to $x$ and set it equal to zero. The derivative is $36x-720$. Setting this equal to zero, we get $x = 20$.

Step 25: Substituting $x = 20$ into $y = 40 - x$, we get $y = 20$.

Step 26: Substituting $x = 20$ and $y = 20$ into $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get $5(20)^2+5(20)^2-8(20)(20) = 2000+2000-3200 = 800$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 800 when $x = 20$ and $y = 20$. The answer is: $800$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"

Assistant:

Here's the step by step solution:



Step 1: Let $z = x - 2y$ and $w = y - 2x$. Then $|z| + |w| = 40$.
Step 2: We know that $|a| + |b| \geq |a + b|$, so $|z| + |w| \geq |z + w|$. Therefore, $|z + w| \leq 40$.
Step 3: We also know that $z + w = x - 2y + y - 2x = -x - y$. So $| -x - y| \leq 40$, which implies $|x + y| \leq 40$.
Step 4: Now we want to minimize the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = \frac{5}{2}((x + y)^2 - 2xy) = \frac{5}{2}((x + y)^2 - 2(x^2 + y^2))$.
Step 5: By the inequality in Step 3, we know that $|x + y| \leq 40$, so $(x + y)^2 \leq 1600$.
Step 6: Also, we know that $(x^2 + y^2) \geq \frac{1}{5}(\frac{(x + y)^2}{2})$, by the inequality $|a| + |b| \geq \frac{|a + b|}{2}$.
Step 7: Substituting the inequality from Step 5, we get $(x^2 + y^2) \geq \frac{1}{5}(\frac{1600}{2}) = 160$.
Step 8: Substituting these results back into the expression in Step 4, we get $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy \geq \frac{5}{2}(1600 - 2 \cdot 160) = \frac{5}{2}(1280) = 3200$.
Step 9: Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is 3200.

Here is the Python code to solve this problem:

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Here's the step by step solution:



1. First, we notice that the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is equivalent to $|x-2y| = 40 - |y-2x|$.
2. We can then square both sides to get rid of the absolute values: $(x-2y)^2 = (40 - (y-2x))^2$.
3. Expanding both sides, we get $x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2 = 1600 - 80(y-2x) + (y-2x)^2$.
4. Simplifying the right side, we have $x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2 = 1600 - 80y + 160x + y^2 - 4xy + 4x^2$.
5. Combining like terms, we get $3x^2 - 8xy + 3y^2 = 1600 + 160x - 80y$.
6. Now, let's subtract the original expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ from both sides: $-2x^2 + 2xy - 2y^2 = 1600 + 160x - 80y$.
7. Rearranging the terms, we get $2x^2 - 2xy + 2y^2 = -1600 - 160x + 80y$.
8. We can rewrite the left side as $2(x^2 - xy + y^2) = -1600 - 160x + 80y$.
9. Notice that the right side is a constant, so the left side must also be a constant. Let's call this constant $C$: $x^2 - xy + y^2 = \frac{C}{2}$.
10. Now, let's substitute $x = 2y$ into the equation $x^2 - xy + y^2 = \frac{C}{2}$: $(2y)^2 - (2y)(y) + y^2 = \frac{C}{2}$.
11. Simplifying, we have $4y^2 - 2y^2 + y^2 = \frac{C}{2}$, which simplifies to $3y^2 = \frac{C}{2}$.
12. So, $C = 6y^2$.
13. Substituting this back into the equation $x^2 - xy + y^2 = \frac{C}{2}$, we have $x^2 - xy + y^2 = 3y^2$.
14. Simplifying, we get $x^2 - xy = 2y^2$, which can be rewritten as $x^2 - xy - 2y^2 = 0$.
15. This is a quadratic equation in $x$, and we can use the quadratic formula to solve for $x$: $x = \frac{y \pm \sqrt{y^2 + 8y^2}}{2} = \frac{y \pm 3y}{2}$.
16. This gives us two possible values for $x$: $x = 2y$ or $x = -y$.
17. We can substitute $x = 2y$ back into the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ to verify that it holds.
18. After substituting and simplifying, we find that it does indeed hold.
19. Therefore, the only valid solution is $x = 2y$.
20. Now, we can substitute $x = 2y$ into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ to find its minimum value.
21. We have $5(2y)^2 + 5y^2 - 8(2y)(y) = 20y^2 + 5y^2 - 16y^2 = 9y^2$.
22. Since $y^2$ is always non-negative, the minimum value of $9y^2$ is 0, which occurs when $y = 0$.
23. Substituting $y = 0$ into the equation $x = 2y$, we get $x = 0$.
24. Finally, we substitute $x = 0$ and $y = 0$ into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ to find its minimum value: $5(0)^2 + 5(0)^2 - 8(0)(0) = 0$.

So, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is 0. The answer is: $0$

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"

Assistant:

Here's the step by step solution:



1. First, we rewrite the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ using the property $|a| + |b| = |a+b|$ which gives us $|3x-3y| = 40 \implies |x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$.

2. Now, let's find the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite it as $5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x-y)^2 + 2xy] - 8xy = 5(x-y)^2 + 3xy$.

3. We know that $(x-y)^2 \ge 0$ and $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$, so $(x-y)^2 \ge \left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2$.

4. Now, let's find the minimum value of $3xy$. Since $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$, we can substitute $y = x + \frac{40}{3}$ in the equation $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$ and get $|x - (x + \frac{40}{3})| = \frac{40}{3}$, which simplifies to $\left|\frac{-40}{3}\right| = \frac{40}{3}$. Therefore, $3xy = -\frac{40^2}{3}$.

5. Substituting the values of $(x-y)^2$ and $3xy$ into the expression $5(x-y)^2 + 3xy$, we get $5\left(\frac{40^2}{3^2}\right) - \frac{40^2}{3} = \frac{40^2}{3} (5/3 - 1) = \frac{40^2}{3} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = \frac{800}{9}$.

So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\frac{800}{9}$. The answer is:

$\frac{800}{9}$

Here's the step by step solution:



Step 1: First, we observe that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be simplified to $|x-2y| = 20$ and $|y-2x| = 20$. This is because $|a| + |b| = c$ implies $|a| = c - |b|$, and if we set $c = 40$, then $|x-2y| = 20$ and $|y-2x| = 20$.

Step 2: Now we consider the four possible cases for the absolute values:
Case 1: $x-2y = 20$ and $y-2x = 20$. Solving these equations simultaneously gives $x = 20$ and $y = 0$.
Case 2: $x-2y = 20$ and $2x-y = 20$. Solving these equations simultaneously gives $x = 20$ and $y = 0$.
Case 3: $x-2y = -20$ and $y-2x = 20$. Solving these equations simultaneously gives $x = 0$ and $y = -10$.
Case 4: $x-2y = -20$ and $2x-y = -20$. Solving these equations simultaneously gives $x = 0$ and $y = -10$.

Step 3: Now we substitute these values of $x$ and $y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to find the minimum value.
For Case 1: $5(20)^2+5(0)^2-8(20)(0) = 2000$.
For Case 2: $5(20)^2+5(0)^2-8(20)(0) = 2000$.
For Case 3: $5(0)^2+5(-10)^2-8(0)(-10) = 500$.
For Case 4: $5(0)^2+5(-10)^2-8(0)(-10) = 500$.

Step 4: Comparing the values, we find that the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 500.

So, the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 500.
The answer is: $500$

Here's the step by step solution:



Step 1: The given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$. This is the absolute value of the sum of two absolute values, which is always non-negative. Thus, we can square both sides of the equation to get rid of the absolute value:
\[(2y-x)^2 + (2x-y)^2 = 40^2.\]
This simplifies to:
\[4y^2 - 4xy + x^2 + 4x^2 - 4xy + y^2 = 1600,\]
which further simplifies to:
\[5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = 1600.\]

Step 2: Now we have the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = 1600$. This expression is the same as the original expression in the problem. Therefore, the minimum value of the original expression is 1600.

The answer is: $1600$.

Here's the step by step solution:



Step 1: Rewrite the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$. This is equivalent to $|2y-x| + |x-2y| = 40$.

Step 2: By the triangle inequality, $|2y-x| + |x-2y| \geq |(2y-x) - (x-2y)| = |0| = 0$. 

Step 3: Therefore, the equality condition of the triangle inequality holds, which means $(2y-x)(x-2y) \geq 0$. This simplifies to $x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2 \geq 0$, or $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy \geq 0$.

Step 4: The minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is therefore 0.
