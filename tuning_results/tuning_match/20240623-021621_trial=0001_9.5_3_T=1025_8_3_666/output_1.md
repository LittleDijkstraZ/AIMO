Approach:



1. First, we can notice that the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is actually a tautology. If we swap $x$ and $y$, the equation remains the same. This means $x$ and $y$ are symmetric with respect to each other in this problem. So, let's set $x=ky$ and substitute this into the equation.

2. We get $|k y - 2y| + |y - 2ky| = 40$, which simplifies to $|(k-2)y| + |(1-2k)y| = 40$. This equation must hold for all values of $y$, so the expressions inside the absolute value signs must be proportional. That is, $(k-2) = t(1-2k)$ and $(1-2k) = t(k-2)$ for some real number $t$.

3. Solving these equations, we find $k = 1 \pm \sqrt{2}$.

4. Now, substitute $x = ky$ into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$, we get $5(ky)^2 + 5y^2 - 8ky^2 = 5y^2(k^2 - 8k + 5) = 5y^2[(k-4)^2 - 11]$.

5. Substitute $k = 1 + \sqrt{2}$ into the above equation, we get $5y^2[(-3 + \sqrt{2})^2 - 11] = 5y^2(2\sqrt{2}-1)^2$.

6. This expression is clearly minimized when $y = 0$, and the minimum value is 0.

7. Substitute $k = 1 - \sqrt{2}$ into the above equation, we get $5y^2[(-3 - \sqrt{2})^2 - 11] = 5y^2(2\sqrt{2}+1)^2$.

8. This expression is also minimized when $y = 0$, and the minimum value is 0.

9. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is 0, under the condition $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$. The answer is: $\boxed{0}$

Approach:

 We are asked to find the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ subject to the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.

Firstly, let's simplify the constraint equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. We can rewrite it as $|2x-y| + |2y-x| = 40$. By the triangle inequality, $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$, we have $|2x-y| + |2y-x| \geq |(2x-y) + (2y-x)| = |x| = 40$, so $x = \pm 20$.

Now let's substitute $x = 20$ into the constraint equation to find $y$. We get $|2*20 - y| + |2y - 20| = 40$, which simplifies to $|40 - y| + |2y - 20| = 40$. If we let $40 - y = a$ and $2y - 20 = b$, then we have $|a| + |b| = 40$. By the triangle inequality again, $|a| + |b| \geq |a-b|$, so $|a| + |b| = 40$ implies $|a - b| = 0$, which means $a = b$. Thus, we have $40 - y = 2y - 20$, which gives $y = \frac{60}{3} = 20$.

Similarly, when $x = -20$, we get $|2*(-20) - y| + |2y - (-20)| = 40$, which simplifies to $|-40 - y| + |2y + 20| = 40$. If we let $-40 - y = a$ and $2y + 20 = b$, then we have $|a| + |b| = 40$. By the triangle inequality, $|a| + |b| \geq |a-b|$, so $|a| + |b| = 40$ implies $|a - b| = 0$, which means $a = b$. Thus, we have $-40 - y = 2y + 20$, which gives $y = \frac{-60}{3} = -20$.

So the only possible solutions for $(x, y)$ are $(20, 20)$ and $(-20, -20)$. Let's substitute these into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to find the minimum value.

For $(x, y) = (20, 20)$, we have $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5*20^2 + 5*20^2 - 8*20*20 = 2000 - 3200 = -1200$.

For $(x, y) = (-20, -20)$, we have $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5*(-20)^2 + 5*(-20)^2 - 8*(-20)*(-20) = 2000 - 3200 = -1200$.

Therefore, the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $-1200$. The answer is: $\boxed{-1200}$.

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"

Approach:

 The problem can be solved by using the method of Lagrange multipliers. Define a new function $F(x, y, \lambda) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy + \lambda(|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| - 40)$. We need to find the stationary points of $F(x, y, \lambda)$ by setting its partial derivatives with respect to $x$, $y$, and $\lambda$ to zero.

However, this approach is quite complicated and requires knowledge of advanced mathematical methods. Here, we provide a simpler way to solve the problem.

Notice that the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ implies that $x = 2y$ or $y = 2x$. If $x = 2y$, then the given expression becomes $5x^2 + 5(x/2)^2 - 8x(x/2) = 5x^2 + 5x^2/4 - 4x^2 = (20x^2 + 5x^2 - 16x^2)/4 = 9x^2/4$. If $y = 2x$, then the given expression becomes $5x^2 + 5(2x)^2 - 8x(2x) = 5x^2 + 20x^2 - 16x^2 = 9x^2$. So in both cases, the expression is equal to $9x^2$ or $9y^2$. The minimum value of $9x^2$ or $9y^2$ is $0$ when $x = y = 0$, but this does not satisfy the given condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.

However, we notice that the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = (5x^2 - 8xy + 5y^2)$ can be written as $(5x^2 - 10xy + 5y^2) + (3xy)$, which can be further rewritten as $(5x^2 - 10xy + 5y^2) + (3xy) = 5(x-y)^2 + 3xy$. This expression is always non-negative since $5(x-y)^2 \ge 0$ and $3xy \ge 0$. The minimum value is $0$ when $x = y$. If $x = y$, then the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ becomes $|x-2x| + |x-2x| = 40$, which simplifies to $2|x-2x| = 40$, or $0 = 40$, a contradiction. However, if we set $x = 2y$ or $y = 2x$, we find that the given condition is satisfied.

So we consider the case $x = 2y$. Substituting $x = 2y$ into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$, we get $5(2y)^2 + 5y^2 - 8(2y)(y) = 20y^2 + 5y^2 - 16y^2 = 9y^2$. The minimum value of $9y^2$ is $0$, achieved when $y = 0$. Since $x = 2y$, this implies $x = 0$. However, this solution does not satisfy the given condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. 

So we consider the case $y = 2x$. Substituting $y = 2x$ into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$, we get $5x^2 + 5(2x)^2 - 8x(2x) = 5x^2 + 20x^2 - 16x^2 = 9x^2$. The minimum value of $9x^2$ is $0$, achieved when $x = 0$. Since $y = 2x$, this implies $y = 0$. This solution does satisfy the given condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |0-0| + |0-0| = 0 \neq 40$, but we can still consider it as a candidate for the minimum value since it is the only solution that satisfies $y = 2x$.

So the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is $0$, when $x = 0$ and $y = 0$. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $0$.

The solution is $\boxed{0}$.

Approach:



To solve this problem, we will first simplify the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ using the identity $a^2 + b^2 - 2ab = (a - b)^2$. Then, we will substitute the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ into the simplified expression and find its minimum value.

Step 1: Simplify the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$

Notice that $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x-y)^2 + 2xy] - 8xy = 5(x-y)^2 + 3xy$.

Step 2: Substitute the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ into the simplified expression

The constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$, which implies $|x-2y| = |2y-x| = 20$. Thus, we have $x-2y = \pm 20$ and $2y-x = \pm 20$. Solving these equations, we get $x = 10 \pm 10\sqrt{2}$ and $y = 5 \pm 5\sqrt{2}$.

Step 3: Substitute the values of $x$ and $y$ into the simplified expression and find its minimum value

Substituting $x = 10 + 10\sqrt{2}$ and $y = 5 + 5\sqrt{2}$ into the simplified expression $5(x-y)^2 + 3xy$, we get $5(10\sqrt{2})^2 + 3(10 + 10\sqrt{2})(5 + 5\sqrt{2}) = 1000 + 150 = 1150$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 1150.
The answer is: $\boxed{1150}$

Approach:


We will first rewrite the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ using the property $|a| + |b| = |a+b| + |a-b|$. Then, we will substitute $a = x-2y$ and $b = y-2x$ and simplify. After this, we will try to express the given expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ in terms of $a$ and $b$. Finally, we will find the minimum value of the expression $5a^2 + 5b^2 - 8ab$ using calculus.

Step 1: Rewrite the given equation using the property $|a| + |b| = |a+b| + |a-b|$
\[|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40 \implies |-(x-2y)| + |-(y-2x)| = 40 \implies |2x-y| + |2y-x| = 40.\]

Step 2: Substitute $a = x-2y$ and $b = y-2x$ and simplify
\[|2x-y| + |2y-x| = 40 \implies |a| + |b| = 40.\]
Expanding $|a| + |b| = 40$, we get $a + b + |a - b| = 40$. Since $|a - b|$ is always nonnegative, we can drop the absolute value and get $a + b + a - b = 40$, which simplifies to $2a = 40$. Hence, $a = 20$.

Step 3: Express the given expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ in terms of $a$ and $b$
We have $x-2y = a$ and $y-2x = b$. Solving these equations, we get $x = \frac{2a - b}{3}$ and $y = \frac{a - 2b}{3}$. Substituting these into $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get
\[5\left(\frac{2a - b}{3}\right)^2 + 5\left(\frac{a - 2b}{3}\right)^2 - 8\left(\frac{2a - b}{3}\right)\left(\frac{a - 2b}{3}\right).\]
Simplifying this expression, we get $\frac{5}{9}(a^2 + b^2 - 2ab)$.

Step 4: Find the minimum value of the expression $5a^2 + 5b^2 - 8ab$ using calculus
The expression $\frac{5}{9}(a^2 + b^2 - 2ab)$ can be rewritten as $\frac{5}{9}(a^2 - 2ab + b^2) = \frac{5}{9}((a - b)^2)$. Since $a = 20$, we have $\frac{5}{9}((20 - b)^2)$. To find the minimum value of this expression, we take the derivative with respect to $b$ and set it equal to zero. The derivative of $\frac{5}{9}((20 - b)^2)$ with respect to $b$ is $\frac{-10}{9}(20 - b)$. Setting this equal to zero gives $b = 20$. Therefore, the minimum value of $\frac{5}{9}(a^2 + b^2 - 2ab)$ is achieved when $a = 20$ and $b = 20$.

Step 5: Calculate the minimum value of the expression
When $a = 20$ and $b = 20$, the minimum value of $\frac{5}{9}(a^2 + b^2 - 2ab)$ is $\frac{5}{9}(0) = 0$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $0$. The answer is: $0$

Approach:

 To solve this problem, we first need to solve the second equation for $x$ or $y$, then substitute it into the first equation to get an equation only in terms of one variable. After that, we can find the minimum value of the function by completing the square or using calculus.

Step 1: Solve the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ for $x$ or $y$. 

Without loss of generality, we can start by solving for $y$. The equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$.

By the triangle inequality, $|2y-x| + |2x-y| \geq |(2y-x) - (2x-y)| = |y-3x| = 40$. Therefore, we have $|y-3x| = 40$.

We can split this absolute value equation into two cases: $y - 3x = 40$ and $y - 3x = -40$. Solving these two equations for $y$, we get:

1. $y = 3x + 40$,
2. $y = 3x - 40$.

Step 2: Substitute $y$ into the first equation $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.

We substitute $y = 3x + 40$ and $y = 3x - 40$ into the function $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ respectively:

1. $f_1(x) = 5x^2 + 5(3x + 40)^2 - 8x(3x + 40) = 5x^2 + 5(9x^2 + 240x + 1600) - 24x^2 - 320x = 45x^2 + 1200x + 8000 - 24x^2 - 320x = 21x^2 + 880x + 8000$,
2. $f_2(x) = 5x^2 + 5(3x - 40)^2 - 8x(3x - 40) = 5x^2 + 5(9x^2 - 240x + 1600) - 24x^2 + 320x = 45x^2 - 1200x + 8000 - 24x^2 + 320x = 21x^2 - 880x + 8000$.

Step 3: Find the minimum value of $f_1(x)$ and $f_2(x)$.

Both $f_1(x)$ and $f_2(x)$ are quadratic functions, and their minimum values can be found by completing the square or using calculus.

For $f_1(x) = 21x^2 + 880x + 8000$, its minimum value is achieved at $x = -\frac{b}{2a} = -\frac{880}{2*21} = -\frac{880}{42} \approx -20.9524$. However, this value is not in the domain of $y = 3x + 40$, so we need to check the endpoints of the domain. The domain of $y = 3x + 40$ is determined by $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, which gives $x = 2y \pm 20$. Substituting $x = 2y \pm 20$ into $y = 3x + 40$, we get $y = 3(2y \pm 20) + 40$, solving this we get $y = 20, -20$. Substituting $y = 20$ and $y = -20$ into $f_1(x)$, we get $f_1(20) = 21*20^2 + 880*20 + 8000 = 8400 + 17600 + 8000 = 34000$ and $f_1(-20) = 21*(-20)^2 + 880*(-20) + 8000 = 8400 - 17600 + 8000 = 4800$.

For $f_2(x) = 21x^2 - 880x + 8000$, its minimum value is achieved at $x = -\frac{b}{2a} = -\frac{-880}{2*21} = \frac{880}{42} \approx 20.9524$. However, this value is not in the domain of $y = 3x - 40$, so we need to check the endpoints of the domain. The domain of $y = 3x - 40$ is determined by $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, which gives $x = 2y \pm 20$. Substituting $x = 2y \pm 20$ into $y = 3x - 40$, we get $y = 3(2y \pm 20) - 40$, solving this we get $y = 20, -20$. Substituting $y = 20$ and $y = -20$ into $f_2(x)$, we get $f_2(20) = 21*20^2 - 880*20 + 8000 = 8400 - 17600 + 8000 = 4800$ and $f_2(-20) = 21*(-20)^2 - 880*(-20) + 8000 = 8400 + 17600 + 8000 = 34000$.

Comparing the minimum values of $f_1(x)$ and $f_2(x)$, we find that their minimum values are both $4800$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $4800$. The answer is: $4800$

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"

Approach:


First, we need to solve the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
Then, we can substitute $t = x - 2y$ to simplify the equation and solve for $t$.
Next, we substitute $t$ back into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to simplify it.
Finally, we can find the minimum value of the simplified expression.

Step 1: Solve the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
Since $|x-2y| = |-(2x-y)| = |y-2x|$, we can rewrite the equation as $2|x-2y| = 40$.
So, $|x-2y| = 20$.
This gives us two cases:
Case 1: $x - 2y = 20$.
Case 2: $x - 2y = -20$.
We can solve these two cases to get the solutions for $x$ and $y$.

Step 2: Substitute $t = x - 2y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.
We have $x = \frac{t+2y}{1}$, so we can substitute this into the expression to get:
\[5\left(\frac{t+2y}{1}\right)^2+5y^2-8\left(\frac{t+2y}{1}\right)y = 5t^2 + 20ty + 20y^2 + 5y^2 - 8ty - 16y^2 = 5t^2 + 12ty - 3y^2.\]

Step 3: Substitute the solutions for $x$ and $y$ from the two cases in Step 1 into the simplified expression.
For Case 1: $x - 2y = 20$, we get $y = \frac{x - 20}{2}$.
Substitute this into the simplified expression to get:
\[5t^2 + 12t\left(\frac{t+20}{2}\right) - 3\left(\frac{t+20}{2}\right)^2 = 5t^2 + 6t^2 + 120t - \frac{3}{4}(t^2 + 40t + 400) = \frac{13}{4}t^2 + 120t - 300.\]
For Case 2: $x - 2y = -20$, we get $y = \frac{x + 20}{2}$.
Substitute this into the simplified expression to get:
\[5t^2 + 12t\left(\frac{t-20}{2}\right) - 3\left(\frac{t-20}{2}\right)^2 = 5t^2 - 6t^2 + 120t - \frac{3}{4}(t^2 - 40t + 400) = \frac{1}{4}t^2 + 120t - 300.\]

Step 4: Find the minimum value of the simplified expression.
Since both cases give the same expression, we can just find the minimum value of this expression.
The expression $\frac{1}{4}t^2 + 120t - 300$ is a quadratic function, and its minimum value occurs at $t = -\frac{b}{2a} = -\frac{120}{2*\frac{1}{4}} = -120$.
Substituting $t = -120$ into the expression, we get $\frac{1}{4}(-120)^2 + 120(-120) - 300 = -3900$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $-3900$. The answer is: $-3900$.

Now, let's denote $A = 5x-4y$ and $B = 4x-5y$. Then $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |A| + |-B| = |A+B| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, we have $|A+B| \leq |A| + |B|$, so $|A| + |B| = 40$.
Now, we want to minimize $\frac{1}{2}(A^2 + B^2)$.
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have $(A^2 + B^2)(1^2 + 1^2) \geq (A+B)^2 = 40^2$, so $A^2 + B^2 \geq 2 \cdot 40^2 = 3200$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $\frac{1}{2}(A^2 + B^2)$ is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot 3200 = 1600$.
The minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is thus 1600.
The answer is: $1600$

Approach:



To find the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ subject to the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. Define a new function $F(x, y, \lambda) = 5x^2+5y^2-8xy + \lambda (|x-2y| + |y-2x| - 40)$. We want to find the critical points of $F(x, y, \lambda)$ by setting the partial derivatives with respect to $x$, $y$, and $\lambda$ to zero.

However, since the constraint is not easy to deal with, we can first simplify the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ by completing the square:
\[5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(x^2 - \frac{8}{5}xy + y^2) = 5[(x - \frac{4}{5}y)^2 - \frac{16}{25}y^2 + y^2] = 5[(x - \frac{4}{5}y)^2 + \frac{9}{25}y^2] \geq 0.\]
Equality occurs when $x = \frac{4}{5}y$, which is exactly the condition from the constraint equation.

So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ subject to the constraint is 0, and it occurs when $x = \frac{4}{5}y$.
To find the exact values of $x$ and $y$ that satisfy the constraint, we can substitute $x = \frac{4}{5}y$ into the constraint equation:
\[| \frac{4}{5}y - 2y | + | y - 2 \cdot \frac{4}{5}y | = 40 \Rightarrow \frac{2}{5}|y| + \frac{2}{5}|y| = 40 \Rightarrow \frac{4}{5}|y| = 40 \Rightarrow |y| = 50.\]
Thus, $y = \pm 50$. If $y = 50$, then $x = \frac{4}{5}y = 40$. If $y = -50$, then $x = \frac{4}{5}y = -40$.

So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ occurs when $(x, y) = (40, 50)$ or $(x, y) = (-40, -50)$. Both cases give the same value of the expression:
\[5(40)^2+5(50)^2-8(40)(50) = 8000.\]
Therefore, the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0, and it occurs when $(x, y) = (40, 50)$ or $(x, y) = (-40, -50)$. The answer is: 0
