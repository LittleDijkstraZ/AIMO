The problem statement provides a complicated equation that represents the boundary of a region in the Cartesian plane. The goal is to find the area of the region enclosed by this boundary.

However, the given equation is of the form $(A)(B) = 0$, where $A$ and $B$ are two separate expressions. For this equation to be true, either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$.

This means that the points that satisfy the equation are those that satisfy either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Let's analyze these separately.

1) For $A = 0$: The expression inside the absolute value, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$, is zero when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. This represents a square with side length 20 centered at the origin.

2) For $B = 0$: The expression inside the absolute value, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$, is zero when $\vert x \vert = 8$. Similarly, $\vert y \vert = 8$ gives another square with side length 16 centered at the origin.

The intersection of these two squares is a smaller square with side length 8 centered at the origin. The area of this smaller square is $8^2 = 64$.

So, the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the boundary of the given equation is 64.

Here is a Python code snippet to calculate the area:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    side_length_small_square = 8
    area_small_square = side_length_small_square ** 2
    return area_small_square

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 64

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
64
```
The area of the convex polygon is $64$ square units. The answer is: $64$

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. 

For the first expression, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, both terms must be zero. This means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length 10.

For the second expression, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, both terms must be zero. This means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length 16.

The convex polygon formed by the intersection of these two squares is a smaller square with side length 10. So the area of this convex polygon is $10^2 = 100$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    """Find the area of the convex polygon formed by the intersection of the two squares."""
    side_length = 10
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 100

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
100
```
The area of the convex polygon is $100$. The answer is: $100$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

This problem can be solved by understanding the properties of absolute values and zero products. The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is equal to zero when any of the terms inside the parentheses is equal to zero.

First, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us a square with side length 10, centered at the origin.

Second, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us a square with side length 16, centered at the origin.

The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for. It is a square with side length 10, so its area is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $\boxed{100}$

 The given equation is a product of two quadratic expressions equal to zero. This means that either of the expressions must be zero for the product to be zero. This gives us four conditions:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From conditions 1 and 2, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(8,2)$, $(8,-2)$, $(-8,2)$, and $(-8,-2)$.

From conditions 3 and 4, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Adding these points to our list gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(8,2)$, $(8,-2)$, $(-8,2)$, $(-8,-2)$, $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

The points form a square with side length 16. The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

This problem involves mathematical concepts and notation that are beyond the scope of what is typically done in simple Python code. However, I can provide an outline of the solution, which involves careful consideration of absolute value and square functions and how they can be manipulated to yield a specific shape.

The equation given is a product of two terms being equal to zero. This means either the first term is zero, the second term is zero, or both are zero. We can analyze each term separately.

1. The term $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ is zero when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. This represents a square with side length 20 and its center at the origin.

2. The term $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ is zero when $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This also represents a square with side length 20 and its center at the origin.

3. The term $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ is zero when $\vert x \vert = 8$. This represents a square with side length 16 and its center at the origin.

4. The term $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2$ is zero when $\vert y \vert = 8$. This also represents a square with side length 16 and its center at the origin.

By analyzing these four conditions, we can conclude that the points that satisfy the original equation form a shape that is the intersection of the four squares. This intersection is a square with side length 10 (since 10 is the shortest distance from the origin to the edges of the larger squares).

To find the area of this square, we simply square the side length, giving us $10^2 = 100$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units.

In Python, you can simply print the result:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    side_length = 10
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 100

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
100
```
The area of the convex polygon is 100 square units. The answer is: $100$
