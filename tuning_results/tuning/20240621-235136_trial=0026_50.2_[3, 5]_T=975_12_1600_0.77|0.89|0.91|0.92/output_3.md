Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The equation given is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.

2. The terms $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ are both zero when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two lines in the plane, forming a square with side length 20.

3. The terms $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2$ are both zero when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two more lines in the plane, forming a square with side length 16.

4. The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for.

5. To find the area of this convex polygon, we just need to find the area of the smaller square and subtract the area of the larger square that it is a part of.

6. The area of a square with side length $a$ is $a^2$. So the area of the larger square is $20^2 = 400$ and the area of the smaller square is $16^2 = 256$.

7. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $400 - 256 = 144$.

The answer is: $144$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of them is zero. So we have two cases to consider: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

2. For $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. This implies $x + y = \pm 10$.

3. Similarly, for $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x - y = \pm 10$.

4. For $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$, which implies $x = \pm 8$.

5. For $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $y = \pm 8$.

6. Now, we have the following system of equations:
   - $x + y = \pm 10$
   - $x - y = \pm 10$
   - $x = \pm 8$
   - $y = \pm 8$

7. By solving this system, we find the vertices of the polygon: $(\pm 8, \pm 2)$, $(\pm 2, \pm 8)$.

8. To find the area of the polygon, we can use the formula for the area of a polygon given its vertices. Using the vertices $(\pm 8, \pm 2)$ and $(\pm 2, \pm 8)$, we find the area to be 96 square units.

The answer is: $96$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

The equation $A \cdot B = 0$ implies that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. So, the given equation is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The solutions to these equations are:
1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which gives $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
2. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which gives $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
3. $\vert x \vert = 8$, which gives $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
4. $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

These lines form a rectangle with side lengths $16$ and $20$, so its area is $16 \cdot 20 = 320$. The answer is: $320$

 The equation $AB = 0$ implies that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to the system of equations:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From equation (2), we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that the points lie on the square with vertices at $(8,8), (8,-8), (-8,-8), (-8,8)$.

From equation (1), we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that the points lie on a square with side length 10 and centered at the origin.

The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for. This polygon is a square with side length 8 (the smaller square). Therefore, its area is $8^2 = 64$. The answer is: $64$

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. This means that the points that satisfy the equation are either on the lines where the first expression is zero or the lines where the second expression is zero.

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, and it is zero when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length 10.

The second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$, and it is zero when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length 16.

The convex polygon is the intersection of these two squares, so it is a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.

2. Let's denote the two terms as $A = ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$ and $B = ((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$.

3. The equation $A \cdot B = 0$ implies that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$.

4. If $A = 0$, then $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two perpendicular lines.

5. If $B = 0$, then $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which are the equations of two circles.

6. The intersection of the two lines and the two circles forms a square with side length 16.

7. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256.
The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, we know that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of them is zero. Thus, we can split the problem into two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get four possible pairs $(x, y)$: $(5, 5)$, $(-5, -5)$, $(5, -5)$, and $(-5, 5)$.

For the second case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So we get four more possible pairs $(x, y)$: $(8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, $(8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$.

Now we plot these eight points on a coordinate plane and connect them with line segments. The resulting figure is a square with side length 10, so its area is $10^2 = 100$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def calculate_area():
    # The side length of the square is 10
    side_length = 10

    # Calculate the area of the square
    area = side_length**2

result = calculate_area()
print(result)
```

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. Therefore, either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. 

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. This expression is zero if and only if both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. These equations imply that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only way both of these equations can be true is if $x = 0$ and $y = 0$. 

The second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. This expression is zero if and only if both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. These equations imply that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The only way both of these equations can be true is if $-8 \leq x \leq 8$ and $-8 \leq y \leq 8$.

Therefore, the points satisfying the given equation are all points in the square with vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$. The area of this square is $8 \times 8 = 64$. So the area of the convex polygon is 64 square units.

Here is a Python code to calculate the area of the convex polygon:
```python

    side_length = 8 * 2  # The side length of the square

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We are given a math problem that involves absolute values and the square of absolute values. We can solve it by using the properties of absolute values.

2. The equation is: $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

3. According to the zero-product property, the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So we have two cases:
   a) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
   b) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

4. For each case, we can solve the equations:
   a) $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$
   b) $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$

5. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon.

6. Once we have the vertices, we can calculate the area of the polygon.

Now, let's use Python to solve the problem:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Abs

def polygon_area():
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # Solve the equations
    solutions = [(x, y) for x in range(-8, 9) for y in range(-8, 9) if Abs(x + y) == 10 and Abs(x - y) == 10]

    # Calculate the area of the polygon using the shoelace formula
    area = 0
    for i in range(len(solutions)):
        area += solutions[i][0] * solutions[(i + 1) % len(solutions)][1] - solutions[i][1] * solutions[(i + 1) % len(solutions)][0]
    area = abs(area / 2)

    return int(area)

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

0

CODE RESULTS 0

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
0
```
The code seems to have a problem because it's returning 0. Let's re-examine the problem. The equations $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ imply that $x$ and $y$ must be in the range of $[-8, 8]$. The equations $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ imply that $x$ and $y$ must be in the range of $[-8, 8]$. Therefore, the solution set of the equations is the set of all points $(x, y)$ in the square $[-8, 8] \times [-8, 8]$. The area of this square is $16 \times 16 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $\boxed{256}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The expression $A = ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ equals to zero if and only if at least one of the following conditions holds:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert y \vert = 8$.

From conditions 3 and 4, we know that the points must lie in a square with side length 16.
From conditions 1 and 2, we know that the points must lie on a square grid with a spacing of 10 units.

Therefore, the points that satisfy the equation are the intersections of these two conditions. These intersections form a square with side length 8.

The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 64.
The answer is: $64$
