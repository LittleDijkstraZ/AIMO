Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 To solve this problem, we need to understand the properties of the absolute value function and how it affects the number of solutions of the equation.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to the distance between the two inner absolute value functions' roots. The roots of $\vert x-1 \vert -2$ are $x = -1$ and $x = 3$, so the distance between them is $3 - (-1) = 4$. Therefore, we need $\frac{m}{100} = 4$, which gives $m = 400$.

So the only positive integer $m$ that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions is $400$. Therefore, the number of such $m$ is 1.

    return 1

result = number_of_m()

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. 

We know that the right side of the equation is always positive, so the left side, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, must also be positive. This means that $\vert x-1 \vert -2 > 0$, or $\vert x-1 \vert > 2$.

This inequality splits into two cases:

1. If $x-1 \geq 0$, then $x-1 > 2$, so $x > 3$.
2. If $x-1 < 0$, then $-(x-1) > 2$, so $x < -1$.

So, the solutions must be either greater than 3 or less than -1.

Now, let's analyze the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ in each of these cases:

1. If $x > 3$, then $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, so $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. This further splits into two cases:
   a. If $x-1 \geq 0$, then $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, so $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.
   b. If $x-1 < 0$, then $-(x-1) = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, so $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

2. If $x < -1$, then $\vert -(x-1) \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, so $\vert x+1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, and further $\vert x+1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. This also splits into two cases:
   a. If $x+1 \geq 0$, then $x+1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, so $x = 1 + \frac{m}{100}$.
   b. If $x+1 < 0$, then $-(x+1) = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, so $x = -3 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Now, we want the equation to have 4 distinct solutions. This happens when the four expressions for $x$ are all distinct. Comparing the four expressions, we see that the only overlapping ones are the third and the fourth. So, we need to find the value of $m$ for which $1 + \frac{m}{100} = -3 + \frac{m}{100}$, or $4 = \frac{m}{50}$, or $m = 200$.

So, the only value of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 200. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 1.

The answer is: $1$

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation has 4 distinct solutions, which means the right hand side $\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal to 2. This is because the absolute value function creates a V-shape graph which intersects the x-axis at $x=1 \pm 2$, which are 3 and -1. 

So, we have $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, which gives $m = 200$.

Therefore, the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 200.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def find_m():
    # The value of m for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions
    m = 200
    return m

result = find_m()
print(result)
```

200

Assistant:

 To solve this problem, we first need to understand the structure of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. This equation has four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $2$. Therefore, we have $m=200$.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the given condition is $1$. The answer is: $1$
