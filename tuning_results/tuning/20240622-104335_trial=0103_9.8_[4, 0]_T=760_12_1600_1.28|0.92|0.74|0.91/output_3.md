Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ is satisfied only when either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. These equations are all satisfied only when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$. These conditions form a square with side length $16$ (since $\vert x \vert = 8$ means $x = 8$ or $x = -8$, and similarly for $y$), and the area of a square is side length squared, so the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. So the area of the convex polygon formed by these points is $256$.

To solve the problem using Python, here is an example:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

256

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is $256$ square units. The answer is: $\boxed{256}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The equation is equal to zero if either of the two terms in the product is zero. That means either:
   a) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
   b) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
2. For the first equation to be zero, both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which simplifies to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This represents a square with side length 20.
3. For the second equation to be zero, both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which simplifies to $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This represents a square with side length 16.
4. To find the area of the convex polygon, we just need to sum the areas of these two squares. The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of the first square is $20^2 = 400$ and the area of the second square is $16^2 = 256$.
5. Adding these together gives us a total area of $400 + 256 = 656$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 656 square units. Therefore, the area is a positive integer: 656.

The answer is: $656$.

Assistant:

 The given equation is equal to zero if and only if both factors are equal to zero. This gives us the following systems of equations:

1. $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x-y| - 10 = 0$
2. $|x| - 8 = 0$ and $|y| - 8 = 0$

Solving these systems of equations, we find the following points:

1. $(x, y) = (8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$
2. $(x, y) = (8, 8), (-8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, -8)$

All these points coincide, so the set of points that satisfy the given equation are these four points. This means the convex polygon is a square with side length 16. The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

Note: The Python code to solve this problem would be as follows:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    # The side length of the square is 16
    side_length = 16

    # The area of a square is side length squared
    area = side_length ** 2

    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

256

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{256}$. The correct numerical answer is $256$. So the Python code to solve this problem is correct.
