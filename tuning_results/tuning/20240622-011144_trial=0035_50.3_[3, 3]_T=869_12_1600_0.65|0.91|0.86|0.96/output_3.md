Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The expression $A = ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is zero if and only if at least one of the factors is zero. This happens if and only if either $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$. These four conditions describe four lines in the plane: the lines $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The intersection of these lines is a square with side length 6 (since the square with side length 8 that is centered at the origin is translated 5 units in the positive and negative x and y directions). Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $6^2 = 36$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 36.

    # The side length of the square is 6 (since the square with side length 8 that is centered at the origin is translated 5 units in the positive and negative x and y directions)
    side_length = 6

    # The area of the square is side_length^2
    area = side_length ** 2

    return area

result = area_of_polygon()

The area of the convex polygon is 36. The answer is $\boxed{36}$.

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

If either $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x-y| - 10 = 0$, then $|x+y| = 10$ or $|x-y| = 10$. These are the equations of two lines parallel to the x-axis and y-axis respectively, and they form a square with side length 20.

If either $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$, then $|x| = 8$ or $|y| = 8$. These are the equations of two lines parallel to the y-axis and x-axis respectively, and they form a square with side length 16.

The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for. The area of the convex polygon is the area of the smaller square, which is $16^2 = 256$. 

So the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The expression $A = ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if both of its factors are equal to zero. This gives us two systems of equations:

1) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2) $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For each of these systems, we have:

1.1) $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$.
1.2) $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

Now, let's analyze each equation:

- $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ gives $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
- $\vert x \vert = 8$ gives $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
- $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ gives $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
- $\vert y \vert = 8$ gives $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

Solving these systems of equations, we find the following vertices for the polygon:

$(8, 2)$, $(8, -18)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, -18)$, $(2, 8)$, $(-18, 8)$, $(2, -8)$, and $(-18, -8)$.

Now, let's plot these points and determine the shape of the polygon:

- $(8, 2)$, $(8, -18)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -18)$ form a rectangle with side lengths $20$ and $32$.
- $(2, 8)$, $(-18, 8)$, $(2, -8)$, and $(-18, -8)$ form a rectangle with side lengths $32$ and $20$.

The area of the polygon is the area of either of these rectangles, which is $20 \times 32 = 640$.

So the area of the convex polygon is $640$. The answer is: $640$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The expression is equal to zero if either of the factors is equal to zero. This gives us two sets of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

2. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first set of equations, we have:

1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

This implies that $x = 8$, $y = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = -8$, $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

For the second set of equations, we have:

2. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

This implies that $x = 8$, $y = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = -8$, $x + y = -10$, $x + y = 10$, $x - y = -10$, and $x - y = 10$.

Solving these equations, we get the same vertices as in the first set of equations.

So, the vertices of the polygon are $(8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, and $(-8, -8)$. These vertices form a square with side length 16.

The area of the square is side length squared, which is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units.

The answer is: $256$

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero, or the second term is zero, or both are zero.

The first term is zero when $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. These equations simplify to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

The second term is zero when $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. These equations simplify to $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The solutions to these equations are the vertices of the polygon. The polygon is a square with side length 20 (since the vertices are $(\pm 8, \pm 8)$ and $(\pm 10, \pm 10)$). The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of the polygon is $20^2 = 400$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 400. The answer is: $400$

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, which means either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.

The first term is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, and this term is zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These two equations represent two squares with side length 10, centered at the origin, with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. The intersection of these two squares is a square with side length 10 and area $10^2 = 100$.

The second term is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$, and this term is zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These two equations represent two squares with side length 8, centered at the origin, with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. The intersection of these two squares is a square with side length 8 and area $8^2 = 64$.

The convex polygon enclosed by the points satisfying the given equation is the intersection of the two squares, which is a square with side length 8. Therefore, the area of this convex polygon is 64. The answer is: $64$

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, which means that either of the terms must be zero for the entire equation to be zero. This gives us two sets of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first set of equations, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$, and $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, and $(-10, 0)$.

For the second set of equations, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = 8$ or $x = -8$, and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The convex polygon formed by these vertices is a square with side length 10. The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side, so the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The expression $A = ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to 0 if and only if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. 

This translates to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

Solving these absolute value equations, we get four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. Also, $x = 8$ and $x = -8$, $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

The area of this rectangle is $(8-(-8))*(8-(-8)) = 16*16 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256.

Here is the python code to calculate the area of the polygon:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    # The sides of the rectangle
    x_positive = 8
    y_positive = 8
    
    # Calculate the area
    area = (x_positive * 2) * (y_positive * 2)
    
    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

256

The area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$
