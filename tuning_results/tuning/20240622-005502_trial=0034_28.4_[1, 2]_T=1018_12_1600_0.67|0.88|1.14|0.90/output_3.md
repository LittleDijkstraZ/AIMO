 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

The first term is zero when either $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x-y| - 10 = 0$. These simplify to $|x+y| = 10$ and $|x-y| = 10$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x+y = 10$, $x+y = -10$, $x-y = 10$, and $x-y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(10,0)$, $(0,10)$, $(-10,0)$, and $(0,-10)$.

The second term is zero when either $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$. These simplify to $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(8,0)$, $(0,8)$, $(-8,0)$, and $(0,-8)$.

The intersection of the two rectangles is a square with side length 8 and area $8^2 = 64$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 64.

 The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. For the product of two numbers to be zero, either one of the numbers must be zero. This gives us two cases:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This can only happen if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, -2)$, and $(-8, 2)$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This can only happen if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$.

Combining the vertices from both cases, we find that the points satisfying the given equation enclose a square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$. The area of this square is $(10\sqrt{2})^2 = 200$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $200$. The answer is: $200$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is true if and only if both of the following conditions are met:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From condition 1, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle with side lengths of 20 and 10 units.

From condition 2, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length of 16 units.

The intersection of the two regions is a smaller square with side length of 8 units.

The area of the rectangle is $20 \times 10 = 200$ square units, and the area of the square with side length of 8 units is $8^2 = 64$ square units. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $200 - 64 = 136$ square units.

The answer is: $136$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to the system of equations:

$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$$
$$((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$

From the first equation, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving this system of equations, we find that the solutions are:

$$(x, y) = (5, 5), (-5, -5), (5, -5), (-5, 5)$$

From the second equation, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving this system of equations, we find that the solutions are:

$$(x, y) = (8, 8), (-8, -8), (8, -8), (-8, 8)$$

The intersection of the solutions of the two equations gives us the vertices of the polygon:

$$(x, y) = (5, 5), (-5, -5), (5, -5), (-5, 5), (8, 8), (-8, -8), (8, -8), (-8, 8)$$

The polygon is a square with side length 10. The area of the square is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. 

For the first expression, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, both terms must be zero, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us four lines: $x + y = \pm10$ and $x - y = \pm10$.

For the second expression, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, both terms must be zero, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us four lines: $x = \pm8$ and $y = \pm8$.

The intersection of these lines form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

The answer is: $256$

1. The expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This is the equation of a square with side length 20 centered at the origin.

2. Similarly, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which is a square with side length 16 centered at the origin.

3. The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for. It is a square with side length 8 (the smaller of the two squares' side lengths).

4. The area of a square is given by the square of its side length. So, the area of the convex polygon is $8^2 = 64$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 64.

Here is the entire script:

    # The expression |y| - 8 = 0 implies |y| = 8
    # The intersection of these two squares forms a smaller square with side length 8
