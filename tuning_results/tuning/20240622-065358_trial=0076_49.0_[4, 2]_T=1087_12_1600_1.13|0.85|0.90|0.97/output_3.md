Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

 The problem statement itself is not a typical programming task. However, the equation given, $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$, implies that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first case, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, it means that both $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two perpendicular lines, $x = y$ and $x = -y$.

For the second case, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, it means that both $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two circles with radius 8 centered at the origin.

The convex polygon is the intersection of these lines and circles. It is a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{256}$.

 The equation $AB = 0$ is satisfied if and only if $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the given equation is satisfied if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The first equation is satisfied if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This is the set of points that lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$, as well as the lines $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.
The second equation is satisfied if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This is the set of points that lie on the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $100$. The answer is: $100$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Step 1: We notice that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Thus, the given equation is equivalent to the following system of equations:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

Step 2: To solve the system, we take each equation separately:

For equation 1: $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$, which gives us $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. This means $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.

For equation 2: $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which gives us $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.

For equation 3: $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$, which gives us $\vert x \vert = 8$. This means $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.

For equation 4: $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which gives us $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

Step 3: We solve all combinations of the above equations and find the vertices of the polygon:

1. $(x, y) = (8, 2)$
2. $(x, y) = (8, -2)$
3. $(x, y) = (-8, 2)$
4. $(x, y) = (-8, -2)$
5. $(x, y) = (2, 8)$
6. $(x, y) = (2, -8)$
7. $(x, y) = (-2, 8)$
8. $(x, y) = (-2, -8)$

Step 4: Plot these points and connect them to form a polygon.

Step 5: Calculate the area of the polygon. In this case, it's a square with side length 16.

Area of the square = side^2 = 16^2 = 256.

So, the area of the polygon is 256.

The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, notice that the expression equals 0 if either of the terms equals 0. This translates to four separate equations:
   a) $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$
   b) $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$

2. For each of the absolute value equations, we need to consider both the positive and negative cases:
   a) For $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$, we have $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
   b) For $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, we have $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
   c) For $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$, we have $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
   d) For $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, we have $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

3. This gives us a total of 8 separate lines in the coordinate plane:
   a) $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.
   b) $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

4. These lines form a square with side length 16 (from $-8$ to $8$ in both the x and y directions).

5. The area of this square is simply the side length squared, or $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256. To confirm, we can write a simple python script to calculate it:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

256

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```

The area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is $\boxed{256}$.
