Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

The given equation is satisfied only when both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. 
This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. 
The absolute value equations have the following solutions: 
$\vert x + y \vert = 10$ gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$. 
$\vert x \vert = 8$ gives us $x = 8$ and $x = -8$. 
$\vert y \vert = 8$ gives us $y = 8$ and $y = -8$. 
The lines intersect to form a square with side length 16. 
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $16 \times 16 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

 This problem requires a mathematical analysis rather than a computational one. The equation given is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either of the terms must be zero. This gives us the following four conditions:
1. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$
2. $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$
3. $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$
4. $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$

Solving these conditions, we find the points that satisfy them:
1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10 \Rightarrow x + y = \pm 10$
2. $\vert x - y \vert = 10 \Rightarrow x - y = \pm 10$
3. $\vert x \vert = 8 \Rightarrow x = \pm 8$
4. $\vert y \vert = 8 \Rightarrow y = \pm 8$

The intersections of these lines give us the vertices of the polygon:
$(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$

The polygon is a square with side length $16$, so its area is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

The problem states that we are to find the area of a convex polygon formed by the points $\left(x, y\right)$ that satisfy the given equation. The equation is
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]
This equation is satisfied if either of the two factors is zero.

The first factor is zero if either $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. This simplifies to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two lines forming a cross.

The second factor is zero if either $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which simplifies to $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two lines forming a cross as well.

The intersection of the two crosses is a square with side length 8. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of the square, which is $8^2 = 64$.

To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, let's understand what the equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies.

In the first equation, for a sum or difference of absolute values to be zero, both absolute values must be zero, i.e., $x + y = 0$ and $x - y = 0$, which implies $x = y = 0$. Thus, the first equation implies the point $(0,0)$.

In the second equation, for a sum or difference of absolute values to be zero, both absolute values must be zero, i.e., $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$, which implies $-8 \leq x \leq 8$ and $-8 \leq y \leq 8$. Thus, the second equation implies a square with side length $16$.

So, the points that satisfy the given equation are $(0,0)$ and all points in the square with side length $16$. This means the area of the polygon is the area of the square, which is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is a positive integer: 256. The answer is: $\boxed{256}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation given is: $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$

This equation will equal zero if either of the two products equals zero. So we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first case, this means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of the lines forming the diamond-shape in the coordinate plane.

For the second case, this means $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of the lines forming the square-shape in the coordinate plane.

The intersection of these two shapes forms a convex polygon, which is a square with side length 10 (the square formed by the lines $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ is inside the diamond-shape formed by the lines $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$).

The area of this square is side length squared, so $10^2 = 100$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 100. 

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    side_length = 10
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)

The area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

The problem given asks for the area of a polygon formed by the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equation
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$

If the product of two numbers is zero, then at least one of the numbers must be zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. This gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. The polygon formed by the intersection of these lines is a square with side length 10.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. The polygon formed by the intersection of these lines is also a square with side length 16.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of the larger square minus the area of the smaller square. The side length of the larger square is 16 and the side length of the smaller square is 10, so the area of the convex polygon is $16^2 - 10^2 = 256 - 100 = 156$. So the area of the polygon is 156. The answer is: $156$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The expression $A = ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is zero if and only if at least one of its factors is zero.

For $A$ to be zero, one of the following must be true:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

These are equivalent to the following:
1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$
2. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$
3. $\vert x \vert = 8$
4. $\vert y \vert = 8$

The equations $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$ represent 4 lines in the plane, and they enclose a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256.
The answer is: $256$.
