Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We are asked to solve the inequality $|x+y-10|^2 + |x-y-10|^2 \cdot |x-8|^2 + |y-8|^2 = 0$.

2. The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

   a. $|x+y-10|^2 = 0$ and $|x-8|^2 + |y-8|^2 \neq 0$.
   b. $|x-y-10|^2 = 0$ and $|x-8|^2 + |y-8|^2 \neq 0$.

3. For case a, $|x+y-10|^2 = 0$ implies $x+y=10$.
   For case b, $|x-y-10|^2 = 0$ implies $x-y=10$.

4. The intersection of these two lines is the point $(10, 0)$.

5. The area of the convex polygon formed by the intersection of these lines and the circle $|x-8|^2 + |y-8|^2 = 0$ is a square with side length $10$ (since the distance from $(0,0)$ to $(10,0)$ is $10$).

6. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $100$. The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of them is zero. Thus, the given equation is equivalent to the system of equations:
   $$ ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0 $$
   $$ ((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0 $$

2. The first equation is satisfied if and only if $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving this system of equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, and $(-5,-5)$.

3. The second equation is satisfied if and only if $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving this system of equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(8,0)$, $(0,8)$, $(-8,0)$, and $(0,-8)$.

4. The polygon is a square with side length $10$. To find the area of the square, we use the formula $s^2$, where $s$ is the side length. So the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

 The equation is satisfied only when both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(2, 8)$, $(-2, 8)$, $(2, -8)$, and $(-2, -8)$. These points form a square with side length 16. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. Therefore, either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.

The first term is zero when $|\pm x \pm y| - 10 = 0$, which simplifies to $|\pm x \pm y| = 10$. This gives us four linear equations: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(0, 10)$, $(10, 0)$, $(0, -10)$, and $(-10, 0)$.

The second term is zero when $|\pm x| - 8 = 0$ or $|\pm y| - 8 = 0$, which simplifies to $|\pm x| = 8$ or $|\pm y| = 8$. This gives us four linear equations: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(8, -8)$.

The intersection of these two shapes is a square with side length $10$ (the maximum of $10$ and $8$), so its area is $10^2 = 100$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $100$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():

    side_length = 10  # The maximum of 10 and 8
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)

The area of the convex polygon is $100$. The answer is: $100$
