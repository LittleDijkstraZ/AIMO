Assistant:

 The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero, or the second expression is zero, or both are zero. 

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. This expression is zero if and only if both $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square with side length 10.

The second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. This expression is zero if and only if both $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square with side length 16.

The convex polygon is the intersection of these two squares. It is a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.
The first term is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, which is zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two squares in the coordinate plane, centered at the origin with side length 20.
The second term is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$, which is zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two squares in the coordinate plane, centered at the origin with side length 16.
The intersection of these squares is a square with side length 8, so the area of the convex polygon is $8^2 = 64$. The answer is: $64$

To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of them is zero. Therefore, the equation

\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0\]

implies that either

\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0\]
or
\[((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]

If $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies that $x = 0$ and $y = 0$.

If $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that $-8 \le x \le 8$ and $-8 \le y \le 8$.

The points $\left(x, y\right)$ that satisfy the equation form a square with side length 16, so its area is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is a positive integer, not an algebraic expression! The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ have to be solved.

From $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, and $(-10, 0)$.

Similarly, from $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(8, 0)$, $(-8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, and $(0, -8)$.

Now, we can plot these points on a coordinate plane and connect them to form the polygon. It's a square with side length 10 units. The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of the polygon is $10^2 = 100$.

The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, we need to understand the equation given in the problem. The equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, which means either of the expressions should be zero.
2. Let's consider the first expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This expression will be zero only when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$.
3. Similarly, for the second expression $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, it will be zero only when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$.
4. The intersection of these lines form a square with side length 10 (from $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$) and vertices at $(8, 2)$, $(8, 18)$, $(-2, 18)$, and $(-2, 2)$.
5. To find the area of this square, we simply square the length of one of its sides. The side length is 10, so the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 100.

The entire script to solve this problem is as follows:

```python

def area_of_polygon():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    # The side length of the square is 10 (from x + y = 10 and x - y = 10)
    side_length = 10
    # The area of the square is side_length^2
    area = side_length**2
    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

100

The area of the convex polygon is $100$. The answer is: $\boxed{100}$
