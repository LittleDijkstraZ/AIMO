Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

The first term is zero when either $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x-y| - 10 = 0$. These simplify to $|x+y| = 10$ and $|x-y| = 10$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x+y = 10$, $x+y = -10$, $x-y = 10$, and $x-y = -10$.

The second term is zero when either $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$. These simplify to $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The lines $x+y = 10$, $x+y = -10$, $x-y = 10$, and $x-y = -10$ form a rectangle with vertices at $(8,2)$, $(-8,2)$, $(-8,-2)$, and $(8,-2)$. The lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$ form a square with side length 16 and vertices at $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

The convex polygon formed by the intersection of these two sets of lines is a square with side length 8. Therefore, its area is $8^2 = 64$. The answer is: $64$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We are given the equation: $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$
2. This equation equals zero if and only if either of the two factors equals zero.
3. Therefore, we have two sets of equations to solve: $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$, $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$, and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.
4. Solving these equations, we find the vertices of the polygon: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.
5. To find the area of the polygon, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle and subtract the areas of the four right triangles formed by the sides of the rectangle.
6. The length of the rectangle is $16$ (from $8$ to $-8$ on both the x and y axes), and the width is $16$ (from $8$ to $-8$ on both the x and y axes).
7. The area of the rectangle is $16 \times 16 = 256$.
8. Each right triangle has a base and height of $8$, so the area of each triangle is $\frac{1}{2} \times 8 \times 8 = 32$.
9. There are four triangles, so the total area of the triangles is $4 \times 32 = 128$.
10. The area of the convex polygon is the area of the rectangle minus the area of the triangles, so it is $256 - 128 = 128$.

The area of the convex polygon is $128$. However, this doesn't seem right, as the polygon is a square with side length $16$, so its area should be $256$. Let's reevaluate our steps:

1. We are given the equation: $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$
2. This equation equals zero if and only if either of the two factors equals zero.
3. Therefore, we have two sets of equations to solve: $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$, $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$, and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.
4. Solving these equations, we find the vertices of the polygon: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.
5. To find the area of the polygon, we can use the formula for the area of a square and subtract the areas of the four right triangles formed by the sides of the square.
6. The side length of the square is $16$, so the area of the square is $16 \times 16 = 256$.
7. Each right triangle has a base and height of $8$, so the area of each triangle is $\frac{1}{2} \times 8 \times 8 = 32$.
8. There are four triangles, so the total area of the triangles is $4 \times 32 = 128$.
9. The area of the convex polygon is the area of the square minus the area of the triangles, so it is $256 - 128 = 128$.

The area of the convex polygon is $128$. However, this doesn't seem right, as the polygon is a square with side length $16$, so its area should be $256$. Let's reevaluate our steps:

1. We are given the equation: $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$
2. This equation equals zero if and only if either of the two factors equals zero.
3. Therefore, we have two sets of equations to solve: $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$, $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$, and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.
4. Solving these equations, we find the vertices of the polygon: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.
5. To find the area of the polygon, we can use the formula for the area of a square and subtract the areas of the four right triangles formed by the sides of the square.
6. The side length of the square is $16$, so the area of the square is $16 \times 16 = 256$.
7. Each right triangle has a base and height of $8$, so the area of each triangle is $\frac{1}{2} \times 8 \times 8 = 32$.
8. There are four triangles, so the total area of the triangles is $4 \times 32 = 128$.
9. The area of the convex polygon is the area of the square minus the area of the triangles, so it is $256 - 128 = 128$.

However, we made a mistake in step 5. The vertices of the polygon are actually $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$, which form a square with side length $16$. Therefore, the area of the square is $16 \times 16 = 256$. The area of the convex polygon is the area of the square, which is $256$.

The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

2. If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

3. If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

4. The intersection of these lines form a square with side length 16.

5. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

    # The expression (|x| - 8)^2 + (|y| - 8)^2 = 0 gives us the lines x = 8, x = -8, y = 8, and y = -8
    # The intersection of these lines form a square with side length 16
    # The area of the square is 16^2 = 256

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, we observe that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to the system of equations:

$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0,$$
$$((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$

2. Each of the above equations implies that $|x+y|=10$ and $|x-y|=10$, and $|x|=8$ and $|y|=8$ respectively.

3. The solutions to the first system of equations are all points $(x, y)$ such that $x+y = \pm 10$ and $x-y = \pm 10$. This system of equations has four solutions: $(5, 5)$, $(5, -5)$, $(-5, 5)$, and $(-5, -5)$.

4. The solutions to the second system of equations are all points $(x, y)$ such that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This system of equations has four solutions: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

5. The eight points found above form a square with side length $10$. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$.

The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of them is zero. Thus the given equation is equivalent to the system of equations:

\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0\]
\[((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0\]

Each of the equations in this system implies that the absolute value of one of the variables is equal to 8, and the absolute value of the other variable is equal to 10. This implies that the points must lie on a square with side length 16 centered at the origin. Therefore, the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

The answer is: $256$
