 The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. For the product of two numbers to be zero, either one of the numbers must be zero. This gives us two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This can only happen if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(10,0)$, $(-10,0)$, $(0,10)$, and $(0,-10)$.

2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This can only happen if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This forms a square with vertices at $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

The intersection of the rectangle and the square gives us the convex polygon. To find the area of this polygon, we can simply find the area of the rectangle and subtract the area of the square that is outside the rectangle. The rectangle has side lengths of 20 units (from $(10,0)$ to $(-10,0)$ or from $(0,10)$ to $(0,-10)$) and the square has side lengths of 16 units (from $(8,8)$ to $(-8,8)$ or from $(8,8)$ to $(8,-8)$). The area of the rectangle is $20 \times 20 = 400$ square units, and the area of the square is $16 \times 16 = 256$ square units. The area of the convex polygon is therefore $400 - 256 = 144$ square units.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
For the product of two numbers to be zero, either one of the numbers must be zero. Therefore, we have two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only possible solution for this case is when $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$.

2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The only possible solution for this case is when $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

Combining the two cases, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(8, -8)$. This forms a square with side length $16$. The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of the polygon is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, let's notice that this problem can be simplified using the property of absolute value that $|a|^2 = a^2$. Therefore, we can rewrite the equation as follows:

$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$

Now, this equation equals to zero if and only if either of the two terms equals to zero. Hence, we have four cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 \neq 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 \neq 0$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 \neq 0$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 \neq 0$.

For case 1, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.
For case 2, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which gives us four lines: $x - y = 10$, $x - y = -10$, $x + y = 10$, and $x + y = -10$.
For case 3, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$, which gives us two lines: $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.
For case 4, we have $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us two lines: $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

The intersection of these lines form a square with side length $16$. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So the area of the convex polygon is 256.

The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The given equation is a product of two terms, each of which is a square of a difference. The product is zero if and only if at least one of the terms is zero. Therefore, we need to solve the equations:

1. $|x+y| - 10 = 0$
2. $|x-y| - 10 = 0$
3. $|x| - 8 = 0$
4. $|y| - 8 = 0$

Let's solve each of these equations:

1. $|x+y| = 10$ implies $x+y = 10$ or $x+y = -10$.
2. $|x-y| = 10$ implies $x-y = 10$ or $x-y = -10$.
3. $|x| = 8$ implies $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
4. $|y| = 8$ implies $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

Combining the solutions from these four equations, we get the following vertices of the polygon:

$(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8), (10, 0), (0, 10), (-10, 0), (0, -10)$.

Now, let's plot these points on a coordinate plane and observe the polygon formed by them. We see that it's a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

Here is the python code to solve this problem:

```python

from sympy import symbols, Abs, solveset, S

def area_of_polygon():
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # Define the equations

    eq2 = Abs(x - y) - 10
    eq3 = Abs(x) - 8
    eq4 = Abs(y) - 8

    # Solve the equations
    solutions1 = solveset(eq1, x, domain=S.Reals)
    solutions2 = solveset(eq2, x, domain=S.Reals)
    solutions3 = solveset(eq3, x, domain=S.Reals)
    solutions4 = solveset(eq4, y, domain=S.Reals)

    # Get the vertices of the polygon
    vertices = [(x_val, y_val) for x_val in solutions3 for y_val in solutions4] + \
               [(x_val, y_val) for x_val in solutions1 for y_val in solutions4] + \
               [(x_val, y_val) for x_val in solutions2 for y_val in solutions4] + \
               [(x_val, y_val) for x_val in solutions1 for y_val in solutions3]

    # Calculate the side length of the square
    side_length = sqrt((vertices[0][0] - vertices[1][0])**2 + (vertices[0][1] - vertices[1][1])**2)

    # Calculate the area of the square
    area = side_length**2

    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
