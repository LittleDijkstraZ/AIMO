Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

First, let's analyze the problem. The equation is a product of two terms, each of which is a squared expression. The product will be zero if and only if at least one of the terms is zero. This gives us two separate cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two lines in the $x$-$y$ plane.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two more lines in the $x$-$y$ plane.

The intersection of these lines will form a rectangle with side lengths 16 and 20. Therefore, the area of the rectangle is $16 \times 20 = 320$. So the area of the convex polygon is 320.

Here is a Python function that calculates the area:

```python

def polygon_area():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    # Calculate the side lengths of the rectangle
    length = 2 * 10
    width = 2 * 8

    # Calculate the area of the rectangle
    area = length * width

    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

320

CODE RESULTS 320

```output

```

The area of the convex polygon is $320$. The answer is: $320$

 The given equation is a product of two terms equals to zero, which means either the first term equals to zero or the second term equals to zero.
The first term is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$ and the second term is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$.
For the first term to be zero, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$, which gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.
For the second term to be zero, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$, which gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.
The intersection points of these lines form a rectangle with side lengths $20$ and $16$. The area of this rectangle is $20 \times 16 = 320$. So, the area of the convex polygon is $320$. The answer is: $320$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. Let's start by understanding the problem. The problem is asking for the area of the region enclosed by the points $\left(x, y\right)$ that satisfy the given equation.

2. The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. In order for the product of two numbers to be zero, either one of the numbers must be zero. Therefore, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

3. If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations we get the lines $y = -x + 10$ and $y = x - 10$.

4. If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So we get the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

5. The region enclosed by these lines is a square with side length $20$. Therefore, the area of the region is $20^2 = 400$. The answer is: $400$

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.

The first term is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, and it equals to zero if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

The intersection of these lines form a square with side length 10, so the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The equation given is a product of two terms equal to zero, which means either one of the terms has to be zero for the equation to hold. So we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

In the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us the lines $x + y = \pm10$ and $x - y = \pm10$. In the second case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us the lines $x = \pm8$ and $y = \pm8$. These lines form a rectangle with side lengths 16 and 20.

To find the area of the rectangle, we multiply the side lengths: $16 \times 20 = 320$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 320 square units.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    # Side lengths of the rectangle
    length = 16
    width = 20

    # Area of the rectangle
    area = length * width

    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

320

The area of the convex polygon is $320$ square units. The answer is $\boxed{320}$.
