Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We need to find the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points that satisfy the equation.
2. The equation is given as $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
3. The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So, we have two cases:
   a. Either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
   b. Either $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
4. For each case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
5. Solving these equations, we find the points that satisfy the conditions.
6. The points form a square with side length 16.
7. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, we need to understand the problem. The equation given is a product of two quadratic expressions equal to zero. This means that either one of the expressions is zero, or both are zero.

2. The expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ is zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. This is the equation of a square with side length 20. Similarly, the expression $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ is zero if and only if $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which is also the equation of a square with side length 20.

3. The expression $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ is zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$, which is the equation of a horizontal line segment of length 16. Similarly, the expression $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2$ is zero if and only if $\vert y \vert = 8$, which is the equation of a vertical line segment of length 16.

4. The intersection of these four squares and line segments forms a convex polygon, which is a square with side length 16.

5. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

The python code to compute the area is simple:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

256

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is $\boxed{256}$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is equal to zero if and only if both of the factors are equal to zero.
The first factor is zero if and only if $|x + y| = 10$ or $|x - y| = 10$.
The second factor is zero if and only if $|x| = 8$ or $|y| = 8$.

The lines $|x + y| = 10$, $|x - y| = 10$, $|x| = 8$, and $|y| = 8$ form a rectangle with vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The length of the rectangle is $2*8 = 16$ and the width is $2*8 = 16$, so the area of the rectangle is $16*16 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256.
The answer is: $256$
