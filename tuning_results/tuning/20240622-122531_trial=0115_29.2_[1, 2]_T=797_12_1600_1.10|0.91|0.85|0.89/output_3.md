Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, we see that the product of two terms equals zero if and only if at least one of the terms equals zero. That is, the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is equivalent to the following system of equations:
   $$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0,$$
   $$(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0.$$

2. The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. These are four lines in the plane: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

3. The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. These are four lines in the plane: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

4. The intersection points of these lines form a square with side length 10.

5. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $100$.

The answer is: $100$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 This problem is quite complex and would require a deep understanding of absolute value functions and their properties, as well as knowledge of mathematical analysis and geometry.

However, upon closer inspection, the equation is actually the product of two separate equations:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$$
and
$$((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$

The first equation implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the sum of the absolute values of $x$ and $y$ is always $10$, and the absolute value of the difference of $x$ and $y$ is also $10$. These are the conditions for a rectangle with side lengths of $10$ and $20$, so the area of this rectangle is $10 \times 20 = 200$.

The second equation implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that the absolute values of $x$ and $y$ are both $8$, so the points are confined within a square with side length $16$.

Since the first equation encloses a rectangle with side lengths of $10$ and $20$ and the second equation encloses a square with side length $16$, the intersection of these two areas is the convex polygon that we are looking for. The area of this convex polygon is the area of the rectangle, which is $200$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $200$.

So the answer is: $200$.

Below is a Python program to calculate the area of the polygon formed by the intersection of the two regions:

```python

def area_of_polygon():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    # The side lengths of the rectangle are 10 and 20
    length = 10
    width = 20

    # Calculate the area of the rectangle
    area = length * width

    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

200

The area of the convex polygon is $200$. The answer is $\boxed{200}$.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ equals zero if and only if both of its factors equal zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The first equation holds if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$.

The second equation holds if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

Combining the solutions from the two equations, we see that the points satisfying the given equation are the vertices of a larger square, with side length $16$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The given expression is a product of two expressions, and it equals zero. A product equals zero if any of the terms equals zero. Therefore, either the first expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or the second expression $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ equals zero.

For the first expression to be zero, both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ must lie on a square with side length $20$.

For the second expression to be zero, both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ must lie on a square with side length $16$.

The intersection of these two areas is a square with side length $20 - 8 = 12$. The area of this square is therefore $12^2 = 144$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import *

def area_of_polygon():
    # Side length of the square
    side_length = 20 - 8

    # Area of the square

 The equation is equivalent to the product of two equations being zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first equation, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, it means that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This forms a square with side length 20, so the area is $20^2 = 400$.

For the second equation, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, it means that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This forms a square with side length 16, so the area is $16^2 = 256$.

However, the second equation is not possible because it would mean that both x and y are in the range of -8 to 8, but the first equation requires that either $|x+y|=10$ or $|x-y|=10$, which is not possible when both x and y are in the range of -8 to 8.

Therefore, the only possible solution is the first equation, and the area of the convex polygon is 400. The answer is: $400$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The expression $A \cdot B = 0$ is equivalent to either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Thus the points that satisfy the equation are the union of the points that satisfy each of the equations:

$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$$
$$((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$

From the first equation we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that the points that satisfy this equation are those that are at a distance of 10 from the origin in the x-y plane, forming a square with side length 20.

From the second equation we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that the points that satisfy this equation are those that are at a distance of 8 from the origin in the x and y directions, forming a square with side length 16.

The intersection of these two squares is a smaller square with side length 8. So the area of the convex polygon is the area of the smaller square, which is $8^2 = 64$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 64 square units. The answer is: $64$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The condition of the problem is a multiplication of two terms equal to 0. Hence, either the first term is equal to zero or the second term is equal to zero. 

For the first term to be equal to zero, either $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x - y| - 10 = 0$. That implies $|x+y| = 10$ or $|x - y| = 10$. These are the equations of two lines, so they form a rectangle. The length of the rectangle is $20$ and the width is $20$, so the area of the rectangle is $400$.

For the second term to be equal to zero, either $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$. That implies $|x| = 8$ or $|y| = 8$. These are the equations of two lines, so they form a square. The side of the square is $16$, so the area of the square is $256$.

Hence, the total area is the sum of the areas of the two figures, which is $400 + 256 = 656$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def calculate_area():
    # The area of the rectangle
    rectangle_area = 20 * 20

 The equation is equal to zero if either of the factors is equal to zero.
The first factor, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$, is equal to zero if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.
Solving these equations, we find that the solutions are the points $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, and $(-5,-5)$.
The second factor, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, is equal to zero if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
Solving these equations, we find that the solutions are the points $(8,0)$, $(0,8)$, $(-8,0)$, and $(0,-8)$.

Putting all of these points together, we see that the points enclose a square with side length $10$.
The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.
So the area of the convex polygon is $100$. The answer is: $100$

 The given equation is a product of two quadratic expressions equaling zero. This means that either the first quadratic expression equals zero or the second quadratic expression equals zero. 

For the first quadratic expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, it can only be zero if both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. This gives us $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we find that the points that satisfy these conditions are $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, and $(-10, 0)$.

For the second quadratic expression $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, it can only be zero if both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. This gives us $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. The points that satisfy these conditions are $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

Now we can plot these points on a coordinate plane and connect them with line segments to form a square with side length $10$ units. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$ square units. So the area of the convex polygon is $100$ square units.
