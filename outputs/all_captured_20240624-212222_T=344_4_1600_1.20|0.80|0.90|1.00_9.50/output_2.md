Below is an instruction that describes a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!). Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"

### Response: Let's think step by step.


The expression $| |x-1|-2|$ simplifies to $|x-1-2|$ if $x \geq 3$, and to $|2-x|$ if $x \leq 1$.
In order for the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, both cases must hold.
If $x \geq 3$, then $|x-1-2|=|x-3|$ must have 4 distinct solutions.
This occurs when $m$ is a multiple of 100 (since $|x-3|$ ranges from 0 to 2).
If $x \leq 1$, then $|2-x|$ must have 4 distinct solutions.
This occurs when $m$ is a multiple of 25 (since $|2-x|$ ranges from 1 to 2).
Therefore, $m$ must be a multiple of both 100 and 25, or $m$ must be a multiple of 2500.
The positive multiples of 2500 are 2500, 5000, 7500, and so on.
So, there are $\boxed{3}$ positive integers $m$ that satisfy the given conditions.
The answer is: 3

Below is an instruction that describes a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!). Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"

### Response: Let's think step by step.


The equation can be rewritten as \[\vert x-1 \vert - 2 = \pm \frac{m}{100}.\]
Since we want 4 distinct solutions, we need to consider both cases: \[\vert x-1 \vert - 2 = \frac{m}{100}\] and \[\vert x-1 \vert - 2 = -\frac{m}{100}.\]
For the first case, we have \[\vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100} + 2.\]
This means that the distance between $x$ and 1 is $\frac{m}{100} + 2$.
To have 4 distinct solutions, we need this distance to be greater than or equal to 2 (since $x$ can be 1).
So we have the inequality \[\frac{m}{100} + 2 \geq 2.\]
Simplifying, we get \[\frac{m}{100} \geq 0.\]
This inequality holds for all positive values of $m$.
For the second case, we have \[\vert x-1 \vert = -\frac{m}{100} + 2.\]
This means that the distance between $x$ and 1 is $-\frac{m}{100} + 2$.
To have 4 distinct solutions, we need this distance to be less than or equal to 2 (since $x$ can be 1).
So we have the inequality \[\frac{m}{100} + 2 \leq 2.\]
Simplifying, we get \[\frac{m}{100} \leq 0.\]
This inequality holds for all positive values of $m$.
Therefore, the equation has 4 distinct solutions for all positive values of $m$.
The answer is: 0

Below is an instruction that describes a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!). Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"

### Response: Let's think step by step.


First, we simplify the equation.
\[| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}\]
Since the absolute value of a number is always non-negative, we can rewrite the equation as
\[|x-1|-2=\frac{m}{100}.\]
Now, we consider two cases:
Case 1: $|x-1|-2 \ge 0$
In this case, the equation becomes
\[|x-1|=\frac{m}{100}+2.\]
Since the absolute value of a number is always non-negative, we can rewrite the equation as
\[x-1=\frac{m}{100}+2 \quad \text{or} \quad -(x-1)=\frac{m}{100}+2.\]
Simplifying, we get
\[x=\frac{m}{100}+3 \quad \text{or} \quad x=-\frac{m}{100}+1.\]
Case 2: $|x-1|-2 < 0$
In this case, the equation becomes
\[-(|x-1|-2)=\frac{m}{100}.\]
Simplifying, we get
\[-(x-1)+2=\frac{m}{100} \quad \text{or} \quad -(-(x-1))+2=\frac{m}{100}.\]
Simplifying further, we get
\[x+1+2=\frac{m}{100} \quad \text{or} \quad x-1+2=\frac{m}{100}.\]
Simplifying again, we get
\[x=\frac{m}{100}+3 \quad \text{or} \quad x=\frac{m}{100}+1.\]
Therefore, the possible values of $x$ are $\frac{m}{100}+3$, $\frac{m}{100}+2$, $\frac{m}{100}+1$, $-\frac{m}{100}+1$, $-\frac{m}{100}+2$, and $-\frac{m}{100}+3$.
To have $4$ distinct solutions, we need at least $4$ different values among these $6$ possible values.
If $m$ is a multiple of $100$, then all $6$ possible values are the same, so there are no solutions.
If $m$ is not a multiple of $100$, then there are $4$ distinct values among these $6$ possible values, so there are $\boxed{99}$ possible values of $m$.
The answer is: 99

### Instruction:
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"

### Response: Let's think step by step.


First, let's simplify the equation.
\[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\]
We can simplify the expression inside the absolute value as follows:
\[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert\]
Now, let's consider the two cases:
Case 1: \(\vert x-1 \vert -2 \ge 0\)
In this case, the absolute value simplifies to:
\[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\vert x-1 \vert -2\]
So the equation becomes:
\[\vert x-1 \vert -2=\frac{m}{100}\]
Simplifying further, we get:
\[\vert x-1 \vert=\frac{m+2}{100}\]
Case 2: \(\vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0\)
In this case, the absolute value simplifies to:
\[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=-(\vert x-1 \vert -2)\]
So the equation becomes:
\[-(\vert x-1 \vert -2)=\frac{m}{100}\]
Simplifying further, we get:
\[2-(\vert x-1 \vert)=\frac{m}{100}\]
\[\vert x-1 \vert=\frac{m+2}{100}\]
Now, let's consider the solutions in each case:
Case 1: \(\vert x-1 \vert -2=\frac{m+2}{100}\)
In this case, we have two possible solutions: \(x-1=\frac{m+2}{100}\) and \(x-1=-\frac{m+2}{100}\).
Solving for \(x\) in each equation, we get:
\(x=\frac{m+3}{100}\) and \(x=\frac{m-1}{100}\)
Case 2: \(-(\vert x-1 \vert -2)=\frac{m}{100}\)
In this case, we also have two possible solutions: \(x-1=-\frac{m}{100}\) and \(x-1=\frac{m+2}{100}\).
Solving for \(x\) in each equation, we get:
\(x=1-\frac{m}{100}\) and \(x=\frac{m+2}{100}\)
Now, let's count the number of distinct solutions.
We have a total of \(4\) solutions: \(\frac{m+3}{100}\), \(\frac{m-1}{100}\), \(1-\frac{m}{100}\), and \(\frac{m+2}{100}\).
To ensure that these solutions are distinct, we need to make sure that none of them are equal.
Simplifying each solution, we get:
\(m+3\), \(m-1\), \(100-m\), and \(m+2\).
To find the number of positive integers \(m\) that satisfy this condition, we need to find the number of distinct positive integers among \(m+3\), \(m-1\), \(100-m\), and \(m+2\).
Since the sum of the distinct positive integers among these four numbers must be greater than \(3\), we can conclude that there are at least \(4\) distinct positive integers among these four numbers.
Therefore, the number of positive integers \(m\) that satisfy the condition is \(\boxed{3}\).The answer is: 3
