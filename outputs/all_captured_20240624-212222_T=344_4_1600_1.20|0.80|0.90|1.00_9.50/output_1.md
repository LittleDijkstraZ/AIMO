### Instruction:
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"

### Response: Let's think step by step.


First, we notice that $|x-2y| + |y-2x|$ is the expression we want to minimize.
This expression is equal to $|(x-2y)+(y-2x)|$ by the triangle inequality.
Simplifying, we get $|-x-y+4|$.
We want to find the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ given that $|-x-y+4|=40$.
To do this, we can use the fact that $|-x-y+4|$ is the same as $|-x-y+4-40|=|-x-y-36|$.
We can rewrite $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $(x^2+y^2)-4xy$.
Now, we want to minimize $(x^2+y^2)-4xy$ given that $|-x-y-36|=40$.
We can complete the square for $x$ and $y$ in the first expression:
$(x^2+y^2)-4xy = (x^2+2y+y^2)-4xy = (x+y)^2-(2\sqrt{2}y-4x)$.
We can see that $(x+y)^2$ is always nonnegative, so to minimize the expression, we want $-2\sqrt{2}y+4x$ to be as large as possible.
Since $|-x-y-36|=40$, we have $-x-y-36=-40$, which means $x+y=6$.
Substituting this into $-2\sqrt{2}y+4x$, we get $-2\sqrt{2}y+4(6-y)=-2\sqrt{2}y+24-4y=-2\sqrt{2}y-4y+24$.
Now, we want to minimize $-2\sqrt{2}y-4y+24$ given that $x+y=6$.
To do this, we can find the minimum value of $-2\sqrt{2}y-4y+24$ when $y$ ranges over all real numbers such that $x+y=6$.
We can rewrite $-2\sqrt{2}y-4y+24$ as $-2\sqrt{2}y-4y+24=-\sqrt{2}y-2y+12$.
We can complete the square for $y$ in this expression:
$-\sqrt{2}y-2y+12 = -\sqrt{2}y-2y+4+8 = -\sqrt{2}y-2y+4+8$.
We can see that $-\sqrt{2}y-2y+4+8$ is always nonnegative, so the minimum value is $\boxed{0}$.
The answer is: 0

### Instruction:
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"

### Response: Let's think step by step.


We are given the inequality $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
We can rewrite this as $|x-2y| = 40 - |y-2x|$.
Since the absolute value of a number is always greater than or equal to zero, we have two cases to consider:
Case 1: $x-2y = 40 - |y-2x|$.
In this case, $x-2y$ is nonnegative, so $x-2y = 40 - |y-2x|$ simplifies to $x-2y = 40 - (2x-y)$.
Solving for $y$, we get $y = 2x - 20$.
Case 2: $-(x-2y) = 40 - |y-2x|$.
In this case, $x-2y$ is negative, so $-(x-2y) = 40 - |y-2x|$ simplifies to $-x+2y = 40 - (2x-y)$.
Solving for $y$, we get $y = -x + 20$.
So, we have two possible values for $y$ in terms of $x$.
Now, let's substitute these values of $y$ into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$.
For $y = 2x - 20$, we have $5x^2 + 5(2x-20)^2 - 8x(2x-20)$.
Similarly, for $y = -x + 20$, we have $5x^2 + 5(-x+20)^2 - 8x(-x+20)$.
To find the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$, we need to find the minimum value of these two expressions.
We can see that both expressions are quartic polynomials in $x$.
We can graph these two quartic polynomials to see if they intersect.
If they intersect, then the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ occurs at the intersection point.
If they do not intersect, then the minimum value occurs when one of the polynomials is equal to zero, which happens when $x = 0$ or $x = 20$.
By graphing the polynomials, we can see that they intersect at $x = 10$.
So, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is equal to the value of the quartic polynomial at $x = 10$.
Evaluating the polynomial at $x = 10$, we get $5(10)^2 + 5(2(10)-20)^2 - 8(10)(2(10)-20) = 500 + 5(40)^2 - 8(10)(40) = 500 + 8000 - 3200 = 4400$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is $\boxed{4400}$.The answer is: 4400

### Instruction:
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"

### Response: Let's think step by step.


First, we want to find the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.
We can rewrite this expression as $(x^2-4xy+4y^2)$.
Now, let's focus on the second part of the problem.
We have the inequality $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
Since the absolute value of a number is always non-negative, we can split this inequality into two cases:
Case 1: $x-2y+y-2x=40$, which simplifies to $-x+3y=40$.
Case 2: $x-2y-y+2x=40$, which simplifies to $x+y=40$.
Now, let's solve each case separately.
For Case 1, we can rewrite the equation as $-x+3y=40$.
We can then rewrite this as $x=40-3y$ and substitute this expression into the expression $(x^2-4xy+4y^2)$.
We get $(40-3y)^2-4(40-3y)y+4y^2$.
Expanding and simplifying, we get $1600-240y+9y^2-160y+12y^2$.
Combining like terms, we get $360y^2-640y+1600$.
Now, let's find the minimum value of this expression.
We can rewrite it as $360(y^2-2y+4)-1600$.
Simplifying further, we get $360(y-1)^2-1600$.
Since $(y-1)^2$ is always non-negative, the minimum value of this expression occurs when $(y-1)^2=0$.
Therefore, the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ in Case 1 is $360(0)-1600=-1600$.
For Case 2, we have $x+y=40$.
We can rewrite this as $x=40-y$ and substitute this expression into the expression $(x^2-4xy+4y^2)$.
We get $(40-y)^2-4(40-y)y+4y^2$.
Expanding and simplifying, we get $1600-80y+y^2-160y+4y^2$.
Combining like terms, we get $5y^2-240y+1600$.
Now, let's find the minimum value of this expression.
We can rewrite it as $5(y^2-48y+320)-1600$.
Simplifying further, we get $5(y-24)^2-1600$.
Since $(y-24)^2$ is always non-negative, the minimum value of this expression occurs when $(y-24)^2=0$.
Therefore, the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ in Case 2 is $5(0)-1600=-1600$.
Finally, since both cases have the same minimum value of $-1600$, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\boxed{-1600}$.The answer is: -1600

### Instruction:
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"

### Response: Let's think step by step.



We are given the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ and we want to find its minimum value.

To find the minimum value, we need to find the values of $x$ and $y$ that minimize the expression.

We are also given the inequality $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.

Let's solve this inequality first.

If we substitute $x-2y$ for $a$ and $y-2x$ for $b$, the inequality becomes $|a| + |b| = 40$.

This is a well-known inequality in the study of distance, and it represents the distance between two points $(a,b)$ and $(-a,-b)$ in the coordinate plane.

We can visualize this inequality as a square with side length 40 centered at the origin.

Now, let's go back to the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$.

This expression is a quadratic function of $x$ and $y$.

To find the minimum value of a quadratic function, we need to find the vertex.

The vertex of a quadratic function in the form $ax^2 + bx + cy^2 + dy + e$ is given by the coordinates $\left(-\frac{b}{2a}, -\frac{d}{2c}\right)$.

In our case, the quadratic function is $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$, so the vertex is $\left(-\frac{0}{2(5)}, -\frac{0}{2(5)}\right) = (0,0)$.

Now, we have two conditions to satisfy:

1. The expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is minimized at the point $(x,y)$.
2. The point $(x,y)$ lies within the square defined by the inequality $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.

To find the minimum value, we need to find the values of $x$ and $y$ that satisfy both conditions.

Let's try different values of $x$ and $y$ within the square and check if they minimize the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$.

After some calculations, we find that the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is $\boxed{0}$.

Therefore, the minimum value of the expression is 0.The answer is: 0
