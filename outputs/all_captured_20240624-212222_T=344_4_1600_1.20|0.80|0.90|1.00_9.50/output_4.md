Below is an instruction that describes a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!). Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."

### Response: Let's think step by step.


First, we can use the second condition to simplify the expression $f(f(f(n)))$:
$f(f(f(n))) = f(f(2f(n)+1)) = f(4f(n)+2) = 8f(n)-6$
So the first condition becomes $8f(n)-6 = 8n-7$
Solving this equation, we find that $f(n) = 2n + 1$
Therefore, $f(100) = 2(100) + 1 = \boxed{201}$
The answer is: 201

Below is an instruction that describes a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!). Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."

### Response: Let's think step by step.


First, we can use the second condition to simplify $f(2n)$:
$f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$.
Next, we can use the second condition again to simplify $f(f(2n))$:
$f(f(2n)) = 2f(f(n)) + 1$.
Now, let's substitute $f(f(2n))$ into the first condition:
$f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$.
We can rewrite this equation as:
$2f(f(n)) + 1 = 8n - 7$.
Simplifying this equation, we get:
$2f(f(n)) = 8n - 8$.
Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
$f(f(n)) = 4n - 4$.
Now, let's substitute $f(f(n))$ into the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$:
$f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$.
We can rewrite this equation as:
$f(4n - 4) = 8n - 7$.
Using the second condition again, we get:
$2f(n) + 1 = 8n - 7$.
Simplifying this equation, we get:
$2f(n) = 8n - 8$.
Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
$f(n) = 4n - 4$.
Now, we can use this expression to find $f(100)$:
$f(100) = 4(100) - 4$.
$f(100) = 400 - 4$.
$f(100) = \boxed{396}$.
The answer is: 396

### Instruction:
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."

### Response: Let's think step by step.


We are given that $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$.
This means that $f(f(f(n)))$ is equal to $8n - 7$ for all positive integers $n$.
We are also given that $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$.
Using this information, we can find $f(100)$.
We start by finding $f(2 \cdot 50) = 2f(50) + 1$.
Then, we find $f(2 \cdot 25) = 2f(25) + 1$.
Continuing in this manner, we find $f(2 \cdot 12) = 2f(12) + 1$, $f(2 \cdot 6) = 2f(6) + 1$, $f(2 \cdot 3) = 2f(3) + 1$, and finally $f(2 \cdot 1) = 2f(1) + 1$.
We can see that $f(2 \cdot n) = 2f(n) + 1$ is equivalent to $f(n) = 2^k(n) + 1$, where $k$ is the number of times we applied the function.
Now, we can go back and find $f(100)$.
$f(100) = f(2 \cdot 50) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2(2f(25) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(2f(12) + 1) + 1) + 1 = \dots = 2^{9}(100) + 1 = \boxed{198}$.
The answer is: 198

### Instruction:
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."

### Response: Let's think step by step.


From the second condition, we have $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$.
Substituting $n$ with $2n$, we get $f(4n) = 2f(2n) + 1 = 2(2f(n) + 1) + 1 = 4f(n) + 3$.
Substituting $n$ with $4n$, we get $f(8n) = 2f(4n) + 1 = 2(4f(n) + 3) + 1 = 8f(n) + 7$.
Substituting $n$ with $8n$, we get $f(16n) = 2f(8n) + 1 = 2(8f(n) + 7) + 1 = 16f(n) + 15$.
And so on.
We can see that $f(2^k \cdot n) = 2^k \cdot f(n) + (2^k - 1)$ for any positive integer $k$.
In particular, $f(100) = 2^k \cdot f(n) + (2^k - 1)$.
Since $100 = 2^4 \cdot 5$, we have $f(100) = 2^4 \cdot f(5) + (2^4 - 1) = 16f(5) + 15$.
From the first condition, we know that $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$.
Substituting $n$ with $5$, we get $f(f(f(5))) = 8(5) - 7 = 31$.
Since $f(f(f(5))) = 31$, we can conclude that $f(5) = 31$.
Therefore, $f(100) = 16f(5) + 15 = 16(31) + 15 = \boxed{507}$.The answer is: 507
