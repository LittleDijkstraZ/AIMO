### Instruction:
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

### Response: Let's think step by step.


First, let's consider the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
We can rewrite this equation as $(x^2 + 2xy + y^2 - 20x - 20y + 100)(x^2 + y^2 - 16x - 16y + 64) = 0$.
Expanding, we get $(x^4 + y^4 + 2x^3y + 4x^2y^2 - 20x^3 - 40x^2y - 20xy^3 - 80xy^2 + 224x^2 + 224xy - 144y^2 + 112y - 3200) = 0$.
This equation represents a set of points that form a convex polygon.
To find the area of this polygon, we can calculate the area of each quadrilateral formed by two pairs of opposite sides.
We notice that each quadrilateral has two pairs of parallel sides and two pairs of congruent sides.
Therefore, each quadrilateral is a kite.
The area of a kite is given by the formula $\frac{1}{2} \times \text{product of diagonals}$.
In this case, the diagonals are the pairs of terms $x^2 + 2xy + y^2 - 20x - 20y + 100$ and $x^2 + y^2 - 16x - 16y + 64$.
Simplifying, we get $x^2 + y^2 + 2xy - 20x - 20y + 164$ and $x^2 + y^2 - 16x - 16y + 64$.
Expanding, we get $x^4 + y^4 + 2x^3y + 4x^2y^2 - 20x^3 - 40x^2y - 20xy^3 - 80xy^2 + 224x^2 + 224xy - 144y^2 + 112y - 3200$ and $x^4 + y^4 - 16x^3 - 16x^2y - 16xy^3 - 32x^2 - 32xy - 96y^2 + 64x + 64y - 384$.
We can factor out a common factor of $x^2 + y^2 - 16x - 16y + 64$ from both expressions, giving us $(x^2 + y^2 + 2xy - 20x - 20y + 164)(x^2 + y^2 - 16x - 16y + 64)$.
Therefore, the area of each quadrilateral is $\frac{1}{2} \times (x^2 + y^2 + 2xy - 20x - 20y + 164)(x^2 + y^2 - 16x - 16y + 64)$.
The total area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the four quadrilaterals.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $4 \times \frac{1}{2} \times (x^2 + y^2 + 2xy - 20x - 20y + 164)(x^2 + y^2 - 16x - 16y + 64) = \boxed{64}$.The answer is: 64

Below is an instruction that describes a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!). Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

### Response: Let's think step by step.


First, we notice that the equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ represents a circle with center $(10, 10)$ and radius $10$.
Next, we consider the equation $( \vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This equation represents a circle with center $(8, 8)$ and radius $8$.
Now, we need to find the intersection points of these two circles.
Since the circles have the same center, the intersection points lie on the line segment connecting the centers of the circles.
The distance between the centers of the circles is $10 - 8 = 2$, so the line segment connecting the centers has length $2$.
Therefore, the intersection points of the two circles lie on a line segment with length $2$.
Now, we have a convex polygon formed by the line segment and the circles.
The area of this polygon can be calculated using the formula for the area of a circle and the length of the line segment.
The area of the polygon is $\pi r^2 + 2 \cdot \text{base} \cdot \text{height}$.
The radius of the larger circle is $10$, and the base of the polygon is $2$.
The height of the polygon can be calculated as the distance between the centers of the circles, which is $2$.
Therefore, the area of the polygon is $\pi \cdot 10^2 + 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 10 = 100\pi + 40$.
So, the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{100\pi + 40}$.The answer is: 100\pi+40

Below is an instruction that describes a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!). Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

### Response: Let's think step by step.


We can rewrite the given equation as
\[((|x + y| - 10)^2 + (|x - y| - 10)^2)((|x| - 8)^2 + (|y| - 8)^2) = 0.\]
Since both squares are nonnegative, one of them must be equal to zero.

Case 1: $(|x + y| - 10)^2 + (|x - y| - 10)^2 = 0$
This means that either $x + y = 10$ or $x - y = 10$.
If $x + y = 10$, then $x = 10 - y$ and substituting into the other equation gives $(y - 8)^2 + (|y - 10 + 8| - 8)^2 = 0$.
This simplifies to $(y - 8)^2 + (|y - 2| - 8)^2 = 0$.
Since squares are nonnegative, both terms must be zero.
This gives $y - 8 = 0$ and $|y - 2| - 8 = 0$, which has no solutions.

If $x - y = 10$, then $x = y + 10$ and substituting into the other equation gives $(y + 10 - 8)^2 + (|y + 10 - 2| - 8)^2 = 0$.
This simplifies to $(y + 2)^2 + (|y + 8| - 8)^2 = 0$.
Again, since squares are nonnegative, both terms must be zero.
This gives $y + 2 = 0$ and $|y + 8| - 8 = 0$, which has no solutions.

Therefore, there are no solutions in this case.

Case 2: $(|x| - 8)^2 + (|y| - 8)^2 = 0$
This means that $x = 8$ and $y = 8$.

Therefore, the only solution is $(x, y) = (8, 8)$.
This point lies on the line $y = x - 10$ and $y = -x + 10$, so it lies on the lines $y = x - 10$ and $y = -x + 10$.

Since $(8, 8)$ lies on the line $y = x - 10$, the line $y = x - 10$ is a side of the convex polygon.
Since $(8, 8)$ lies on the line $y = -x + 10$, the line $y = -x + 10$ is a side of the convex polygon.

Therefore, the convex polygon is a triangle with vertices $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The base of the triangle is $8 - (-8) = 16$ and the height is $8 - (-8) = 16$.

Therefore, the area of the triangle is $(16)(8)/2 = \boxed{64}$ square units.

The answer is: 64

## QUESTION 3 - 3

Below is an instruction that describes a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!). Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

### Response: Let's think step by step.


First, we need to find the points $\left(x, y\right)$ that satisfy the given equation.
We can start by considering the square in the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
If the square inside the parentheses is equal to 0, then both terms inside the parentheses must be equal to 0.
For the first square, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we can set each term inside the parentheses equal to 0:
$\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$.
Simplifying these equations, we have $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$.
Solving for $x$ and $y$, we get $x = 5$ and $y = 5$.
Now, let's consider the second square, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
Since the absolute value of any number is always nonnegative, the only way for this square to be equal to 0 is if both terms inside the parentheses are equal to 0.
Setting each term inside the parentheses equal to 0, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
This means that $x = 8$ or $x = -8$, and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.
So, the points $\left(x, y\right)$ that satisfy the equation are $(5, 5)$, $(-5, 5)$, $(5, -5)$, $(-5, -5)$, $(8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.
Now, let's plot these points on a coordinate plane and find the vertices of the convex polygon.
We can see that the vertices of the polygon are $(5, 5)$, $(-5, 5)$, $(5, -5)$, and $(-5, -5)$.
To find the area of the convex polygon, we can use the Shoelace Formula or any other method.
The Shoelace Formula states that if the vertices of a polygon are $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$, $(x_3, y_3)$, ..., $(x_n, y_n)$, then the area of the polygon is given by:
Area = $\frac{1}{2} \left|(x_1y_2 + x_2y_3 + ... + x_ny_1) - (x_2y_1 + x_3y_2 + ... + x_1y_n)\right|$.
Using this formula, we can calculate the area of the polygon.
The area is $\frac{1}{2} \left|(5 \cdot 5 + -5 \cdot 5 + 5 \cdot -5 + -5 \cdot -5) - (5 \cdot -5 + -5 \cdot 5 + 5 \cdot 5 + -5 \cdot -5)\right| = \frac{1}{2} \left|0 - 0\right| = \boxed{0}$.
The answer is: 0
