**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many solutions does the equation \[\frac{(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)\dotsm(x-100)}{(x-1^2)(x-2^2)(x-3^2)\dotsm(x-100^2)} = 0\]have for $x$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Any solution to this equation must make the numerator of the left-hand side zero, while keeping the denominator non-zero. The numerator is zero when $x$ is one of the numbers $1, 2, 3, \dots, 100.$ However, for any value in this list that is a perfect square, the denominator will also be zero, so that value of $x$ will not be a root. Therefore, we want to find the number of integers in the list $1, 2, \dots, 100$ which are not perfect squares. The perfect squares in the list are $1^2, 2^2, \dots, 10^2,$ so there are $10$ perfect squares, and \[100 - 10 = \boxed{90}\]integers which are not perfect squares. The answer is $\boxed{90}$

The value of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 1. However, this doesn't match with any of the options provided. It seems there might be a mistake in the code or the problem statement. Let's re-examine the problem statement.

The equation is \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] and we want to find the number of positive integer values of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions. The equation is a piecewise function with four cases based on the value of $x$. For each case, we can find the solutions and check if there are 4 distinct solutions. If there are, we add the corresponding value of $m$ to the list.

After re-examining the problem statement and the code, we realize that we are not checking if the solutions are distinct for each value of $m$. We are only checking if the solutions for the last value of $m$ (which is 100) are 4 distinct. This is not sufficient. We need to check if the solutions for each value of $m$ are 4 distinct. Let's modify the code accordingly.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many distinct solutions are there to the equation $|x-7| = |x+1|$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
If $|x-7| = |x+1|$, then either $x-7 = x+1$ or $x-7 = -(x+1)$.  Simplifying $x-7=x+1$ gives $0=8$, which has no solutions, so no values of $x$ satisfy $x-7 = x+1$.  If $x-7 = -(x+1)$, then $x-7 = -x-1$, so $2x = 6$, which gives $x=3$.  So, there is $\boxed{1}$ solution.

Challenge: See if you can find a quick solution to this problem by simply thinking about the graphs of $y=|x-7|$ and $y=|x+1|$. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $2$. This is because the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a graph that is a series of "V"s, with the $x$-intercepts of the "teeth" of the "V"s being the solutions to the equation. The number of "teeth" is equal to the number of distinct solutions. If $\frac{m}{100}$ is less than $1$, then there are no solutions. If $\frac{m}{100}$ is greater than $2$, then there are more than $4$ solutions. If $\frac{m}{100}$ is between $1$ and $2$, then there are exactly $4$ solutions. Therefore, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Multiplying all parts of the inequality by $100$ gives $100 < m < 200$. The number of positive integers in this range is $100$. Therefore, the value of $m$ is $100$. The answer is: $100$

The above code is not working as expected because it is trying to solve the equation for each value of $m$ from 1 to 100 and checking if it has 4 distinct solutions. However, this approach is too computationally intensive and will cause the code to run for a long time.

A better approach is to analyze the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] and determine for which values of $m$ it will have 4 distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have 4 distinct solutions when the right side $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to 2. This is because the graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a shape of a "V" with the vertex at $(1, 2)$, and the number of distinct solutions will be 4 when the right side of the equation is equal to 2.

Therefore, we can simply set $\frac{m}{100}$ equal to 2 and solve for $m$:

$$2 = \frac{m}{100} \implies m = 200.$$

So, the value of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 200. The answer is: $200$

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.
2. We know that $\frac{m}{100}$ must be a positive number, so $m$ must be a positive integer.
3. We also know that the absolute value function $\vert \cdot \vert$ makes the expression inside it non-negative. So, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

Now, let's use Python to solve this problem:

## QUESTION 2 - 6 
- TIME_SPENT : 445 secs

6_
**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many distinct solutions are there to the equation $|x-7| = |x+1|$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
If $|x-7| = |x+1|$, then either $x-7 = x+1$ or $x-7 = -(x+1)$.  Simplifying $x-7=x+1$ gives $0=8$, which has no solutions, so no values of $x$ satisfy $x-7 = x+1$.  If $x-7 = -(x+1)$, then $x-7 = -x-1$, so $2x = 6$, which gives $x=3$.  So, there is $\boxed{1}$ solution.

Challenge: See if you can find a quick solution to this problem by simply thinking about the graphs of $y=|x-7|$ and $y=|x+1|$. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Eq, Abs, solveset, S

def find_m():
    x, m = symbols('x m')
    equation = Eq(Abs(Abs(x - 1) - 2), m / 100)
    solutions = []

    # Loop through possible values of m
    for i in range(1, 101):
        equation_i = equation.subs(m, i)
        solution_set = solveset(equation_i, x, domain=S.Reals)
        # Check if the number of solutions is 4
        if len(solution_set) == 4:
            solutions.append(i)

    return solutions

result = find_m()
print(result)
```

The list of all possible values of $m$ is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100].
However, the problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions. From the list above, we can see that the only values of $m$ that satisfy this condition are $1$ through $100$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is $100$. The answer is: $100$
