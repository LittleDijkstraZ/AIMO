Below is a math problem you are to solve (hint: answer is a natural number):

Problem Statement: "The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Instructions:
- Define all functions and variables clearly.
- Enumerate all conditions and explain their significance to the problem.
- Describe the solution process in a structured manner: introduction, body (steps), and conclusion.
- For each step, provide a detailed explanation and mathematical proof or derivation as needed.
- Discuss potential errors or common pitfalls in solving this type of problem and how they are addressed in your solution.
- Clearly state the solution, followed by a brief discussion on the implications or potential applications of the result.



Solution:

The problem statement gives a condition that the product of two quantities must be zero. This means that each of the quantities must be zero individually. Therefore, we have two sets of conditions:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From condition 1, we have:
- $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
- $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.

From condition 2, we have:
- $\vert x \vert = 8$, which implies $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
- $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

Combining these conditions, we get the following vertices of the polygon:
$(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8), (10, 0), (-10, 0), (0, 10), (0, -10)$.

These vertices form a square with side length 16. The area of a square is the side length squared, so the area of the polygon is $16^2 = 256$.

The answer is: $256$ square units.
