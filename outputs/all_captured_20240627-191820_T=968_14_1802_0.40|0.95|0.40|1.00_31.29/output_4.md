**Problem:** 
"Let $
f(n) =
\begin{cases}
n^2+1 & \text{if }n\text{ is odd} \\
\dfrac{n}{2} & \text{if }n\text{ is even}
\end{cases}.
$

For how many integers $n$ from 1 to 100, inclusive, does $f ( f (\dotsb f (n) \dotsb )) = 1$ for some number of applications of $f$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we note that if $n$ is a positive integer, then $f(n)$ is also a positive integer.  We claim that $f ( f (\dotsb f (n) \dotsb )) = 1$ for some number of applications of $f$ only for $n = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32,$ and $64.$  (In other words, $n$ must be a power of 2.)

Note that $f(1) = 2,$ so $f(f(1)) = f(2) = 1.$  If $n > 1$ is a power of 2, it is easy to see that repeated applications of $f$ on $n$ eventually reach 1.

Suppose $n$ is an odd positive integer, where $n > 1.$  Write $n = 2k + 1,$ where $k$ is a positive integer.  Since $n$ is odd,
\[f(n) = n^2 + 1 = (2k + 1)^2 + 1 = 4k^2 + 4k + 2 = 2(2k^2 + 2k + 1).\]Since $2k^2 + 2k$ is always even, $2k^2 + 2k + 1$ is always odd (and greater than 1), so $f(n)$ can never be a power of 2 when $n$ is odd and greater than 1.

Now, suppose $n$ is even.  For example, if $n = 2^3 \cdot 11,$ then
\[f(2^3 \cdot 11) = f(2^2 \cdot 11) = f(2 \cdot 11) = f(11),\]which we know is not a power of 2.

More generally, suppose $n = 2^e \cdot m,$ where $e$ is nonnegative and $m$ is odd.  Then
\[f(2^e \cdot m) = f(2^{e - 1} \cdot m) = f(2^{e - 2} \cdot m) = \dots = f(m).\]If $m = 1,$ then $n$ is a power of 2, and the sequence eventually reaches 1.  Otherwise, $f(m)$ is not a power of 2.  We also know that $f(m)$ is odd and greater than 1, $f(f(m))$ is not a power of 2 either, and so on.  Thus, the sequence can never reach 1.

Therefore, $n$ must be one of the $\boxed{7}$ values 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, or 64. The answer is $\boxed{7}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):

**Problem**
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


To solve this problem, we can start by substituting $n = 1$ into the second equation to get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. Then we can substitute $n = 2$ into the second equation to get $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$. Continuing this process, we can find the values of $f(1)$, $f(2)$, $f(4)$, $f(8)$, and so on.

Once we have the values of $f(1)$, $f(2)$, $f(4)$, $f(8)$, and so on, we can substitute these values into the first equation to find the value of $f(f(f(n)))$ for some values of $n$. By comparing the results with the given equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we can find a pattern and determine the value of $f(n)$ for any positive integer $n$.

Finally, we can substitute $n = 100$ into the function $f(n)$ to find the value of $f(100)$.

Here is the python code to solve the problem:

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"The function $f(n)$ is defined on the positive integers such that $f(f(n)) = 2n$ and $f(4n + 1) = 4n + 3$ for all positive integers $n.$  Find $f(1000).$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Consider the expression $f(f(f(a))).$  Since $f(f(a)) = 2a,$ this is equal to $f(2a).$  But taking $n = f(a)$ in $f(f(n)) = 2n,$ we get
\[f(f(f(a))) = 2f(a).\]Hence,
\[f(2a) = 2f(a)\]for all positive integers $a.$

Then
\[f(1000) = 2f(500) = 4f(250) = 8f(125).\]Taking $n = 31$ in $f(4n + 1) = 4n + 3,$ we get
\[f(125) = 127,\]so $f(1000) = \boxed{1016}.$ The answer is $\boxed{1016}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):

**Problem**
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


To solve this problem, we need to find the value of $f(100)$ given the function $f$ defined by the two conditions.

First, let's try to find a pattern in the function $f$ using the second condition $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$.

For $n = 1$, we have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.
For $n = 2$, we have $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$.
For $n = 3$, we have $f(6) = 2f(3) + 1$.
And so on.

By substituting the expression for $f(2)$ into the equation for $f(4)$, we get $f(4) = 2(2f(1) + 1) + 1 = 4f(1) + 3$.

Similarly, by substituting the expression for $f(4)$ into the equation for $f(6)$, we get $f(6) = 2(4f(1) + 3) + 1 = 8f(1) + 7$.

We can see a pattern here: $f(2n) = 2^kf(n) + (2^k - 1)$ for all positive integers $n$ and $k$.

Now let's use the first condition $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$.

If we set $n = 1$, we get $f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = 1$.
Since $f(1)$ is a positive integer, we can substitute the expression for $f(2)$ into the equation to get $f(f(2)) = 1$.

By substituting the expression for $f(2)$ into this equation, we get $f(4f(1) + 3) = 1$.

Now, if we set $n = 4f(1) + 3$ in the second condition, we get $f(2(4f(1) + 3)) = 2f(4f(1) + 3) + 1$.

By substituting the expression for $f(4f(1) + 3)$ into this equation, we get $f(8f(1) + 6) = 2*1 + 1 = 3$.

Finally, if we set $n = 8f(1) + 6$ in the first condition, we get $f(f(f(8f(1) + 6))) = 8(8f(1) + 6) - 7 = 64f(1) + 47$.

By substituting the expression for $f(8f(1) + 6)$ into this equation, we get $3 = 64f(1) + 47$.

Solving this equation for $f(1)$, we get $f(1) = -1$.

However, this is not possible as $f(1)$ must be a positive integer.

Let's try another approach.

From the first condition, we have $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$.

If we set $n = f(n)$, we get $f(f(f(f(n)))) = 8f(n) - 7$.

By substituting the expression for $f(f(f(n)))$ into this equation, we get $f(8f(n) - 7) = 8f(n) - 7$.

This means that $f(8f(n) - 7) = 8f(n) - 7$ for all positive integers $n$.

In particular, for $n = 1$, we have $f(1) = 1$.

For $n = 2$, we have $f(5) = 5$.

For $n = 3$, we have $f(7) = 7$.

And so on.

We can see a pattern here: $f(2^k - 1) = 2^k - 1$ for all positive integers $k$.

Now let's calculate $f(100)$.

Since $100 = 2^6 + 3*2^4 + 2^2$, we can write $100 = 2^6 - 1 + 3*(2^4 - 1) + 2^2 - 1$.

By substituting the expressions for $f(2^k - 1)$, we get $f(100) = 2^6 - 1 + 3*(2^4 - 1) + 2^2 - 1 = 63 + 3*15 + 3 = 63 + 45 + 3 = 111$.

However, this is not possible as $f(100)$ must be a positive integer.

Let's try another approach.

From the second condition, we have $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$.

If we set $n = 2^k$, we get $f(2^{k+1}) = 2f(2^k) + 1$.

By substituting the expression for $f(2^k)$ into this equation, we get $f(2^{k+1}) = 2(2^k - 1) + 1 = 2^{k+1} - 1$.

This means that $f(2^k) = 2^k - 1$ for all positive integers $k$.

Now let's calculate $f(100)$.

Since $100 = 2^6 + 3*2^4 + 2^2$, we can write $100 = 2^6 - 1 + 3*(2^4 - 1) + 2^2 - 1$.

By substituting the expressions for $f(2^k)$, we get $f(100) = 2^6 - 1 + 3*(2^4 - 1) + 2^2 - 1 = 63 + 3*15 + 3 = 63 + 45 + 3 = 111$.

However, this is not possible as $f(100)$ must be a positive integer.

Let's try another approach.

From the first condition, we have $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$.

If we set $n = 2^k$, we get $f(f(f(2^k))) = 8*2^k - 7$.

By substituting the expression for $f(f(f(2^k)))$ into this equation, we get $f(8*2^k - 7) = 8*2^k - 7$.

This means that $f(8*2^k - 7) = 8*2^k - 7$ for all positive integers $k$.

In particular, for $k = 3$, we have $f(47) = 47$.

For $k = 4$, we have $f(71) = 71$.

And so on.

We can see a pattern here: $f(8*2^k - 7) = 8*2^k - 7$ for all positive integers $k$.

Now let's calculate $f(100)$.

Since $100 = 2^6 + 3*2^4 + 2^2$, we can write $100 = 8*2^6 - 7 + 3*(8*2^4 - 7) + 8*2^2 - 7$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $
f(n) =
\begin{cases}
n^2+1 & \text{if }n\text{ is odd} \\
\dfrac{n}{2} & \text{if }n\text{ is even}
\end{cases}.
$

For how many integers $n$ from 1 to 100, inclusive, does $f ( f (\dotsb f (n) \dotsb )) = 1$ for some number of applications of $f$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we note that if $n$ is a positive integer, then $f(n)$ is also a positive integer.  We claim that $f ( f (\dotsb f (n) \dotsb )) = 1$ for some number of applications of $f$ only for $n = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32,$ and $64.$  (In other words, $n$ must be a power of 2.)

Note that $f(1) = 2,$ so $f(f(1)) = f(2) = 1.$  If $n > 1$ is a power of 2, it is easy to see that repeated applications of $f$ on $n$ eventually reach 1.

Suppose $n$ is an odd positive integer, where $n > 1.$  Write $n = 2k + 1,$ where $k$ is a positive integer.  Since $n$ is odd,
\[f(n) = n^2 + 1 = (2k + 1)^2 + 1 = 4k^2 + 4k + 2 = 2(2k^2 + 2k + 1).\]Since $2k^2 + 2k$ is always even, $2k^2 + 2k + 1$ is always odd (and greater than 1), so $f(n)$ can never be a power of 2 when $n$ is odd and greater than 1.

Now, suppose $n$ is even.  For example, if $n = 2^3 \cdot 11,$ then
\[f(2^3 \cdot 11) = f(2^2 \cdot 11) = f(2 \cdot 11) = f(11),\]which we know is not a power of 2.

More generally, suppose $n = 2^e \cdot m,$ where $e$ is nonnegative and $m$ is odd.  Then
\[f(2^e \cdot m) = f(2^{e - 1} \cdot m) = f(2^{e - 2} \cdot m) = \dots = f(m).\]If $m = 1,$ then $n$ is a power of 2, and the sequence eventually reaches 1.  Otherwise, $f(m)$ is not a power of 2.  We also know that $f(m)$ is odd and greater than 1, $f(f(m))$ is not a power of 2 either, and so on.  Thus, the sequence can never reach 1.

Therefore, $n$ must be one of the $\boxed{7}$ values 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, or 64. The answer is $\boxed{7}$

**Solution:**



To find $f(100)$, we can use the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We can apply this condition repeatedly to get $f(100)$ in terms of $f(50)$, $f(25)$, and $f(12.5)$. However, we know that $f(n)$ only takes integer values, so $f(12.5)$ is undefined.

But we can use the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to express $f(12.5)$ in terms of $f(6.25)$, $f(3.125)$, and so on. Continuing this process, we find that $f(n)$ is a recursive function that doubles the argument and subtracts 1 until the argument is 1. Then, $f(1)=0$.

Now we can use the second condition to find $f(2)$, $f(4)$, $f(8)$, and so on, until we reach $f(100)$.

```python

To solve this problem, we need to find the value of $f(100)$ given the two conditions. We can start by finding the value of $f(1)$ using the second condition.

From the second condition, we have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. But we also know that $f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = 1$. Since $f(f(f(1))) = f(2)$, we have $f(2) = 1$. Substituting this into the equation $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$, we get $1 = 2f(1) + 1$, which simplifies to $f(1) = 0$.

Now we can find $f(100)$ by repeatedly applying the second condition. We have:

**Solution:**



First, we can see that the function $f$ is a bit tricky to deal with directly. However, we can observe that the function $f$ is a bijection (one-to-one and onto) from the natural numbers to the natural numbers. This is because the function $f$ is defined as a mapping from the natural numbers to the natural numbers, and it is given that it is both one-to-one (injective) and covers all natural numbers (surjective).

Now, let's try to find a pattern in the function $f$. From the first condition, $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we can see that applying the function $f$ three times gives us $8n-7$. This suggests that applying the function $f$ twice might give us $4n-3$ or $4n-1$.

From the second condition, $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can see that if we double the input, the output is also doubled and then increased by 1. This suggests that the function $f$ might be an odd function, meaning that $f(n)$ is different from $f(-n)$.

Now, let's try to find a function that satisfies both conditions. One possible function is $f(n) = 4n - 3$. Let's check if it satisfies both conditions.

For the first condition, $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$:
\[f(f(f(n))) = f(f(4n - 3)) = f(4(4n - 3) - 3) = f(16n - 15) = 8n - 7.\]
So, $f(n) = 4n - 3$ satisfies the first condition.

For the second condition, $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$:
\[f(2n) = 4(2n) - 3 = 8n - 3,\]
\[2f(n) + 1 = 2(4n - 3) + 1 = 8n - 5.\]
However, $8n - 3 \neq 8n - 5$, so $f(n) = 4n - 3$ does not satisfy the second condition.

Let's try another function. One possible function is $f(n) = 4n - 1$. Let's check if it satisfies both conditions.

For the first condition, $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$:
\[f(f(f(n))) = f(f(4n - 1)) = f(4(4n - 1) - 1) = f(16n - 5) = 8n - 7.\]
So, $f(n) = 4n - 1$ satisfies the first condition.

For the second condition, $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$:
\[f(2n) = 4(2n) - 1 = 8n - 1,\]
\[2f(n) + 1 = 2(4n - 1) + 1 = 8n - 1.\]
Now, $8n - 1 = 8n - 1$, so $f(n) = 4n - 1$ satisfies the second condition.

Therefore, the function $f(n) = 4n - 1$ satisfies both conditions. Now we can calculate $f(100)$:
\[f(100) = 4(100) - 1 = 400 - 1 = 399.\]

So, the value of $f(100)$ is 399. The answer is $\boxed{399}$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"The function $f(n)$ is defined on the positive integers such that $f(f(n)) = 2n$ and $f(4n + 1) = 4n + 3$ for all positive integers $n.$  Find $f(1000).$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Consider the expression $f(f(f(a))).$  Since $f(f(a)) = 2a,$ this is equal to $f(2a).$  But taking $n = f(a)$ in $f(f(n)) = 2n,$ we get
\[f(f(f(a))) = 2f(a).\]Hence,
\[f(2a) = 2f(a)\]for all positive integers $a.$

Then
\[f(1000) = 2f(500) = 4f(250) = 8f(125).\]Taking $n = 31$ in $f(4n + 1) = 4n + 3,$ we get
\[f(125) = 127,\]so $f(1000) = \boxed{1016}.$ The answer is $\boxed{1016}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):

**Problem**
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**



First, let's denote $f(1)$ as $a$, $f(2)$ as $b$, and $f(3)$ as $c$. We can then express $f(f(f(n)))$ and $f(2n)$ in terms of $a$, $b$, and $c$.

From the given conditions, we have:
1. $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. So $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$, $f(f(f(2)))=8*2-7=9$, and $f(f(f(3)))=8*3-7=19$. This gives us the system of equations:
   \[
   \begin{cases}
   f(f(a)) = 1 \\
   f(f(b)) = 9 \\
   f(f(c)) = 19
   \end{cases}
   \]
2. $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. So $f(2*1)=2f(1)+1=2a+1$, $f(2*2)=2f(2)+1=2b+1$, and $f(2*3)=2f(3)+1=2c+1$. This gives us the system of equations:
   \[
   \begin{cases}
   f(2) = 2a+1 \\
   f(4) = 2b+1 \\
   f(6) = 2c+1
   \end{cases}
   \]

Now, let's solve the systems of equations. From the first system, we have $f(a)=1$, $f(b)=9$, and $f(c)=19$. From the second system, we have $f(2)=2a+1$, $f(4)=2b+1$, and $f(6)=2c+1$.

We can use the second equation to express $a$, $b$, and $c$ in terms of $f(1)$, $f(2)$, and $f(3)$:
1. $a = \frac{f(2) - 1}{2}$
2. $b = \frac{f(4) - 1}{2}$
3. $c = \frac{f(6) - 1}{2}$

Substituting the values of $f(2)$, $f(4)$, and $f(6)$ from the first system into these equations, we get:
1. $a = \frac{2a+1 - 1}{2} \Rightarrow a = 1$
2. $b = \frac{2b+1 - 1}{2} \Rightarrow b = 9$
3. $c = \frac{2c+1 - 1}{2} \Rightarrow c = 19$

So, $f(1)=1$, $f(2)=9$, and $f(3)=19$.

Now, we can find $f(100)$. Since $100$ is even, we can use the second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We have $f(100)=2f(50)+1$. Again, since $50$ is even, we can use the second equation again to get $f(50)=2f(25)+1$. Continuing this process, we find:
\[
\begin{cases}
f(100) = 2f(50)+1 \\
f(50) = 2f(25)+1 \\
f(25) = 2f(12.5)+1 \\
\end{cases}
\]

However, we cannot continue this process because $12.5$ is not an integer. Instead, we can use the first equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to find $f(100)$. We know that $f(f(f(100)))=8*100-7=793$. Since $f(f(f(100)))=f(f(50))$, we have $f(f(50))=793$. Again, since $f(f(50))=f(25)$, we have $f(25)=793$. Finally, since $f(25)=2f(12.5)+1$, we have $793=2f(12.5)+1$. Solving for $f(12.5)$, we get $f(12.5)=\frac{793-1}{2}=396$.

Now, we can use the second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to find $f(50)$. We have $f(50)=2f(25)+1=2*396+1=793$. Similarly, we can find $f(100)=2f(50)+1=2*793+1=1587$.

Finally, we can check our result by using the first equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. We have $f(f(f(100)))=8*100-7=793$. Since $f(f(100))=f(50)$, we have $f(f(50))=793$. Again, since $f(50)=f(25)$, we have $f(25)=793$. Finally, since $f(25)=2f(12.5)+1$, we have $793=2f(12.5)+1$. Solving for $f(12.5)$, we get $f(12.5)=\frac{793-1}{2}=396$.

Now, we can use the second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to find $f(50)$. We have $f(50)=2f(25)+1=2*396+1=793$. Similarly, we can find $f(100)=2f(50)+1=2*793+1=1587$.

So, $f(100)=1587$. The answer is: $1587$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"The function $f$ is defined on the set of integers and satisfies \[f(n)= \begin{cases}  n-3 & \mbox{if }n\ge 1000 \\  f(f(n+5)) & \mbox{if }n<1000. \end{cases}\]Find $f(84)$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Denote by (1) and (2) the two parts of the definition of $f$, respectively. If we begin to use the definition of $f$ to compute $f(84)$, we use (2) until the argument is at least $1000$: \[f(84) = f(f(89)) = f(f(f(94))) = \dots = f^N(1004)\](where $f^N$ denotes composing $f$ with itself $N$ times, for some $N$). The numbers $84, 89, 94, \dots, 1004$ form an arithmetic sequence with common difference $5$; since $1004 - 84 = 920 = 184 \cdot 5$, this sequence has $184 + 1 = 185$ terms, so $N = 185$.

At this point, (1) and (2) are both used: we compute \[\begin{aligned} f^N(1004) &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-1}(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-1}(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(1000) \\ &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(997) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1002) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(999) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1004). \end{aligned}\]Repeating this process, we see that \[f^N(1004) = f^{N-2}(1004) = f^{N-4}(1004) = \dots = f^3(1004).\](The pattern breaks down for $f^k(1004)$ when $k$ is small, so it is not true that $f^3(1004) = f(1004)$.) Now, we have \[f^3(1004) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^2(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^2(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(1000) \stackrel{(1)}{=} \boxed{997}.\] The answer is $\boxed{997}$

**Solution:**



To find $f(100)$, we need to use the given equations. Let's start by calculating $f(f(100))$ using the second equation.

We know that $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. So, we can substitute $n = 50$ to get $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.

Now, let's find $f(50)$ using the same equation. Substituting $n = 25$, we get $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.

Continuing this process, we can keep substituting $n$ with half of its value until we reach a value that can be directly calculated using the first equation.

Let's calculate this step by step:

1. $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$
2. $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$
3. $f(25) = 2f(12.5)$ (since $12.5$ is not an integer, we stop here)

Now, let's substitute $n = 12.5$ into the first equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$:

4. $f(f(f(12.5))) = 8(12.5) - 7 = 100 - 7 = 93$

Now, we know that $f(f(12.5)) = 93$. Since $12.5$ is not an integer, we can't continue further with the second equation.

However, we can use the first equation to find $f(12.5)$ by setting $n = f(12.5)$ and solving for $f(12.5)$:

5. $f(f(f(12.5))) = 8f(12.5) - 7 = 93$
6. $f(f(12.5)) = 8f(12.5) - 7$
7. $93 = 8f(12.5) - 7$
8. $93 + 7 = 8f(12.5)$
9. $100 = 8f(12.5)$
10. $f(12.5) = \frac{100}{8} = 12.5$

This result is not possible because $f(12.5)$ should be an integer. We must have made a mistake in our calculations. Let's go back and check our work.

Upon reexamination, we realize that we made a mistake in step 5. The equation should be $f(f(f(12.5))) = 8(12.5) - 7 = 100 - 7 = 93$, not $f(f(f(12.5))) = 8f(12.5) - 7 = 93$. Let's correct this and continue:

5. $f(f(f(12.5))) = 8(12.5) - 7 = 100 - 7 = 93$

Now, we know that $f(f(f(12.5))) = 93$. Since $f(f(f(12.5))) = f(93)$, we can substitute $n = 93$ into the first equation to find $f(93)$:

6. $f(f(93)) = 8(93) - 7 = 744 - 7 = 737$

Now, we know that $f(f(93)) = 737$. Since $f(f(93)) = f(737)$, we can substitute $n = 737$ into the first equation to find $f(737)$:

7. $f(f(737)) = 8(737) - 7 = 5896 - 7 = 5889$

Now, we know that $f(f(737)) = 5889$. Since $f(f(737)) = f(5889)$, we can substitute $n = 5889$ into the first equation to find $f(5889)$:

8. $f(f(5889)) = 8(5889) - 7 = 47112 - 7 = 47105$

Now, we know that $f(f(5889)) = 47105$. Since $f(f(5889)) = f(47105)$, we can substitute $n = 47105$ into the first equation to find $f(47105)$:

9. $f(f(47105)) = 8(47105) - 7 = 376840 - 7 = 376833$

Now, we know that $f(f(47105)) = 376833$. Since $f(f(47105)) = f(376833)$, we can substitute $n = 376833$ into the first equation to find $f(376833)$:

10. $f(f(376833)) = 8(376833) - 7 = 3014664 - 7 = 3014657$

Now, we know that $f(f(376833)) = 3014657$. Since $f(f(376833)) = f(3014657)$, we can substitute $n = 3014657$ into the first equation to find $f(3014657)$:

11. $f(f(3014657)) = 8(3014657) - 7 = 24117256 - 7 = 24117249$

Now, we know that $f(f(3014657)) = 24117249$. Since $f(f(3014657)) = f(24117249)$, we can substitute $n = 24117249$ into the first equation to find $f(24117249)$:

12. $f(f(24117249)) = 8(24117249) - 7 = 192937992 - 7 = 192937985$

Now, we know that $f(f(24117249)) = 192937985$. Since $f(f(24117249)) = f(192937985)$, we can substitute $n = 192937985$ into the first equation to find $f(192937985)$:

13. $f(f(192937985)) = 8(192937985) - 7 = 1543503880 - 7 = 1543503873$

Now, we know that $f(f(19293798

"We define a function $f(x)$ such that $f(14)=7$, and if there exists an integer $a$ such that $f(a)=b$, then $f(b)$ is defined and

$f(b)=\frac{b}{2}$ if $b$ is even.

Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Since $f(14)=7$, we know that $f(7)$ is defined, and it must equal $22$.  Similarly, we know that $f(22)$ is defined, and it must equal $11$.  Continuing on this way,  \begin{align*}

Thus there are no more values which need to be defined, as there is no $a$ currently defined for which $f(a)$ is a $b$ not already defined.  Thus the minimum number of integers we can define is the number we have already defined, which is $\boxed{18}$. The answer is $\boxed{18}$

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."

**Solution:**



We will use the second condition to find $f(100)$: $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. Let $n = 50$, we have $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.

Now we need to find $f(50)$. We can use the second condition again: $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. Let $n = 25$, we have $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.

Next, we need to find $f(25)$. We can use the first condition: $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. Let $n = 25$, we have $f(f(f(25))) = 8*25 - 7 = 193$.

We know that $f(f(f(25))) = 193$, so we need to find $f(f(25))$ and $f(25)$ to solve this equation.

We can use the second condition to find $f(25)$: $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. Let $n = 12.5$, but $n$ must be an integer, so this equation doesn't help us directly.

However, we can use the first condition again: $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. Let $n = 12.5$, we have $f(f(f(12.5))) = 8*12.5 - 7 = 93$. But $f(f(f(12.5)))$ is the same as $f(f(25))$, and we know that $f(f(f(25))) = 193$. So we have $f(f(25)) = 193$.

Now we can solve the equation $f(f(25)) = 193$ for $f(25)$. Let $x = f(25)$, we have $f(x) = 193$. We can use the second condition to find $f(x)$: $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. Let $n = x/2$, we have $f(x) = 2f(x/2) + 1$. So we have $193 = 2f(x/2) + 1$.

We can solve this equation for $f(x/2)$: $f(x/2) = (193 - 1) / 2 = 96$.

Now we can use the second condition again to find $f(x/2)$: $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. Let $n = x/4$, we have $f(x/2) = 2f(x/4) + 1$. So we have $96 = 2f(x/4) + 1$.

We can solve this equation for $f(x/4)$: $f(x/4) = (96 - 1) / 2 = 47.5$, but this is not possible because $f(x/4)$ must be an integer.

We made a mistake in our previous steps. Let's go back and check our work.

We know that $f(f(f(25))) = 193$, and we used the second condition to find $f(f(25)) = 2f(25) + 1$. Let $x = f(25)$, we have $f(x) = 2x + 1$. So we have $193 = 2x + 1$.

We can solve this equation for $x$: $x = (193 - 1) / 2 = 96$. So $f(25) = 96$.

Now we can use the second condition to find $f(50)$: $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. Let $n = 25$, we have $f(50) = 2*96 + 1 = 193$.

Finally, we can use the second condition to find $f(100)$: $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. Let $n = 50$, we have $f(100) = 2*193 + 1 = 387$.

So the value of $f(100)$ is 387. The answer is: $387$

**Problem:** 
"The function $f(n)$ is defined on the positive integers such that $f(f(n)) = 2n$ and $f(4n + 1) = 4n + 3$ for all positive integers $n.$  Find $f(1000).$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Consider the expression $f(f(f(a))).$  Since $f(f(a)) = 2a,$ this is equal to $f(2a).$  But taking $n = f(a)$ in $f(f(n)) = 2n,$ we get
\[f(f(f(a))) = 2f(a).\]Hence,
\[f(2a) = 2f(a)\]for all positive integers $a.$

Then
\[f(1000) = 2f(500) = 4f(250) = 8f(125).\]Taking $n = 31$ in $f(4n + 1) = 4n + 3,$ we get
\[f(125) = 127,\]so $f(1000) = \boxed{1016}.$ The answer is $\boxed{1016}$

**Problem:** 
"We define a function $f(x)$ such that $f(14)=7$, and if there exists an integer $a$ such that $f(a)=b$, then $f(b)$ is defined and

$f(b)=3b+1$ if $b$ is odd

$f(b)=\frac{b}{2}$ if $b$ is even.

What is the smallest possible number of integers in the domain of $f$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Since $f(14)=7$, we know that $f(7)$ is defined, and it must equal $22$.  Similarly, we know that $f(22)$ is defined, and it must equal $11$.  Continuing on this way,  \begin{align*}

\end{align*}We are now in a cycle $1$, $4$, $2$, $1$, and so on.  Thus there are no more values which need to be defined, as there is no $a$ currently defined for which $f(a)$ is a $b$ not already defined.  Thus the minimum number of integers we can define is the number we have already defined, which is $\boxed{18}$. The answer is $\boxed{18}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):

**Problem**
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


To find $f(100)$, we need to first understand the function $f$. The first equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ tells us that applying the function $f$ three times to any number $n$ will result in $8n-7$. The second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ tells us that applying the function $f$ to any number $2n$ is equivalent to doubling $f(n)$ and adding $1$.

Let's start by calculating $f(1)$ using the second equation. Since $2 \cdot 1 = 2$, we have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. But we also know from the first equation that $f(f(f(1))) = 8 \cdot 1 - 7 = 1$. Since $f(f(f(1))) = 1$, we have $f(f(1)) = 1$. Then, from the second equation again, we have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = f(f(1)) = 1$. So we get $2f(1) + 1 = 1$, which implies $f(1) = 0$.

Now we can use the second equation to find $f(2)$, $f(3)$, $f(4)$, etc. We find that $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2 \cdot 0 + 1 = 1$, $f(3) = 2f(1.5) + 1 = 2 \cdot f(1) + 1 = 2 \cdot 0 + 1 = 1$, $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2 \cdot 1 + 1 = 3$, and so on.

We can continue this process to find $f(100)$. However, it's clear that this process will be time-consuming and error-prone. A more efficient way is to use the first equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. We can start by calculating $f(f(f(100)))$ and then work backwards to find $f(100)$.

We have $f(f(f(100))) = 8 \cdot 100 - 7 = 793$. Now we need to find a number $n$ such that $f(f(n)) = 793$. We can start by guessing some values of $n$ and checking if $f(f(n)) = 793$. After trying a few values, we find that $f(f(199)) = 793$. Now we need to find a number $m$ such that $f(m) = 199$. We can continue this process until we reach $f(100)$.

After performing this process, we find that $f(100) = 199$.

The value of $f(100)$ is $199$. The answer is: $199$

**Problem:** 
"The function $f(n)$ is defined on the positive integers such that $f(f(n)) = 2n$ and $f(4n + 1) = 4n + 3$ for all positive integers $n.$  Find $f(1000).$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Consider the expression $f(f(f(a))).$  Since $f(f(a)) = 2a,$ this is equal to $f(2a).$  But taking $n = f(a)$ in $f(f(n)) = 2n,$ we get
\[f(f(f(a))) = 2f(a).\]Hence,
\[f(2a) = 2f(a)\]for all positive integers $a.$

Then
\[f(1000) = 2f(500) = 4f(250) = 8f(125).\]Taking $n = 31$ in $f(4n + 1) = 4n + 3,$ we get
\[f(125) = 127,\]so $f(1000) = \boxed{1016}.$ The answer is $\boxed{1016}$

**Solution:**



We are given the function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ and two conditions: $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We are asked to find $f(100)$.

To solve this problem, we can start by calculating $f(100)$ using the second condition. Since $2 \times 100 = 200$, we have $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$.

Next, we can use the first condition to find $f(200)$. We know that $f(f(f(100))) = 8 \times 100 - 7 = 793$, so $f(200) = 793$.

Substituting $f(200) = 793$ into the equation $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$, we get $793 = 2f(100) + 1$. Solving for $f(100)$, we get $f(100) = \frac{793 - 1}{2} = 396$.

Therefore, $f(100) = 396$. The answer is: $396$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"The function $f$ is defined on the set of integers and satisfies \[f(n)= \begin{cases}  n-3 & \mbox{if }n\ge 1000 \\  f(f(n+5)) & \mbox{if }n<1000. \end{cases}\]Find $f(84)$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Denote by (1) and (2) the two parts of the definition of $f$, respectively. If we begin to use the definition of $f$ to compute $f(84)$, we use (2) until the argument is at least $1000$: \[f(84) = f(f(89)) = f(f(f(94))) = \dots = f^N(1004)\](where $f^N$ denotes composing $f$ with itself $N$ times, for some $N$). The numbers $84, 89, 94, \dots, 1004$ form an arithmetic sequence with common difference $5$; since $1004 - 84 = 920 = 184 \cdot 5$, this sequence has $184 + 1 = 185$ terms, so $N = 185$.

At this point, (1) and (2) are both used: we compute \[\begin{aligned} f^N(1004) &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-1}(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-1}(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(1000) \\ &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(997) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1002) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(999) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1004). \end{aligned}\]Repeating this process, we see that \[f^N(1004) = f^{N-2}(1004) = f^{N-4}(1004) = \dots = f^3(1004).\](The pattern breaks down for $f^k(1004)$ when $k$ is small, so it is not true that $f^3(1004) = f(1004)$.) Now, we have \[f^3(1004) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^2(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^2(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(1000) \stackrel{(1)}{=} \boxed{997}.\] The answer is $\boxed{997}$

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**



To find $f(100)$, we first need to find a general expression for $f(n)$. We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. Let's set $m=f(n)$, then we have $f(f(m))=8n-7$. Again setting $k=f(m)$, we have $f(k)=8n-7$. From the second condition, we know that $f(2m)=2f(m)+1=2m+1$. So we can guess that $f(n)=2n+1$.

Now we substitute $f(n)=2n+1$ into the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we get $f(f(2n+1))=8n-7$. Substituting $f(n)=2n+1$ again, we get $f(2(2n+1)+1)=8n-7$, which simplifies to $f(4n+3)=8n-7$.

Now let's substitute $f(n)=2n+1$ into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we get $f(2n)=2(2n+1)+1=4n+3$. This is consistent with our previous result $f(4n+3)=8n-7$.

Now we can find $f(100)$ by substituting $n=50$ into $f(n)=2n+1$, we get $f(100)=2*50+1=101$.

So the value of $f(100)$ is $101$. The answer is: $101$

Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Consider the expression $f(f(f(a))).$  Since $f(f(a)) = 2a,$ this is equal to $f(2a).$  But taking $n = f(a)$ in $f(f(n)) = 2n,$ we get

\[f(2a) = 2f(a)\]for all positive integers $a.$

Then
\[f(1000) = 2f(500) = 4f(250) = 8f(125).\]Taking $n = 31$ in $f(4n + 1) = 4n + 3,$ we get

**Solution:**



To solve this problem, we can start by finding the value of $f(1)$ using the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Setting $n=1$, we get $f(2)=2f(1)+1$. Since $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$, we have $f(1)=1$. Now we can substitute $f(1)=1$ into the equation $f(2)=2f(1)+1$ to get $f(2)=3$.

Next, we can find the value of $f(3)$ using the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. Setting $n=3$, we get $f(f(f(3)))=8*3-7=17$. Since $f(2)=3$, we have $f(f(3))=17$. Now we can substitute $f(2)=3$ into the equation $f(f(3))=17$ to get $f(3)=17$.

Continuing in this way, we can find the values of $f(4)$, $f(5)$, and so on. We find that $f(4)=7$, $f(5)=15$, $f(6)=31$, and so on. By observing the pattern, we can conjecture that $f(n)=2n-1$.

To verify this conjecture, we can substitute $f(n)=2n-1$ into the two given conditions. For the first condition, we have $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. Substituting $f(n)=2n-1$, we get $f(f(f(n)))=f(f(2n-1))=f(4n-3)=8n-7$. For the second condition, we have $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Substituting $f(n)=2n-1$, we get $f(2n)=2(2n-1)+1=4n-1$. Both conditions hold true for $f(n)=2n-1$.

Therefore, the function $f(n)$ is given by $f(n)=2n-1$. Now we can find the value of $f(100)$ by substituting $n=100$ into the equation $f(n)=2n-1$. We get $f(100)=2*100-1=199$.

So the value of $f(100)$ is 199. The answer is: $199$
