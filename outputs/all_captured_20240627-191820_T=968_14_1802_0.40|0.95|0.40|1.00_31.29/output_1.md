**Problem:** 
"Find the minimum value of $2x^2 + 2y^2 + 5z^2 - 2xy - 4yz - 4x - 2z + 15$ over all real numbers $x,$ $y,$ $z.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
We can write the given expression as
\begin{align*}
&(x^2 - 4x + 4) + (x^2 - 2xy + y^2) + (y^2 - 4yz + 4z^2) + (z^2 - 2z + 1) + 10 \\
&= (x - 2)^2 + (x - y)^2 + (y - 2z)^2 + (z - 1)^2 + 10
\end{align*}The minimum value is then $\boxed{10},$ which occurs when $x = 2,$ $y = 2,$ and $z = 1.$ The answer is $\boxed{10}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):

**Problem**
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


To solve this problem, we can use the fact that the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ can be rewritten as $(5x-4y)^2 + (5y-4x)^2$. This is a sum of squares, which is always nonnegative. Therefore, the minimum value of the expression is 0, which occurs when $5x-4y=0$ and $5y-4x=0$. Solving these equations simultaneously gives $x=y$.

Now we need to find the value of $x$ that satisfies the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. Since $x=y$, this simplifies to $|x-2x| + |x-2x| = 40$, or $|x-2x| = 20$. This simplifies further to $|x| = 20$, so $x = \pm 20$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ occurs when $x=y=\pm 20$. Substituting these values into the expression gives $5(20)^2 + 5(20)^2 - 8(20)(20) = 2000$.

So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 2000.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"What is the minimum value of the expression $2x^2+3y^2+8x-24y+62$ for real $x$ and $y$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Rearranging the expression, we have  \[2x^2+8x+3y^2-24y+62\]We first complete the square in $x$. Factoring a 2 from the first two terms of the expression, we get  \[2(x^2+4x)+3y^2-24y+62\]In order for the expression inside the parenthesis to be a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(4/2)^2=4$ inside the parenthesis. Doing this, we have \[2(x^2+4x+4-4)+3y^2-24y+62 \Rightarrow 2(x+2)^2+3y^2-24y+54\]Now we complete the square in $y$. Factoring a 3 from the $y$ terms in the expression, we get \[2(x+2)^2+3(y^2-8y)+54\]In order for the expression inside the second parenthesis to be a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(8/2)^2=16$ inside the parenthesis. Doing this, we have \[2(x+2)^2+3(y^2-8y+16-16)+54 \Rightarrow 2(x+2)^2+3(y-4)^2+6\]Since the minimum value of $2(x+2)^2$ and $3(y-4)^2$ is $0$ (perfect squares can never be negative), the minimum value of the entire expression is $\boxed{6}$, and is achieved when $x=-2$ and $y=4$. The answer is $\boxed{6}$

Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**

    y_sol = solve(eq, y)[0]

    # Substitute y in the expression

**Problem:** 
"Find the minimum value of $2x^2 + 2y^2 + 5z^2 - 2xy - 4yz - 4x - 2z + 15$ over all real numbers $x,$ $y,$ $z.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
We can write the given expression as
\begin{align*}
&(x^2 - 4x + 4) + (x^2 - 2xy + y^2) + (y^2 - 4yz + 4z^2) + (z^2 - 2z + 1) + 10 \\
&= (x - 2)^2 + (x - y)^2 + (y - 2z)^2 + (z - 1)^2 + 10
\end{align*}The minimum value is then $\boxed{10},$ which occurs when $x = 2,$ $y = 2,$ and $z = 1.$ The answer is $\boxed{10}$
