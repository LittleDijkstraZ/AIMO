Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Approach:

 The given equation is a product of two expressions, which is zero if and only if at least one of the expressions is zero. Therefore, the points that satisfy the equation are the union of the points that satisfy each of the expressions individually.

1. For the expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that the points lie on the lines $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.

2. For the expression $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that the points lie on the lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

The four lines $x + y = \pm 10$, $x - y = \pm 10$, $x = \pm 8$, and $y = \pm 8$ form a square with side length $20$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $20^2 = 400$. The answer is: $400$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:


The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us four equations:

1. $x + y = 10$
2. $x + y = -10$
3. $x - y = 10$
4. $x - y = -10$

Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us four more equations:

5. $x = 8$
6. $x = -8$
7. $y = 8$
8. $y = -8$

Now, we need to find the intersection points of these equations to plot the polygon. The intersection points are:

1. $(8, 2)$
2. $(8, -10)$
3. $(-8, 2)$
4. $(-8, -10)$
5. $(8, 8)$
6. $(8, -8)$
7. $(-8, 8)$
8. $(-8, -8)$

These points form a square with side length 16. The area of a square is given by the square of its side length, so the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

The answer is: $256$.

Approach:


The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
From these equations, we can deduce that the points $(x, y)$ must satisfy $-10 \leq x, y \leq 10$ and $-8 \leq x, y \leq 8$.
This forms a square with side length 20, so the area of the square is $20^2 = 400$.


```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    side_length = 20
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 400

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
400
```
The area of the convex polygon is $400$. The answer is: $400$.

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:



The given equation is of the form $A \cdot B = 0$, which implies that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the solution set is the union of the sets of points that satisfy each of the equations:

$$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$$
$$(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$$

The first equation implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. The second equation implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length $16$. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is $256$.
The answer is: $256$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:


The equation given in the problem is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. We will analyze each case separately.

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$:
For the sum of two squares to be zero, both squares must be zero. Therefore, we have:
$\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$.
Solving these equations, we get:
$\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.
The solutions to these equations are:
$(x, y) = (5, 5), (-5, -5), (5, -5), (-5, 5)$.

2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$:
Similar to the first case, for the sum of two squares to be zero, both squares must be zero. Therefore, we have:
$\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.
Solving these equations, we get:
$\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
The solutions to these equations are:
$(x, y) = (8, 8), (-8, -8), (8, -8), (-8, 8)$.

Combining the solutions from both cases, we have a total of 8 points:
$(5, 5), (-5, -5), (5, -5), (-5, 5), (8, 8), (-8, -8), (8, -8), (-8, 8)$.
These 8 points form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $\boxed{100}$.

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:



The given equation is of the form $AB = 0$, which implies that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. So, we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first case, we have $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The absolute value equations can be split into two cases each:

- Case 1.1: $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$. Solving this system of equations gives $x = 10$ and $y = 0$.
- Case 1.2: $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$. Solving this system of equations gives $x = -10$ and $y = 0$.
- Case 2.1: $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$. Solving this system of equations gives $x = 0$ and $y = 10$.
- Case 2.2: $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$. Solving this system of equations gives $x = 0$ and $y = -10$.

So, the vertices of the polygon are $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, and $(0, -10)$. These points form a square with side length 20. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.

For the second case, we have $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The absolute value equations can be split into two cases each:

- Case 1: $x = 8$ and $y = 8$.
- Case 2: $x = -8$ and $y = -8$.

So, the vertices of the polygon are $(8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, $(8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$. These points also form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

However, this case does not apply to the given equation, as it does not satisfy the condition $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. Therefore, the only valid solution is the square formed by the vertices $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, and $(0, -10)$ with an area of 400.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 400.
The answer is: $400$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:


The given equation is equal to zero, which means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 
If either $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x - y| - 10 = 0$, then $|x + y| = 10$ or $|x - y| = 10$.
This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, or $x - y = -10$.
Similarly, if either $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$, then $|x| = 8$ or $|y| = 8$.
This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, or $y = -8$.

The four lines form a square with side length 10 (from $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$), and the other two lines form another square with side length 8 (from $x = 8$ and $y = 8$).
The area of a square is given by the square of its side length, so the area of the larger square is $10^2 = 100$, and the area of the smaller square is $8^2 = 64$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares, which is $100 + 64 = 164$. The answer is: $164$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:

 The given equation is of the form $(A)(B) = 0$. This implies that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. So, we can break the problem into two parts:

1. Solving the equations $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$, $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$, and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.
2. Calculating the area of the convex polygon formed by the intersection points of the solutions from step 1.

Step 1:

1. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ gives $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
2. $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$ gives $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
3. $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ gives $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
4. $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$ gives $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

Step 2:

Now we find the intersection points of these lines:

1. For $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, we get $x = 10$ and $y = 0$.
2. For $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$, we get $x = 0$ and $y = 10$.
3. For $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$, we get $x = -10$ and $y = -20$.
4. For $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$, we get $x = -10$ and $y = 0$.
5. For $x = 8$ and $y = 8$, the equation $x + y = 16$ is satisfied.
6. For $x = 8$ and $y = -8$, the equation $x - y = 16$ is satisfied.
7. For $x = -8$ and $y = 8$, the equation $x + y = 0$ is satisfied.
8. For $x = -8$ and $y = -8$, the equation $x - y = -16$ is satisfied.

So the intersection points are $(10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, $(-10, -20)$, and $(-10, 0)$ from the first two sets of equations, and $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$ from the last two sets of equations.

These points form a square with side length $20$. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $400$. The answer is: $400$
