Approach:


We can rewrite the given equation as $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40 \implies |x-2y| = 40 - |y-2x|$.
Now consider the cases when $(x-2y)$ and $(y-2x)$ have the same sign and when they have opposite signs.
If $(x-2y)$ and $(y-2x)$ have the same sign, then $|x-2y| = (x-2y)$ and $|y-2x| = (y-2x)$, so we have
\[(x-2y) = 40 - (y-2x) \implies 3(x-2y) = 40 \implies x-2y = \frac{40}{3}.\]
If $(x-2y)$ and $(y-2x)$ have opposite signs, then $|x-2y| = -(x-2y)$ and $|y-2x| = -(y-2x)$, so we have
\[-(x-2y) = 40 - -(y-2x) \implies -(x-2y) = 40 + (y-2x) \implies -3(x-2y) = 40 \implies x-2y = -\frac{40}{3}.\]
Similarly, we can find that $y-2x = \pm \frac{40}{3}$.
Now let's consider the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.
We can rewrite this as $5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2 + 4xy] - 8xy$.
Substituting $(x-2y) = \frac{40}{3}$ and $(y-2x) = \pm \frac{40}{3}$, we get
\[5\left[\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 + \left(\pm \frac{40}{3}\right)^2 + 4xy\right] - 8xy = \frac{800}{3}.\]
So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\frac{800}{3}$. The answer is: $\frac{800}{3}$

Approach:


To solve this problem, we will first solve the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ for $x$ and $y$. Then, we will substitute the solution into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to find its minimum value.

Solution:
We can start by solving the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. We know that $|a-b| = |b-a|$, so we can rewrite the equation as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$. 

We can use the property $|a+b| \leq |a| + |b|$ to simplify the equation. Applying this property to the left side of the equation, we get:

$|x-2y| + |2y-x| \leq |x-2y + 2y-x| = |0| = 0$.

However, we know that the left side of the equation is equal to 40, so the only way for the inequality to hold is if the equality holds, i.e., $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 0$.

This equality can only hold if $x-2y = 0$ and $2y-x = 0$, which implies $x = 2y$ and $2y = x$. These two equations are equivalent, so we can conclude that $x = 2y$.

Now, we can substitute $x = 2y$ into the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$:

$|2y-2y| + |y-4y| = 40 \Rightarrow |0| + |-3y| = 40 \Rightarrow |-3y| = 40$.

Since the absolute value of a number is always non-negative, the only way for this equation to hold is if $-3y = 40$, which implies $y = -\frac{40}{3}$. 

Substituting $y = -\frac{40}{3}$ into $x = 2y$, we get $x = 2(-\frac{40}{3}) = -\frac{80}{3}$.

Now, we can substitute $x = -\frac{80}{3}$ and $y = -\frac{40}{3}$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:

$5(-\frac{80}{3})^2 + 5(-\frac{40}{3})^2 - 8(-\frac{80}{3})(-\frac{40}{3}) = \frac{6400}{9} + \frac{8000}{9} - \frac{32000}{9} = -\frac{16000}{9}$.

The minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $-\frac{16000}{9}$. The answer is: $-\frac{16000}{9}$

Approach:

 We will first use the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ to simplify the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ by substitution. Then we will complete the square to find the minimum value of the simplified expression.

Step 1: Let's rewrite the absolute value equation as follows:
\[|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40 \implies |x-2y| = 40 - |y-2x|\]
Since $|a| = |b|$ implies $a = b$ or $a = -b$, we can have two cases:
Case 1: $x - 2y = 40 - (y - 2x)$, which simplifies to $3x - 3y = 40$, or $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$.
Case 2: $x - 2y = -(y - 2x)$, which simplifies to $x - 2y = -y + 2x$, or $x = 3y$.

Step 2: Substitute $x = 3y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to get:
\[5(3y)^2 + 5y^2 - 8(3y)y = 5 \cdot 9y^2 + 5y^2 - 24y^2 = 25y^2\]

Step 3: Now, we want to minimize $25y^2$. Since $y^2$ is always non-negative, the minimum value of $25y^2$ is 0, which occurs when $y = 0$.

Step 4: Substitute $y = 0$ into $x = 3y$ to get $x = 0$.

Step 5: Substitute $x = 0$ and $y = 0$ into the original expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to get:
\[5(0)^2 + 5(0)^2 - 8(0)(0) = 0\]

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0 when $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. The answer is: $0$

Approach:


This is an optimization problem with an inequality constraint. To solve it, we will first solve the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ for $y$ in terms of $x$. Then we will substitute $y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ and find its minimum value.

Step 1: Solve the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ for $y$ in terms of $x$.
We can split the equation into two cases:
Case 1: $x - 2y \geq 0$ and $y - 2x \geq 0$. Then the equation becomes $x - 2y + y - 2x = 40$, which simplifies to $-y = 40$, or $y = -40$.
Case 2: $x - 2y < 0$ and $y - 2x < 0$. Then the equation becomes $2y - x + 2x - y = 40$, which simplifies to $y = 40$.
However, both cases lead to inconsistent results, so we must have made a mistake in our analysis.
Let's reconsider the absolute value equations.
If $x - 2y \geq 0$, then $|x - 2y| = x - 2y$. If $y - 2x \geq 0$, then $|y - 2x| = y - 2x$. The equation then becomes $(x - 2y) + (y - 2x) = 40$, which simplifies to $-y = 40$, or $y = -40$. This case is valid.
If $x - 2y < 0$, then $|x - 2y| = 2y - x$. If $y - 2x < 0$, then $|y - 2x| = 2x - y$. The equation then becomes $(2y - x) + (2x - y) = 40$, which simplifies to $y = 40$. This case is also valid.
So the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ has two solutions: $y = -40$ and $y = 40$.

Step 2: Substitute $y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ and find its minimum value.
For $y = -40$, the expression becomes $5x^2 + 5(-40)^2 - 8x(-40) = 5x^2 + 8000 + 320x$.
For $y = 40$, the expression becomes $5x^2 + 5(40)^2 - 8x(40) = 5x^2 + 8000 - 320x$.
We can find the minimum value of each expression by taking the derivative with respect to $x$ and setting it to zero.
For $5x^2 + 8000 + 320x$, the derivative is $10x + 320$, which is zero when $x = -32$. Substituting $x = -32$ into the expression gives a value of $-6400$.
For $5x^2 + 8000 - 320x$, the derivative is $10x - 320$, which is zero when $x = 32$. Substituting $x = 32$ into the expression also gives a value of $-6400$.
So the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $-6400$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $-6400$.
The answer is: $-6400$

Assistant:

Approach:


To find the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we can first rewrite the condition in a more convenient form.

Step 1: Simplify the condition
The condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$. This simplifies to $2|x-2y| = 40$, or $|x-2y| = 20$.

Step 2: Rewrite the expression
The expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ can be rewritten as $5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x-y)^2 + 2xy] - 8xy$.

Step 3: Use the condition to eliminate $xy$
From the condition $|x-2y| = 20$, we can square both sides to get $(x-2y)^2 = 400$, which simplifies to $x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2 = 400$. Rearranging terms gives $2xy = x^2 + 4y^2 - 400$.

Substitute this into the expression $5[(x-y)^2 + 2xy] - 8xy$, we get $5[(x-y)^2 + x^2 + 4y^2 - 400] - 8(x^2 + 4y^2 - 400)/2 = 5(x^2+y^2-400) = 5(x^2+y^2) - 2000$.

Step 4: Use the condition to find the minimum
Since $|x-2y| = 20$, we know that $x^2 + y^2 - 2xy = 400$. We can rewrite this as $x^2 + y^2 = 400 + 2xy$.

Substitute this into the expression $5(x^2+y^2) - 2000$, we get $5(400 + 2xy) - 2000 = 2000 + 10xy - 2000 = 10xy$.

So the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is achieved when $xy$ is at its maximum under the condition $|x-2y| = 20$. But from the condition, we know that $xy$ is fixed to be half of $(x-2y)^2$, which is a constant. Therefore, $xy$ is at its maximum when $x=y$, in which case $xy = x^2 = (20/2)^2 = 100$.

Step 5: Substitute the maximum $xy$ value
Substituting $xy = 100$ into the expression $10xy$, we get $10*100 = 1000$.

So the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $1000$.

The answer is: $\boxed{1000}$.

Assistant:

Approach:

 We can rewrite the given expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $\frac{1}{2}((x-2y)^2 + (2x-y)^2)$. Then, we know that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, which can be rewritten as $|x-2y| + |2x-y| = 40$. By the triangle inequality, we have $|x-2y| + |2x-y| \ge |(x-2y) + (2x-y)| = |3x-3y| = 3|x-y|$, so we have $3|x-y| = 40$, or $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$.

Now, let $u = x-2y$ and $v = 2x-y$. Then, we have $x = \frac{2u+v}{5}$ and $y = \frac{u+2v}{5}$. Substitute these into the expression $\frac{1}{2}((x-2y)^2 + (2x-y)^2)$, we get $\frac{1}{2}(u^2 + v^2)$.

Now, we have $|u| = 40/3$ and $|v| = 40/3$, so $u^2 + v^2 = \left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{3200}{9}$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{3200}{9} = \frac{1600}{9}$. The answer is: $\boxed{\frac{1600}{9}}$

Approach:


To solve this problem, we can use the method of completing the square. First, we rewrite the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$. Now, let's define $u = 2y - x$ and $v = 2x - y$. Then the equation becomes $|u| + |v| = 40$.

Next, we express the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ in terms of $u$ and $v$. We have:
\begin{align*}
5x^2+5y^2-8xy &= 5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy \\
&= 5[(2y - x)^2 + (2x - y)^2]/4 - 8(2x - y)(2y - x) \\
&= 5(u^2 + v^2)/4 - 2uv \\
&= 5u^2/4 + 5v^2/4 - 2uv.
\end{align*}
Now, we complete the square for the expression $5u^2/4 + 5v^2/4 - 2uv$:
\begin{align*}
5u^2/4 + 5v^2/4 - 2uv &= (5u^2/4 - 2uv + 4v^2/4) + (5v^2/4 - 2uv + 4u^2/4) \\
&= (5u^2/4 - 2uv + v^2) + (5v^2/4 - 2uv + u^2) \\
&= (5u^2/4 - 2uv + v^2) + (u^2 - 2uv + 5v^2/4) \\
&= (u - v/2)^2 + (v - u/2)^2.
\end{align*}
Now, we know that $|u| + |v| = 40$, and $(u - v/2)^2 + (v - u/2)^2 \ge 0$. Thus, the minimum value of $(u - v/2)^2 + (v - u/2)^2$ is 0, which occurs when $u = v/2$ and $v = u/2$. From $|u| + |v| = 40$, we can solve these equations to get $u = v = 20$.

Substituting $u = 2y - x$ and $v = 2x - y$, we get $2y - x = 20$ and $2x - y = 20$. Solving these equations, we find $x = 12$ and $y = 8$.

Substituting $x = 12$ and $y = 8$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get:
\begin{align*}
5x^2+5y^2-8xy &= 5(12)^2 + 5(8)^2 - 8(12)(8) \\
&= 720 - 768 \\
&= -48.
\end{align*}
So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $-48$.
The answer is: $-48$

Approach:


To find the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ subject to the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. Let's introduce a new variable $\lambda$ and form the function $F(x, y, \lambda) = 5x^2+5y^2-8xy + \lambda (|x-2y| + |y-2x| - 40)$.

Now we need to find the partial derivatives of $F$ with respect to $x$, $y$, and $\lambda$, and set them equal to zero.

$\frac{\partial F}{\partial x} = 10x - 8y + \lambda(-1 + 2 \cdot \text{sgn}(x-2y)) = 0$

$\frac{\partial F}{\partial y} = 10y - 8x + \lambda(1 - 2 \cdot \text{sgn}(y-2x)) = 0$

$\frac{\partial F}{\partial \lambda} = |x-2y| + |y-2x| - 40 = 0$

Solving this system of equations is quite involved, but we can simplify the problem by noting that the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ implies that $x$ and $y$ have the same sign. Therefore, we can replace $\text{sgn}(x-2y)$ and $\text{sgn}(y-2x)$ with 1. The system of equations then becomes:

$10x - 8y + \lambda(-1 + 2) = 0 \implies 10x - 8y + \lambda = 0$

$10y - 8x + \lambda(1 - 2) = 0 \implies 10y - 8x - \lambda = 0$

$|x-2y| + |y-2x| - 40 = 0 \implies |x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$

Solving this system of equations, we find that $x = 4$ and $y = 2$. Substituting these values into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get:

$5(4)^2 + 5(2)^2 - 8(4)(2) = 80 + 20 - 64 = 36$.

Therefore, the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 36. The answer is: $36$

1. First, we need to notice that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$. The expression $|a| + |b|$ is minimized when $a$ and $b$ have the same sign, so we can rewrite the equation as $(x-2y) + (2y-x) = 40$, which simplifies to $0 = 40$. This is a contradiction, so we must have made an error in our reasoning.

2. The error comes from the fact that we assumed $|x-2y| + |y-2x|$ is minimized when $x-2y$ and $2y-x$ have the same sign. In reality, the expression $|x-2y| + |y-2x|$ is minimized when $x-2y$ and $2y-x$ are equal (not just have the same sign). This gives us the equation $x-2y = 2y-x$, which simplifies to $x = 2y$.

3. Substituting $x = 2y$ into the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ gives $|2y-2y| + |y-4y| = 40$, which simplifies to $|0| + |-3y| = 40$, or $3|y| = 40$. Solving for $y$ gives $y = \pm \frac{40}{3}$.

4. Substituting $y = \frac{40}{3}$ into $x = 2y$ gives $x = \frac{80}{3}$. Similarly, substituting $y = -\frac{40}{3}$ gives $x = -\frac{80}{3}$.

5. Now we substitute $x = \frac{80}{3}$ and $y = \frac{40}{3}$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to find its minimum value. Similarly, we substitute $x = -\frac{80}{3}$ and $y = -\frac{40}{3}$ to find another value of the expression. The smaller of these two values is the minimum value of the expression.

6. After calculating, we find that the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $-400$.

So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $-400$.
The answer is: $-400$

Approach:

 We will first express the given condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ in a more convenient form and then use the AM-GM inequality to find the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.

Step 1: The given condition can be rewritten as $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40 \implies |x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40 \implies |x-2y| = |2y-x| = 20$.

This implies that $x-2y = 20$ or $x-2y = -20$ and $2y-x = 20$ or $2y-x = -20$.

Solving these systems of equations, we get the solutions $(x, y) = (40, 0)$ or $(x, y) = (-40, 0)$ or $(x, y) = (0, 20)$ or $(x, y) = (0, -20)$.

Step 2: Now we substitute these values into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to find its minimum value.

For $(x, y) = (40, 0)$, we have $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(40)^2+5(0)^2-8(40)(0) = 8000$.

For $(x, y) = (-40, 0)$, we have $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(-40)^2+5(0)^2-8(-40)(0) = 8000$.

For $(x, y) = (0, 20)$, we have $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(0)^2+5(20)^2-8(0)(20) = 2000$.

For $(x, y) = (0, -20)$, we have $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(0)^2+5(-20)^2-8(0)(-20) = 2000$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $2000$.

Approach:

 To solve this problem, we first recognize that the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is always true for real numbers $x$ and $y$. Therefore, we can focus on minimizing the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ without considering the constraint equation.

Let's define a new variable $z = x-2y$ and $w = y-2x$. Then we have $|z| + |w| = 40$. Since $z = x-2y$ and $w = y-2x$, we can rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $5(x^2+y^2)-8xy = \frac{1}{2}(10(x^2+y^2)-16xy) = \frac{1}{2}((x-2y)^2+(y-2x)^2) = \frac{1}{2}(z^2+w^2)$.

We want to minimize $\frac{1}{2}(z^2+w^2)$ subject to the constraint $|z| + |w| = 40$. By the triangle inequality, $|z| + |w| \geq |z+w|$, so $40 \geq |z+w|$. Since $z = x-2y$ and $w = y-2x$, we have $z+w = (x-2y)+(y-2x) = -x-y$. Therefore, $|z+w| = |-x-y| = |-(x+y)| = |x+y|$. Hence, we have $40 \geq |x+y|$.

Now, let's consider the expression $\frac{1}{2}(z^2+w^2)$. Since $z^2 \geq 0$ and $w^2 \geq 0$, we have $\frac{1}{2}(z^2+w^2) \geq 0$. Equality occurs when $z = w = 0$, which implies $x = 2y$ and $y = 2x$. Solving these equations gives $x = 0$ and $y = 0$. However, this does not satisfy the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.

Instead, we consider the case when $x = -y$. Then, $z = x-2y = -3x$ and $w = y-2x = 3x$. Substituting these into the constraint equation gives $|-3x| + |3x| = 40$, which simplifies to $6|x| = 40$. Therefore, $|x| = \frac{40}{6} = \frac{20}{3}$. Since $x = -y$, we have $y = -\frac{20}{3}$. Now, we can calculate the minimum value of $\frac{1}{2}(z^2+w^2)$:

$$\frac{1}{2}(z^2+w^2) = \frac{1}{2}((-3x)^2 + (3x)^2) = \frac{1}{2}(18x^2) = 9x^2.$$

Substituting $x = -\frac{20}{3}$ gives $9x^2 = 9\left(-\frac{20}{3}\right)^2 = 9 \cdot \frac{400}{9} = 400$. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 400.
The answer is: $400$

Approach:



We can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to solve this problem. The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states that for any real numbers $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$ and $b_1, b_2, ..., b_n$, we have:
\[(a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 + ... + a_nb_n)^2 \leq (a_1^2 + a_2^2 + ... + a_n^2)(b_1^2 + b_2^2 + ... + b_n^2).\]
In our case, we can let $a_1 = x - 2y$, $a_2 = y - 2x$, $b_1 = 1$, and $b_2 = 1$. Then we have:
\[(a_1b_1 + a_2b_2)^2 = (x - 2y + y - 2x)^2 = (-x - y)^2 = (x + y)^2.\]
And:
\[(a_1^2 + a_2^2)(b_1^2 + b_2^2) = ((x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2)(1^2 + 1^2) = (5x^2 - 10xy + 5y^2)(2) = 10x^2 - 20xy + 10y^2.\]
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have:
\[(x + y)^2 \leq 10x^2 - 20xy + 10y^2.\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy \geq 0.\]
Since $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$, we know that $x + y$ is a constant. So the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is achieved when $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = 0$.

Solution:

We have found that the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is 0. So the answer is $\boxed{0}$.

However, this doesn't satisfy the condition $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$. We must find the value of $x$ and $y$ that satisfy both the equation and the condition.

From the equation $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = 0$, we can rewrite it as:
\[5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy = 0.\]
This is a quadratic equation in terms of $xy$. Let $t = xy$, then we have:
\[5(x^2 + y^2) - 8t = 0.\]
From the condition $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$, we can use the triangular inequality to get:
\[|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = |x - 2y| + |2y - x| \geq |(x - 2y) + (2y - x)| = 0.\]
So we must have $|x - 2y| = |y - 2x| = 20$. Without loss of generality, we can assume $x - 2y = 20$ (the other case gives the same result). Then we have:
\[x - 2y = 20 \Rightarrow x = 2y + 20.\]
Substitute this into the equation $5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy = 0$, we get:
\[5((2y + 20)^2 + y^2) - 8(2y + 20)y = 0.\]
Expanding and simplifying, we find:
\[5(4y^2 + 80y + 400 + y^2) - 16y^2 - 160y = 0.\]
Simplifying further, we have:
\[25y^2 + 400y + 2000 - 16y^2 - 160y = 0.\]
Combining like terms, we get:
\[9y^2 + 240y + 2000 = 0.\]
This is a quadratic equation in terms of $y$. Solving it, we get two solutions: $y = 10$ and $y = \frac{2000}{9}$.
If $y = 10$, then $x = 2y + 20 = 40$.
If $y = \frac{2000}{9}$, then $x = 2y + 20 = \frac{4000}{9} + \frac{180}{9} = \frac{4180}{9}$.
Now we need to check which pair of $x$ and $y$ satisfies the condition $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$.
For $x = 40$ and $y = 10$, we have $|40 - 20| + |10 - 80| = 20 + 70 = 90$, which is not equal to 40.
For $x = \frac{4180}{9}$ and $y = \frac{2000}{9}$, we have $\left|\frac{4180}{9} - \frac{4000}{9}\right| + \left|\frac{2000}{9} - \frac{8360}{9}\right| = \frac{180}{9} + \frac{6360}{9} = \frac{6540}{9} = 726.67$, which is not equal to 40 either.
We must have made a mistake somewhere. Let's go back and check our work.

From the equation $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = 0$, we can rewrite it as:
\[5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy = 0.\]
This is a quadratic equation in terms of $xy$. Let $t = xy$, then we have:
\[5(x^2 + y^2) - 8t = 0.\]
From the condition $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$, we can use the triangular inequality to get:
\[|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = |x - 2y| + |2y - x| \geq |(x - 2y) + (2y - x)| = 0.\]
So we must have $|x - 2y| = |y - 2x| = 20$. Without loss of generality, we can assume $x - 2

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:

 To solve this problem, we first note that the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is equivalent to $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$. Since $|a| = |-a|$ for all real numbers $a$, this simplifies to $2|x-2y| = 40$, or $|x-2y| = 20$. The absolute value equation $|x-2y| = 20$ splits into two cases: $x-2y = 20$ and $x-2y = -20$. We can solve these two equations to get $y = \frac{x}{2} - 10$ and $y = \frac{x}{2} + 10$, respectively.

Next, we substitute these expressions for $y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to get two separate expressions. For $y = \frac{x}{2} - 10$, we have
\[5x^2+5\left(\frac{x}{2} - 10\right)^2 - 8x\left(\frac{x}{2} - 10\right).\]
Similarly, for $y = \frac{x}{2} + 10$, we have
\[5x^2+5\left(\frac{x}{2} + 10\right)^2 - 8x\left(\frac{x}{2} + 10\right).\]
To find the minimum value of these expressions, we can take the derivative with respect to $x$ and set it equal to zero.

Let's do this for the first expression:
\[5x^2+5\left(\frac{x}{2} - 10\right)^2 - 8x\left(\frac{x}{2} - 10\right).\]
Simplify this to
\[5x^2 + \frac{5}{4}x^2 - 50x + 500 - 4x^2 + 40x = -\frac{1}{4}x^2 + 500.\]
Take the derivative with respect to $x$:
\[-\frac{1}{2}x.\]
Setting this equal to zero gives $x = 0$. Substituting $x = 0$ into the expression $y = \frac{x}{2} - 10$ gives $y = -10$. So the minimum value occurs at $(x, y) = (0, -10)$.

Similarly, we can do this for the second expression:
\[5x^2+5\left(\frac{x}{2} + 10\right)^2 - 8x\left(\frac{x}{2} + 10\right).\]
Simplify this to
\[5x^2 + \frac{5}{4}x^2 + 50x + 500 - 4x^2 - 40x = \frac{1}{4}x^2 + 500.\]
Take the derivative with respect to $x$:
\[\frac{1}{2}x.\]
Setting this equal to zero gives $x = 0$. Substituting $x = 0$ into the expression $y = \frac{x}{2} + 10$ gives $y = 10$. So the minimum value also occurs at $(x, y) = (0, 10)$.

Finally, we substitute $(x, y) = (0, -10)$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to get
\[5(0)^2 + 5(-10)^2 - 8(0)(-10) = 500.\]
And we substitute $(x, y) = (0, 10)$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to get
\[5(0)^2 + 5(10)^2 - 8(0)(10) = 500.\]
In both cases, the minimum value is 500.

So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 500.
The answer is: $500$

Approach:



First, we rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $(5x^2-8xy+5y^2)$. This is a quadratic in $x$, which we can complete the square to get $(x-y)^2$. 

Next, we use the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. We can rewrite this as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$, and since absolute values are always non-negative, we can square the equation to get rid of the absolute values. We get $(x-2y)^2 + (2y-x)^2 = 40^2$.

Expanding the left hand side and simplifying gives $4(x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2) = 1600 \Rightarrow x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2 = 400$.

Now we have two equations: $(x-y)^2 = (x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2) = 400$. 

Since $(x-y)^2 \geq 0$, the minimum value of $(x-y)^2$ is 0, which happens when $x = y$. 

Substituting $x = y$ into the equation $x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2 = 400$, we get $x^2 - 4x^2 + 4x^2 = 400 \Rightarrow x^2 = 400 \Rightarrow x = \pm 20$.

But since we want the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x = y$, we should take the negative root $x = -20$.

Substituting $x = -20$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ gives $5(-20)^2 + 5(-20)^2 - 8(-20)(-20) = 2000$.

So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 2000. The answer is: $2000$
