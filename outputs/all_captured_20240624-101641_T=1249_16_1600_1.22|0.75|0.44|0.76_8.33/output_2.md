Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Approach:

 We can solve this problem by trying out different values of $m$ and checking if the equation has $4$ distinct solutions.

We first rewrite the equation as $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. For this to have $4$ distinct solutions, the right side must be between $0$ and $1$. So we have $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 1$, which gives $0 < m < 100$.

We can now try out different values of $m$ to see when the equation has $4$ distinct solutions.

For $m=1$, we have $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{1}{100}$, which simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \pm \frac{1}{100}$.

Solving $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{1}{100}$ gives $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{1}{100}$, and further solving gives $x-1 = 2 + \frac{1}{100}$ or $x-1 = -(2 + \frac{1}{100})$. The first equation gives $x = 3 + \frac{1}{100}$, and the second equation gives $x = -1 - \frac{1}{100}$. So we have two solutions for this case.

Solving $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{1}{100}$ gives $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{1}{100}$, and further solving gives $x-1 = 2 - \frac{1}{100}$ or $x-1 = -(2 - \frac{1}{100})$. The first equation gives $x = 3 - \frac{1}{100}$, and the second equation gives $x = -1 + \frac{1}{100}$. So we have two more solutions.

Therefore, for $m=1$, the equation has $4$ distinct solutions. We can check that this is also true for $m=2,3,...,99$. So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $99$.
The answer is: $99$

First, we note that the equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if the right-hand side is strictly between 0 and 3. In other words, we need $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 3$. This implies $0 < m < 300$.

Now, we need to count the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy $0 < m < 300$ are the integers from 1 to 299.

Therefore, the number of such positive integers $m$ is $299$.
The answer is: $299$

Approach:


To find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions, we need to consider the possible values of $m$ that make the right side of the equation equal to 0, 1, or 2.

The right side of the equation can be 0, 1, or 2, depending on the value of $m$. The value of $m$ must be such that $\frac{m}{100}$ equals to these values.

If $\frac{m}{100}=0$, then $m=0$. But $m$ must be a positive integer, so we discard this case.

If $\frac{m}{100}=1$, then $m=100$. This is a valid case.

If $\frac{m}{100}=2$, then $m=200$. This is also a valid case.

Therefore, the only positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition are $m=100$ and $m=200$. So, there are 2 such values of $m$.

The answer is: $2$

We are asked to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

This equation involves absolute values, so we first need to understand how absolute values work. The absolute value of a number is its distance from zero on the number line. So, $\vert x-1 \vert$ is the distance of $x$ from $1$ on the number line. Similarly, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is the distance of the distance of $x$ from $1$ from $2$ on the number line.

Now, we know that the absolute value of a number can be positive or negative. This means that $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ can be equal to a positive or negative value of $\frac{m}{100}$.

Let's denote $\vert x-1 \vert$ as $y$, so our equation becomes $\vert y - 2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$. This equation has four distinct solutions if and only if the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ is between $0$ and $2$. This is because the absolute value of a number is always non-negative, so $\vert y - 2 \vert$ can be at most $2$.

Therefore, $0 \leq \frac{m}{100} \leq 2$, which gives $0 \leq m \leq 200$.

So, the positive integers $m$ that satisfy the equation are $1, 2, 3, ..., 200$.

The number of such positive integers is $200$.

So, the answer is $\boxed{200}$.
The answer is $\boxed{200}$.

Approach:



The given equation has 4 distinct solutions, so the expression on the left-hand side, $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$, should have two breakpoints (values of $x$ where the expression inside the absolute value changes its sign) and two turning points (values of $x$ where the slope of the graph changes). This happens when $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, which gives $m = 200$.

Therefore, the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 200.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def count_solutions():
    m = 200
    return m

result = count_solutions()

Approach:


To find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions, we need to understand the properties of the equation.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ involves absolute values, which means that the expression inside the absolute value can be either positive or negative. We need to consider these two cases separately.

Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$
In this case, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. This means that $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 = -2 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Case 2: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$
In this case, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. This means that $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 = -2 + \frac{m}{100}$.

For each of these cases, we need to find the number of distinct solutions. We can do this by solving the equations and counting the number of distinct solutions.

After solving the equations and counting the number of distinct solutions for each case, we find that for $m=200$, the equation has $4$ distinct solutions. Therefore, the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $m=200$. The answer is: $\boxed{1}$

Approach:


The equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if $\frac{m}{100}=2$. Therefore, we need to solve the equation $| |x-1|-2|=2$.

Step 1: Solve the equation $|x-1|-2=2$.
This equation becomes $|x-1|=4$, which splits into two cases:
1) $x-1=4$ which gives $x=5$, and
2) $x-1=-4$ which gives $x=-3$.
So, the solutions for this case are $x=5$ and $x=-3$.

Step 2: Solve the equation $|x-1|-2=-2$.
This equation becomes $|x-1|=0$, which gives $x=1$.
So, the solution for this case is $x=1$.

The four distinct solutions are $x=-3$, $x=1$, and $x=5$. Therefore, $m=\frac{200}{100}=2$. The number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the equation is $1$.
The answer is: $1$

Approach:

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is less than 2 but greater than 0. Therefore, $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which implies $0 < m < 200$.

The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from 1 to 199.

To find how many such integers there are, we subtract the smallest integer from the largest integer and add 1. So, the number of positive integers $m$ is $199 - 1 + 1 = 199$.

So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 199.

The answer is: 199.

Approach:


To find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions, we need to analyze the equation. The right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, is a positive value that varies from $0$ to $\frac{1}{100}$ as $m$ ranges from $0$ to $1$.

The left side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, is a piecewise function that takes on values from $0$ to $3$. It is equal to $0$ when $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$, which gives two solutions $x = 3$ and $x = -1$. It is equal to $1$ when $\vert x-1 \vert = 3$, which gives two solutions $x = 4$ and $x = -2$. It is equal to $2$ when $\vert x-1 \vert = 1$, which gives two solutions $x = 2$ and $x = 0$. It is equal to $3$ when $\vert x-1 \vert = 0$, which gives one solution $x = 1$.

Therefore, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $2$. Solving for $m$ gives $m = 200$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $1$, and the answer is $1$. However, it seems that there was a misunderstanding in the problem statement. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions for infinitely many positive integers $m$. The problem statement asked for the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions, but it seems that the intended question was to find the value of $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions. The answer to that question is $200$.
The answer is $\boxed{1}$.

Approach:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is in the interval $(0, 2)$. This is because the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, changes its behavior twice in the interval $(1-2, 1+2) = ( -1, 3)$, and the absolute value of a quantity changes its behavior at the point where the quantity is equal to zero.

To find the value of $m$, we can multiply both sides of the inequality $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$ by 100 to get $0 < m < 200$. So $m$ must be an integer in the set $\{1, 2, ..., 199\}$.

We want to count the number of integers in this set. The answer is the number of positive integers from 1 to 199, which can be found by subtracting the smallest integer (1) from the largest integer (199) and then adding 1.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ is $199 - 1 + 1 = 199$.
The answer is: $199$

The equation $| |x-1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions, it means that the number $\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal to $2$ (from the graph of $y = ||x-1| - 2|$). So we have $\frac{m}{100} = 2$ and thus $m = 200$.

Therefore, the only positive integer $m$ that satisfies the equation is $200$.

So the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the equation is $1$.

The answer is: 1

Assistant:

Approach:

 We know that the absolute value equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. This equation can be rewritten as a piecewise function:
\[\begin{cases} \vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}, & \text{if } \vert x-1 \vert -2 \geq 0 \\ -\vert x-1 \vert +2 = \frac{m}{100}, & \text{if } \vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0 \end{cases}\]
Solving each case separately:

Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$. We can rewrite the left-hand side as $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, and then split into two subcases:
Subcase 1.1: $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, so $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.
Subcase 1.2: $-(x-1) = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, so $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Case 2: $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = \frac{m}{100}$. We can rewrite the left-hand side as $-\vert x-1 \vert = -\frac{m}{100} + 2$, and then split into two subcases:
Subcase 2.1: $-(x-1) = -\frac{m}{100} + 2$, so $x = 1 + \frac{m}{100} - 2 = \frac{m}{100} - 1$.
Subcase 2.2: $x-1 = -\frac{m}{100} + 2$, so $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Now, for the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ to have 4 distinct solutions, the following conditions must be satisfied:
1. The solutions from Subcase 1.1 and Subcase 2.1 must be distinct. This gives us $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq \frac{m}{100} - 1$, which simplifies to $3 \neq -1$, which is always true.
2. The solutions from Subcase 1.2 and Subcase 2.2 must be distinct. This gives us $-1 + \frac{m}{100} \neq 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $2 \neq 4$, which is also always true.
3. The solutions from Subcase 1.1 and Subcase 1.2 must be distinct from the solutions from Subcase 2.1 and Subcase 2.2. This gives us $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, and $-1 + \frac{m}{100} \neq \frac{m}{100} - 1$ and $-1 + \frac{m}{100} \neq 3 - \frac{m}{100}$. These conditions are all true.

Therefore, all four cases give distinct solutions. So the value of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is any positive integer.

However, the question asks for the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions. Since $m$ can be any positive integer, the number of positive integers $m$ is infinite.

But the question seems to be looking for a specific value of $m$. Let's go back to the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. The absolute value function $\vert \cdot \vert$ is always non-negative, so for the equation to have a solution, we must have $\frac{m}{100} \geq 0$, which implies $m \geq 0$. But $m$ is a positive integer, so the smallest possible value of $m$ is 1.

Let's consider the case when $m=1$. Substituting $m=1$ into the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{1}{100}$, we get $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=0.01$. The absolute value equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=0.01$ has 4 distinct solutions: $x \approx 0.99$, $x \approx 1.01$, $x \approx 2.99$, and $x \approx 3.01$.

Therefore, the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is $m=1$. So the answer is $\boxed{1}$.
The value of m for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is $m=1$. So the answer is 1. The answer is: $1$
