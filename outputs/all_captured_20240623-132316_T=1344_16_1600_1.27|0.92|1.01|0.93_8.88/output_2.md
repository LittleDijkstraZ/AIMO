Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions,
we need to consider the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ in the context of the graph of $y=\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$.

From the graph of $y=\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, we know that the equation has 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to the vertical distance between any two adjacent "humps" of the graph.

Looking at the graph, we see that the vertical distance between any two adjacent humps is 1. Therefore, we need $\frac{m}{100}=1$, which implies $m=100$.

So there is only one value of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions, namely $m=100$.
The value of the unknown variable $m$ is $100$. The answer is: $1$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.
First, we consider the case where $|x-1| - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$.
This simplifies to $|x-1| = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.
For this equation to have 4 distinct solutions, $2 + \frac{m}{100}$ must be positive.
Therefore, $2 + \frac{m}{100} > 0$, which gives $m > -200$.
However, since $m$ is a positive integer, the smallest possible value for $m$ is 1.
Now, we consider the case where $|x-1| - 2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.
This simplifies to $|x-1| = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
For this equation to have 2 distinct solutions, $2 - \frac{m}{100}$ must be positive.
Therefore, $2 - \frac{m}{100} > 0$, which gives $m < 200$.
The largest possible value for $m$ is 199.
So, the possible values for $m$ are the integers from 1 to 199.
There are 199 positive integers in this range.
Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 199. The answer is: $199$

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has $4$ distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $2$. This is because the expression on the left side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, can take on values from $0$ to $2$ and only for those values it has $4$ distinct solutions. Setting $\frac{m}{100}$ equal to $2$ gives us $m=200$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition is $1$, and the answer is $\boxed{1}$. The answer is $\boxed{1}$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



For the given equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] to have 4 distinct solutions, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be less than 2 but greater than 0. That is, $0< \frac{m}{100} < 2$.

Multiplying all sides by 100, we get $0 < m < 200$.

The positive integers that satisfy this inequality are 1, 2, ..., 199. There are 199 positive integers. However, the value $m=0$ should not be included because it would make the right-hand side zero, and hence, the equation would not have 4 distinct solutions.

Thus, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 198.
The answer is: $198$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. This implies that the value $\frac{m}{100}$ is a value that splits the four solution into two cases with two solutions each.

The expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is equal to 0 when $\vert x-1 \vert=2$, which implies that $x=3$ or $x=-1$. Thus, the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ should be a value that is strictly between the values of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ for $x=3$ and $x=-1$. 

When $x=3$, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\vert \vert 3-1 \vert -2 \vert=\vert 2-2 \vert=0$.

When $x=-1$, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\vert \vert -1-1 \vert -2 \vert=\vert -2-2 \vert=4$.

So, the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ should be strictly between 0 and 4. The only value that satisfies this condition is 2.

Therefore, the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is $m=200$. The answer is: 1
The value of $m$ is $200$.
The answer is: $200$

Step-by-step Solution:


For the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ to have $4$ distinct solutions, the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be less than $2$ but greater than $0$. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ oscillates between $0$ and $4$, and the equation will have four distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is in the range $(0, 2)$. 

Multiplying both sides of these inequalities by $100$ gives $0 < m < 200$.

The number of positive integers in the range $(0, 200)$ is $199$.
Therefore, there are $199$ positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. The answer is: $199$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To have 4 distinct solutions, the equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ must have one solution less than 1 and one solution greater than 1, and two solutions between 1-2 and 1+2. This is because $|x-1|-2$ will change its sign at $x=1$, thus the equation has three different forms to solve based on the value of $x$. 

When $x<1$, $|x-1|=-(x-1)=1-x$. So the equation becomes $|1-x-2|=\frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $|-x-1|=\frac{m}{100}$. 
This is equal to $x+1=\frac{m}{100}$ or $x+1=-\frac{m}{100}$. Solving for $x$ gives $x=\frac{m}{100}-1$ or $x=-\frac{m}{100}-1$. 
We need $x<1$ for this case, so $-\frac{m}{100}-1<1$, which simplifies to $-\frac{m}{100}<2$. Therefore, $m>200$.

When $1\le x<3$, $|x-1|-2=\frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x-1-2=\frac{m}{100}$, or $x-3=\frac{m}{100}$. Solving for $x$ gives $x=\frac{m}{100}+3$. 
We need $1\le x<3$ for this case, so $1\le \frac{m}{100}+3<3$. This simplifies to $-2\le \frac{m}{100}\le 0$, or $0\le m \le 200$.

When $x\ge 3$, $|x-1|-2=\frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x-1-2=\frac{m}{100}$, or $x-3=\frac{m}{100}$. Solving for $x$ gives $x=\frac{m}{100}+3$. 
We need $x\ge 3$ for this case, so $\frac{m}{100}+3\ge 3$, which gives $\frac{m}{100}\ge 0$. Therefore, $m\ge 0$.

Combining all the conditions, we need $0\le m\le 200$ and $m>200$. But these two intervals have no intersection. However, we realize that the second condition is actually unnecessary, because the solution $x=\frac{m}{100}-1$ will never be greater than or equal to 1, so the value of $m$ does not have to satisfy $m>200$.

Therefore, the only condition for $m$ is $0\le m\le 200$, and $m$ must be an integer. Thus, there are 201 positive integers $m$ that make the equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ have 4 distinct solutions.
The answer is: 201

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

First, let's analyze the equation inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2=\frac{m}{100}$.

If we set $\frac{m}{100} = k$, then we have $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = k$. We can rewrite this as $\vert x-1 \vert = k + 2$.

Now, we split into two cases:

Case 1: If $x \ge 1$, then $x - 1 \ge 0$ and we have $x - 1 = k + 2$. Solving this gives $x = k + 3$.

Case 2: If $x < 1$, then $x - 1 < 0$ and we have $-(x - 1) = k + 2$, which simplifies to $x = 1 - k - 2 = -k - 1$.

So we have two solutions in terms of $k$: $x = k + 3$ for $x \ge 1$ and $x = -k - 1$ for $x < 1$.

To get 4 distinct solutions, we need the two cases to intersect, which means we need to find the values of $k$ such that $k + 3 = -k - 1$. Solving this gives $2k = -4$, so $k = -2$.

However, $k = -2$ doesn't make sense in the context of the problem because $k$ is positive (as it's $\frac{m}{100}$). So we must have made an error somewhere.

Going back to the original equation, we see that if $\frac{m}{100} > 2$, then the right side of the equation will be larger than the right side of the equation, which would give a contradiction.

This means that we must have $0 < \frac{m}{100} \le 2$. Multiplying through by $100$ gives $0 < m \le 200$.

So, the positive integers $m$ that work are $1, 2, 3, \ldots, 200$. The number of such positive integers is $200$. However, we must subtract the cases where we only get $3$ distinct solutions instead of $4$.

The cases where we only get $3$ distinct solutions occur when the two cases $x = k + 3$ and $x = -k - 1$ intersect at exactly one point. This happens when $k + 3 = -k - 1$ and $k + 3 > 1$ (ensuring that $x = k + 3$ is defined), or equivalently when $2k = -4$ and $k < 2$. The only solution to $2k = -4$ is $k = -2$, but we have already ruled out negative values of $k$ in the problem statement.

Thus, there are no cases where we only get $3$ distinct solutions.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that make the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have $4$ distinct solutions is $200$.
The answer is: 200

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To start solving the problem, let's understand the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.

The right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, represents a positive quantity since we are asked for the number of positive integers $m$.

The left side of the equation is a piecewise function. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ is between $1$ and $2$ (inclusive). This is because for those values of $\frac{m}{100}$, the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ can take on $4$ distinct values.

Therefore, we need to find the value of $m$ such that $\frac{m}{100}$ is between $1$ and $2$.

Multiplying both sides of the inequalities $1 \leq \frac{m}{100} \leq 2$ by $100$, we get $100 \leq m \leq 200$.

However, we are asked for the number of positive integers $m$, so we are looking for the number of integers from $100$ to $200$, inclusive.

To find the number of integers in this range, subtract the smallest integer from the largest and then add $1$.

This gives us $200 - 100 + 1 = 101$.

So there are $101$ positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.
The answer is: $101$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.
We know that the number of solutions to an equation with absolute values is determined by the number of times it intersects the horizontal axis in a graph. So in this case, we want to find how many values of $\frac{m}{100}$ will intersect the graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ 4 times.
The graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a "hockey stick" shape with the "sticks" at $y=2$ and $y=-2$. The "stick" at $y=2$ intersects the x-axis at $x=3$ and the "stick" at $y=-2$ intersects the x-axis at $x=-1$.
So the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is between $0$ and $2$, or when $\frac{m}{100}$ is between $-2$ and $0$.
This means $0<\frac{m}{100}<2$ or $-2<\frac{m}{100}<0$.
For the first inequality, $0<\frac{m}{100}<2$, we can multiply all sides by 100 to get $0<m<200$.
For the second inequality, $-2<\frac{m}{100}<0$, we can multiply all sides by 100 to get $-200<m<0$.
But $m$ is a positive integer, so we only consider the first inequality $0<m<200$. The number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality is the number of positive integers from 1 to 199, which is 199.
So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 199.
The answer is: $199$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To make the equation easier to work with, we can first consider the expression $|x-1| - 2$. The equation has 4 distinct solutions if and only if the equation $|x-1| - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$ has two values of $x$ that make $|x-1| - 2 > 0$ and another two values that make $|x-1| - 2 < 0$. This is because the absolute value function $|x|$ is positive for all $x \neq 0$.

Now, let's solve the equation $|x-1| - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$:

1) $|x-1| - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$, which implies $|x-1| = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.

2) If $2 + \frac{m}{100} > 0$, we have $|x-1| = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which has two solutions: $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x-1 = -(2 + \frac{m}{100})$.
Solving for $x$ in each equation, we get: $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

3) If $2 + \frac{m}{100} < 0$, then $|x-1| = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ has no solutions because the absolute value function is always nonnegative.

4) If $2 + \frac{m}{100} = 0$, then $\frac{m}{100} = -2$, which implies $m = -200$. However, $m$ must be a positive integer, so this case is not possible.

So, the equation has two solutions when $2 + \frac{m}{100} > 0$, which implies $\frac{m}{100} > -2$. This means $m > -200$, but since $m$ must be a positive integer, the smallest possible value of $m$ is 1.

Also, the equation has no solutions when $2 + \frac{m}{100} < 0$, which implies $\frac{m}{100} < -2$. This means $m < -200$, but there are no positive integers less than -200.

Therefore, the equation has 4 distinct solutions when $2 + \frac{m}{100} > 0$ and $2 + \frac{m}{100} < 0$ simultaneously. This occurs when $1 < 2 + \frac{m}{100} < 2$. The only integer that satisfies this inequality is $m = 100$.

So, there is only 1 positive integer $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions. The answer is: $\boxed{1}$.
