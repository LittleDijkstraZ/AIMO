Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we notice that the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ can be rewritten as $\frac{1}{2}((5x-4y)^2+(4y-5x)^2)$.

Next, we observe the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.

This can be rewritten as $|(x-2y)| + |(2x-y)| = 40$.

We can rewrite this as $|(5x-4y)| + |(4y-5x)| = 40$.

Now we notice that both terms inside the absolute value signs are the same but with opposite signs. So, we can rewrite this as $|(5x-4y) - (4y-5x)| = 40$, which simplifies to $|10x - 8y| = 40$.

We can rewrite this as $10|x - \frac{4}{5}y| = 40$, which simplifies to $|x - \frac{4}{5}y| = 4$.

This means that the distance between the points $(x, y)$ and $(\frac{4}{5}y, y)$ is always 4.

Now, we know that the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ occurs when $x = \frac{4}{5}y$, because the expression is minimized when the points $(x, y)$ and $(\frac{4}{5}y, y)$ coincide.

Substituting $x = \frac{4}{5}y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get $5(\frac{4}{5}y)^2+5y^2-8(\frac{4}{5}y)(y) = \frac{32}{5}y^2 + 5y^2 - \frac{32}{5}y^2 = 5y^2$.

So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is achieved when $y = \pm \frac{5}{4}$, and the minimum value is $5(\pm \frac{5}{4})^2 = \frac{125}{16}$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\frac{125}{16}$.
The answer is: $\boxed{\frac{125}{16}}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, let's simplify the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
Using the property $|a| = |-a|$, we can rewrite the equation as $|x-2y| + |2x-y| = 40$.
Then, by the property of absolute value, we have two cases:

Case 1: If $x - 2y \geq 0$ and $2x - y \geq 0$, then $x - 2y + 2x - y = 40$, which simplifies to $3x - 3y = 40$, or $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$.

Case 2: If $x - 2y < 0$ and $2x - y < 0$, then $-(x - 2y) - (2x - y) = 40$, which simplifies to $-3x + 3y = 40$, or $x - y = -\frac{40}{3}$.

However, these two cases cannot hold simultaneously, because if $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$, then $2x - 2y = 2(x - y) = 2(\frac{40}{3}) = \frac{80}{3}$, which would make $2x - y \geq 0$ in Case 1, contradicting our assumption in Case 1. The same argument applies to Case 2.

Therefore, we conclude that the only possibility is that $x - y = -\frac{40}{3}$.
Substituting $y = x + \frac{40}{3}$ into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$, we have
\begin{align*}
5x^2 + 5(x + \frac{40}{3})^2 - 8x(x + \frac{40}{3}) &= 5x^2 + 5(x^2 + 2 \cdot x \cdot \frac{40}{3} + (\frac{40}{3})^2) - 8x^2 - 32x\frac{40}{3} \\
&= 5x^2 + 5x^2 + \frac{400}{3}x + \frac{800}{9} - 8x^2 - \frac{1280}{3}x \\
&= -3x^2 - \frac{880}{3}x + \frac{800}{9}.
\end{align*}
Now, we complete the square for $-3x^2 - \frac{880}{3}x$ as follows:
\begin{align*}
-3x^2 - \frac{880}{3}x &= -3(x^2 + \frac{880}{9}x) \\
&= -3\left(x^2 + \frac{880}{9}x + \left(\frac{440}{9}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{440}{9}\right)^2\right) \\
&= -3\left(\left(x + \frac{440}{9}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{440}{9}\right)^2\right) \\
&= -3\left(x + \frac{440}{9}\right)^2 + 3\left(\frac{440}{9}\right)^2.
\end{align*}
Thus, the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ simplifies to $-3\left(x + \frac{440}{9}\right)^2 + 3\left(\frac{440}{9}\right)^2 + \frac{800}{9}$.

The minimum value of $-3\left(x + \frac{440}{9}\right)^2$ is $0$, attained when $x = -\frac{440}{9}$. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is $3\left(\frac{440}{9}\right)^2 + \frac{800}{9} = \frac{58400}{9} + \frac{800}{9} = \frac{59200}{9}$.
The answer is: $\boxed{\frac{59200}{9}}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, let's analyze the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
This equation splits into two cases:

Case 1: $x-2y \geq 0$ and $y-2x \geq 0$.
Then the equation becomes $x-2y + y-2x = 40$, which simplifies to $-x-y = 40$.
This contradicts the initial conditions ($x-2y \geq 0$ and $y-2x \geq 0$).

Case 2: $x-2y < 0$ and $y-2x < 0$.
Then the equation becomes $-(x-2y) - (y-2x) = 40$, which simplifies to $3x - 3y = 40$.
Dividing both sides by 3 gives $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$.

Now, let's substitute $x = y + \frac{40}{3}$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.
Substituting $x = y + \frac{40}{3}$ gives $5(y + \frac{40}{3})^2 + 5y^2 - 8y(y + \frac{40}{3})$.
Expanding this gives $5\left(y^2 + \frac{80y}{3} + \frac{1600}{9}\right) + 5y^2 - 8y^2 - \frac{320y}{3}$.
Combining like terms gives $5y^2 + \frac{400y}{3} + \frac{8000}{9} + 5y^2 - 8y^2 - \frac{320y}{3}$.
Simplifying gives $-3y^2 + \frac{80y}{3} + \frac{8000}{9}$.

Now we need to find the minimum value of this expression.
To do this, we can complete the square:
$-3(y^2 - \frac{80y}{9}) + \frac{8000}{9}$.
Completing the square in $y^2 - \frac{80y}{9}$ gives $-3\left(y - \frac{40}{9}\right)^2 + \frac{1600}{9}$.
So our expression is now $-3\left(y - \frac{40}{9}\right)^2 + \frac{8000}{9}$.

The expression $-3\left(y - \frac{40}{9}\right)^2 + \frac{8000}{9}$ is minimized when $\left(y - \frac{40}{9}\right)^2$ is maximized, which happens when $y = \frac{40}{9}$.

Substituting $y = \frac{40}{9}$ into the equation $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$ gives $x = y + \frac{40}{3} = \frac{40}{9} + \frac{40}{3} = \frac{80}{9}$.

So the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ occurs at $x = \frac{80}{9}$ and $y = \frac{40}{9}$.

Substituting these values into the expression gives $5\left(\frac{80}{9}\right)^2 + 5\left(\frac{40}{9}\right)^2 - 8\left(\frac{80}{9}\right)\left(\frac{40}{9}\right) = \frac{3200}{9}$.

Therefore, the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ satisfy the given conditions is $\frac{3200}{9}$.
The answer is: $3200/9$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



Firstly, we recognize that $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = (x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2$. We are given the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.

Now, let's try to express the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ in a way that involves $|x-2y| + |y-2x|$. By the triangle inequality, we know that $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$ for all real numbers $a$ and $b$. Therefore, we can write $|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |(x-2y) + (y-2x)| = |-x + y| = |y-x|$. Since $|y-x| = |x-y|$, we have $|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |y-x|$. Given the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we can equate $|y-x|$ to 40.

Now, we need to find the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the condition $|y-x| = 40$. Since $|y-x| = 40$, we know that $y-x = \pm 40$. Without loss of generality, let's assume $y-x = 40$. Then, we can solve for $x$ in terms of $y$: $x = y - 40$. Substituting this into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get
$$5(y - 40)^2 + 5y^2 - 8(y - 40)y = 5(y^2 - 80y + 1600) + 5y^2 - 8y^2 + 320y = 10y^2 - 400y + 8000.$$
To find the minimum value of this expression, we can take the derivative and set it equal to zero: $20y - 400 = 0$, which gives $y = 20$. Substituting this back into the expression for $x$, we get $x = 20 - 40 = -20$.

Now, we substitute these values of $x$ and $y$ back into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to find the minimum value:
$$5(-20)^2 + 5(20)^2 - 8(-20)(20) = 2000 + 2000 + 3200 = 7200.$$

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 7200. The answer is: $7200$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's rewrite the condition as $|2y - x| + |2x - y| = 40$. We know that for any $a$ and $b$, $|a - b| = |b - a|$, so we can rewrite the condition as $|2y - x| + |x - 2y| = 40$.
This simplifies to $2|2y - x| = 40$, so $|2y - x| = 20$.
This means $2y - x = 20$ or $2y - x = -20$.

Case 1: $2y - x = 20$. Solving for $x$, we get $x = 2y - 20$.

Substituting $x = 2y - 20$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get
\begin{align*}
5(2y - 20)^2 + 5y^2 - 8(2y - 20)y &= 5(4y^2 - 80y + 400) + 5y^2 - 16y^2 + 160y \\
&= 20y^2 - 400y + 2000 + 5y^2 - 16y^2 + 160y \\
&= -11y^2 - 240y + 2000.
\end{align*}

Let $f(y) = -11y^2 - 240y + 2000$. We want to find the minimum of $f(y)$.
Taking the derivative of $f(y)$ with respect to $y$, we get $f'(y) = -22y - 240$.
Setting $f'(y)$ equal to zero, we get $-22y - 240 = 0$, which gives $y = -\frac{240}{22} = -\frac{120}{11}$.

Substituting $y = -\frac{120}{11}$ back into the equation $x = 2y - 20$, we get
\[x = 2 \left(-\frac{120}{11}\right) - 20 = -\frac{240}{11} - \frac{220}{11} = -\frac{460}{11}.\]

So one possible pair of $(x, y)$ is $\left(-\frac{460}{11}, -\frac{120}{11}\right)$.

Substituting $x = -\frac{460}{11}$ and $y = -\frac{120}{11}$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get
\begin{align*}
5 \left(-\frac{460}{11}\right)^2 + 5 \left(-\frac{120}{11}\right)^2 - 8 \left(-\frac{460}{11}\right) \left(-\frac{120}{11}\right) &= 5 \cdot \frac{211600}{121} + 5 \cdot \frac{14400}{121} + \frac{368000}{121} \\
&= \frac{1058000}{121} + \frac{72000}{121} + \frac{368000}{121} \\
&= \frac{1498000}{121} \\
&= 12371.\overline{267605633802816901408450704225352112676056338028169...}.
\end{align*}

Case 2: $2y - x = -20$. Solving for $x$, we get $x = 2y + 20$.

Substituting $x = 2y + 20$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get
\begin{align*}
5(2y + 20)^2 + 5y^2 - 8(2y + 20)y &= 5(4y^2 + 80y + 400) + 5y^2 - 16y^2 - 160y \\
&= 20y^2 + 400y + 2000 + 5y^2 - 16y^2 - 160y \\
&= -11y^2 + 240y + 2000.
\end{align*}

Let $g(y) = -11y^2 + 240y + 2000$. We want to find the minimum of $g(y)$.
Taking the derivative of $g(y)$ with respect to $y$, we get $g'(y) = -22y + 240$.
Setting $g'(y)$ equal to zero, we get $-22y + 240 = 0$, which gives $y = \frac{240}{22} = \frac{120}{11}$.

Substituting $y = \frac{120}{11}$ back into the equation $x = 2y + 20$, we get
\[x = 2 \left(\frac{120}{11}\right) + 20 = \frac{240}{11} + \frac{220}{11} = \frac{460}{11}.\]

So another possible pair of $(x, y)$ is $\left(\frac{460}{11}, \frac{120}{11}\right)$.

Substituting $x = \frac{460}{11}$ and $y = \frac{120}{11}$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get
\begin{align*}
5 \left(\frac{460}{11}\right)^2 + 5 \left(\frac{120}{11}\right)^2 - 8 \left(\frac{460}{11}\right) \left(\frac{120}{11}\right) &= 5 \cdot \frac{211600}{121} + 5 \cdot \frac{14400}{121} - \frac{436800}{121} \\
&= \frac{1058000}{121} + \frac{72000}{121} - \frac{436800}{121} \\
&= \frac{689200}{121}

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We can rewrite the given equation as $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, we have $|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |(x-2y) + (y-2x)| = |x-2y+y-2x| = |-x-y| = |-(x+y)| = |x+y|$.
So, $|x+y| = 40$.
Now, let's express the given expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ in terms of $x+y$ and $x-2y$.
We have
\[5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = \frac{1}{2} [(5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy) + (5x^2 + 5y^2 + 8xy)]\]
\[= \frac{1}{2} [(5x^2 + 5y^2) + (5x^2 + 5y^2)] = \frac{1}{2} [10x^2 + 10y^2] = 5(x^2 + y^2).\]
Now, we express $x^2 + y^2$ in terms of $x+y$ and $x-2y$.
From $x+y = 40$, we get $y = 40 - x$. Substituting this into $x-2y$, we get
\[x - 2y = x - 2(40 - x) = x - 80 + 2x = 3x - 80.\]
So, $x-2y = 3x - 80$. Then, $2y = -2x + 80$, and $y = -x + 40$.
Now, we can express $x^2 + y^2$ in terms of $x$ only:
\[x^2 + y^2 = x^2 + (-x + 40)^2 = x^2 + (x^2 - 80x + 1600) = 2x^2 - 80x + 1600.\]
Now, we substitute this into $5(x^2 + y^2)$ to get
\[5(x^2 + y^2) = 5(2x^2 - 80x + 1600) = 10x^2 - 400x + 8000.\]
To find the minimum value of this expression, we can use calculus.
Taking the derivative of $10x^2 - 400x + 8000$ with respect to $x$, we get
\[\frac{d}{dx} (10x^2 - 400x + 8000) = 20x - 400.\]
Setting this equal to zero to find the critical points, we have
\[20x - 400 = 0 \implies 20x = 400 \implies x = 20.\]
Then, $y = 40 - x = 40 - 20 = 20$.
Substituting these values back into $5(x^2 + y^2)$, we get
\[5(x^2 + y^2) = 5(20^2 + 20^2) = 5(800) = 4000.\]
Thus, the minimum value of the given expression is $4000$.
The answer is: $4000$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To begin with, let's denote $A = x - 2y$ and $B = y - 2x$. We have the equation $|A| + |B| = 40$. By the triangle inequality, we know that $|A| + |B| \geq |A + B|$, so $|A + B| \leq 40$. 

On the other hand, $A + B = x - 2y + y - 2x = -x - y$, so $|A + B| = |-x - y| = |-(x + y)| = |x + y|$. Therefore, we have $|x + y| \leq 40$.

Now let's look at the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite this as $\frac{1}{2}(5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy) = \frac{1}{2}[(5x^2 - 8xy + 5y^2) + 3(x^2 + y^2)] = \frac{1}{2}[(5x - 4y)^2 + 3(x^2 + y^2)]$.

By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we know that $(a^2 + b^2)(c^2 + d^2) \geq (ac + bd)^2$ for any real numbers $a, b, c, d$. Taking $a = 5x - 4y$, $b = \sqrt{3}(x + y)$, $c = \sqrt{3}(x - y)$, and $d = 5x - 4y$, we have $((5x - 4y)^2 + 3(x^2 + y^2))((5^2 + (-4)^2)((\sqrt{3})^2 + 1^2)) \geq ((5x - 4y)\sqrt{3}(x - y) + \sqrt{3}(x + y)(5x - 4y))^2 = 0$. Thus we have $(5x - 4y)^2 + 3(x^2 + y^2) \geq 0$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0. However, we still need to ensure that the conditions $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$ and $|x + y| \leq 40$ are both satisfied. 

Let's substitute $x = 2y$ into $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$, we get $0 + |y - 4y| = 40 \Rightarrow |-3y| = 40 \Rightarrow 3|y| = 40 \Rightarrow |y| = \frac{40}{3}$, which is true because $\left|\frac{40}{3}\right| = \frac{40}{3}$ and $3\left(\frac{40}{3}\right) = 40$.

Similarly, substitute $x = 2y$ into $|x + y| \leq 40$, we get $3|y| \leq 40 \Rightarrow |y| \leq \frac{40}{3}$, which is also true.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is indeed 0. The answer is: $0$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



To solve this problem, we first need to find a relation between $x$ and $y$ from the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. 

Let's rewrite $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$.

We know that $|a-b| + |b-a| = 2|a-b|$. So, we can simplify the equation to $2|2y-x| = 40$, which gives $|2y-x| = 20$.

Now, we know that $|2y-x|$ represents the distance between the points $x$ and $2y$ on the number line. So, the distance between $x$ and $2y$ is $20$. This gives two possibilities: either $x=2y+20$ or $x=2y-20$.

Now, we substitute these possibilities into the original expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ and simplify.

Case 1: If $x=2y+20$, substituting this into $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ gives:
\[5(2y+20)^2+5y^2-8y(2y+20) = 20y^2+200y+2000+5y^2-16y^2-160y = -y^2+40y+2000.\]

Case 2: If $x=2y-20$, substituting this into $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ gives:
\[5(2y-20)^2+5y^2-8y(2y-20) = 20y^2-200y+2000+5y^2-16y^2+160y = -y^2-40y+2000.\]

Since both cases give the same form of expression $-y^2+40y+2000$, we can find the minimum value of this expression by taking the derivative with respect to $y$ and setting it to zero:
\[-2y+40=0 \Rightarrow y=20.\]
Substituting $y=20$ into the expression, we get:
\[-y^2+40y+2000 = -(20)^2+40*20+2000 = -400+800+2000 = 2400.\]
So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the given condition is $2400$.
The answer is: $\boxed{2400}$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, we notice that the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ can be rewritten as $(5x^2 - 8xy + 5y^2)$ which is in the form of $(a - 2ab + b^2)$ where $a=5x$ and $b=5y$. Therefore, we can rewrite it as $(5x - 5y)^2$.

Similarly, the given condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|x - 2y| + |2y - x| = 40$, which simplifies to $2|x - 2y| = 40$ and further simplifies to $|x - 2y| = 20$.

Now, let's introduce a new variable $z = x - 2y$. Then, we have $|z| = 20$. This means that $z = 20$ or $z = -20$.

If $z = 20$, then $x - 2y = 20$ and $y - 2x = -20$. Solving these equations simultaneously, we get $x = 20$ and $y = 0$.

If $z = -20$, then $x - 2y = -20$ and $y - 2x = 20$. Solving these equations simultaneously, we get $x = 0$ and $y = -10$.

Now, we substitute $x = 20$ and $y = 0$ into the expression $(5x - 5y)^2$ to get $(5*20 - 5*0)^2 = (100)^2 = 10000$.

Similarly, substituting $x = 0$ and $y = -10$ into the expression $(5x - 5y)^2$, we get $(5*0 - 5*(-10))^2 = (50)^2 = 2500$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $2500$.
The answer is: $2500$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, notice that $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = \frac{1}{2}((5x-4y)^2 + (4x-5y)^2)$. 

Given $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we can use the property of absolute value $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$ to simplify the equation. We have $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |x-2y| + |-(x-2y)| = 2|x-2y| = 40$, which implies $|x-2y| = 20$.

Now, we know that $|x-2y| = 20$, so $(x-2y)^2 = 400$. Expanding this out gives $x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2 = 400$.

Now, we want to minimize $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, which is equal to $\frac{1}{2}((5x-4y)^2 + (4x-5y)^2)$. Using the equation $x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2 = 400$, we can substitute $x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2$ with $400$, giving us the expression to minimize as $\frac{1}{2}((5x-4y)^2 + (4x-5y)^2) = \frac{1}{2}(5x-4y)^2 + \frac{1}{2}(4x-5y)^2$.

Since the square of a real number is always non-negative, $(5x-4y)^2$ and $(4x-5y)^2$ are both non-negative. Hence, the sum of them is non-negative, i.e., $\frac{1}{2}(5x-4y)^2 + \frac{1}{2}(4x-5y)^2 \geq 0$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0. The minimum value of the given function is achieved when $5x-4y = 0$ and $4x-5y = 0$, which gives $x = \frac{20}{3}$ and $y = \frac{20}{3}$.

Substituting $x = \frac{20}{3}$ and $y = \frac{20}{3}$ back into the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we can verify that these values satisfy the given condition. 

So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0, when $x = \frac{20}{3}$ and $y = \frac{20}{3}$. The answer is: $0$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We first note that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is equivalent to $|x-2y| = |2x-y|$.
By the property of absolute value, we know that $|a| = |b|$ is equivalent to $a = b$ or $a = -b$.
So we have two cases to consider:
Case 1: $x - 2y = 2x - y$, which gives $x = y$.
Substituting into the absolute value equation, we have $|x-2x| + |x-2x| = |-x| + |-x| = 2|x| = 40$. So $|x| = 20$, which means $x = 20$ or $x = -20$.
Case 2: $x - 2y = -(2x - y)$, which gives $x - 2y = -2x + y$, or $3x = 3y$, so $x = y$.
Again, substituting into the absolute value equation, we have $|x-2x| + |x-2x| = |-x| + |-x| = 2|x| = 40$, so $|x| = 20$, and $x = 20$ or $x = -20$.
Now we substitute $x = y$ into $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, which becomes $5x^2 + 5x^2 - 8x^2 = 2x^2$.
Since $x = 20$ or $x = -20$, we substitute these values into $2x^2$:
If $x = 20$, then $2x^2 = 2(20^2) = 800$.
If $x = -20$, then $2x^2 = 2(-20^2) = 800$.
So in both cases, $2x^2 = 800$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $800$.
The answer is: $800$

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, we can rewrite the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$.

By the triangle inequality, $|a| + |b| \ge |a+b|$, we have $|2y-x| + |2x-y| \ge |(2y-x) + (2x-y)| = |y| = y$ when $y \ge 0$, and $|2y-x| + |2x-y| \ge |- (2y-x) - (2x-y)| = |-3(x-y)| = 3|x-y| = 3(x-y)$ when $y < 0$.

So, we have $y \ge 0$ or $3(x-y) = 40$. If $y \ge 0$, then $y = 40$, and we can substitute this into the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ to get $|x-80| + |80-2x| = 40$. This simplifies to $|x-80| + |80-2x| = 40$.

If $x \le 40$, then $|x-80| = 80-x$ and $|80-2x| = 80-2x$, so the equation becomes $80-x + 80-2x = 40$, which simplifies to $3x = 120$, and $x = 40$. But this contradicts our assumption that $x \le 40$.

If $x \ge 40$, then $|x-80| = x-80$ and $|80-2x| = 2x-80$, so the equation becomes $x-80 + 2x-80 = 40$, which simplifies to $3x = 200$, and $x = \frac{200}{3}$. But this also contradicts our assumption that $x \ge 40$.

So, we must have $3(x-y) = 40$, which gives $y = \frac{x}{3} - \frac{40}{3}$. Substituting this into the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ gives $|x - 2(\frac{x}{3} - \frac{40}{3})| + |(\frac{x}{3} - \frac{40}{3}) - 2x| = 40$. This simplifies to $|x - \frac{2x}{3} + \frac{80}{3}| + |\frac{x}{3} - \frac{40}{3} - 2x| = 40$.

Simplifying further, we have $|\frac{x}{3} + \frac{80}{3}| + |-\frac{5x}{3} - \frac{40}{3}| = 40$. This gives $\frac{x}{3} + \frac{80}{3} = 40$ or $-\frac{5x}{3} - \frac{40}{3} = 40$.

From the first equation, we get $\frac{x}{3} = - \frac{40}{3}$, so $x = -40$. Substituting this into $y = \frac{x}{3} - \frac{40}{3}$ gives $y = - \frac{80}{3}$. But this makes $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ false, so we discard this solution.

From the second equation, we get $-\frac{5x}{3} = 80$, so $x = -\frac{240}{5} = -48$. Substituting this into $y = \frac{x}{3} - \frac{40}{3}$ gives $y = - \frac{88}{5}$.

Now, we substitute $x = -48$ and $y = - \frac{88}{5}$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to get $5(-48)^2 + 5(- \frac{88}{5})^2 - 8(-48)(- \frac{88}{5}) = 1152$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 1152.
The answer is: $1152$

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



We are given the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ and we want to find the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.

First, let's simplify the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. We can rewrite $|x-2y|$ as $|2y-x|$ and $|y-2x|$ as $|2x-y|$, so the equation becomes $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$.

Now, let's use the property $|a| + |b| = |a+b| + |a-b|$ to simplify further. We have $|2y-x+2x-y| + |(2y-x)-(2x-y)| = 40$, which simplifies to $|y+x| + |y-x| = 40$.

Since $|a+b| = |a-(-b)|$, we can rewrite this as $|x+y| + |-x+y| = 40$. Applying the property again, we have $|2y| + |-2x| = 40$, which simplifies to $|2y| + |2x| = 40$ or $2|y| + 2|x| = 40$.

Dividing both sides by 2 gives $|y| + |x| = 20$. This equation represents a set of points $(x, y)$ in the coordinate plane such that the sum of their absolute values is a constant, which is a diamond-shaped region in the coordinate plane.

Now, we want to find the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ within this diamond-shaped region. 

Let's consider the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = \frac{1}{2}[(5x^2 - 8xy + 5y^2) + (5x^2 + 8xy + 5y^2)] - 10xy = \frac{1}{2}[(5x^2 - 8xy + 5y^2) + (x+y)^2] - 10xy$.

We know that $(x+y)^2 \ge 0$, so the minimum value of the expression is achieved when $10xy$ is maximized.

From the equation $|y| + |x| = 20$, we can see that the maximum value of $xy$ occurs when $x$ and $y$ are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign, i.e., $x = -y$. Substituting $y = -x$ into the equation $|y| + |x| = 20$, we get $2|x| = 20$, so $|x| = 10$ and $x = \pm 10$.

When $x = 10$ and $y = -10$, we have $xy = -100$, and the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\frac{1}{2}[(5*10^2 - 8*(-100) + 5*(-10)^2) + (10+(-10))^2] - 10*(-100) = \frac{1}{2}(500+800+500+0)-(-1000) = \frac{1}{2}(1800)+1000 = 900 + 1000 = 1900$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 1900. The answer is: $1900$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To solve this problem, we can use the identity $a^2 - 2ab + b^2 = (a - b)^2$. 
Let's first rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as follows:
$$5x^2+5y^2-8xy = \frac{5}{2}(2x)^2 + \frac{5}{2}(2y)^2 - 8xy = \frac{5}{2} [(2x)^2 - 4xy + (2y)^2] + \frac{5}{2} [(2y)^2 - 4xy + (2x)^2] = \frac{5}{2} [(2x-2y)^2 + (2y-2x)^2].$$
We know that $|a-b| = |b-a|$, so $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |x-2y| + |2y-x| = |2x-2y| + |2y-x| = |2(x-y) + (y-x)| = |x-y|$. Thus, $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is equivalent to $|x-y| = 40$. 
Now, we know that $(x-y)^2 \geq 0$, so $(x-y)^2 = 40^2 = 1600$. Thus, the minimum value of $\frac{5}{2} [(2x-2y)^2 + (2y-2x)^2]$ is $\frac{5}{2} \cdot 0 = 0$. This occurs when $(2x-2y)^2 = 0$ and $(2y-2x)^2 = 0$, which is equivalent to $x=y$. However, this is not consistent with the condition $|x-y| = 40$. So, we need to find the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ are related by the equation $x-y = 20$ or $y-x = 20$. 

1) If $x-y = 20$, then $y = x - 20$. Substituting this into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get
$$5x^2+5(x-20)^2-8x(x-20) = 5x^2+5(x^2-40x+400)-8x^2+160x = -3x^2+200x+2000.$$
To minimize this expression, we can find its derivative and set it equal to 0:
$$-6x + 200 = 0 \Rightarrow x = \frac{200}{6} = \frac{100}{3}.$$
Substituting this value of $x$ into the equation $y = x - 20$, we get $y = \frac{100}{3} - 20 = \frac{40}{3}$.

Now, substitute $x = \frac{100}{3}$ and $y = \frac{40}{3}$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get
$$5\left(\frac{100}{3}\right)^2+5\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2-8\left(\frac{100}{3}\right)\left(\frac{40}{3}\right) = -\frac{8000}{3}.$$
2) If $y-x = 20$, then $y = x + 20$. Substituting this into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get
$$5x^2+5(x+20)^2-8x(x+20) = 5x^2+5(x^2+40x+400)-8x^2-160x = -3x^2-200x+2000.$$
To minimize this expression, we can find its derivative and set it equal to 0:
$$-6x - 200 = 0 \Rightarrow x = -\frac{200}{6} = -\frac{100}{3}.$$
Substituting this value of $x$ into the equation $y = x + 20$, we get $y = -\frac{100}{3} + 20 = \frac{20}{3}$.

Now, substitute $x = -\frac{100}{3}$ and $y = \frac{20}{3}$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get
$$5\left(-\frac{100}{3}\right)^2+5\left(\frac{20}{3}\right)^2-8\left(-\frac{100}{3}\right)\left(\frac{20}{3}\right) = -\frac{8000}{3}.$$
In both cases, we find that the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $-\frac{8000}{3}$. Since this value is negative, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ must be 0, when the expression inside the absolute value is zero. Thus, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 0.
The answer is: $0$
