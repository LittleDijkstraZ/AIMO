Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, we need to find the points $A$ and $B$ where the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$. This means we need to solve the equation $4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l$.
2. The distance between $A$ and $B$ is given as 6. This means the difference of the x-coordinates of $A$ and $B$ is 3 (since the parabola is symmetric about the line $x = k$).
3. Let's denote the x-coordinates of $A$ and $B$ as $x_1$ and $x_2$. Then we have $x_2 - x_1 = 3$.
4. The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $(x_1^2 + y_1^2) + (x_2^2 + y_2^2)$, where $y_1 = 4$ and $y_2 = 4$.
5. Substituting $y = 4$ into the equation of the parabola, we get $4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l$.
6. Solving this equation for $x$, we get two solutions $x_1$ and $x_2$.
7. Then we can calculate the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin using the formula $(x_1^2 + y_1^2) + (x_2^2 + y_2^2)$.

Now, let's write the code to solve the problem:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solve, simplify

def calculate_distance_sum():
    x, k, l = symbols('x k l')

    # Equation of the parabola
    parabola = k*x**2 - 2*k*x + l - 4

    # Solve the equation for x
    solutions = solve(parabola, x)

    # Denote the solutions as x1 and x2
    x1, x2 = solutions

    # The difference of the x-coordinates is 3
    x2 = x1 + 3

    # Calculate the sum of the squares of the distances from A and B to the origin
    distance_sum = (x1**2 + 4**2) + (x2**2 + 4**2)

    # Simplify the expression
    distance_sum = simplify(distance_sum)

    return distance_sum

result = calculate_distance_sum()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS (51*k - 2*l - 10*sqrt(k*(k - l + 4)) + 8)/k

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
(51*k - 2*l - 10*sqrt(k*(k - l + 4)) + 8)/k
```

Oops, it seems we made a mistake. We should not have used the solutions $x_1$ and $x_2$ directly. Instead, we should have used the fact that the parabola is symmetric about the line $x = k$. The x-coordinate of the vertex of the parabola is $k$, and the distance between the vertex and each of $A$ and $B$ is $\frac{3}{2}$. So we should have used the x-coordinates $k - \frac{3}{2}$ and $k + \frac{3}{2}$ for $A$ and $B$, respectively. Let's correct the code:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solve, simplify

def calculate_distance_sum():
    x, k, l = symbols('x k l')

    # Equation of the parabola
    parabola = k*x**2 - 2*k*x + l - 4

    # Solve the equation for x
    solutions = solve(parabola, x)

    # Denote the solutions as x1 and x2
    x1, x2 = solutions

    # The vertex of the parabola is at x = k
    k_value = solve(x - k, k)[0]

    # The distance between the vertex and each of A and B is 3/2
    x1 = k_value - 3/2
    x2 = k_value + 3/2

    # Calculate the sum of the squares of the distances from A and B to the origin
    distance_sum = (x1**2 + 4**2) + (x2**2 + 4**2)

    # Simplify the expression
    distance_sum = simplify(distance_sum)

    return distance_sum

result = calculate_distance_sum()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 2.0*x**2 + 36.5
