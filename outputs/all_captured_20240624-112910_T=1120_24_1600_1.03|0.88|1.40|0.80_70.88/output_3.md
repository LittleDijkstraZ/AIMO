Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

First, we can rewrite the given equation as:

$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$

The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So we have two cases:

1. Either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

2. Both of them are zero. This is not possible because the square of a non-zero number cannot be zero.

For the first case, we have:

$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.

This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

The solutions of these equations are the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

For the second case, we have:

$(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

This implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The solutions of these equations are the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

These lines form a square with side length 10 (from the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$), and a smaller square with side length 8 (from the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$).

The area of the larger square is $10^2 = 100$, and the area of the smaller square is $8^2 = 64$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the difference of the areas of the two squares, which is $100 - 64 = 36$.
The answer is $\boxed{36}$.

 The problem statement seems to be incorrect, as the expression $A(x, y) = ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if either $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$. These four conditions represent a set of lines and axes in the coordinate plane, which enclose a square of side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The given equation is of the form $A \cdot B = 0$, which implies that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. This translates to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. 

For the first equation to be true, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us the lines $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.

For the second equation to be true, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us the lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

These lines enclose a square with side length $20$, so the area of the square is $20^2 = 400$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $400$. The answer is: $400$.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:


The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied only if at least one of the factors is zero. This implies that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
From this, we can see that the points $\left(x, y\right)$ must satisfy either $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The points that satisfy $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ form a square with side length 10, while the points that satisfy $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$ form a square with side length 16.
The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon formed by the points $\left(x, y\right)$ that satisfy the given equation.
The area of a square is given by the square of its side length, so the area of the smaller square is $10^2 = 100$ and the area of the larger square is $16^2 = 256$.
The intersection of the two squares is a smaller square whose side length is equal to the side length of the smaller square (10), so the area of the convex polygon is also $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$

The equation is satisfied if either of the two factors is zero.
The first factor is zero if $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which simplifies to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
The second factor is zero if $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which simplifies to $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
So the points that satisfy the equation lie on the lines $x + y = \pm 10$, $x - y = \pm 10$, $x = \pm 8$, and $y = \pm 8$.
These lines form a square with side length 16, since the distance between the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$ is 20, and since the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$ are a distance of 16 apart.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

The first term is zero when either $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x-y| - 10 = 0$. These equations simplify to $|x+y| = 10$ and $|x-y| = 10$, respectively. These are the equations of two lines in the plane, and the region enclosed by these lines is a square with side length 20.

The second term is zero when either $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$. These equations simplify to $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$, respectively. These are the equations of two lines in the plane, and the region enclosed by these lines is a square with side length 16.

The intersection of the two squares is the convex polygon that is the solution to the given equation. The side length of this square is the smaller of the side lengths of the two squares, which is 16. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$

The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either one of the expressions must be zero.

The expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ equals zero if and only if both $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These equations represent two squares with side length 10 centered at the origin. Their intersection forms a square with side length 20.

The expression $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2$ equals zero if and only if both $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These equations represent two squares with side length 16 centered at the origin. Their intersection forms a square with side length 16.

The intersection of the two squares forms a square with side length 8. The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$.
The answer is: $64$

 The given equation is a product of two expressions, and for the product to be zero, one of the expressions must be zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

For the first case, we have $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$. Solving these equations, we get $x = 10$ and $y = 0$. Similarly, we have $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$, which gives $x = -10$ and $y = 0$. So, we have two points $(10, 0)$ and $(-10, 0)$.

For the second case, we have $x = 8$ and $y = 8$. So, we have another point $(8, 8)$. Similarly, we have $x = -8$ and $y = -8$, giving us the point $(-8, -8)$.

The four points $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$ form a rectangle. The length of the rectangle is $20$ (from $10$ to $-10$ on the x-axis) and the width is $16$ (from $8$ to $-8$ on the y-axis). Therefore, the area of the rectangle is $20 \times 16 = 320$. The answer is: $320$

 The given equation is equal to zero if and only if both of the factors are equal to zero. Therefore, we have two systems of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From the first system of equations, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us the vertices of the square as $(8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, $(-8, 0)$, and $(0, -8)$.

From the second system of equations, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us the vertices of the square as $(8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, $(-8, 0)$, and $(0, -8)$.

Thus, the points satisfying the equation form a square with side length 16. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$.
