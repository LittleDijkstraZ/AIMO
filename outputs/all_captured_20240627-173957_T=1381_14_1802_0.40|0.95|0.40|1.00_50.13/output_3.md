**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_ 2= (-16,2).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that
\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as
\[\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1.\]Find $h + k + a + b.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

Let's consider the first term:
$$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0.$$
This equation is satisfied if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the square as $(5, 5)$, $(5, -5)$, $(-5, -5)$, and $(-5, 5)$.

Now let's consider the second term:
$$(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0.$$
This equation is satisfied if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the square as $(8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, $(-8, 0)$, and $(0, -8)$.

The intersection of the two squares forms a smaller square with side length 10 (the smaller of the two side lengths). The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 100.

    intersection_vertices = [vertex for vertex in square1_vertices if vertex in square2_vertices]

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many square units are in the area of the triangle whose vertices are the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the curve $y = (x-3)^2 (x+2)$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we need to find where this curve intersects the $x$ and $y$ axes.  If $y=0$, then $(x-3)^2(x+2)=0$, which has solutions of $x=3$ and $x=-2$.  If $x=0$, then $y=(-3)^2(2)=18$.  So, the curve has two $x$-intercepts and one $y$-intercept.  The length of the base along the $x$-axis is $3-(-2)=5$.  The height from this base is equal to the $y$-intercept, 18.  The area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 5\cdot 18=\boxed{45}$. The answer is $\boxed{45}$

**Solution:** 



The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. This gives us two systems of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

Each of these systems of equations simplifies to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are the vertices of the polygon.

The solutions to $\vert x \vert = 8$ are $x = 8$ and $x = -8$. The solutions to $\vert y \vert = 8$ are $y = 8$ and $y = -8$. The solutions to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ are given by the intersections of the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$ with the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

By plotting these lines and finding their intersections, we find that the polygon is a square with side length 6. The area of the square is $6^2 = 36$.

```python

    # Solve the systems of equations
    solutions1 = solve([Abs(x + y) - 10, Abs(x) - 8, Abs(y) - 8], (x, y))
    solutions2 = solve([Abs(x - y) - 10, Abs(x) - 8, Abs(y) - 8], (x, y))

    # Find the vertices of the polygon
    vertices = solutions1 + solutions2

    # Find the distance between the vertices
    distance = max([(vertices[i][0] - vertices[j][0])**2 + (vertices[i][1] - vertices[j][1])**2 for i in range(len(vertices)) for j in range(i+1, len(vertices))])**0.5

    # Calculate the area of the polygon
    area = simplify(distance**2)

    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

ValueError: max() arg is an empty sequence

FAIL

```

The error in the code is due to the fact that the `max()` function is trying to find the maximum of an empty sequence. This is because the list of distances is empty because there are no distances between the vertices of the polygon.

Let's correct this by calculating the side length of the square directly from the equations.

The solutions to $\vert x \vert = 8$ are $x = 8$ and $x = -8$. The solutions to $\vert y \vert = 8$ are $y = 8$ and $y = -8$. The solutions to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ are given by the intersections of the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$ with the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

By plotting these lines and finding their intersections, we find that the polygon is a square with side length 6. The area of the square is $6^2 = 36$.

So, the area of the polygon is 36.
The answer is: $36$

Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Let $w$ be the width of each of the identical rectangles. Since $PQ=3w$, $RS=2x$ and $PQ=RS$ (because $PQRS$ is a rectangle), then $2x = 3w$, or $$w=\frac{2}{3}x.$$ Therefore, the area of each of the five identical rectangles is $$x\left(\frac{2}{3}x\right)=\frac{2}{3}x^2.$$ Since the area of $PQRS$ is 4000 and it is made up of five of these identical smaller rectangles, then $$5\left(\frac{2}{3}x^2\right)=4000$$ or $$\frac{10}{3}x^2 = 4000$$ or $x^2 = 1200$ or $x \approx 34.6$ which, when rounded off to the nearest integer, is $\boxed{35}.$ The answer is $\boxed{35}$

To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step.

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


The problem asks for the area of a polygon formed by the points that satisfy the given equation. The equation is a product of two terms, each of which is a square of a difference of absolute values. The product is zero if and only if at least one of the terms is zero. Therefore, we need to find the points that satisfy each term separately and then find the intersection of these sets of points.

1. For the first term, we have $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. This gives us two lines: $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.
2. For the second term, we have $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us two more lines: $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.
3. For the third term, we have $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$. This gives us two vertical lines: $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.
4. For the fourth term, we have $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us two horizontal lines: $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

Now we need to find the intersection of these lines to get the vertices of the polygon. The polygon is a square with side length 20 (the distance between the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$), so its area is $20^2 = 400$.

The answer is: $400$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. This gives us four cases to consider:

1. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.
2. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.
3. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.
4. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.

Each of these cases gives a line in the coordinate plane. The first and third cases give lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$, the second and fourth cases give lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$, and the second and fourth cases give lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

These lines enclose a rectangle with side lengths 16 and 20, so the area of the rectangle is $16 \times 20 = 320$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 320 square units.

Since $PQ=3w$, $RS=2x$ and $PQ=RS$ (because $PQRS$ is a rectangle), then $2x = 3w$, or $$w=\frac{2}{3}x.$$ Therefore, the area of each of the five identical rectangles is $$x\left(\frac{2}{3}x\right)=\frac{2}{3}x^2.$$ Since the area of $PQRS$ is 4000 and it is made up of five of these identical smaller rectangles, then $$5\left(\frac{2}{3}x^2\right)=4000$$ or $$\frac{10}{3}x^2 = 4000$$ or $x^2 = 1200$ or $x \approx 34.6$ which, when rounded off to the nearest integer, is $\boxed{35}.$ The answer is $\boxed{35}$

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So we have two cases to consider:

   a) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
   b) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

2. For case a), we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us four lines in the coordinate plane: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

3. For case b), we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us four lines in the coordinate plane: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

4. The intersection of these lines form a square with side length 10.

5. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 100.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Let $w$ be the width of each of the identical rectangles. Since $PQ=3w$, $RS=2x$ and $PQ=RS$ (because $PQRS$ is a rectangle), then $2x = 3w$, or $$w=\frac{2}{3}x.$$ Therefore, the area of each of the five identical rectangles is $$x\left(\frac{2}{3}x\right)=\frac{2}{3}x^2.$$ Since the area of $PQRS$ is 4000 and it is made up of five of these identical smaller rectangles, then $$5\left(\frac{2}{3}x^2\right)=4000$$ or $$\frac{10}{3}x^2 = 4000$$ or $x^2 = 1200$ or $x \approx 34.6$ which, when rounded off to the nearest integer, is $\boxed{35}.$ The answer is $\boxed{35}$

**Problem:** 
"How many square units are in the area of the triangle whose vertices are the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the curve $y = (x-3)^2 (x+2)$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we need to find where this curve intersects the $x$ and $y$ axes.  If $y=0$, then $(x-3)^2(x+2)=0$, which has solutions of $x=3$ and $x=-2$.  If $x=0$, then $y=(-3)^2(2)=18$.  So, the curve has two $x$-intercepts and one $y$-intercept.  The length of the base along the $x$-axis is $3-(-2)=5$.  The height from this base is equal to the $y$-intercept, 18.  The area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 5\cdot 18=\boxed{45}$. The answer is $\boxed{45}$

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


This problem involves understanding the properties of absolute value and how it interacts with equations and inequalities. The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either term must be zero. This gives us two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, and $(-10, 0)$.

For the second case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(8, 0)$, $(-8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, and $(0, -8)$.

The polygon formed by these vertices is a square with side length 10. To find its area, we simply square the length of one of its sides: $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units. The answer is: $100$

**Problem:** 
"Let $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_ 2= (-16,2).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that
\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we first need to understand the given equation and the conditions it imposes on $x$ and $y$. The equation is:
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]
This equation is equal to zero if either of the two factors is zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the four lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

For the second case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So we get the four lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length $20$. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$. So the area of the convex polygon is $400$.

## QUESTION 3 - 12 
- TIME_SPENT : 667 secs

12_
**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Find the number of 10-tuples $(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{10})$ of real numbers such that
\[(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2 = \frac{1}{11}.\]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,
\begin{align*}
&[(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + \dots + 1^2 + 1^2)][(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2] \\
&\ge [(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + (x_2 - x_3) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10}]^2 = 1.
\end{align*}From the given condition, we have equality, so by the equality condition for Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[\frac{1 - x_1}{1} = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{1} = \frac{x_2 - x_3}{1} = \dots = \frac{x_9 - x_{10}}{1} = \frac{x_{10}}{1}.\]Let
\[d = 1 - x_1 = x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_3 = \dots = x_9 - x_{10} = x_{10}.\]Then
\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so
\[(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_{10}) = \left( \frac{10}{11}, \frac{9}{11}, \frac{8}{11}, \dots, \frac{1}{11} \right).\]In particular, there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.

The first term is zero when $|x + y| = 10$ or $|x - y| = 10$. These are the equations of two pairs of parallel lines, each pair being 20 units apart.

The second term is zero when $|x| = 8$ or $|y| = 8$. These are the equations of two pairs of parallel lines, each pair being 16 units apart.

The intersection points of these lines form a rectangle with side lengths 20 and 16. The area of this rectangle is $20 \times 16 = 320$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 320 square units.

**Problem:** 
"Five identical rectangles are arranged to form a larger rectangle $PQRS$, as shown.  The area of $PQRS$ is $4000$.  What is the length, $x$, rounded off to the nearest integer? [asy]
real x = 1; real w = 2/3;

draw(left--right);
label("$x$", (x/2, -0.1), S);

[/asy]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Let $w$ be the width of each of the identical rectangles. Since $PQ=3w$, $RS=2x$ and $PQ=RS$ (because $PQRS$ is a rectangle), then $2x = 3w$, or $$w=\frac{2}{3}x.$$ Therefore, the area of each of the five identical rectangles is $$x\left(\frac{2}{3}x\right)=\frac{2}{3}x^2.$$ Since the area of $PQRS$ is 4000 and it is made up of five of these identical smaller rectangles, then $$5\left(\frac{2}{3}x^2\right)=4000$$ or $$\frac{10}{3}x^2 = 4000$$ or $x^2 = 1200$ or $x \approx 34.6$ which, when rounded off to the nearest integer, is $\boxed{35}.$ The answer is $\boxed{35}$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The equation is satisfied if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The first two equations are satisfied if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which represent two lines.
The last two equations are satisfied if $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$, which represent two lines.
The intersection of these lines form a square with side length 16.
The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$
