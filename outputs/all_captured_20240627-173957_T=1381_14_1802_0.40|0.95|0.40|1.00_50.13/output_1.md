**Problem:** 
"What is the minimum value of the expression $2x^2+3y^2+8x-24y+62$ for real $x$ and $y$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Rearranging the expression, we have  \[2x^2+8x+3y^2-24y+62\]We first complete the square in $x$. Factoring a 2 from the first two terms of the expression, we get  \[2(x^2+4x)+3y^2-24y+62\]In order for the expression inside the parenthesis to be a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(4/2)^2=4$ inside the parenthesis. Doing this, we have \[2(x^2+4x+4-4)+3y^2-24y+62 \Rightarrow 2(x+2)^2+3y^2-24y+54\]Now we complete the square in $y$. Factoring a 3 from the $y$ terms in the expression, we get \[2(x+2)^2+3(y^2-8y)+54\]In order for the expression inside the second parenthesis to be a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(8/2)^2=16$ inside the parenthesis. Doing this, we have \[2(x+2)^2+3(y^2-8y+16-16)+54 \Rightarrow 2(x+2)^2+3(y-4)^2+6\]Since the minimum value of $2(x+2)^2$ and $3(y-4)^2$ is $0$ (perfect squares can never be negative), the minimum value of the entire expression is $\boxed{6}$, and is achieved when $x=-2$ and $y=4$. The answer is $\boxed{6}$

**Problem**
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


This problem is a bit tricky because it involves absolute values and we need to consider different cases for the absolute values. However, we can simplify the problem by noting that $|x-2y| + |y-2x|$ is always equal to $0$ when $x=2y$. So we can substitute $x=2y$ into the equation and the inequality to simplify the problem.

Let's start by substituting $x=2y$ into the inequality:
\[|2y-2(2y)| + |y-2(2y)| = |2y-4y| + |y-4y| = |-2y| + |-3y| = 2|y| + 3|y| = 5|y| = 40.\]
So $|y| = 8$ and therefore $y = \pm 8$.

Now let's substitute $x=2y$ into the expression we want to minimize:
\[5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(2y)^2 + 5y^2 - 8(2y)y = 20y^2 + 5y^2 - 16y^2 = 19y^2.\]
Now we substitute $y = \pm 8$ into the expression:
\[19y^2 = 19(8^2) = 19 \cdot 64 = 1216 \text{ when } y = 8,\]
\[19y^2 = 19(-8^2) = 19 \cdot 64 = 1216 \text{ when } y = -8.\]
So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $1216$.

**Solution:**


This problem is a bit tricky to solve directly. However, we can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to solve it.

The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states that for any real numbers $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$ and $b_1, b_2, ..., b_n$, we have:
\[(a_1^2 + a_2^2 + ... + a_n^2)(b_1^2 + b_2^2 + ... + b_n^2) \geq (a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 + ... + a_nb_n)^2.\]

In this problem, we can set $a_1 = x$, $a_2 = y$, $b_1 = 1$, and $b_2 = -2$. Then we have:
\[(x^2 + y^2)(1^2 + (-2)^2) \geq (x - 2y)^2.\]
Simplifying the left side gives:
\[(x^2 + y^2)(1 + 4) \geq (x - 2y)^2.\]
\[5(x^2 + y^2) \geq (x - 2y)^2.\]

Similarly, we can set $a_1 = y$, $a_2 = x$, $b_1 = -2$, and $b_2 = 1$. Then we have:
\[(y^2 + x^2)((-2)^2 + 1^2) \geq (y - 2x)^2.\]
Simplifying the left side gives:
\[(y^2 + x^2)(4 + 1) \geq (y - 2x)^2.\]
\[5(y^2 + x^2) \geq (y - 2x)^2.\]

Adding these two inequalities together, we get:
\[10(x^2 + y^2) \geq (x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2.\]

Now, we are given that $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$. By the triangle inequality, we know that $|a| + |b| \geq |a + b|$. Therefore, we have:
\[|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| \geq |(x - 2y) + (y - 2x)| = |-x - y| = |x + y|.\]
So, $|x + y| = 40$.

Now, we can substitute this into the inequality we derived:
\[10(x^2 + y^2) \geq (x + y)^2.\]
Substituting $|x + y| = 40$, we get:
\[10(x^2 + y^2) \geq 40^2 = 1600.\]
Dividing both sides by 10, we get:
\[x^2 + y^2 \geq \frac{1600}{10} = 160.\]

Finally, we want to find the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$. We can rewrite this as:
\[5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy.\]
We know that $x^2 + y^2 \geq 160$, and we want to minimize $5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy$. By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we know that $(x^2 + y^2)(1^2 + (-1)^2) \geq (x - y)^2$, which simplifies to $2(x^2 + y^2) \geq (x - y)^2$. Therefore, $x^2 + y^2 \geq \frac{(x - y)^2}{2}$.

Substituting $x^2 + y^2 \geq 160$, we get:
\[160 \geq \frac{(x - y)^2}{2}.\]
Multiplying both sides by 2, we get:
\[320 \geq (x - y)^2.\]
Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[\sqrt{320} \geq |x - y|.\]

Now, we can substitute this into the expression $5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy$:
\[5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy \geq 5(160) - 8\sqrt{320}\sqrt{160}.\]
Simplifying the right side gives:
\[800 - 8\sqrt{320}\sqrt{160}.\]
We can simplify $\sqrt{320}\sqrt{160}$ as $\sqrt{320*160} = \sqrt{51200} = 226.2741699797$.
So, the minimum value of $5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy$ is:
\[800 - 8*226.2741699797 = 800 - 1810.19335983776 = -1010.19335983776.\]
However, this is not possible since the minimum value of a quadratic expression is always non-negative. Therefore, we must have made a mistake in our calculations.

Let's go back and re-examine our steps. We noticed that we made a mistake in our application of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. The correct inequality should be:
\[(x^2 + y^2)(1^2 + (-2)^2) \geq (x - 2y)^2.\]
\[5(x^2 + y^2) \geq (x - 2y)^2.\]

Similarly, the correct inequality should be:
\[(y^2 + x^2)((-2)^2 + 1^2) \geq (y - 2x)^2.\]
\[5(y^2 + x^2) \geq (y - 2x)^2.\]

Adding these two inequalities together, we get:
\[10(x^2 + y^2) \geq (x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2.\]

Now, we are given that $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$. By the triangle inequality, we know that $|a| + |b| \geq |a - b|$. Therefore, we have:
\[|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| \geq |(x - 2y) - (y - 2x)| = |x - 2y - y + 2x| = |3x - 3y| = 3|x - y|.\]
So, $3|x - y| = 40$, which implies $|x - y| = \frac{40}{3}$.

Now, we can substitute this into the inequality we derived:
\[10(x^2 + y^2) \geq 3^2|x - y|^2.\]
Substituting $|x - y| = \frac{40}{3}$, we get:
\[10(x^2 + y^2) \geq 9*\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 = 9*\frac{1600}{9} = 1600.\]
Dividing both sides by 10, we get:
\[x^2 + y^2 \geq \frac{1600}{10} = 160.\]

Finally, we want to find the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$. We can rewrite this as:
\[5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy.\]
We know that $x^2 + y^2 \geq 160$, and we
