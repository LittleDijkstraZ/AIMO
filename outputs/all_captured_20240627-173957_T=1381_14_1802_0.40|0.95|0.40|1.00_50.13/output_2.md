**Problem:** 
"How many distinct solutions are there to the equation $|x-7| = |x+1|$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
If $|x-7| = |x+1|$, then either $x-7 = x+1$ or $x-7 = -(x+1)$.  Simplifying $x-7=x+1$ gives $0=8$, which has no solutions, so no values of $x$ satisfy $x-7 = x+1$.  If $x-7 = -(x+1)$, then $x-7 = -x-1$, so $2x = 6$, which gives $x=3$.  So, there is $\boxed{1}$ solution.

Challenge: See if you can find a quick solution to this problem by simply thinking about the graphs of $y=|x-7|$ and $y=|x+1|$. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The equation $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$.

To see this, consider the function $f(x) = | |x-1| - 2 |$. The graph of $f(x)$ consists of four line segments, with the graph of $|x-1| - 2$ reflected across the x-axis in the interval where $|x-1| - 2 < 0$. The graph of $f(x)$ is symmetric about the line $x=1$, and has a maximum value of 2.

Therefore, the equation $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, or $m = 200$.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 1. The answer is: $1$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many integers are solutions to the equation $$(x-2)^{(25-x^2)}=1?$$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
We need some basic facts from number theory: $a^0 = 1$ for any $a,$ $1^b = 1$ for any $b,$ and $(-1)^c = 1$ if $c$ is an even integer. Unless the base is a complex number (which is excluded since we are looking for integer solutions), there are no other ways to get an RHS of $1.$ Thus, either the exponent is zero $($giving the equation $25 - x^2 = 0),$ the base is $1$ $($giving $x -2 = 1),$ or the base is $-1$ and the exponent is even $($giving the simultaneous equations $x - 2 = -1$ and $25 - x^2 = 2n$ for some integer $n).$ Solving the first equation gives $x = \pm 5,$ and solving the second gives $x = 3.$ The third equation implies that $x = 1,$ in which case $25 - x^2 = 24$ is indeed even, so $x = 1$ is a valid solution. In all, there are $\boxed{4}$ integer solutions. The answer is $\boxed{4}$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many solutions does the equation \[\frac{(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)\dotsm(x-100)}{(x-1^2)(x-2^2)(x-3^2)\dotsm(x-100^2)} = 0\]have for $x$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Any solution to this equation must make the numerator of the left-hand side zero, while keeping the denominator non-zero. The numerator is zero when $x$ is one of the numbers $1, 2, 3, \dots, 100.$ However, for any value in this list that is a perfect square, the denominator will also be zero, so that value of $x$ will not be a root. Therefore, we want to find the number of integers in the list $1, 2, \dots, 100$ which are not perfect squares. The perfect squares in the list are $1^2, 2^2, \dots, 10^2,$ so there are $10$ perfect squares, and \[100 - 10 = \boxed{90}\]integers which are not perfect squares. The answer is $\boxed{90}$

The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $100$. However, we are asked to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has exactly $4$ distinct solutions. To do this, we need to consider the possible values of $m$.

For $m=1$, the equation becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{1}{100}$, which simplifies to $\vert x-1 -2 \vert = \frac{1}{100}$ or $\vert x-1 +2 \vert = \frac{1}{100}$. These simplify to $\vert x-3 \vert = \frac{1}{100}$ and $\vert x+1 \vert = \frac{1}{100}$, respectively. The first equation has two solutions: $x=3\pm\frac{1}{100}$, and the second equation has two solutions: $x=-1\pm\frac{1}{100}$. However, these are not distinct solutions, so $m=1$ does not give us four distinct solutions.

For $m>1$, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be rewritten as $\vert x-1 -2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$ or $\vert x-1 +2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplify to $\vert x-3 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$ and $\vert x+1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, respectively. The first equation has two solutions: $x=3\pm\frac{m}{100}$, and the second equation has two solutions: $x=-1\pm\frac{m}{100}$. For these to be distinct, we must have $\frac{m}{100} \neq 2$, or $m \neq 200$. Therefore, for $m>1$ and $m \neq 200$, the equation has four distinct solutions.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly $4$ distinct solutions is $99$. The answer is: $99$
