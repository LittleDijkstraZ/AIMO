This is a complex problem that requires a deep understanding of absolute value equations and their solutions. To solve it programmatically, we can use a loop to try different values of $m$ and count the number of distinct solutions for each $m$. We can then print the value of $m$ for which there are exactly 4 distinct solutions.

```python

    solutions = []

    for possible_m in range(1, 101):  # We only need to try m values up to 100

However, this approach is not efficient and will take a long time to execute due to the excessive number of function calls and the nested loop. Instead, we can manually analyze the behavior of the absolute value equation to quickly identify the range of $m$ for which the equation has exactly 4 distinct solutions.

Let's break down the equation:

\[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\]

For $\vert x - 1 \vert - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$, we can draw the graph of $y = \vert x - 1 \vert - 2$ and observe that it intersects the line $y = \frac{m}{100}$ at exactly 4 distinct points when $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 1$. This corresponds to $0 < m < 100$.

Similarly, for $-\vert x - 1 \vert + 2 = \frac{m}{100}$, we can draw the graph of $y = -\vert x - 1 \vert + 2$ and observe that it intersects the line $y = \frac{m}{100}$ at exactly 4 distinct points when $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. This corresponds to $100 < m < 200$.

Therefore, the only values of $m$ that satisfy the equation and have 4 distinct solutions are those in the range $1 < m < 200$. The number of such integers is $198$.
The answer is $\boxed{198}$.

 The equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}=1$.
This means that $m=100$.
Therefore, the only positive integer value of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is $m=100$.

So, the answer is $1$.
The answer is: $1$

Assistant:

 To solve this problem, we first need to understand the structure of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. This equation involves absolute values, which makes it somewhat difficult to directly solve for $x$. However, we can observe that the left-hand side of the equation is always non-negative, and it equals to $\frac{m}{100}$ which is also non-negative. Therefore, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be greater than or equal to 0, which means $m$ must be a non-negative integer.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ lies in the interval $(1,2)$. This is because the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a "V" shape with two "humps" of height 1 centered at $x=1$ and $x=3$. The interval $(1,2)$ corresponds to the range of $f(x)$ between these two humps.

To find the value of $m$ that satisfies this condition, we need to multiply the interval $(1,2)$ by 100: $(100, 200)$. Therefore, the positive integer values of $m$ that make the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have 4 distinct solutions are all the integers in the interval $(100, 200)$.

To find the number of such integers, we subtract the lower limit of the interval from the upper limit and then subtract 1 (because we are considering the strict inequalities): $200 - 100 - 1 = 99$.

So the number of positive integer values of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 99. The answer is: $99$

 To solve this problem, we need to analyze the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ and determine for how many positive integers $m$ it has exactly 4 distinct solutions.

First, let's consider the right-hand side of the equation. The value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be positive, so $m$ must be a positive integer.

Now let's consider the left-hand side of the equation. The function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a "V" shape, with the two "knees" occurring at $x=1 \pm 2$. So the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if $\frac{m}{100}$ is in the range $(0, 2)$.

This means $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which simplifies to $0 < m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are $1, 2, 3, ..., 199$.

So, there are 199 positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. The answer is: $199$. However, the problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ that yield exactly 4 distinct solutions, which implies that $m$ must be a positive integer. Since we are dealing with positive integers, the value of $m$ can range from 1 to 199. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 199. The answer is: $199$.

Assistant:

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions, which means the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be $2$. Therefore, we have $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = 2$. This equation has four distinct solutions if and only if the absolute value expression $\vert x-1 \vert -2$ is equal to $2$ or $-2$.

If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 2$, then $\vert x-1 \vert = 4$, which gives us two possibilities: $x-1 = 4$ or $x-1 = -4$. Solving these equations, we get $x = 5$ or $x = -3$.

If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -2$, then $\vert x-1 \vert = 0$, which gives us only one possibility: $x-1 = 0$, so $x = 1$.

Therefore, the four distinct solutions of the original equation are $x = -3, 1, 5$. Now we need to find the value of $m$ such that $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. Solving this equation, we get $m = 200$.

So the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $200$. The answer is: $200$

 This problem is not directly solvable by Python or other programming languages. It requires analytical thinking and problem-solving skills. The problem is asking for the number of positive integers m such that the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. 

The equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ is a piecewise function, and its solutions depend on the value of $\frac{m}{100}$. The equation has 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ falls within a specific range. By analyzing the properties of the piecewise function and the number of its solutions, we can determine the range of $\frac{m}{100}$ that produces 4 distinct solutions. This analysis leads to the conclusion that the value of $m$ must be 200.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 1, so the answer is $\boxed{1}$.

However, this problem requires a deep understanding of the properties of absolute value functions and the number of their solutions. It is not a straightforward programming problem and cannot be solved directly using Python or other programming languages. The correct answer to this problem is 1, not 200.

Assistant:

 This problem is asking for the number of values of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

Let's first look at the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. The right-hand side of the equation is a positive value, so the absolute value of the left-hand side must be equal to this value. This means that the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, must be equal to $\frac{m}{100}$ or $-\frac{m}{100}$. We can write this as two separate equations:

1. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$
2. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$

Now, let's solve each equation separately:

For equation 1, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100} + 2$. This means that $x-1 = \frac{m}{100} + 2$ or $x-1 = -(\frac{m}{100} + 2)$. Solving these two equations gives us $x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$ or $x = 1 - \frac{m}{100} - 2 = 1 - \frac{m}{100} - 2 = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

For equation 2, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. This means that $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 = - (2 - \frac{m}{100}) = -\frac{m}{100} - 2$. Solving these two equations gives us $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ or $x = - \frac{m}{100} - 1$.

Now, we have four equations for $x$ in terms of $m$:

1. $x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$
2. $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$
3. $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$
4. $x = - \frac{m}{100} - 1$

For these equations to have 4 distinct solutions, the ranges of the values of $x$ from each equation must not overlap. This means that the maximum value of $x$ from equation 1 must be less than the minimum value of $x$ from equation 2, the maximum value of $x$ from equation 2 must be less than the minimum value of $x$ from equation 3, and so on.

After calculating the maximum and minimum values of $x$ from each equation and ensuring that they do not overlap, we find that this is only possible when $1 \leq \frac{m}{100} \leq 2$, which gives $100 \leq m \leq 200$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is the number of integers in the range $[100, 200]$, which is $100$.

So, the answer is $100$. The answer is: $100$

The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

We can start by analyzing the equation. The expression on the left, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, is a piecewise function that takes on the value $0$ when $|x-1| = 2 + m/100$, and $4 - 2m/100$ when $|x-1| = 2 - m/100$. These are the two conditions that give us the 4 distinct solutions.

For the first condition, $|x-1| = 2 + m/100$, we have two cases:
1. If $2 + m/100 > 0$, then $x - 1 = \pm (2 + m/100)$, giving us two solutions.
2. If $2 + m/100 < 0$, then there are no solutions.

For the second condition, $|x-1| = 2 - m/100$, we again have two cases:
1. If $2 - m/100 > 0$, then $x - 1 = \pm (2 - m/100)$, giving us two more solutions.
2. If $2 - m/100 < 0$, then there are no solutions.

So, for the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, the first condition $|x-1| = 2 + m/100$ must have two solutions and the second condition $|x-1| = 2 - m/100$ must also have two solutions. This means that $0 < 2 + m/100 < 2$ and $0 < 2 - m/100 < 2$.

Solving these inequalities gives $0 < m/100 < 2$, which simplifies to $0 < m < 200$. Since $m$ must be a positive integer, the possible values for $m$ are 1 through 199.

However, we also need the second condition to have solutions, which means $0 < 2 - m/100 < 2$. Solving this inequality gives $-200 < -m < 0$, or $0 < m < 200$. But this is the same as the range we found for the first condition.

So, all values of $m$ in the range $1$ to $199$ satisfy both conditions and give us 4 distinct solutions. Therefore, the number of such positive integers $m$ is $199$.

Assistant:

 This problem seems to be a bit complex to solve directly using programming as it involves a deep understanding of absolute value and how it behaves. However, we can simplify it using the following reasoning:

The expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ represents a piecewise function that is equal to $0$ when $|x-1| = 2$, $1$ when $|x-1| > 2$, and $-1$ when $|x-1| < 2$. This means that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100} = 1$, because only in this case the absolute value function intersects the line $y = \frac{m}{100}$ exactly four times.

Therefore, the only value of $m$ that makes the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have 4 distinct solutions is $m = 100$.

So, there is only one positive integer $m$ that satisfies the condition, namely $m = 100$. The answer is: $1$.

 To solve this problem, we need to analyze the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ and find the number of positive integer values of $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions.

First, we know that the absolute value function splits into two cases: if $y = |x|$, then $y = x$ when $x \geq 0$ and $y = -x$ when $x < 0$. Applying this to our equation, we get two cases:

1. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$.
2. $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = \frac{m}{100}$.

For each of these cases, we can solve for $x$:

1. $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.
2. $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Again, applying the absolute value property, we get four equations:

1.1. $x - 1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.
1.2. $x - 1 = -(2 + \frac{m}{100})$.
2.1. $x - 1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
2.2. $x - 1 = -(2 - \frac{m}{100})$.

Solving each of these equations gives us the four solutions for $x$ in terms of $m$. We need to find the values of $m$ for which these solutions are distinct.

This process is quite involved and may require numerical methods to solve. However, we can use Python and its sympy library to automate the process and find the required values of $m$. Here's a Python program that does this:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solve, Eq

def find_m():
    x, m = symbols('x m')
    # List to store the valid values of m
    valid_m = []

    # For each case, solve for x
    for case in range(1, 3):
        if case == 1:
            # Case 1: |x - 1| = 2 + m/100
            eq1 = Eq(x - 1, 2 + m/100)
            eq2 = Eq(x - 1, -(2 + m/100))
        else:
            # Case 2: |x - 1| = 2 - m/100
            eq1 = Eq(x - 1, 2 - m/100)
            eq2 = Eq(x - 1, -(2 - m/100))

        # Solve the equations
        solutions1 = solve(eq1, x)
        solutions2 = solve(eq2, x)

        # Combine the solutions
        solutions = solutions1 + solutions2

        # Check if the solutions are distinct
        if len(set(solutions)) == 4:
            # If the solutions are distinct, add the value of m to the list
            valid_m.append(m)

    return valid_m

result = find_m()
print(result)
```

Unfortunately, the Python program returns an empty list, which means that no valid values of $m$ were found. This indicates that our approach to solving this problem is incorrect. Let's try a different method.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ takes on the value $\frac{m}{100}$ exactly $4$ times.

The function $f(x)$ is a piecewise function defined as follows:
- If $x < -1$, then $f(x) = \vert -x - 1 - 2 \vert = \vert -x - 3 \vert = x + 3$.
- If $-1 \leq x < 1$, then $f(x) = \vert x - 1 - 2 \vert = \vert x - 3 \vert = 3 - x$.
- If $x \geq 1$, then $f(x) = \vert x - 1 - 2 \vert = \vert x - 3 \vert = x - 3$.

We can see that $f(x)$ is a triangular wave function with amplitude $3$ and period $2$. The function takes on the value $\frac{m}{100}$ exactly $4$ times if and only if $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 3$. This gives us the inequality $0 < m < 300$.

Therefore, the number of positive integer values of $m$ that satisfy the equation is $299$.
The answer is: $299$

Assistant:

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is between $1$ and $2$ (inclusive). This is because the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, will change its sign twice in the interval from $-2$ to $0$, which corresponds to the interval from $0$ to $2$ for $\frac{m}{100}$. So, $1 \leq \frac{m}{100} \leq 2$, which implies $100 \leq m \leq 200$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from $100$ to $200$, inclusive. To count the number of these integers, we subtract the smallest value from the largest value and add 1. So, the number of such integers is $200 - 100 + 1 = 101$. The answer is: $101$

Assistant:

 To solve this problem, we first need to understand the structure of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.

The equation $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|$ is equal to a positive value $\frac{m}{100}$. The expression $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|$ is a value that is always nonnegative, so the right side $\frac{m}{100}$ must also be nonnegative. This means that $m$ must be a nonnegative integer.

Now let's consider the number of solutions of the equation. The equation $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions means that the equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2=\frac{m}{100}$ or $\vert x-1 \vert -2=-\frac{m}{100}$ has 2 distinct solutions for each case.

For the equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2=\frac{m}{100}$, the solutions are $x = 1 \pm (2 + \frac{m}{100})$. For the equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2=-\frac{m}{100}$, the solutions are $x = 1 \pm (2 - \frac{m}{100})$.

For these solutions to be distinct, we need $2 + \frac{m}{100} > 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $m < 100$. Therefore, the positive integers $m$ that satisfy the conditions are the integers from 1 to 99.

To find the number of these integers, we simply count the number of integers from 1 to 99. The answer is $99$. The value of unknown variable $m$ is 99. The answer is: $99$

 This problem is quite complex and requires a deep understanding of absolute value and piecewise functions. However, it can be solved by programming and analyzing the number of distinct solutions for each $m$.

Here is a Python program that solves the problem:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Abs, solve

def number_of_distinct_solutions(m):
    x = symbols('x')
    equation = Abs(Abs(x - 1) - 2) - m / 100
    solutions = solve(equation, x)
    # Count the number of distinct solutions
    distinct_solutions = len(set(solutions))
    return distinct_solutions

count = 0
for m in range(1, 101):  # Loop through possible values of m
    if number_of_distinct_solutions(m) == 4:
        count += 1
print(count)
```

CODE RESULTS 100

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
100
```
The answer to the problem is $\boxed{1}$.

However, this seems to be incorrect. After analyzing the problem further, we realize that we have misunderstood the problem. The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions, not the number of possible values of $m$. 

To find the correct answer, let's analyze the piecewise function that represents the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. We know that this function will have 4 distinct solutions if the right side of the equation ($\frac{m}{100}$) falls into a specific range.

The piecewise function can be written as:
\[
f(x) = \begin{cases}
x-3 & \text{if } x \geq 3 \\
-x+1 & \text{if } 1 \leq x < 3 \\
x-1 & \text{if } -1 \leq x < 1 \\
-(x+1) & \text{if } x \leq -1
\end{cases}
\]

The function will have 4 distinct solutions if $\frac{m}{100}$ is in the range $(0, 1]$. This happens when $0 < m \leq 100$. Therefore, there is only 1 value of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions. The value of $m$ is 100.

However, the original question asked for the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy this condition. Since there is only one such integer (m=100), the correct answer is 1.
The answer is $\boxed{1}$.
