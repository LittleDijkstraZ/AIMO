Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is equal to zero if and only if both of its factors are equal to zero. This gives us two sets of equations:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From the first set of equations, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$. This implies that $-10 \leq x + y \leq 10$ and $-8 \leq x \leq 8$.

From the second set of equations, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $-10 \leq x - y \leq 10$ and $-8 \leq y \leq 8$.

The solution to these inequalities is a square with side length 16. Therefore, the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The expression $A \cdot B = 0$ is equivalent to $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The first equation implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of a square with side length 10 and area $10^2 = 100$.
The second equation implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us a square with side length 16 and area $16^2 = 256$.
However, the points that satisfy both equations are the vertices of the smaller square, which are also vertices of the larger square. Therefore, the convex polygon is the larger square, and its area is 256.
The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. This gives us two systems of equations to solve:

1. $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x - y| - 10 = 0$
2. $|x| - 8 = 0$ and $|y| - 8 = 0$

For the first system, we have $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations gives us the vertices of a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

For the second system, we have $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these four equations gives us the vertices of a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

However, the convex polygon formed by the intersection of these two squares is a smaller square with side length 8 (since the intersection of the two squares is the square with side length 8). The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 64.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    # Side length of the square
    side_length = 8

    # Area of the square
    area = side_length ** 2

    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 64

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
64
```
The area of the convex polygon is $64$. The answer is: $64$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to the system of equations:

1) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2) $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
3) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
4) $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

Each of these equations implies that the absolute value of some expression is zero, which in turn implies that the expression is zero. Therefore, the solutions to the system are:

1) $x + y = 0$
2) $x - y = 0$
3) $x = 0$
4) $y = 0$

The solutions to the system are the points that satisfy all four equations. The intersection of the lines $x + y = 0$, $x - y = 0$, $x = 0$, and $y = 0$ is the origin $(0,0)$. The convex polygon formed by these points is a square with side length 16 (since the absolute value of $x$ or $y$ being 8 implies that the distance from the origin to the point $(x, y)$ is 8 along one of the coordinate axes). The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if at least one of the factors is equal to zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The first equation holds if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means that $x$ and $y$ are both $5$ or both $-5$. The second equation holds if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means that $x$ is in the interval $[-8, 8]$ and $y$ is in the interval $[-8, 8]$.

Therefore, the points that satisfy the equation are all the points in the square with vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(8, -8)$, and the points in the square with vertices at $(5, 5)$, $(5, -5)$, $(-5, -5)$, and $(-5, 5)$. These two squares overlap at their centers, forming a larger square with side length $10$ and vertices at $(5, 5)$, $(5, -5)$, $(-5, -5)$, and $(-5, 5)$.

The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. So, the area of the convex polygon is $100$. The answer is: $100$

Assistant:


The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. 

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. This expression is zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us a square with side length 10, centered at the origin.

The second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. This expression is zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us a square with side length 16, centered at the origin.

The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for. This polygon is also a square, with side length equal to the shorter of the two squares, which is 10.

The area of a square with side length $s$ is $s^2$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is equal to zero if and only if both factors are equal to zero. The factors are:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$$
and
$$((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$$

The first factor equals zero if and only if both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only way this can happen is if $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$. So the first factor equals zero on the four lines $x = 10$, $x = -10$, $y = 10$, and $y = -10$.

The second factor equals zero if and only if both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The only way this can happen is if $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So the second factor equals zero on the four lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length $20$, so the area of the square is $20^2 = 400$. The answer is: $400$

Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The equation is satisfied only when both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are:
- For $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.
- For $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, the lines $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.
- For $\vert x \vert = 8$, the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.
- For $\vert y \vert = 8$, the lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.
These lines form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So the area of the convex polygon is 256.
