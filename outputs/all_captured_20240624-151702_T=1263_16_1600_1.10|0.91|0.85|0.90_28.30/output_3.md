Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The given equation is zero only when either of the terms inside the product is zero. This gives us four conditions:

   a. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$  => $\vert x + y \vert = 10$
   
   b. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ => $\vert x - y \vert = 10$
   
   c. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ => $\vert x \vert = 8$
   
   d. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ => $\vert y \vert = 8$

2. To satisfy these conditions, the values of $x$ and $y$ should lie within a square with vertices at $\pm(8,8)$, $\pm(8,-8)$, $\pm(-8,8)$ and $\pm(-8,-8)$.

3. The side length of the square is $16$ (twice the absolute value of the coordinates), so the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

The answer is: $256$

 The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if both factors are equal to zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The first factor is zero if and only if both $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

The second factor is zero if and only if both $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersection of these lines is a square with side length $10$, so the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $100$. The answer is: $100$

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two quadratic expressions equal to zero, which means that at least one of the expressions must be zero. Therefore, we have two separate cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0)$.

From the second case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$.

So the polygon is a square with side length 10 units. The area of a square is given by side length squared, so the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$ square units. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units. The answer is: 100

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The given equation is the product of two terms equals to zero. So, either the first term equals to zero or the second term equals to zero. If one term equals to zero, then the whole product equals to zero. Therefore, the set of points satisfying this equation is the union of the sets of points satisfying each term equals to zero.

1. For the first term, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, this implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. So the points lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.
2. For the second term, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, this implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. So the points lie on the lines $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.
3. For the third term, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, this implies $\vert x \vert = 8$. So the points lie on the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.
4. For the fourth term, $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, this implies $\vert y \vert = 8$. So the points lie on the lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

The set of points satisfying the equation forms a rectangle with vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$. The area of this rectangle is $16 \times 16 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so each of the expressions must be zero individually. This gives us the following four equations:

1. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$
2. $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$
3. $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$
4. $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$

Solving these equations, we find the following points:

1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10 \implies x + y = \pm 10$
2. $\vert x - y \vert = 10 \implies x - y = \pm 10$
3. $\vert x \vert = 8 \implies x = \pm 8$
4. $\vert y \vert = 8 \implies y = \pm 8$

From these equations, we find the following points: $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8), (10, 0), (0, 10), (-10, 0), (0, -10)$. These points form a square with side length 16. The area of the square is therefore $16^2 = 256$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, observe that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
From $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
From $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert x \vert = 8$, which implies $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
From $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

The solutions to these equations are the vertices of the polygon:
$(8,8), (8,-8), (-8,8), (-8,-8), (10,0), (0,10), (-10,0), (0,-10)$.

Now, plot these points on the coordinate plane to visualize the polygon. It's a square with side length $16$, so the area is $16^2 = 256$. The numerical answer is 256. However, it is a positive integer, not an algebraic expression. Hence, the area of the polygon is $256$.
The answer is: $256$
