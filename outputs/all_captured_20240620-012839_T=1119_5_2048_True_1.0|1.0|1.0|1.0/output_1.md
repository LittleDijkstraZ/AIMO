    # The number of all three-digit numbers is 9 * 10 * 10 = 900.
    # The number of blue numbers is 900 / 2 = 450 because each blue number can be matched with another blue number to form a sum.
    # Let y be the number of yellow numbers. The total sum of all three-digit numbers is (111 + 222 + ... + 999) = 499500.
    # The total sum of all blue numbers is 450 * (111 + 999) / 2 = 247500.
    # The total sum of all yellow numbers is the total sum of all three-digit numbers minus the total sum of all blue numbers.
    # Therefore, the total sum of all yellow numbers is 499500 - 247500 = 252000.
    # Because each yellow number can be matched with another yellow number to form a sum, the total sum of all yellow numbers is 2 * y * (111 + 999) / 2 = y * (111 + 999) = y * 1110.
    # Setting up the equation: 252000 = y * 1110.
    y = symbols('y')
    equation = y * 1110 - 252000

227

CODE RESULTS 227

```
The maximum possible number of yellow numbers there can be is $\boxed{227}$.
However, upon closer inspection, it seems that the problem states that the sum of any two yellow numbers should be a blue number. The calculated value of 227 yellow numbers results in having 227 choose 2 = 26,391 yellow-yellow combinations, which is greater than the total number of blue numbers (450). Therefore, it seems there is an inconsistency in the problem statement. The maximum number of yellow numbers should be less than or equal to the total number of blue numbers. Let's reevaluate the problem.

After reevaluating the problem, we realize that for each blue number B, there must be at least one pair of yellow numbers Y1 and Y2 such that B = Y1 + Y2. This implies that the total number of blue numbers should be less than or equal to the number of yellow-yellow combinations.

Let's assume the maximum number of yellow numbers to be the total number of three-digit numbers divided by 2, which is 450. With 450 yellow numbers, the number of yellow-yellow combinations would be 450 choose 2 = 99750, which is much larger than the total number of blue numbers (450). This suggests that the maximum number of yellow numbers should be less than 450.

Let's try a smaller value of yellow numbers. If we select 225 yellow numbers, the number of yellow-yellow combinations would be 225 choose 2 = 26,250, which is still a bit large. However, if we select 224 yellow numbers, the number of yellow-yellow combinations would be 224 choose 2 = 26,148, which is within the acceptable range compared to the total number of blue numbers (450).

Based on this analysis, it seems that the maximum number of yellow numbers is more likely to be 224 rather than 227, considering the inconsistency in the problem statement and the fact that having more than 450 yellow-yellow combinations would exceed the total number of blue numbers.

Therefore, the maximum possible number of yellow numbers there can be is 224.
The value of y in this scenario would be 224.

So, the corrected answer is $\boxed{224}$.

Sorry for the confusion and the mistake in my initial solution. The corrected answer is indeed 224. I apologize again for any misunderstanding caused by my initial incorrect solution. Thank you for your time and understanding.

Approach:


We are given the constraint that the sum of any two yellow numbers is equal to a blue number. This means that if we have $n$ yellow numbers, the set of all possible sums of pairs of yellow numbers will be a subset of the blue numbers.

To find the maximum number of yellow numbers, we need to find the largest set of numbers from $111$ to $999$ such that any pair of numbers sums to a unique number. This is an instance of the Set Partition Problem, which is a well-known NP-complete problem. However, there is a simple observation that can help us find an approximation of the solution: the maximum number of yellow numbers might be close to half of the total number of three-digit numbers.

Let's implement the logic to find the maximum number of yellow numbers in Python:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def max_yellow_numbers():
    total_numbers = 999 - 111 + 1
    max_yellow = total_numbers // 2
    return max_yellow

result = max_yellow_numbers()
print(result)
```

444

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
444
```
The maximum possible number of yellow numbers there can be is 444. However, this is an approximation and not an exact solution. To get an exact solution, we need to use a more complex algorithm or a better approximation. Unfortunately, finding the exact solution to this problem is an open question, and it is not known if there is a polynomial-time algorithm to solve it. Therefore, we cannot provide the exact solution to this problem using sympy. However, we have found the maximum possible number of yellow numbers is approximately half the number of three-digit numbers, which is 444. The answer is: $444$

    # There are a total of 9*9*9 = 729 three-digit numbers from 111 to 999.
    total_numbers = 729

    # If there are y yellow numbers, then the number of blue numbers is total_numbers - y.
    # According to the given condition, for any two yellow numbers, their sum must be a blue number.
    # This implies that for any yellow number y1, the sum y1 + y1 = 2*y1 must also be a blue number.

The maximum possible number of yellow numbers is the number of all three-digit numbers from 111 to 999, which is 999 - 111 + 1 = 899. This is because each number from 111 to 999 can be either blue or yellow, so the maximum number of yellow numbers is the total number of these numbers.
The answer is: $899$

QUESTION 1 - 4 - TIME_SPENT : 207 secs

"Each of the three-digits numbers $111$ to $999$ is coloured blue or yellow in such a way that the sum of any two (not necessarily different) yellow numbers is equal to a blue number. What is the maximum possible number of yellow numbers there can be?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.



To solve this problem, we first observe that the number 111 is a yellow number. Then, we can add 111 to any yellow number to get another yellow number. For example, if $a$ is a yellow number, then $a + 111$ is also a yellow number.

To maximize the number of yellow numbers, we want to use this property to generate as many yellow numbers as possible from the initial yellow number 111.

Since we want to generate as many numbers as possible, we should start with the smallest possible yellow number, which is 111. Then, we can repeatedly add 111 to get more yellow numbers:

1. $111$ (yellow)
2. $111 + 111 = 222$ (yellow)
3. $222 + 111 = 333$ (yellow)
...
$n$th. $111 \times n = nn1$ (yellow), where $nn1$ is the number with digits $n$, $n$, and $1$.

For $n = 9$, we get the largest three-digit number $991$ which is a yellow number.

Now, to show that no more yellow numbers can be generated, suppose there exists a yellow number $xy1$ where $x$ and $y$ are digits, and $x > y$. Then we can repeatedly add 111 to $xy1$ until we reach a number with digits in decreasing order, which can't be a yellow number because adding 111 to a number with digits in decreasing order will always give a number with digits in decreasing order. But this contradicts the given condition that the sum of any two yellow numbers is a blue number. So no more yellow numbers can be generated, and the maximum number of yellow numbers is the number of terms in the sequence $111, 222, ..., 991$, which is 9.

Therefore, the maximum possible number of yellow numbers there can be is 9. The answer is: $9$
