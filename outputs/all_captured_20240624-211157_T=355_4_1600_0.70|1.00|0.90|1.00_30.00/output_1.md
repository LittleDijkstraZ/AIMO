### Instruction:
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"

### Response: Let's think step by step.


First, we notice that the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ can be factored as $(5x - 8y)(x - 5y)$.
Next, we consider the given inequality $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$.
We can rewrite this as $|x - 2y| = |2x - 4| = 40$ and $|y - 2x| = |-y + 2x| = 40$.
This means that $x - 2y = 40$ and $y - 2x = 40$ or $x - 2y = -40$ and $y - 2x = -40$.
We can solve these equations to find the values of $x$ and $y$.
For $x - 2y = 40$ and $y - 2x = 40$, we get $x = 40$ and $y = 20$.
For $x - 2y = -40$ and $y - 2x = -40$, we get $x = -40$ and $y = -20$.
Now, we substitute these values of $x$ and $y$ into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ to find the minimum value.
For $x = 40$ and $y = 20$, we get $5(40)^2 + 5(20)^2 - 8(40)(20) = 8000$.
For $x = -40$ and $y = -20$, we get $5(-40)^2 + 5(-20)^2 - 8(-40)(-20) = 8000$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is $\boxed{8000}$.The answer is: 8000

### Instruction:
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"

### Response: Let's think step by step.


We have the inequality $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
We can rewrite this as $|x-2y|=|2x-y|\leq 40$ and $|y-2x|=|-x+2y|\leq 40$.
From the first inequality, we have $x-2y\geq -40$ and $2x-y\geq -40$.
Adding these inequalities, we get $3x-y\geq -80$.
From the second inequality, we have $y-2x\geq -40$ and $-x+2y\geq -40$.
Adding these inequalities, we get $-x+y\geq -80$.
Now, let's solve the system of inequalities $3x-y\geq -80$ and $-x+y\geq -80$.
Adding these inequalities, we get $2x\geq -64$, so $x\geq -32$.
Subtracting the second inequality from the first, we get $4x\geq -160$, so $x\leq 40$.
Therefore, $-32\leq x\leq 40$.
Similarly, we can solve the system of inequalities $-y+2x\geq -80$ and $y-2x\geq -80$ to find $-40\leq y\leq 40$.
Now, let's substitute these bounds on $x$ and $y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.
The minimum value of this expression occurs when $x$ and $y$ are at the bounds of their ranges.
Substituting $x=-32$ and $y=-40$, we get $5(-32)^2+5(-40)^2-8(-32)(-40)=5(960)+5(1600)-1280=9600+8000-1280=16320$.
Substituting $x=40$ and $y=40$, we get $5(40)^2+5(40)^2-8(40)(40)=5(1600)+5(1600)-3200=8000+8000-3200=12800$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\boxed{12800}$.The answer is: 12800

### Instruction:
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"

### Response: Let's think step by step.


We can rewrite the given equation as $|x-2y| = 40 - |y-2x|$.
This means that either $x-2y = 40 - |y-2x|$ or $x-2y = -(40 - |y-2x|)$.
In the first case, we have $x-2y = 40 - y + 2x$, which simplifies to $x = 20$.
In the second case, we have $x-2y = -40 + y - 2x$, which simplifies to $x = -20$.
So, the possible values of $x$ are $20$ and $-20$.
For $x = 20$, we have $|y-2x| = |y-40|$, which means that either $y-2x = y-40$ or $y-2x = -(y-40)$.
In the first case, we have $y = 40$.
In the second case, we have $y = -20$.
So, the possible values of $y$ for $x = 20$ are $40$ and $-20$.
For $x = -20$, we have $|y-2x| = |y+40|$, which means that either $y-2x = y+40$ or $y-2x = -(y+40)$.
In the first case, we have $y = -20$.
In the second case, we have $y = 60$.
So, the possible values of $y$ for $x = -20$ are $-20$ and $60$.
Now, let's find the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ for the given values of $x$ and $y$.
For $x = 20$ and $y = 40$, we have $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(20)^2+5(40)^2-8(20)(40) = 4000+8000-6400 = 6400$.
For $x = 20$ and $y = -20$, we have $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(20)^2+5(-20)^2-8(20)(-20) = 4000+4000-3200 = 4800$.
For $x = -20$ and $y = -20$, we have $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(-20)^2+5(-20)^2-8(-20)(-20) = 4000+4000-3200 = 4800$.
For $x = -20$ and $y = 60$, we have $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(-20)^2+5(60)^2-8(-20)(60) = 4000+18000-9600 = 26400$.
So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\boxed{4800}$.
The answer is: 4800

### Instruction:
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"

### Response: Let's think step by step.


First, we can rewrite the given expression as $5(x^2-2xy+y^2)$.
We recognize that $x^2-2xy+y^2$ is the square of the distance between the point $(x,y)$ and the origin $(0,0)$.
So, the expression $5(x^2-2xy+y^2)$ represents the square of the distance between the point $(x,y)$ and the center $(0,0)$ of the ellipse.
The equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ represents a diamond shape with vertices at $(20,0)$, $(0,20)$, $(-20,0)$, and $(0,-20)$.
We want to find the minimum value of the expression $5(x^2-2xy+y^2)$, which represents the square of the distance between the point $(x,y)$ and the center $(0,0)$ of the ellipse.
Since the minimum value of the square of a distance is 0 (when the point is at the center), the minimum value of the expression $5(x^2-2xy+y^2)$ is $\boxed{0}$.
The answer is: 0
