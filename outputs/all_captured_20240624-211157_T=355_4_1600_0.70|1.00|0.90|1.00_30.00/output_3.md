Below is an instruction that describes a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!). Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

### Response: Let's think step by step.


First, we can simplify the equation as follows:
$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$
$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

Next, let's consider the two cases separately:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
Since the square of a real number is always nonnegative, the only way for this equation to hold is if both terms are equal to 0.
This means that $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$.
Simplifying these equations, we find that $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$.
Adding these equations, we get $2x = 20$, so $x = 10$.
Substituting this value back into $x + y = 10$, we find that $y = 0$.
Therefore, the only point that satisfies this case is $(10, 0)$.

2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
Similarly, the only way for this equation to hold is if both terms are equal to 0.
This means that $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.
Simplifying these equations, we find that $x = 8$ and $y = 8$.
Therefore, the only point that satisfies this case is $(8, 8)$.

So, the two points that satisfy the equation are $(10, 0)$ and $(8, 8)$.

Now, let's find the vertices of the convex polygon formed by these two points.
Using the distance formula, we find that the distance between $(10, 0)$ and $(8, 8)$ is $\sqrt{(10-8)^2 + (0-8)^2} = \sqrt{16 + 64} = \sqrt{80}$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $\frac{1}{2} \times \sqrt{80} \times \sqrt{80} = \boxed{16\sqrt{2}}$.

The answer is: 16\sqrt{2}

Below is an instruction that describes a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!). Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

### Response: Let's think step by step.


First, we can simplify the expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ by expanding and simplifying.
Second, we can analyze the simplified expression to find the conditions for the points $(x, y)$ to satisfy the equation.
Third, we can draw a diagram to visualize the conditions and determine the shape of the convex polygon.
Finally, we can calculate the area of the convex polygon using the formula for the area of a polygon.

Since the problem asks for a numerical answer, we cannot determine the exact value of the area without further simplification.
However, we can state that the area of the convex polygon is a positive numerical value.
The answer is: 0

Below is an instruction that describes a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!). Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

### Response: Let's think step by step.


First, let's consider the first factor of the equation:
$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$
Since the squares of real numbers are always nonnegative, the only way for the sum of two squares to be zero is if both squares are zero.
So, we have two cases to consider:
Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
This means that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$.
Case 2: $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
This means that $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
Now, let's consider the second factor of the equation:
$$((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$
Again, the only way for the sum of two squares to be zero is if both squares are zero.
So, we have two cases to consider:
Case 1: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
This means that $\vert x \vert = 8$.
Case 2: $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
This means that $\vert y \vert = 8$.
Now, let's analyze each case:
Case 1: $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$
This means that $x + y = 10$ and $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
Similarly, we can analyze the other cases:
Case 2: $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$
Case 3: $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$
Case 4: $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$
From these cases, we can see that the points that satisfy the equation are:
$(8, 2), (8, -2), (-8, 2), (-8, -2), (2, 8), (2, -8), (-2, 8), (-2, -8)$
These points form a square with side length 10.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $10 \times 10 = \boxed{100}$.The answer is: 100

Below is an instruction that describes a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!). Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

### Response: Let's think step by step.


First, we notice that the expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if at least one of the terms inside the parentheses is equal to zero.
Let's consider the case when $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$.
This means that either $(x + y - 10)^2 + (x - y - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(x + y - 10)^2 + (x - y + 10)^2 = 0$.
In the first case, we have $(x + y - 10)^2 + (x - y - 10)^2 = 0$, which simplifies to $2x^2 - 20x + 2y^2 - 40y + 100 = 0$.
Since all the coefficients are positive, this equation has no real solutions.
In the second case, we have $(x + y - 10)^2 + (x - y + 10)^2 = 0$, which simplifies to $2x^2 + 2y^2 - 20x + 20y + 100 = 0$.
Again, since all the coefficients are positive, this equation also has no real solutions.
Therefore, the case when $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$ does not yield any solutions.
Now, let's consider the case when $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
This means that either $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(-\vert x \vert + 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
In the first case, we have $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which simplifies to $x^2 + y^2 - 16x + 16y + 64 = 0$.
Again, since all the coefficients are positive, this equation has no real solutions.
In the second case, we have $(-\vert x \vert + 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which simplifies to $-x^2 + y^2 + 16x + 16y + 64 = 0$.
This equation also has no real solutions since all the coefficients are positive.
Therefore, the case when $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ does not yield any solutions either.
Finally, we conclude that the expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if all the terms inside the parentheses are equal to zero.
This means that the points $\left(x, y\right)$ must satisfy the following conditions:
$\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$, $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$, and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.
Solving these equations, we find that the points $\left(x, y\right)$ must be on the lines $x + y = 10$, $x - y = 10$, $x = 8$, and $y = 8$.
These four lines intersect at the points $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$.
Therefore, the convex polygon enclosed by these points is a square with side length 16.
The area of this square is $16 \times 16 = \boxed{256}$.The answer is: 256
