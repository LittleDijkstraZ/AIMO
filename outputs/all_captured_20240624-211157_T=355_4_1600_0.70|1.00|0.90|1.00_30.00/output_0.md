### Instruction:
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"

### Response: Let's think step by step.


First, we find the $x$-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$ by solving the system of equations $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$ and $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$.
Simplifying the equation, we get $kx^2 - 2kx + (l-4) = 0$.
Let $r_1$ and $r_2$ be the roots of this quadratic equation.
By Vieta's formulas, we have $r_1 + r_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $r_1r_2 = \frac{l-4}{k}$.
Since $A$ and $B$ are distance 6 apart, we have $(r_1 - r_2)^2 = 6^2$.
Expanding, we get $r_1^2 - 2r_1r_2 + r_2^2 = 36$.
Substituting $r_1r_2 = \frac{l-4}{k}$, we get $r_1^2 - 2\left(\frac{l-4}{k}\right) + r_2^2 = 36$.
Multiplying through by $k$, we get $kr_1^2 - 2(l-4) + kr_2^2 = 36k$.
Since $kr_1^2 + kr_2^2 = k(r_1^2 + r_2^2)$, we can rewrite the equation as $k(r_1^2 + r_2^2) - 2(l-4) + 36k = 36k$.
Simplifying, we get $k(r_1^2 + r_2^2) - 2l + 40k = 0$.
Factoring out a $k$, we get $k(r_1^2 + r_2^2 - 2l + 40) = 0$.
Since $k > 0$, we have $r_1^2 + r_2^2 - 2l + 40 = 0$.
Substituting $r_1 + r_2 = 2$, we get $(r_1^2 - 2r_1 + 1) + (r_2^2 - 2r_2 + 1) - 2l + 40 = 0$.
Expanding and simplifying, we get $2 + 2(r_1 - 1)^2 + 2(r_2 - 1)^2 - 2l + 40 = 0$.
This simplifies to $2(r_1 - 1)^2 + 2(r_2 - 1)^2 - 2l + 38 = 0$.
Since $r_1 - 1$ and $r_2 - 1$ are the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin, respectively,
the sum of the squares of these distances is $2(r_1 - 1)^2 + 2(r_2 - 1)^2$.
Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $2(r_1 - 1)^2 + 2(r_2 - 1)^2 = \boxed{38}$.The answer is: 38

Below is an instruction that describes a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!). Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"

### Response: Let's think step by step.


Since the parabola intersects the line $y=4$ at two points $A$ and $B$, we know that $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$.
This is a quadratic equation in terms of $x$.
Since $A$ and $B$ are 6 units apart, we can set up the following equation:
$(x_1 - x_2)^2 + (y_1 - y_2)^2 = 6^2$, where $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ are the coordinates of $A$ and $B$ respectively.
Substituting $y_1 = y_2 = 4$, we have $(x_1 - x_2)^2 + (0 - 0)^2 = 36$.
Simplifying, we get $(x_1 - x_2)^2 = 36$.
Now, we need to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin.
The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$.
So, the sum of the squares of the distances is $(x_1^2 + y_1^2) + (x_2^2 + y_2^2)$.
Substituting $y_1 = y_2 = 4$, we have $(x_1^2 + 4^2) + (x_2^2 + 4^2)$.
Simplifying, we get $x_1^2 + 16 + x_2^2 + 16$.
Since we know that $(x_1 - x_2)^2 = 36$, we can write $x_1^2 - 2x_1x_2 + x_2^2 = 36$.
Adding $4(x_1^2 + x_2^2)$ to both sides, we have $4(x_1^2 + x_2^2) + 4(x_1x_2) = 36 + 4(x_1x_2)$.
Since $x_1x_2$ is positive, we can simplify the equation to $3(x_1^2 + x_2^2) = 36$.
Dividing both sides by 3, we have $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = 12$.
Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $12 + 12 = \boxed{24}$.The answer is: 24

"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"

### Response: Let's think step by step.


We have the equation $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$.
This means the parabola is symmetric about the line $y = 4$.
Since the distance from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is 6,
the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $6^2 + 6^2 = 12^2 = 144$.
Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{144}$.
The answer is: 144

### Instruction:
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"

### Response: Let's think step by step.


We are given that the parabola intersects the line $y=4$ at two points $A$ and $B$.
Since the parabola is a downward-opening parabola, the points $A$ and $B$ must be on the top of the parabola.
The equation of the line $y=4$ can be rewritten as $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$.
To find the coordinates of points $A$ and $B$, we can solve this equation for $x$.
Simplifying the equation, we get $kx^2 - 2kx + (l-4) = 0$.
Since the parabola intersects the line at two points, this quadratic equation must have two distinct solutions for $x$.
For a quadratic equation to have two distinct solutions, the discriminant must be greater than 0.
The discriminant is $(-2k)^2 - 4(k)(l-4) = 4k^2 - 4kl + 16$.
We are given that the distance between points $A$ and $B$ is 6.
The distance between two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is given by the distance formula $\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$.
So, the distance between points $A$ and $B$ is $\sqrt{(x_B - x_A)^2 + (y_B - y_A)^2}$.
From the equation of the parabola, we can see that $y_A = kx_A^2 - 2kx_A + l$ and $y_B = kx_B^2 - 2kx_B + l$.
Substituting these expressions into the distance formula, we get $\sqrt{(x_B - x_A)^2 + (kx_B^2 - 2kx_B + l - (kx_A^2 - 2kx_A + l))^2}$.
Simplifying this expression, we get $\sqrt{(x_B - x_A)^2 + (kx_B^2 - kx_A^2 - 4kx_B + 4kx_A)^2}$.
Expanding and simplifying further, we get $\sqrt{(x_B - x_A)^2 + (2k(x_B - x_A) - 4k(x_B - x_A))^2}$.
Simplifying again, we get $\sqrt{(x_B - x_A)^2 + (2k(x_B - x_A))^2}$.
Since we are given that the distance between points $A$ and $B$ is 6, we can write this as $\sqrt{(x_B - x_A)^2 + (2k(x_B - x_A))^2} = 6$.
Squaring both sides of the equation, we get $(x_B - x_A)^2 + (2k(x_B - x_A))^2 = 36$.
Expanding and simplifying, we get $(x_B - x_A)^2 + 4k^2(x_B - x_A)^2 = 36$.
Adding $4k^2(x_B - x_A)^2$ to both sides of the equation, we get $5k^2(x_B - x_A)^2 = 36$.
Dividing both sides of the equation by $5k^2$, we get $(x_B - x_A)^2 = \frac{36}{5k^2}$.
Since the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $(x_B - x_A)^2 + (y_B - y_A)^2$, we can substitute the expression for $(x_B - x_A)^2$ into this equation.
So, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $\frac{36}{5k^2} + (y_B - y_A)^2$.
We are asked to find this sum, so the answer is $\boxed{\frac{36}{5k^2} + (y_B - y_A)^2}$.The answer is: 5
