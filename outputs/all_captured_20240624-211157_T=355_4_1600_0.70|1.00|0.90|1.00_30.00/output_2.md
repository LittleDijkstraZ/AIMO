### Instruction:
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"

### Response: Let's think step by step.


First, we need to understand the given equation.
We have two absolute values, so we can consider two cases:
Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert > \frac{m}{100}$
Case 2: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert < \frac{m}{100}$
For Case 1, we have two possibilities:
1. $\vert x-1 \vert > \frac{m+2}{100}$ and $\vert -2 \vert \geq 0$
2. $\vert x-1 \vert \geq \frac{m+2}{100}$ and $\vert -2 \vert < 0$
For Case 2, we also have two possibilities:
1. $\vert x-1 \vert < \frac{m+2}{100}$ and $\vert -2 \vert \geq 0$
2. $\vert x-1 \vert \leq \frac{m+2}{100}$ and $\vert -2 \vert < 0$
We can solve each case separately and find the range of values for $m$ that satisfy the given condition.
For Case 1.1, we have $\vert x-1 \vert > \frac{m+2}{100}$ and $\vert -2 \vert \geq 0$, which means $m+2 \geq 0$.
For Case 1.2, we have $\vert x-1 \vert \geq \frac{m+2}{100}$ and $\vert -2 \vert < 0$, which means $m+2 < 0$.
For Case 2.1, we have $\vert x-1 \vert < \frac{m+2}{100}$ and $\vert -2 \vert \geq 0$, which means $m+2 \geq 0$.
For Case 2.2, we have $\vert x-1 \vert \leq \frac{m+2}{100}$ and $\vert -2 \vert < 0$, which means $m+2 < 0$.
Combining all the cases, we find that $m$ must satisfy $m+2 \geq 0$ and $m+2 < 0$, which gives us $0 \leq m \leq -2$.
Since $m$ must be a positive integer, the possible values for $m$ are $0, 1$.
Therefore, there are $\boxed{2}$ positive integers $m$ that satisfy the given condition.
The answer is: 2

Below is an instruction that describes a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!). Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"

### Response: Let's think step by step.


First, let's simplify the equation.
We have $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.
Since the absolute value of a number is always nonnegative, we can rewrite the equation as $\vert \vert x-1 \vert \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$.
Next, let's consider the possible values of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert \vert$.
Since the absolute value of a number is always nonnegative, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert \vert$ can be either $x-1$ or $-(x-1)$.
So, we can rewrite the equation as $(x-1) -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ or $-(x-1) -2 = \frac{m}{100}$.
Simplifying these equations, we get $x-1 -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ or $-(x-1) -2 = \frac{m}{100}$.
Simplifying further, we have $x-3 = \frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 = \frac{m}{100}$.
Solving for $x$ in each equation, we get $x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$ or $x = \frac{m}{100} + 1$.
To have 4 distinct solutions, we need the four possible values of $x$ to be different.
This means that $\frac{m}{100} + 3$, $\frac{m}{100} + 1$, $\frac{m}{100} + 2$, and $\frac{m}{100} + 4$ must all be different.
We can set up an inequality to represent this: \[ \frac{m}{100} + 3 > \frac{m}{100} + 1 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{m}{100} + 1 < \frac{m}{100} + 2 < \frac{m}{100} + 4.\]
Simplifying the inequalities, we get $2 > 0$ and $0 < 1 < 2$.
Since these inequalities are always true, we can conclude that there are $\boxed{100}$ positive integers $m$ that satisfy the given conditions.
The answer is: 100

### Instruction:
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"

### Response: Let's think step by step.


First, we simplify the equation:
\[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\]
\[\vert x-1-2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\]
\[\vert x-3 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\]
There are two cases we need to consider: $x-3 \ge 0$ and $x-3 < 0$.
For the first case, we have:
\[x-3 \ge 0\]
\[x \ge 3\]
For the second case, we have:
\[x-3 < 0\]
\[x < 3\]
Combining the two cases, we have:
\[x \in [3, \infty)\]
So, the equation has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $m$ is a positive integer such that $\frac{m}{100} \in [1, 2)$.
In other words, $m$ should be a positive integer such that $1 \le \frac{m}{100} < 2$.
Multiplying both sides by 100, we have $100 \le m < 200$.
The number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality is $200 - 100 + 1 = \boxed{101}$.
The answer is: 101

### Instruction:
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"

### Response: Let's think step by step.


First, let's consider the expression inside the absolute value signs: $|x-1| - 2|$.
If $x-1$ is positive, then $|x-1|=x-1$ and $|2|=2$.
So, the expression becomes $(x-1)-2=x-3$.
If $x-1$ is negative, then $|x-1|=-(x-1)=-x+1$ and $|2|=2$.
So, the expression becomes $(-x+1)-2=-x-1$.
Therefore, the equation becomes $x-3=m/100$ and $-x-1=m/100$.
To have $4$ distinct solutions, the two equations must have $4$ distinct values for $x$.
From the first equation, we have $x=(m/100)+3$.
From the second equation, we have $x=-(m/100)-1$.
Setting these two expressions for $x$ equal, we have $(m/100)+3=-(m/100)-1$.
Simplifying, we have $2m/100=2$, so $m=100$.
Therefore, there is only $\boxed{1}$ positive integer $m$ that satisfies the given conditions.
The answer is: 1
