### Instruction:
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"

### Response: Let's think step by step.


First, we find the $x$-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$ by solving the system of equations $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$ and $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$.
Simplifying the equation, we get $kx^2 - 2kx + (l-4) = 0$.
Let $r_1$ and $r_2$ be the roots of this quadratic equation.
By Vieta's formulas, we have $r_1 + r_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $r_1r_2 = \frac{l-4}{k}$.
Since $A$ and $B$ are distance 6 apart, we have $(r_1 - r_2)^2 = 6^2$.
Expanding, we get $r_1^2 - 2r_1r_2 + r_2^2 = 36$.
Substituting $r_1r_2 = \frac{l-4}{k}$, we get $r_1^2 - 2\left(\frac{l-4}{k}\right) + r_2^2 = 36$.
Multiplying through by $k$, we get $kr_1^2 - 2(l-4) + kr_2^2 = 36k$.
Since $kr_1^2 + kr_2^2 = k(r_1^2 + r_2^2)$, we can rewrite the equation as $k(r_1^2 + r_2^2) - 2(l-4) + 36k = 36k$.
Simplifying, we get $k(r_1^2 + r_2^2) - 2l + 40k = 0$.
Factoring out a $k$, we get $k(r_1^2 + r_2^2 - 2l + 40) = 0$.
Since $k > 0$, we have $r_1^2 + r_2^2 - 2l + 40 = 0$.
Substituting $r_1 + r_2 = 2$, we get $(r_1^2 - 2r_1 + 1) + (r_2^2 - 2r_2 + 1) - 2l + 40 = 0$.
Expanding and simplifying, we get $2 + 2(r_1 - 1)^2 + 2(r_2 - 1)^2 - 2l + 40 = 0$.
This simplifies to $2(r_1 - 1)^2 + 2(r_2 - 1)^2 - 2l + 38 = 0$.
Since $r_1 - 1$ and $r_2 - 1$ are the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin, respectively,
the sum of the squares of these distances is $2(r_1 - 1)^2 + 2(r_2 - 1)^2$.
Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $2(r_1 - 1)^2 + 2(r_2 - 1)^2 = \boxed{38}$.The answer is: 38

Below is an instruction that describes a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!). Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"

### Response: Let's think step by step.


Since the parabola intersects the line $y=4$ at two points $A$ and $B$, we know that $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$.
This is a quadratic equation in terms of $x$.
Since $A$ and $B$ are 6 units apart, we can set up the following equation:
$(x_1 - x_2)^2 + (y_1 - y_2)^2 = 6^2$, where $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ are the coordinates of $A$ and $B$ respectively.
Substituting $y_1 = y_2 = 4$, we have $(x_1 - x_2)^2 + (0 - 0)^2 = 36$.
Simplifying, we get $(x_1 - x_2)^2 = 36$.
Now, we need to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin.
The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$.
So, the sum of the squares of the distances is $(x_1^2 + y_1^2) + (x_2^2 + y_2^2)$.
Substituting $y_1 = y_2 = 4$, we have $(x_1^2 + 4^2) + (x_2^2 + 4^2)$.
Simplifying, we get $x_1^2 + 16 + x_2^2 + 16$.
Since we know that $(x_1 - x_2)^2 = 36$, we can write $x_1^2 - 2x_1x_2 + x_2^2 = 36$.
Adding $4(x_1^2 + x_2^2)$ to both sides, we have $4(x_1^2 + x_2^2) + 4(x_1x_2) = 36 + 4(x_1x_2)$.
Since $x_1x_2$ is positive, we can simplify the equation to $3(x_1^2 + x_2^2) = 36$.
Dividing both sides by 3, we have $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = 12$.
Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $12 + 12 = \boxed{24}$.The answer is: 24

### Response: Let's think step by step.


We have the equation $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$.
This means the parabola is symmetric about the line $y = 4$.
Since the distance from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is 6,
the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $6^2 + 6^2 = 12^2 = 144$.
Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{144}$.

### Response: Let's think step by step.


We are given that the parabola intersects the line $y=4$ at two points $A$ and $B$.
Since the parabola is a downward-opening parabola, the points $A$ and $B$ must be on the top of the parabola.
The equation of the line $y=4$ can be rewritten as $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$.
To find the coordinates of points $A$ and $B$, we can solve this equation for $x$.
Simplifying the equation, we get $kx^2 - 2kx + (l-4) = 0$.
Since the parabola intersects the line at two points, this quadratic equation must have two distinct solutions for $x$.
For a quadratic equation to have two distinct solutions, the discriminant must be greater than 0.
The discriminant is $(-2k)^2 - 4(k)(l-4) = 4k^2 - 4kl + 16$.
We are given that the distance between points $A$ and $B$ is 6.
The distance between two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is given by the distance formula $\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$.
So, the distance between points $A$ and $B$ is $\sqrt{(x_B - x_A)^2 + (y_B - y_A)^2}$.
From the equation of the parabola, we can see that $y_A = kx_A^2 - 2kx_A + l$ and $y_B = kx_B^2 - 2kx_B + l$.
Substituting these expressions into the distance formula, we get $\sqrt{(x_B - x_A)^2 + (kx_B^2 - 2kx_B + l - (kx_A^2 - 2kx_A + l))^2}$.
Simplifying this expression, we get $\sqrt{(x_B - x_A)^2 + (kx_B^2 - kx_A^2 - 4kx_B + 4kx_A)^2}$.
Expanding and simplifying further, we get $\sqrt{(x_B - x_A)^2 + (2k(x_B - x_A) - 4k(x_B - x_A))^2}$.
Simplifying again, we get $\sqrt{(x_B - x_A)^2 + (2k(x_B - x_A))^2}$.
Since we are given that the distance between points $A$ and $B$ is 6, we can write this as $\sqrt{(x_B - x_A)^2 + (2k(x_B - x_A))^2} = 6$.
Squaring both sides of the equation, we get $(x_B - x_A)^2 + (2k(x_B - x_A))^2 = 36$.
Expanding and simplifying, we get $(x_B - x_A)^2 + 4k^2(x_B - x_A)^2 = 36$.
Adding $4k^2(x_B - x_A)^2$ to both sides of the equation, we get $5k^2(x_B - x_A)^2 = 36$.
Dividing both sides of the equation by $5k^2$, we get $(x_B - x_A)^2 = \frac{36}{5k^2}$.
Since the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $(x_B - x_A)^2 + (y_B - y_A)^2$, we can substitute the expression for $(x_B - x_A)^2$ into this equation.
So, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $\frac{36}{5k^2} + (y_B - y_A)^2$.
We are asked to find this sum, so the answer is $\boxed{\frac{36}{5k^2} + (y_B - y_A)^2}$.The answer is: 5

Below is an instruction that describes a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!). Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"

### Response: Let's think step by step.


First, we notice that the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ can be factored as $(5x - 8y)(x - 5y)$.
Next, we consider the given inequality $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$.
We can rewrite this as $|x - 2y| = |2x - 4| = 40$ and $|y - 2x| = |-y + 2x| = 40$.
This means that $x - 2y = 40$ and $y - 2x = 40$ or $x - 2y = -40$ and $y - 2x = -40$.
We can solve these equations to find the values of $x$ and $y$.
For $x - 2y = 40$ and $y - 2x = 40$, we get $x = 40$ and $y = 20$.
For $x - 2y = -40$ and $y - 2x = -40$, we get $x = -40$ and $y = -20$.
Now, we substitute these values of $x$ and $y$ into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ to find the minimum value.
For $x = 40$ and $y = 20$, we get $5(40)^2 + 5(20)^2 - 8(40)(20) = 8000$.
For $x = -40$ and $y = -20$, we get $5(-40)^2 + 5(-20)^2 - 8(-40)(-20) = 8000$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is $\boxed{8000}$.The answer is: 8000

### Instruction:
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"

### Response: Let's think step by step.


We have the inequality $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
We can rewrite this as $|x-2y|=|2x-y|\leq 40$ and $|y-2x|=|-x+2y|\leq 40$.
From the first inequality, we have $x-2y\geq -40$ and $2x-y\geq -40$.
Adding these inequalities, we get $3x-y\geq -80$.
From the second inequality, we have $y-2x\geq -40$ and $-x+2y\geq -40$.
Adding these inequalities, we get $-x+y\geq -80$.
Now, let's solve the system of inequalities $3x-y\geq -80$ and $-x+y\geq -80$.
Adding these inequalities, we get $2x\geq -64$, so $x\geq -32$.
Subtracting the second inequality from the first, we get $4x\geq -160$, so $x\leq 40$.
Therefore, $-32\leq x\leq 40$.
Similarly, we can solve the system of inequalities $-y+2x\geq -80$ and $y-2x\geq -80$ to find $-40\leq y\leq 40$.
Now, let's substitute these bounds on $x$ and $y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.
The minimum value of this expression occurs when $x$ and $y$ are at the bounds of their ranges.
Substituting $x=-32$ and $y=-40$, we get $5(-32)^2+5(-40)^2-8(-32)(-40)=5(960)+5(1600)-1280=9600+8000-1280=16320$.
Substituting $x=40$ and $y=40$, we get $5(40)^2+5(40)^2-8(40)(40)=5(1600)+5(1600)-3200=8000+8000-3200=12800$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\boxed{12800}$.The answer is: 12800

### Instruction:
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"

### Response: Let's think step by step.


We can rewrite the given equation as $|x-2y| = 40 - |y-2x|$.
This means that either $x-2y = 40 - |y-2x|$ or $x-2y = -(40 - |y-2x|)$.
In the first case, we have $x-2y = 40 - y + 2x$, which simplifies to $x = 20$.
In the second case, we have $x-2y = -40 + y - 2x$, which simplifies to $x = -20$.
So, the possible values of $x$ are $20$ and $-20$.
For $x = 20$, we have $|y-2x| = |y-40|$, which means that either $y-2x = y-40$ or $y-2x = -(y-40)$.
In the first case, we have $y = 40$.
In the second case, we have $y = -20$.
So, the possible values of $y$ for $x = 20$ are $40$ and $-20$.
For $x = -20$, we have $|y-2x| = |y+40|$, which means that either $y-2x = y+40$ or $y-2x = -(y+40)$.
In the first case, we have $y = -20$.
In the second case, we have $y = 60$.
So, the possible values of $y$ for $x = -20$ are $-20$ and $60$.
Now, let's find the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ for the given values of $x$ and $y$.
For $x = 20$ and $y = 40$, we have $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(20)^2+5(40)^2-8(20)(40) = 4000+8000-6400 = 6400$.
For $x = 20$ and $y = -20$, we have $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(20)^2+5(-20)^2-8(20)(-20) = 4000+4000-3200 = 4800$.
For $x = -20$ and $y = -20$, we have $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(-20)^2+5(-20)^2-8(-20)(-20) = 4000+4000-3200 = 4800$.
For $x = -20$ and $y = 60$, we have $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(-20)^2+5(60)^2-8(-20)(60) = 4000+18000-9600 = 26400$.
So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\boxed{4800}$.
The answer is: 4800

### Instruction:
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"

### Response: Let's think step by step.


First, we can rewrite the given expression as $5(x^2-2xy+y^2)$.
We recognize that $x^2-2xy+y^2$ is the square of the distance between the point $(x,y)$ and the origin $(0,0)$.
So, the expression $5(x^2-2xy+y^2)$ represents the square of the distance between the point $(x,y)$ and the center $(0,0)$ of the ellipse.
The equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ represents a diamond shape with vertices at $(20,0)$, $(0,20)$, $(-20,0)$, and $(0,-20)$.
We want to find the minimum value of the expression $5(x^2-2xy+y^2)$, which represents the square of the distance between the point $(x,y)$ and the center $(0,0)$ of the ellipse.
Since the minimum value of the square of a distance is 0 (when the point is at the center), the minimum value of the expression $5(x^2-2xy+y^2)$ is $\boxed{0}$.

Below is an instruction that describes a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!). Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"

### Response: Let's think step by step.


First, we need to understand the given equation.
We have two absolute values, so we can consider two cases:
Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert > \frac{m}{100}$
Case 2: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert < \frac{m}{100}$
For Case 1, we have two possibilities:
1. $\vert x-1 \vert > \frac{m+2}{100}$ and $\vert -2 \vert \geq 0$
2. $\vert x-1 \vert \geq \frac{m+2}{100}$ and $\vert -2 \vert < 0$
For Case 2, we also have two possibilities:
1. $\vert x-1 \vert < \frac{m+2}{100}$ and $\vert -2 \vert \geq 0$
2. $\vert x-1 \vert \leq \frac{m+2}{100}$ and $\vert -2 \vert < 0$
We can solve each case separately and find the range of values for $m$ that satisfy the given condition.
For Case 1.1, we have $\vert x-1 \vert > \frac{m+2}{100}$ and $\vert -2 \vert \geq 0$, which means $m+2 \geq 0$.
For Case 1.2, we have $\vert x-1 \vert \geq \frac{m+2}{100}$ and $\vert -2 \vert < 0$, which means $m+2 < 0$.
For Case 2.1, we have $\vert x-1 \vert < \frac{m+2}{100}$ and $\vert -2 \vert \geq 0$, which means $m+2 \geq 0$.
For Case 2.2, we have $\vert x-1 \vert \leq \frac{m+2}{100}$ and $\vert -2 \vert < 0$, which means $m+2 < 0$.
Combining all the cases, we find that $m$ must satisfy $m+2 \geq 0$ and $m+2 < 0$, which gives us $0 \leq m \leq -2$.
Since $m$ must be a positive integer, the possible values for $m$ are $0, 1$.
Therefore, there are $\boxed{2}$ positive integers $m$ that satisfy the given condition.
The answer is: 2

### Instruction:
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"

### Response: Let's think step by step.


First, let's simplify the equation.
We have $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.
Since the absolute value of a number is always nonnegative, we can rewrite the equation as $\vert \vert x-1 \vert \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$.
Next, let's consider the possible values of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert \vert$.
Since the absolute value of a number is always nonnegative, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert \vert$ can be either $x-1$ or $-(x-1)$.
So, we can rewrite the equation as $(x-1) -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ or $-(x-1) -2 = \frac{m}{100}$.
Simplifying these equations, we get $x-1 -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ or $-(x-1) -2 = \frac{m}{100}$.
Simplifying further, we have $x-3 = \frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 = \frac{m}{100}$.
Solving for $x$ in each equation, we get $x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$ or $x = \frac{m}{100} + 1$.
To have 4 distinct solutions, we need the four possible values of $x$ to be different.
This means that $\frac{m}{100} + 3$, $\frac{m}{100} + 1$, $\frac{m}{100} + 2$, and $\frac{m}{100} + 4$ must all be different.
We can set up an inequality to represent this: \[ \frac{m}{100} + 3 > \frac{m}{100} + 1 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{m}{100} + 1 < \frac{m}{100} + 2 < \frac{m}{100} + 4.\]
Simplifying the inequalities, we get $2 > 0$ and $0 < 1 < 2$.
Since these inequalities are always true, we can conclude that there are $\boxed{100}$ positive integers $m$ that satisfy the given conditions.
The answer is: 100

There are two cases we need to consider: $x-3 \ge 0$ and $x-3 < 0$.
For the first case, we have:
\[x-3 \ge 0\]
\[x \ge 3\]
For the second case, we have:
\[x-3 < 0\]
\[x < 3\]
Combining the two cases, we have:
\[x \in [3, \infty)\]
So, the equation has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $m$ is a positive integer such that $\frac{m}{100} \in [1, 2)$.
In other words, $m$ should be a positive integer such that $1 \le \frac{m}{100} < 2$.
Multiplying both sides by 100, we have $100 \le m < 200$.
The number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality is $200 - 100 + 1 = \boxed{101}$.
The answer is: 101

Below is an instruction that describes a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!). Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"

### Response: Let's think step by step.


First, let's consider the expression inside the absolute value signs: $|x-1| - 2|$.
If $x-1$ is positive, then $|x-1|=x-1$ and $|2|=2$.
So, the expression becomes $(x-1)-2=x-3$.
If $x-1$ is negative, then $|x-1|=-(x-1)=-x+1$ and $|2|=2$.
So, the expression becomes $(-x+1)-2=-x-1$.
Therefore, the equation becomes $x-3=m/100$ and $-x-1=m/100$.
To have $4$ distinct solutions, the two equations must have $4$ distinct values for $x$.
From the first equation, we have $x=(m/100)+3$.
From the second equation, we have $x=-(m/100)-1$.
Setting these two expressions for $x$ equal, we have $(m/100)+3=-(m/100)-1$.
Simplifying, we have $2m/100=2$, so $m=100$.
Therefore, there is only $\boxed{1}$ positive integer $m$ that satisfies the given conditions.
The answer is: 1

Below is an instruction that describes a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!). Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

### Response: Let's think step by step.


First, we can simplify the equation as follows:
$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$
$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

Next, let's consider the two cases separately:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
Since the square of a real number is always nonnegative, the only way for this equation to hold is if both terms are equal to 0.
This means that $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$.
Simplifying these equations, we find that $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$.
Adding these equations, we get $2x = 20$, so $x = 10$.
Substituting this value back into $x + y = 10$, we find that $y = 0$.
Therefore, the only point that satisfies this case is $(10, 0)$.

2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
Similarly, the only way for this equation to hold is if both terms are equal to 0.
This means that $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.
Simplifying these equations, we find that $x = 8$ and $y = 8$.
Therefore, the only point that satisfies this case is $(8, 8)$.

So, the two points that satisfy the equation are $(10, 0)$ and $(8, 8)$.

Now, let's find the vertices of the convex polygon formed by these two points.
Using the distance formula, we find that the distance between $(10, 0)$ and $(8, 8)$ is $\sqrt{(10-8)^2 + (0-8)^2} = \sqrt{16 + 64} = \sqrt{80}$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $\frac{1}{2} \times \sqrt{80} \times \sqrt{80} = \boxed{16\sqrt{2}}$.

The answer is: 16\sqrt{2}

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

### Response: Let's think step by step.


First, we can simplify the expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ by expanding and simplifying.
Second, we can analyze the simplified expression to find the conditions for the points $(x, y)$ to satisfy the equation.
Third, we can draw a diagram to visualize the conditions and determine the shape of the convex polygon.
Finally, we can calculate the area of the convex polygon using the formula for the area of a polygon.

Since the problem asks for a numerical answer, we cannot determine the exact value of the area without further simplification.
However, we can state that the area of the convex polygon is a positive numerical value.
The answer is: 0

### Instruction:
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

### Response: Let's think step by step.


First, let's consider the first factor of the equation:
$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$
Since the squares of real numbers are always nonnegative, the only way for the sum of two squares to be zero is if both squares are zero.
So, we have two cases to consider:
Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
This means that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$.
Case 2: $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
This means that $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
Now, let's consider the second factor of the equation:
$$((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$
Again, the only way for the sum of two squares to be zero is if both squares are zero.
So, we have two cases to consider:
Case 1: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
This means that $\vert x \vert = 8$.
Case 2: $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
This means that $\vert y \vert = 8$.
Now, let's analyze each case:
Case 1: $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$
This means that $x + y = 10$ and $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
Similarly, we can analyze the other cases:
Case 2: $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$
Case 3: $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$
Case 4: $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$
From these cases, we can see that the points that satisfy the equation are:
$(8, 2), (8, -2), (-8, 2), (-8, -2), (2, 8), (2, -8), (-2, 8), (-2, -8)$
These points form a square with side length 10.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $10 \times 10 = \boxed{100}$.The answer is: 100

### Instruction:
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

### Response: Let's think step by step.


First, we notice that the expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if at least one of the terms inside the parentheses is equal to zero.
Let's consider the case when $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$.
This means that either $(x + y - 10)^2 + (x - y - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(x + y - 10)^2 + (x - y + 10)^2 = 0$.
In the first case, we have $(x + y - 10)^2 + (x - y - 10)^2 = 0$, which simplifies to $2x^2 - 20x + 2y^2 - 40y + 100 = 0$.
Since all the coefficients are positive, this equation has no real solutions.
In the second case, we have $(x + y - 10)^2 + (x - y + 10)^2 = 0$, which simplifies to $2x^2 + 2y^2 - 20x + 20y + 100 = 0$.
Again, since all the coefficients are positive, this equation also has no real solutions.
Therefore, the case when $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$ does not yield any solutions.
Now, let's consider the case when $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
This means that either $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(-\vert x \vert + 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
In the first case, we have $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which simplifies to $x^2 + y^2 - 16x + 16y + 64 = 0$.
Again, since all the coefficients are positive, this equation has no real solutions.
In the second case, we have $(-\vert x \vert + 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which simplifies to $-x^2 + y^2 + 16x + 16y + 64 = 0$.
This equation also has no real solutions since all the coefficients are positive.
Therefore, the case when $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ does not yield any solutions either.
Finally, we conclude that the expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if all the terms inside the parentheses are equal to zero.
This means that the points $\left(x, y\right)$ must satisfy the following conditions:
$\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$, $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$, and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.
Solving these equations, we find that the points $\left(x, y\right)$ must be on the lines $x + y = 10$, $x - y = 10$, $x = 8$, and $y = 8$.
These four lines intersect at the points $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$.
Therefore, the convex polygon enclosed by these points is a square with side length 16.
The area of this square is $16 \times 16 = \boxed{256}$.The answer is: 256

Below is an instruction that describes a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!). Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."

### Response: Let's think step by step.


We are given that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.
From the second condition, we can write $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ as $f(2^k n)=2^kf(n)+1$ for any positive integer $k$.
Now, let's compute $f(2^k n)$ for $k=1,2,3,\dots$ until we find a value of $k$ that gives us $f(100)$.
Starting with $k=1$, we have $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.
Since $2n=2^1\cdot n$, this equation is equivalent to $f(2^1 n)=2f(n)+1$.
For $k=2$, we have $f(4n)=2f(2n)+1$.
Since $4n=2^2\cdot n$, this equation is equivalent to $f(2^2 n)=4f(n)+1$.
For $k=3$, we have $f(8n)=2f(4n)+1$.
Since $8n=2^3\cdot n$, this equation is equivalent to $f(2^3 n)=8f(n)+1$.
We continue this process until we find $f(100)$.
If we let $n=1$, we have $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1$.
From the first condition, we have $f(f(f(1)))=f(8-7)=f(1)=1$.
From the second condition, we have $f(2)=2f(1)+1=3$.
From the second condition again, we have $f(4)=2f(2)+1=7$.
From the second condition once more, we have $f(8)=2f(4)+1=15$.
From the second condition again, we have $f(16)=2f(8)+1=31$.
From the second condition once more, we have $f(32)=2f(16)+1=63$.
From the second condition again, we have $f(64)=2f(32)+1=127$.
From the second condition once more, we have $f(128)=2f(64)+1=255$.
From the second condition again, we have $f(256)=2f(128)+1=511$.
From the second condition once more, we have $f(512)=2f(256)+1=1023$.
From the second condition again, we have $f(1024)=2f(512)+1=2047$.
Finally, we have $f(1024)=2047$.
Therefore, $f(100)=\boxed{2047}$.
The answer is: 2047

### Response: Let's think step by step.


We are given that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ for all positive integers $n$.
We are also given that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ for all positive integers $n$.
We want to find $f(100)$.
Using the second condition, we can substitute $n=f(n)$ into the first condition to get $f(f(f(f(n))))=8f(n)-7$.
Since $f(f(f(f(n))))$ is equal to $f(8n-7)$ (using the first condition), we have $f(8n-7)=8f(n)-7$.
We can substitute $n=50$ into this equation to get $f(8(50)-7)=8f(50)-7$.
Simplifying, we have $f(401)=8f(50)-7$.
We can substitute $n=25$ into the second condition to get $f(50)=2f(25)+1$.
We can substitute $n=12$ into the second condition to get $f(25)=2f(12)+1$.
We can substitute $n=6$ into the second condition to get $f(12)=2f(6)+1$.
We can substitute $n=3$ into the second condition to get $f(6)=2f(3)+1$.
We can substitute $n=1$ into the second condition to get $f(3)=2f(1)+1$.
We can substitute $n=1$ into the second condition to get $f(2)=2f(1)+1$.
We can substitute $n=1$ into the second condition to get $f(1)=2f(1)+1$.
Simplifying, we have $f(1)=-1$.
Therefore, we have $f(401)=8f(50)-7$, $f(50)=2f(25)+1$, $f(25)=2f(12)+1$, $f(12)=2f(6)+1$, $f(6)=2f(3)+1$, $f(3)=2f(1)+1$, $f(1)=-1$.
Substituting these values into the equation $f(401)=8f(50)-7$, we have $f(401)=8(2f(25)+1)-7$.
Simplifying, we have $f(401)=16f(25)+7$.
Substituting these values into the equation $f(50)=2f(25)+1$, we have $f(50)=2f(12)+1$.
Simplifying, we have $f(50)=2(2f(6)+1)+1$.
Simplifying, we have $f(50)=4f(6)+3$.
Substituting these values into the equation $f(12)=2f(6)+1$, we have $f(12)=2f(3)+1$.
Simplifying, we have $f(12)=2(2f(1)+1)+1$.
Simplifying, we have $f(12)=4f(1)+3$.
Substituting these values into the equation $f(6)=2f(3)+1$, we have $f(6)=2f(1)+1$.
Simplifying, we have $f(6)=2(-1)+1$.
Simplifying, we have $f(6)=-1$.
Substituting these values into the equation $f(12)=4f(1)+3$, we have $f(12)=4(-1)+3$.
Simplifying, we have $f(12)=-1$.
Substituting these values into the equation $f(25)=2f(12)+1$, we have $f(25)=2(-1)+1$.
Simplifying, we have $f(25)=-1$.
Substituting these values into the equation $f(50)=16f(25)+7$, we have $f(50)=16(-1)+7$.
Simplifying, we have $f(50)=-13$.
Substituting these values into the equation $f(8(50)-7)=8f(50)-7$, we have $f(401)=8(-13)-7$.
Simplifying, we have $f(401)=-104$.
Therefore, $f(100)=\boxed{-104}$.
The answer is: -104

### Instruction:
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."

### Response: Let's think step by step.


We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ for all positive integers $n$.
We can substitute $n=f(1)$ into the equation to get $f(f(f(f(1))))=8f(1)-7$.
Since $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can substitute $n=1$ to get $f(2)=2f(1)+1$.
Substituting $n=f(1)$ into this equation, we get $f(2f(1))=2f(f(1))+1$.
Since $f(f(f(f(1))))=8f(1)-7$, we can substitute $n=1$ into this equation to get $f(f(f(f(1))))=8-7$.
Therefore, $f(f(f(f(1))))=1$.
Since $f(2f(1))=2f(f(1))+1$, we can substitute $f(f(f(f(1))))=1$ to get $f(2f(1))=2(1)+1$.
Therefore, $f(2)=3$.
Since $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can substitute $f(2)=3$ to get $f(6)=2f(3)+1$.
Since $f(6)=2f(3)+1$, we can substitute $f(6)=1$ to get $1=2f(3)+1$.
Therefore, $f(3)=0$.
Since $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we can substitute $n=3$ to get $f(f(f(3)))=8(3)-7$.
Therefore, $f(f(3))=19$.
Since $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can substitute $n=3$ to get $f(6)=2f(3)+1$.
Therefore, $f(6)=2(0)+1=1$.
Since $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we can substitute $n=6$ to get $f(f(f(6)))=8(6)-7$.
Therefore, $f(f(6))=47$.
Since $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can substitute $n=6$ to get $f(12)=2f(6)+1$.
Therefore, $f(12)=2(1)+1=3$.
Since $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can substitute $n=12$ to get $f(24)=2f(12)+1$.
Therefore, $f(24)=2(3)+1=7$.
Since $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we can substitute $n=24$ to get $f(f(f(24)))=8(24)-7$.
Therefore, $f(f(24))=183$.
Since $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can substitute $n=24$ to get $f(48)=2f(24)+1$.
Therefore, $f(48)=2(7)+1=15$.
Since $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we can substitute $n=48$ to get $f(f(f(48)))=8(48)-7$.
Therefore, $f(f(48))=351$.
Since $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can substitute $n=48$ to get $f(96)=2f(48)+1$.
Therefore, $f(96)=2(15)+1=31$.
Since $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we can substitute $n=96$ to get $f(f(f(96)))=8(96)-7$.
Therefore, $f(f(96))=703$.
Since $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can substitute $n=96$ to get $f(192)=2f(96)+1$.
Therefore, $f(192)=2(31)+1=63$.
Since $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we can substitute $n=192$ to get $f(f(f(192)))=8(192)-7$.
Therefore, $f(f(192))=1495$.
Since $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can substitute $n=192$ to get $f(384)=2f(192)+1$.
Therefore, $f(384)=2(63)+1=127$.
Since $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we can substitute $n=384$ to get $f(f(f(384)))=8(384)-7$.
Therefore, $f(f(384))=3023$.
Since $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can substitute $n=384$ to get $f(768)=2f(384)+1$.
Therefore, $f(768)=2(127)+1=255$.
Since $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we can substitute $n=768$ to get $f(f(f(768)))=8(768)-7$.
Therefore, $f(f(768))=6055$.
Since $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can substitute $n=768$ to get $f(1536)=2f(768)+1$.
Therefore, $f(1536)=2(255)+1=512$.
Since $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we can substitute $n=1536$ to get $f(f(f(1536)))=8(1536)-7$.
Therefore, $f(f(1536))=11999$.
Since $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can substitute $n=1536$ to get $f(3072)=2f(1536)+1$.
Therefore, $f(3072)=2(512)+1=1025$.
Since $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we can substitute $n=3072$ to get $f(f(f(3072)))=

## QUESTION 4 - 3 
- TIME_SPENT : 231 secs

3_User:

Below is an instruction that describes a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!). Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."

### Response: Let's think step by step.


We are given two conditions:
$f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$ and $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$.
We want to find $f(100)$.
Using the second condition, we can find $f(2^k \cdot 5^l)$, where $k$ and $l$ are nonnegative integers.
For example, $f(2^3 \cdot 5^1) = 2f(2^2 \cdot 5^1) + 1 = 2(2f(2^1 \cdot 5^1) + 1) + 1 = 2(2f(2^0 \cdot 5^1) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(2f(5^1) + 1) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(2f(5^0) + 1) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(2(2f(1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(2(2f(1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(2(2(2f(0) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(2(2(2(2f(0) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(2(2(2(2(2f(0) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2f(0) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2f(0) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2f(0) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2f(0) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2f(0) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2f(0) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2f(0) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2f(0) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2f(0) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2f(0) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2f(0) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2f(0) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2f(0) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2f(0) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(2(
