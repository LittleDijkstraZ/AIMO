 To solve this problem, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. This method involves introducing a new variable, say $\lambda$, and considering the function $F(x, y, \lambda) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy + \lambda(|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| - 40)$.

We then find the gradient of $F$ and set it equal to zero, which gives us the following system of equations:

1. $\frac{\partial F}{\partial x} = 10x - 8y + \lambda(-1 + 2\delta_1) = 0$
2. $\frac{\partial F}{\partial y} = 10y - 8x + \lambda(2 - 1\delta_2) = 0$
3. $\frac{\partial F}{\partial \lambda} = |x - 2y| + |y - 2x| - 40 = 0$

where $\delta_1$ and $\delta_2$ are the signs of $(x - 2y)$ and $(y - 2x)$, respectively.

We can solve this system of equations to find the values of $x$, $y$, and $\lambda$ that minimize $F$. Once we have these values, we can substitute them back into the original function to find the minimum value.

```python

from sympy import symbols, solve, Abs, S

def find_minimum():
    x, y, lam = symbols('x y lam')

    # System of equations
    eq1 = 10*x - 8*y + lam*(-1 + 2*Abs(x - 2*y))
    eq2 = 10*y - 8*x + lam*(2 - 1*Abs(y - 2*x))
    eq3 = Abs(x - 2*y) + Abs(y - 2*x) - 40

    # Solve the system of equations
    solutions = solve((eq1, eq2, eq3), (x, y, lam))

    # Calculate the minimum value of the function
    min_value = 5*solutions[0][0]**2 + 5*solutions[0][1]**2 - 8*solutions[0][0]*solutions[0][1]

    return min_value

result = find_minimum()
print(result)
```

The above code failed to produce a numerical answer because the `solve` function did not find a numerical solution for the system of equations. This is because the absolute value terms make the equations non-linear, and the `solve` function does not handle such equations well.

However, we can solve this problem analytically by noting that the given condition $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$ implies that $x = y = 20$ (by using the property of absolute value $|a| + |b| = |a + b|$ if $a$ and $b$ have the same sign). 

Substituting $x = y = 20$ into the function $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$, we get $5(20)^2 + 5(20)^2 - 8(20)(20) = 2000$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ subject to the condition $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$ is $\boxed{2000}$.
