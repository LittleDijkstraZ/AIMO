 This problem can be solved using Python. The steps are as follows:

1. Analyze the given equation and identify the conditions for which the equation equals zero.
2. The conditions obtained in step 1 determine the vertices of the polygon.
3. Use a method to calculate the area of the polygon based on its vertices.

Here is a Python code to solve the problem:

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 To find the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points, we first need to find the vertices of the polygon. 

The equation is given as $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

This equation is satisfied when either of the two factors is equal to zero. 

The first factor is zero when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. 

The second factor is zero when $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as:

- When $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$: 

  - $x = 8, y = 2$
  - $x = 8, y = -2$
  - $x = -8, y = 10$
  - $x = -8, y = -6$

- When $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$:

  - $x = 8, y = -2$
  - $x = 8, y = 2$
  - $x = -8, y = -6$
  - $x = -8, y = 10$

- When $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$:

  - $x = 2, y = 8$
  - $x = 2, y = -8$
  - $x = 10, y = 8$
  - $x = 10, y = -8$

- When $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$:

  - $x = 2, y = 8$
  - $x = 2, y = -8$
  - $x = 10, y = 8$
  - $x = 10, y = -8$

So, the vertices of the polygon are $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(8, 10)$, $(8, -6)$, $(2, 8)$, $(2, -8)$, $(10, 8)$, and $(10, -8)$.

The area of the polygon can be found by calculating the area of the rectangle formed by the vertices $(8, 2)$, $(8, 10)$, $(10, 2)$, and $(10, 10)$, and then subtracting the areas of the triangles formed by the vertices $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(8, 10)$, $(8, -6)$, $(2, 8)$, $(2, -8)$, $(10, 8)$, and $(10, -8)$.

The area of the rectangle is $(10 - 2) \times (8 - (-2)) = 80$ square units.

The area of the triangle formed by $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, and $(8, 10)$ is $\frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 8 = 40$ square units.

The area of the triangle formed by $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, and $(8, -6)$ is $\frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 8 = 40$ square units.

The area of the triangle formed by $(2, 8)$, $(2, -8)$, and $(8, 2)$ is $\frac{1}{2} \times 6 \times 6 = 18$ square units.

The area of the triangle formed by $(2, 8)$, $(2, -8)$, and $(10, 8)$ is $\frac{1}{2} \times 8 \times 8 = 32$ square units.

The area of the triangle formed by $(10, 8)$, $(10, -8)$, and $(8, 10)$ is $\frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times 2 = 2$ square units.

The area of the triangle formed by $(10, 8)$, $(10, -8)$, and $(8, -6)$ is $\frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times 14 = 14$ square units.

Adding all these areas together, we get the total area of the polygon as $80 - 40 - 40 - 18 - 32 - 2 - 14 = 18$ square units.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{18}$ square units.

The given problem cannot be solved directly using Sympy's solve function as it involves absolute values. We need to solve this problem manually.

The points that satisfy the given equations are the vertices of the convex polygon. The vertices of the polygon are:
- (0, 0)
- (0, 16)
- (16, 0)
- (8, 8)

Plotting these points, we can see that they form a square with side length 16. 

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the answer is $\boxed{256}$.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 We can break down the problem into two parts:

1. Understand the condition of the points satisfying the given equation.
2. Calculate the area of the convex polygon formed by these points.

Let's start with the first part.

The given equation is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

This equation equals to zero if either of the two terms equals to zero. Therefore, we have four cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$
3. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
4. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For case 1, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. There are 8 points satisfying this case.

For case 2, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x - y = \pm 10$ and $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. There are also 8 points satisfying this case.

For case 3, we have $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. There are 4 points satisfying this case.

For case 4, we have $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. There are 4 points satisfying this case.

Therefore, the total number of points is $8 + 8 + 4 + 4 = 24$. These points form a rectangle with side lengths $20$ and $16$. The area of the rectangle is $20 \times 16 = 320$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{320}$.

I am not sure how to solve this problem with Sympy. It seems like the condition in the problem creates a non-boolean condition inside the Piecewise function. This could be a problem for Sympy, as it does not handle non-boolean conditions well.

The problem might be more suitable for a geometry-based solution, as the conditions seem to be related to the geometry of the problem. In this case, the given equation defines a set of points enclosed by a convex polygon, where the polygon is defined by the conditions in the equation. The area of the polygon can be found by analyzing the geometry of the polygon.

The polygon can be divided into two parts: one part is a square with side length 16 (8 in each dimension), and the other part is a square with side length 20 (10 in each dimension), where the two squares share a side. Therefore, the total area of the polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares, which is $16^2 + 20^2 = 256 + 400 = 656$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{656}$ square units.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

 To solve this problem, we need to understand the properties of absolute value and how it affects the equations involved. 

The given equation is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. 

This equation is equal to zero if any of the factors are zero. This means we can break down the problem into four separate cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For each of these cases, we can solve for the corresponding values of x and y. 

Let's analyze each case:

1. If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. This gives us two lines: $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.

2. If $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us two lines: $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.

3. If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$. This gives us two lines: $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.

4. If $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us two lines: $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

Now, we can plot these lines on a coordinate plane. The lines will form a rectangle with vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The area of this rectangle can be calculated as follows:

Area = length * width = $2*8*2*8 = 256$ square units.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{256}$ square units.
