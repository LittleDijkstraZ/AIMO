This problem is more complex than it seems. When we try to solve the equation directly with `sympy`, it doesn't work because the equation contains absolute values which are not supported by `sympy`. 

However, we can analyze the equation manually to solve this problem. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions when $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. This is because the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, changes its sign at $x=1$ and again at $x=3$. So, the equation has four distinct solutions when $1 < x < 3$. 

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the equation is $2 * 100 = 200$. 

But we are looking for positive integers $m$ such that $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which means $0 < m < 200$. 

So, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the equation is $200 - 1 = 199$. 

But this is not an option in the problem, so we need to check our calculation. 

We made an error in our calculation. The equation has four distinct solutions when $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which means $0 < m < 200$. 

So, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the equation is $200 - 1 = 199$. 

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{199}$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 We know that the equation has 4 distinct solutions, which means there are 4 different values of $x$ that satisfy the equation.
Let's analyze the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\]
We can see that the right side of the equation is always positive, so the left side of the equation must also be positive.
Therefore, we have \[\vert x-1 \vert -2 > 0\]
Simplifying this inequality, we get \[\vert x-1 \vert > 2\]
This inequality splits into two cases: \[x-1 > 2\] or \[x-1 < -2\]
For the first case, we have \[x > 3\]
For the second case, we have \[x < -1\]
Now, let's analyze the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\]
We know that the left side of the equation is always non-negative, so the right side of the equation must also be non-negative.
Therefore, we have \[\frac{m}{100} \geq 0\]
Simplifying this inequality, we get \[m \geq 0\]
Since $m$ is a positive integer, we have $m > 0$
Now, let's consider the number of solutions for each value of $m$.
For $m = 1$, the equation becomes \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{1}{100}\]
This equation has 2 solutions: $x = \frac{201}{100}$ and $x = \frac{199}{100}$
For $m = 2$, the equation becomes \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{2}{100}\]
This equation has 4 solutions: $x = \frac{202}{100}$, $x = \frac{200}{100}$, $x = \frac{198}{100}$, and $x = \frac{199}{100}$
For $m = 3$, the equation becomes \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{3}{100}\]
This equation has 2 solutions: $x = \frac{203}{100}$ and $x = \frac{197}{100}$
For $m = 4$, the equation becomes \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{4}{100}\]
This equation has 4 solutions: $x = \frac{204}{100}$, $x = \frac{202}{100}$, $x = \frac{198}{100}$, and $x = \frac{196}{100}$
From this analysis, we can see that for $m = 2$ and $m = 4$, the equation has 4 distinct solutions.
Therefore, there are $\boxed{2}$ possible values of $m$.
The answer is $\boxed{2}$.

Assistant:

 This problem cannot be solved directly by programming. It requires a deep understanding of the properties of absolute value functions and the nature of their solutions.

The given equation is a double absolute value function, which can be split into two cases:

Case 1: $|x-1| - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$
Case 2: $-(|x-1| - 2) = \frac{m}{100}$

For each case, we can further split into two sub-cases based on the absolute value function:

Sub-case 1.1: $x - 1 - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$ or $x - 1 - 2 = -\frac{m}{100}$
Sub-case 1.2: $-(x - 1) - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$ or $-(x - 1) - 2 = -\frac{m}{100}$

Solving these equations for $x$ gives us the solutions to the original equation. The number of distinct solutions will depend on the values of $m$, as well as the properties of the absolute value functions.

To find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions, we need to analyze the behavior of the absolute value functions and consider the constraints on $m$ that will result in 4 distinct solutions.

This analysis is beyond the scope of a simple programmatic solution and requires a deep understanding of the properties of absolute value functions and the nature of their solutions.

The answer to this problem is $\boxed{2}$.

Assistant:

 The equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is less than $2$ and greater than or equal to $\frac{1}{2}$. This is because the graph of $| |x-1|-2|$ is a "V" shape with the minimum value of $1$, and the maximum value of $3$. The graph intersects the line $y=\frac{m}{100}$ four times in the interval $1 \leq \frac{m}{100} < 2$. 

Let's write a Python program to find the number of such $m$:

```python

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 To solve this problem, we need to analyze the equation and find out how many positive integers $m$ would result in the equation having 4 distinct solutions. 

First, let's rewrite the equation as follows:
\[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\]

This equation is a piecewise function that can be split into four cases based on the value of $x$:

1. If $x \geq 3$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\vert x-3 \vert$.
2. If $1 \leq x < 3$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\vert x-3 \vert$.
3. If $0 \leq x < 1$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\vert x+1 \vert$.
4. If $x < 0$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\vert x+1 \vert$.

Each of these cases will result in a quadratic equation. Solving these equations and finding the number of distinct solutions will give us the required answer.

Let's write a Python program to solve this problem:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solveset, S

It seems like there's a problem with the code. The `number_of_solutions` function is not being called with any argument, which leads to the TypeError. Let's correct this and re-run the code:

```python

FAIL

```
The error in the code is due to a misunderstanding of how the `solveset()` function works. It is not possible to iterate over the solutions of a condition set in the way the code tries to do it. However, we can solve the problem using a more manual approach.

Let's analyze the equation: $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$

It has 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100} = 2$.

So, $m = 200$.

Hence, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 1.

So, the answer is $\boxed{1}$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 To solve this problem, we need to understand the properties of the equation and how it relates to the number of distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is a piecewise linear function with four pieces. Each piece is a line segment with slope $\pm1$ and length $2$. The function is symmetric about $x=1$.

The equation has 4 distinct solutions if the length of the line segments is equal to $\frac{m}{100}$. This happens when $m=200$.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is $\boxed{1}$.
