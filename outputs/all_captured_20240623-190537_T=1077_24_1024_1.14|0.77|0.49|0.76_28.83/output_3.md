The equation $AB=0$ is equivalent to $A=0$ or $B=0$. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. This represents a square with side length 20.
From $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This also represents a square with side length 20.
From $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$. This represents a square with side length 16.
From $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert y \vert = 8$. This also represents a square with side length 16.

The intersection of these four squares is a square with side length 8. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $8^2 = 64$. The answer is: $64$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, which means that either of the expressions must be zero for the entire equation to be zero. Therefore, we have two sets of conditions:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first set of conditions, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, and $(0, -10)$.

For the second set of conditions, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The intersection of these two sets of lines is the convex polygon enclosed by the points that satisfy the original equation. The polygon is a square with side length 10 (since the distance between the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$ is 16, and the distance between the lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$ is also 16). Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

 The equation $AB = 0$ is equivalent to $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
Solving these equations gives the vertices of the polygon:
- For $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$.
- For $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = \pm 10$.
- For $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$.
- For $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = \pm 8$.
Combining these solutions, we find the vertices of the polygon to be: $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8),$ and $(-8, -8)$. These vertices form a square with side length $16$. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$

The equation given in the problem is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.

For the first expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, it is only possible when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

For the second expression $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, it is only possible when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The four lines from the first expression and the four lines from the second expression form a square with side length 20. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 400 square units. The answer is: $400$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The given equation is equivalent to the product of two equations being equal to zero:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$$ or $$((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$
The first equation implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which gives us the lines $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.
The second equation implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us the lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
The points that satisfy both equations are the vertices of a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So, the area of the convex polygon is 256.
The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The given equation is equal to zero if and only if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
From the first set of equations, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
From the second set of equations, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
This means that the points must satisfy either $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$ or $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
The first set of equations gives us four lines: $y = x$, $y = -x$, $y = x - 20$, and $y = -(x - 20)$.
The second set of equations gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.
The intersection points of these lines are the vertices of the polygon.
By plotting these lines, we find that the polygon is a square with side length 16.
The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: 256

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The expression $AB = 0$ is true if and only if either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the points that satisfy the equation are those that satisfy either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$. Similarly, the equation $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = \pm 10$. The equations $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ imply $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, respectively, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

These equations describe a square with side length 16 (the square that connects the points $(\pm 8, 8)$, $(8, \pm 8)$, and $(-8, \pm 8)$). The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units.
