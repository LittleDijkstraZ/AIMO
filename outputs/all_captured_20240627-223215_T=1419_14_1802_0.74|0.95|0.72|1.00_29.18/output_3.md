Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. 

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. This expression is zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These equations represent a square with side length 20, centered at the origin.

The second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. This expression is zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which represents a square with side length 16, centered at the origin.

The intersection of these two squares is a smaller square with side length 8, centered at the origin. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of the smaller square, which is $8^2 = 64$.

## QUESTION 3 - 1

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"What is the product of all the coordinates of all the points of intersection of the two circles defined by $x^2-2x +y^2-10y+25=0$ and $x^2-8x+y^2-10y+37=0$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Add $(-2/2)^2$ and $(-10/2)^2$ to the first equation and $(-8/2)^2$ and $(-10/2)^2$ to the second equation to find that the given equations are equivalent to \begin{align*}
(x^2-2x+1)+(y^2-10y+25)&=1\text{, and} \\
(x^2-8x+16)+(y^2-10y+25)&=4
\end{align*} which are equivalent to \begin{align*}
(x-1)^2+(y-5)^2 &=1^2, \\
(x-4)^2+(y-5)^2 &=2^2,
\end{align*} respectively.  Hence, the two circles have centers $(1,5)$ and $(4,5)$ respectively and radii $1$ and $2$ respectively. Since the centers of the circles are $3$ units apart and the sum of their radii is $3$, the two circles intersect at only one point.  We can see that $(2,5)$ is the desired intersection point, so our product is $2 \cdot 5 =\boxed{10}$. The answer is $\boxed{10}$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"A line segment begins at $(2, 5)$. It is 10 units long and ends at the point $(-6, y)$ where $y > 0$. What is the value of $y$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
We use the distance formula: \begin{align*}
\sqrt{(2 - (-6))^2 + (y - 5)^2} &= \sqrt{8^2 + (y - 5)^2} \\
& = \sqrt{y^2 - 10y + 89} \\
& = 10.
\end{align*}Squaring both sides and rearranging terms, we find that \begin{align*}
y^2 - 10y + 89 &= 100 \\
y^2 - 10y - 11 &= 0\\
(y - 11)(y + 1) &= 0
\end{align*}Thus, $y = 11$ or $y = -1$. We are given that $y > 0$, so $y = \boxed{11}$. The answer is $\boxed{11}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


This problem seems to be asking for the area of a polygon, but the equation given is not straightforward to analyze. However, we can simplify the equation and identify the vertices of the polygon.

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we find that the vertices of the polygon are $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$.

Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So the vertices of the polygon are also $(8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(8, -8)$.

The polygon formed by these vertices is a square with side length $16$. The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side, so the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $256$ square units.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Real numbers $x$ and $y$ satisfy the equation $x^2 + y^2 = 10x - 6y - 34$.  What is $x+y$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
If we complete the square after bringing the $x$ and $y$ terms to the other side, we get \[(x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 0.\]Squares of real numbers are nonnegative, so we need both $(x-5)^2$ and $(y+3)^2$ to be $0.$  This only happens when $x = 5$ and $y = -3.$ Thus, $x+y = 5 + (-3) = \boxed{2}.$ The answer is $\boxed{2}$

## QUESTION 3 - 6

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many sides would there be in a convex polygon if the sum of all but one of its interior angles is $1070^{\circ}$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The sum of the interior angles in any $n$-sided polygon is $180(n-2)$ degrees, so the angle measures in a polygon with 7 sides sum to $180(7-2) = 900$ degrees, which means that the desired polygon has more than 7 sides.  Meanwhile, the angle measures in a polygon with 8 sides sum to $180(8-2) = 1080$ degrees.  So, it's possible that the polygon has $\boxed{8}$ sides, and that the last angle measures $10^\circ$.

To see that this is the only possibility, note that the angle measures in a polygon with 9 sides sum to $180(9-2) = 1260$ degrees.  Therefore, if the polygon has more than 8 sides, then the last interior angle must measure at least $1260^\circ - 1070^\circ = 190^\circ$.  But this is impossible because each interior angle of a convex polygon has measure less than $180^\circ$. The answer is $\boxed{8}$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The given equation is of the form $A \cdot B = 0$, which means that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$.

So we have two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations we get the points $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, and $(-5,-5)$.

For the second case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations we get the points $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

The points that satisfy both cases are the vertices of the polygon, and they form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 100.
