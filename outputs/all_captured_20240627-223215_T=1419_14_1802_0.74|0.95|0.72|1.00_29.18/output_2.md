Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The number of solutions of the equation $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|=\frac{m}{100}$ is 4 if and only if $\frac{m}{100}=1$. This is because the expression $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|$ can take on the value of 1 in exactly 4 ways.

Therefore, the value of $m$ that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions is $m = 100$.

So the answer is $\boxed{1}$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many positive integers, not exceeding 100, are multiples of 2 or 3 but not 4?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The multiples of 2 from 1 to 100 are $2, 4, 6,\ldots, 100$.  There are 50 such numbers.

The multiples of 3 from 1 to 100 are $3, 6, 9,\ldots, 99$.  There are 33 such numbers.

These lists count all of the multiples of 6 twice.  The multiples of 6 are $6, 12,\ldots,96$, and there are 16 such multiples of 6.  Therefore there are $50+33-16=67$ multiples of 2 or 3 from 1 to 100.

All of the 25 multiples of 4 from 1 to 100 are on this list.  Therefore there are $67-25=\boxed{42}$ numbers from 1 to 100 that are multiples of 2 or 3 but not 4. The answer is $\boxed{42}$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many integers $m$ are there such that $0<m<100$ and $\gcd(m,100)$ is a single-digit number?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
If $m$ is any integer, then $\gcd(m,100)$ is one of the positive divisors of $100$: $$1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100.$$We note that the numbers on this list with more than one digit are all multiples of $10$, with the exception of $25$. Thus, $m$ has a single-digit $\gcd$ with $100$ if and only if $m$ is not a multiple of either $10$ or $25$. Thus, we just need to count integers $m$ between $0$ and $100$ which are not multiples of $10$ or of $25$.

There are $99$ integers $m$ such that $0<m<100$. These include nine multiples of $10$ ($10,20,30,\ldots,80,90$) and two more multiples of $25$ ($25$ and $75$; we don't count $50$ because we already counted it). So, that leaves $99-9-2=\boxed{88}$ integers whose greatest common divisor with $100$ has a single digit. The answer is $\boxed{88}$

**Problem:** 
"How many positive integers, not exceeding 100, are multiples of 2 or 3 but not 4?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The multiples of 2 from 1 to 100 are $2, 4, 6,\ldots, 100$.  There are 50 such numbers.

The multiples of 3 from 1 to 100 are $3, 6, 9,\ldots, 99$.  There are 33 such numbers.

These lists count all of the multiples of 6 twice.  The multiples of 6 are $6, 12,\ldots,96$, and there are 16 such multiples of 6.  Therefore there are $50+33-16=67$ multiples of 2 or 3 from 1 to 100.

All of the 25 multiples of 4 from 1 to 100 are on this list.  Therefore there are $67-25=\boxed{42}$ numbers from 1 to 100 that are multiples of 2 or 3 but not 4. The answer is $\boxed{42}$

**Solution:**



This problem involves understanding the properties of the absolute value function and how it affects the number of solutions of an equation. We will use Python to solve this problem step by step.

First, let's rewrite the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ as $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{M}{100}$, where $M$ is a positive integer.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{M}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{M}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $3$. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ takes on the values $0$, $1$, $2$, and $3$ exactly once on the real line.

So we need to find the number of positive integers $M$ such that $1<\frac{M}{100}<3$, or equivalently, $100<M<300$. 

This is a simple arithmetic sequence problem, and the number of terms in the sequence $101,102,\ldots,299$ is $299-101+1=199$.

So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is $199$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def count_m():
    lower_bound = 100
    upper_bound = 300
    count = upper_bound - lower_bound + 1
    return count

result = count_m()
print(result)
```

```
However, this counts the number of integers from $100$ to $300$ inclusive. We are interested in the number of integers strictly between $100$ and $300$, so we need to subtract $2$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def count_m():
    lower_bound = 100
    upper_bound = 300
    count = upper_bound - lower_bound - 1
    return count

result = count_m()
print(result)
``````output

CODE RESULTS 199

INTERMEDIATE OUT :

199
```
The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is $199$.
The answer is: $199$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"On the graph of $y=(x+2)^4-100$, how many points are there whose coordinates are both negative integers?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
A point $(x,y)$ is on the graph if and only if $y=(x+2)^4-100$, so we seek to determine all pairs of negative integers $(x,y)$ which satisfy this equation. We can obtain pairs by plugging in $-1,-2,-3,$ and so on for $x$: \begin{align*}
x=-1 &\Rightarrow y=1^4-100=-99 \\
x=-2 &\Rightarrow y=0^4-100=-100 \\
x=-3 &\Rightarrow y=(-1)^4-100=-99 \\
x=-4 &\Rightarrow y=(-2)^4-100=-84 \\
x=-5 &\Rightarrow y=(-3)^4-100=-19 \\
\end{align*}Starting at $x=-6$, the $y$-coordinates obtained in this way are positive. To be sure that there are no more solutions, we can solve the equation $$(x+2)^4-100 < 0,$$which yields $-2-\sqrt[4]{100}<x<-2+\sqrt[4]{100}$ (in decimals, this is roughly $-5.16<x<1.16$). Thus, the graph of $y=(x+2)^4-100$ passes through $\boxed{5}$ points with negative integer coordinates. The answer is $\boxed{5}$

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The problem is asking for how many positive integers $m$ does the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have $4$ distinct solutions.

This equation is a piecewise function with $4$ cases based on the value of $x$. We can analyze these cases and determine the number of distinct solutions for each value of $m$.

For $m=1$, there are $4$ distinct solutions.
For $m>1$, there are $2$ distinct solutions.

Therefore, the only value of $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $m=1$. So the number of such $m$ is $1$.

The answer is $\boxed{1}$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"For how many integers $n$ where $2 \le n \le 100$ is $\binom{n}{2}$ odd?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
$\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}$. In order for this fraction to be odd, neither $n$ nor $n-1$ can be divisible by $4$, because only one of $n$ and $n-1$ can be even. There are $25$ integers where $n$ is divisible by $4$, namely the multiples of $4$ from $4$ to $100$. There are $24$ integers where $n-1$ is divisible by $4$. We can obtain these integers by incrementing all the multiples of $4$ by $1$, but we must not include $100$ since $100+1 = 101 > 100$. Therefore, there are $49$ invalid integers, so there are $99 - 49 = \boxed{50}$ valid integers. The answer is $\boxed{50}$

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**



First, let's analyze the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. The left-hand side of the equation is a piecewise function that takes on different forms depending on the value of $x$. Specifically, we have:

- If $x < 1$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \vert -x+1 -2 \vert = \vert -x-1 \vert = x+1+2 = x+3$.
- If $1 \leq x < 3$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \vert x-1-2 \vert = \vert x-3 \vert = 3-x$.
- If $x \geq 3$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \vert x-1-2 \vert = \vert x-3 \vert = x-3$.

So the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is equivalent to:

- If $x < 1$, then $x+3 = \frac{m}{100}$.
- If $1 \leq x < 3$, then $3-x = \frac{m}{100}$.
- If $x \geq 3$, then $x-3 = \frac{m}{100}$.

Each of these equations has 2 solutions if $\frac{m}{100} > 0$, and 1 solution if $\frac{m}{100} = 0$. Therefore, the original equation has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 0$ for one of the intervals and $\frac{m}{100} > 0$ for the other two intervals. This happens when $m=0$ or $m=100$. However, the problem asks for positive integers $m$, so we discard $m=0$. Therefore, the only value of $m$ for which the original equation has 4 distinct solutions is $m=100$. So the number of such positive integers $m$ is 1.
The answer is: $1$
