Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The point of intersection between the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ and the line $y = 4$ satisfy the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$. This is a quadratic equation, and since the parabola and line intersect at two points, the discriminant of this equation is positive. The discriminant is given by $(2k)^2 - 4k(l-4) = 4k^2 - 4k(l-4) = 4k^2 - 4kl + 16k$. Since this is positive, we know that $k^2 - kl + 4k > 0$.

The points of intersection are given by the quadratic formula as $x = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{(2k)^2 - 4k(l-4)}}{2k} = 1 \pm \sqrt{1 - (l-4)}$. Let $x_1 = 1 + \sqrt{1 - (l-4)}$ and $x_2 = 1 - \sqrt{1 - (l-4)}$. Then the points of intersection are $(x_1, 4)$ and $(x_2, 4)$.

The distance between these two points is given by $\sqrt{(x_1 - x_2)^2 + (4 - 4)^2} = \sqrt{(x_1 - x_2)^2} = |x_1 - x_2| = 6$. Thus, we have $|1 + \sqrt{1 - (l-4)} - (1 - \sqrt{1 - (l-4)})| = 6$, which simplifies to $2\sqrt{1 - (l-4)} = 6$, so $\sqrt{1 - (l-4)} = 3$. Squaring both sides gives $1 - (l-4) = 9$, or $l-4 = -8$, so $l = -4$.

We want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The distance from $(x_1, 4)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x_1^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{(1 + \sqrt{1 - (l-4)})^2 + 16} = \sqrt{(1 + \sqrt{1 + 8})^2 + 16} = \sqrt{2^2 + 16} = \sqrt{20}$. Similarly, the distance from $(x_2, 4)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{(1 - \sqrt{1 + 8})^2 + 16} = \sqrt{2^2 + 16} = \sqrt{20}$.

Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $2 \times 20 = 40$. The answer is: 40

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To solve this problem, we first need to find the points $A$ and $B$ where the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$. We can find these points by setting the two equations equal to each other and solving for $x$:
$$kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4.$$
Rearranging the equation gives:
$$kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0.$$
This is a quadratic equation with solutions for $x$ given by the quadratic formula:
$$x = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{(2k)^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k}.$$
$$x = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k}.$$
$$x = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}}{2k}.$$
$$x = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{4k(k - l + 4)}}{2k}.$$
$$x = 1 \pm \sqrt{\frac{k - l + 4}{k}}.$$
Let $x = 1 + \sqrt{\frac{k - l + 4}{k}}$ be the x-coordinate of point $A$ and $x = 1 - \sqrt{\frac{k - l + 4}{k}}$ be the x-coordinate of point $B$. The y-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$ are both 4 since they lie on the line $y = 4$.

The distance between points $A$ and $B$ is given as 6, so we have:
$$|1 + \sqrt{\frac{k - l + 4}{k}} - (1 - \sqrt{\frac{k - l + 4}{k}})| = 6,$$
$$\sqrt{\frac{k - l + 4}{k}} \cdot 2 = 6.$$
$$\sqrt{\frac{k - l + 4}{k}} = 3.$$
Squaring both sides gives:
$$\frac{k - l + 4}{k} = 9.$$
$$k - l + 4 = 9k.$$
$$l = \frac{8k}{9} + 4.$$

The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is the sum of $x_A^2 + y_A^2$ and $x_B^2 + y_B^2$, where $(x_A, y_A) = (1 + \sqrt{\frac{k - l + 4}{k}}, 4)$ and $(x_B, y_B) = (1 - \sqrt{\frac{k - l + 4}{k}}, 4)$. This gives:
$$(1 + \sqrt{\frac{k - l + 4}{k}})^2 + 4^2 + (1 - \sqrt{\frac{k - l + 4}{k}})^2 + 4^2.$$
$$(1 + \sqrt{\frac{k - l + 4}{k}})^2 + (1 - \sqrt{\frac{k - l + 4}{k}})^2 + 32.$$
$$2 + 2\left(\sqrt{\frac{k - l + 4}{k}}\right)^2 + 32.$$
$$2 + 2\left(\frac{k - l + 4}{k}\right) + 32.$$
$$2 + 2\left(\frac{k - \left(\frac{8k}{9} + 4\right) + 4}{k}\right) + 32.$$
$$2 + 2\left(\frac{k - \frac{8k}{9} - 4 + 4}{k}\right) + 32.$$
$$2 + 2\left(\frac{k - \frac{8k}{9}}{k}\right) + 32.$$
$$2 + 2\left(\frac{k^2 - 8k}{9k}\right) + 32.$$
$$2 + \frac{2(k^2 - 8k)}{9k} + 32.$$
$$\frac{2(k^2 - 8k) + 18k}{9k} + 32.$$
$$\frac{2k^2 - 16k + 18k}{9k} + 32.$$
$$\frac{2k^2 + 2k}{9k} + 32.$$
$$\frac{2k(k + 1)}{9k} + 32.$$
$$\frac{2(k + 1)}{9} + 32.$$

Now, we need to find the value of $k$ that satisfies the condition. We know that the distance between points $A$ and $B$ is 6, so the distance formula gives:
$$\sqrt{(1 + \sqrt{\frac{k - l + 4}{k}} - (1 - \sqrt{\frac{k - l + 4}{k}}))^2 + (4 - 4)^2} = 6.$$
$$\sqrt{\left(2\sqrt{\frac{k - l + 4}{k}}\right)^2} = 6.$$
$$2\sqrt{\frac{k - l + 4}{k}} = 6.$$
$$\sqrt{\frac{k - l + 4}{k}} = 3.$$
Squaring both sides gives:
$$\frac{k - l + 4}{k} = 9.$$
$$k - l + 4 = 9k.$$
$$l = \frac{8k}{9} + 4.$$

Substituting this value of $l$ into the distance formula gives:
$$\sqrt{\left(2\sqrt{\frac{k - \left(\frac{8k}{9} + 4\right) + 4}{k}}\right)^2} = 6.$$
$$\sqrt{\left(2\sqrt{\frac{k - \frac{8k}{9} - 4 + 4}{k}}\right)^2} = 6.$$
$$\sqrt{\left(2\sqrt{\frac{k - \frac{8k}{9}}{k}}\right)^2} = 6.$$
$$\sqrt{\left(2\sqrt{\frac{k^2 - 8k}{9k}}\right)^2} = 6.$$
$$\sqrt{\left(2\frac{\sqrt{k^2 - 8k}}{3\sqrt{k}}\right)^2} = 6.$$
$$\sqrt{\frac{4(k^2 - 8k)}{9k}} = 6.$$
$$\frac{2\sqrt{k^2 - 8k}}{3\sqrt{k}} = 6.$$
$$\frac{2\sqrt{k(k - 8)}}{3\sqrt{k}} = 6.$$
$$\frac{2\sqrt{k - 8}}{3} = 6.$$
$$\sqrt{k - 8} = 9.$$
$$k - 8 = 81.$$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we find the intersection points of the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ and the line $y = 4$. By setting them equal to each other, we get $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$.
Rearranging terms, we have $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$. This is a quadratic equation.

Let's say that the two intersection points $A$ and $B$ have $x$-coordinates $x_1$ and $x_2$, respectively. Since these are the roots of the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$, we have $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$.

Given that the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, we have $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 36$, which can be expanded to $x_1^2 - 2x_1x_2 + x_2^2 = 36$. We substitute $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$ into this equation to get $x_1^2 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) + x_2^2 = 36$.

We also know from the Pythagorean theorem that the square of the distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $x^2 + y^2$. Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $x_1^2 + y_1^2 + x_2^2 + y_2^2 = x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2 + x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2$.

Since $y_1 = kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l$ and $y_2 = kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l$, we can simplify the expression to $x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2 + x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2$.

Using the equation $x_1^2 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) + x_2^2 = 36$, we can substitute $x_1^2 = 36 + 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) + x_2^2$ into the expression above to get:
$$36 + 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) + x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2$$.

Next, we substitute $x_2 = 2 - x_1$ into the equation $x_1^2 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) + x_2^2 = 36$ to get:
$$x_1^2 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) + (2 - x_1)^2 = 36$$.

This simplifies to:
$$x_1^2 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) + 4 - 4x_1 + x_1^2 = 36$$, which further simplifies to:
$$2x_1^2 - 4x_1 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) + 4 = 36$$, and then to:
$$2x_1^2 - 4x_1 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = 32$$.

Dividing through by 2 gives:
$$x_1^2 - 2x_1 - \left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = 16$$.

Substituting $x_1 = 1$ (from the quadratic formula) into this equation, we get:
$$1 - 2 - \left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = 16$$, which simplifies to:
$$-1 - \left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = 16$$, and then to:
$$- \left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = 17$$.

Multiplying through by $-k$ gives:
$$l - 4 = -17k$$, and then to:
$$l = -17k + 4$$.

Substitute $l = -17k + 4$ into the equation $x_1^2 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) + x_2^2 = 36$ to get:
$$x_1^2 - 2\left(\frac{-17k + 4 - 4}{k}\right) + (2 - x_1)^2 = 36$$, which simplifies to:
$$x_1^2 - 2\left(\frac{-17k}{k}\right) + (2 - x_1)^2 = 36$$, and then to:
$$x_1^2 + 34 + (2 - x_1)^2 = 36$$.

Expanding $(2 - x_1)^2$ gives:
$$x_1^2 + 34 + 4 - 4x_1 + x_1^2 = 36$$, which simplifies to:
$$2x_1^2 - 4x_1 + 38 = 36$$, and then to:
$$2x_1^2 - 4x_1 + 2 = 0$$.

Dividing through by 2 gives:
$$x_1^2 - 2x_1 + 1 = 0$$, which is a perfect square trinomial and factors as $(x_1 - 1)^2 = 0$. Therefore, $x_1 = 1$.

Since $x_2 = 2 - x_1 = 1$, we find that the two intersection points $A$ and $B$ have the same $x$-coordinate. Therefore, they must be on a vertical line. Since they are distance 6 apart horizontally, the line segment connecting them must be vertical. Therefore, the $y$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$ must be the same, which means $y_1 = y_2$.

Finally, substituting $x_1 = 1$ into the equation $y_1 = kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l$, we get:
$$y_1 = k - 2k + l = l - k$$.

Substituting $l

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, we set the equations $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ and $y = 4$ equal to each other to find the $x$-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$. This gives us:
\[kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4.\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0.\]
Let $x_1$ and $x_2$ be the roots of this quadratic equation. By Vieta's formulas, we know that $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$.

Since the points $A$ and $B$ are distance 6 apart, we can use the distance formula:
\[(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 36.\]
Expanding, we have:
\[x_2^2 - 2x_1x_2 + x_1^2 = 36.\]
Substituting the values from Vieta's formulas, we get:
\[(x_1x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 + (x_1x_2)^2 = 36.\]
Simplifying, we have:
\[2(x_1x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 36.\]
Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
\[(x_1x_2)^2 - x_1x_2 = 18.\]
Substituting the value of $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$, we have:
\[\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right)^2 - \frac{l - 4}{k} = 18.\]
Multiplying both sides by $k^2$, we get:
\[(l - 4)^2 - k(l - 4)k = 18k^2.\]
Expanding, we have:
\[l^2 - 8l + 16 - k^2l + 4k^2 = 18k^2.\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[l^2 - k^2l - 8l + 16 = 18k^2.\]
Rearranging again, we have:
\[l^2 - k^2l - 8l - 16k^2 + 16 = 0.\]
Factoring out a common factor of $l$, we get:
\[l(l - k^2) - 8(l - 2k^2) = 0.\]
Factoring again, we have:
\[(l - 8)(l - k^2) = 0.\]
So, we have two possibilities: $l - 8 = 0$ or $l - k^2 = 0$. If $l - 8 = 0$, then $l = 8$. If $l - k^2 = 0$, then $l = k^2$.

Substituting $l = 8$ into the equation for the distance between $A$ and $B$, we get:
\[6^2 = 36 = 2(x_1x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right)^2 - 2\frac{l - 4}{k}.\]
Substituting $l = 8$, we have:
\[36 = 2\left(\frac{8 - 4}{k}\right)^2 - 2\frac{8 - 4}{k} = 2\left(\frac{4}{k}\right)^2 - 2\frac{4}{k}.\]
Simplifying, we have:
\[36 = \frac{32}{k^2} - \frac{8}{k}.\]
Multiplying both sides by $k^2$, we get:
\[36k^2 = 32k - 8k^2.\]
Rearranging terms, we have:
\[36k^2 + 8k^2 = 32k.\]
Simplifying, we have:
\[44k^2 = 32k.\]
Dividing both sides by 4, we get:
\[11k^2 = 8k.\]
If $k = 0$, then the parabola would not exist. So, we can divide both sides by $k$ to get:
\[11k = 8.\]
Solving for $k$, we have:
\[k = \frac{8}{11}.\]
Substituting this value into the equation $l = k^2$, we have:
\[l = \left(\frac{8}{11}\right)^2 = \frac{64}{121}.\]
Therefore, the only valid solution is $l = \frac{64}{121}$.

Finally, we want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. The coordinates of $A$ and $B$ are the solutions to the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$, so they are of the form $(x, 4)$.

The distance from $A$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x_1^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{\left(\frac{2k}{k} - x_2\right)^2 + 16} = \sqrt{(2 - x_2)^2 + 16}$.
The distance from $B$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x_2^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{x_2^2 + 16}$.

The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is:
\[(\sqrt{(2 - x_2)^2 + 16})^2 + (\sqrt{x_2^2 + 16})^2 = (2 - x_2)^2 + 16 + x_2^2 + 16 = 4 - 4x_2 + x_2^2 + 32 = x_2^2 - 4x_2 + 36.\]
Substituting $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k} = \frac{\frac{64}{121} - 4}{\frac{8}{11}} = \frac{-20}{11}$, we have:
\[(\sqrt{(2 - x_2)^2 + 16})^2 + (\sqrt{x_2^2 + 16})^2 = x_2^2 - 4x_2 + 36 = \left(\frac{-20}{11}\right)^2 - 4\left(\frac{-20}{11}\right) + 36.\]
Calculating, we have:
\[x_2^2 - 4x_2 +

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we need to find the x-coordinates of points A and B by setting $y = 4$ in the equation of the parabola:
\[4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l.\]
Rearranging the equation, we get:
\[kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0.\]
We are given that the distance between A and B is 6, so the difference of the roots of this equation is 6. By Vieta's formulas, the difference of the roots is $\frac{2k}{\sqrt{k^2 - k(l-4)}}$. So we have:
\[\frac{2k}{\sqrt{k^2 - k(l-4)}} = 6.\]
Squaring both sides, we get:
\[\frac{4k^2}{k^2 - k(l-4)} = 36.\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[4k^2 = 36k^2 - 36k(l-4).\]
Expanding, we get:
\[4k^2 = 36k^2 - 36kl + 144k.\]
Rearranging, we get:
\[32k^2 = 36kl - 144k.\]
Dividing both sides by 4, we get:
\[8k^2 = 9kl - 36k.\]
Rearranging, we get:
\[8k^2 + 36k = 9kl.\]
Dividing both sides by k, we get:
\[8k + 36 = 9l.\]
Now, we need to find the sum of the squares of the distances from A and B to the origin. The x-coordinates of A and B are the roots of the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$. Let $x_1$ and $x_2$ be the roots of this equation. Then the sum of the squares of the distances from A and B to the origin is:
\[(x_1)^2 + (x_2)^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = \left(\frac{2k}{k}\right)^2 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = 4 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right).\]
From $8k + 36 = 9l$, we can solve for l:
\[l = \frac{8k + 36}{9}.\]
Substituting this into the equation above, we get:
\[4 - 2\left(\frac{\frac{8k + 36}{9} - 4}{k}\right) = 4 - 2\left(\frac{8k + 36 - 36}{9k}\right) = 4 - 2\left(\frac{8k}{9k}\right) = 4 - \frac{16}{9} = \frac{20}{9}.\]
Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from A and B to the origin is $\frac{20}{9}$. The answer is: $\frac{20}{9}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



To find the points of intersection, we set the two equations equal to each other:
\[kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4.\]
Rearranging, we have:
\[kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0.\]
This is a quadratic equation in terms of $x$.

Given that the points $A$ and $B$ are distance 6 apart, the difference of the roots of the equation is 6. From Vieta's formulas, we know that the difference of the roots is $\sqrt{\frac{4k^2 - 4k(l-4)}{k^2}}$, which equals 6.

Simplifying, we get:
\[\sqrt{\frac{4k^2 - 4k(l-4)}{k^2}} = 6.\]
Squaring both sides, we have:
\[\frac{4k^2 - 4k(l-4)}{k^2} = 36.\]
Multiplying both sides by $k^2$, we get:
\[4k^2 - 4k(l-4) = 36k^2.\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[32k^2 = 4k(l-4).\]
Dividing both sides by $4k$, we get:
\[8k = l - 4.\]
We can solve for $l$:
\[l = 8k + 4.\]

Now, we substitute $l = 8k + 4$ into the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$ to get:
\[kx^2 - 2kx + 8k = 0.\]
The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is equal to $x_1^2 + x_2^2$, where $x_1$ and $x_2$ are the roots of the equation. From Vieta's formulas, we know that $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2$, where $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{8k}{k} = 8$. Thus, $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = 2^2 - 2 \cdot 8 = 4 - 16 = -12$.

However, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin cannot be negative, so there must be a mistake in our calculations. Let's revisit the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$.

From Vieta's formulas, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin should be equal to $(x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2$, where $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l-4}{k} = \frac{8k + 4 - 4}{k} = 8 + \frac{4}{k}$.
Thus, $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = 2^2 - 2(8 + \frac{4}{k}) = 4 - 16 - \frac{8}{k} = -12 - \frac{8}{k}$.

Again, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin cannot be negative, so there must be another mistake in our calculations. Let's revisit the condition that the points $A$ and $B$ are distance 6 apart.

The condition that the points $A$ and $B$ are distance 6 apart implies that $(x_1 - x_2)^2 = 6^2 = 36$. From Vieta's formulas, we know that $(x_1 - x_2)^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 4x_1x_2$, where $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l-4}{k} = \frac{8k + 4 - 4}{k} = 8 + \frac{4}{k}$.

Thus, $(x_1 - x_2)^2 = 2^2 - 4(8 + \frac{4}{k}) = 4 - 32 - \frac{16}{k} = -28 - \frac{16}{k}$.
Setting this equal to 36, we have:
\[-28 - \frac{16}{k} = 36.\]
Multiplying through by $k$, we get:
\[-28k - 16 = 36k.\]
Adding $28k$ to both sides, we get:
\[-16 = 64k.\]
Dividing both sides by $64$, we get:
\[k = -\frac{1}{4}.\]
However, since $k$ is given to be positive, we must have made a mistake in our calculations. Let's reexamine our work and see where we went wrong.

We made a mistake when we wrote $(x_1 - x_2)^2 = 6^2 = 36$. The correct equation should be $(x_1 - x_2)^2 = 6^2 = 36$.

From Vieta's formulas, we know that $(x_1 - x_2)^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 4x_1x_2$, where $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l-4}{k} = \frac{8k + 4 - 4}{k} = 8 + \frac{4}{k}$.

Thus, $(x_1 - x_2)^2 = 2^2 - 4(8 + \frac{4}{k}) = 4 - 32 - \frac{16}{k} = -28 - \frac{16}{k}$.

Setting this equal to 36, we have:
\[-28 - \frac{16}{k} = 36.\]
Multiplying through by $k$, we get:
\[-28k - 16 = 36k.\]
Adding $28k$ to both sides, we get:
\[-16 = 64k.\]
Dividing both sides by $64$, we get:
\[k = -\frac{1}{4}.\]
However, since $k$ is given to be positive, we must have made a mistake in our calculations. Let's reexamine our work and see where we went wrong.

When we set up the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$, we assumed that

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The points of intersection of the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ and the line $y = 4$ satisfy the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$. This simplifies to $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$. Let's call this equation (1).

Given that the points of intersection, $A$ and $B$, are distance 6 apart, this means the difference of the x-coordinates of $A$ and $B$ is 3 (since the distance from $A$ to $B$ is twice the length of the segment from the midpoint of $A$ and $B$ to the x-axis).

By the quadratic formula, the solutions for $x$ from equation (1) are $x = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{(2k)^2 - 4k(l-4)}}{2k} = 1 \pm \sqrt{1 - \frac{l-4}{k}}$.

Let's denote $x_1 = 1 + \sqrt{1 - \frac{l-4}{k}}$ and $x_2 = 1 - \sqrt{1 - \frac{l-4}{k}}$. Then $x_1 - x_2 = 2\sqrt{1 - \frac{l-4}{k}} = 3$ (by the property of the difference of the roots of a quadratic equation). This gives $\sqrt{1 - \frac{l-4}{k}} = \frac{3}{2}$.

Squaring both sides gives $1 - \frac{l-4}{k} = \frac{9}{4}$. Simplifying this equation gives $\frac{l-4}{k} = 1 - \frac{9}{4} = -\frac{1}{4}$. Multiplying through by $k$ gives $l - 4 = -\frac{k}{4}$. Rearranging terms gives $l = 4 - \frac{k}{4}$.

The distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin are $\sqrt{x_1^2 + y_1^2} = \sqrt{x_1^2 + 4}$ and $\sqrt{x_2^2 + y_2^2} = \sqrt{x_2^2 + 4}$, respectively. We are asked to find the sum of the squares of these distances, which is $x_1^2 + y_1^2 + x_2^2 + y_2^2 = x_1^2 + 4 + x_2^2 + 4 = (x_1^2 + x_2^2) + 8$.

We know that $(x_1 + x_2)^2 - 4x_1x_2 = (2)^2 - 4(1)(1 - \frac{l-4}{k}) = 4 - 4 + 4\frac{l-4}{k} = 4\frac{l-4}{k}$. But we know from our earlier work that $4\frac{l-4}{k} = 9$.

Therefore, $(x_1 + x_2)^2 - 4x_1x_2 = 9$, and $(x_1^2 + x_2^2) = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 9 + 8 = 17$.

So the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $17 + 8 = 25$.
The value of the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is 25.
The answer is: 25

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We first solve the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$. This equation represents the points of intersection of the parabola and the line $y = 4$. The solutions $x_1$ and $x_2$ of this equation are the $x$-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$. We have: $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$. The distance between $A$ and $B$ is $6$, so $|x_1 - x_2| = 6$. The discriminant of the quadratic equation is $(2k)^2 - 4k(l - 4) = 4k^2 - 4kl + 16k$. By the quadratic formula, $x_{1,2} = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}}{2k} = 1 \pm \sqrt{1 - l + 4}$. So we have $\sqrt{(x_1 - 0)^2 + (4 - 0)^2} + \sqrt{(x_2 - 0)^2 + (4 - 0)^2} = \sqrt{x_1^2 + 16} + \sqrt{x_2^2 + 16}$. By the distance formula and the fact that $|x_1 - x_2| = 6$, this simplifies to $\sqrt{x_1^2 + 16} + \sqrt{x_2^2 + 16} = \sqrt{(x_1 - x_2)^2 + 32} = \sqrt{36 + 32} = \sqrt{68}$. Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $(\sqrt{x_1^2 + 16})^2 + (\sqrt{x_2^2 + 16})^2 = x_1^2 + 16 + x_2^2 + 16 = (x_1^2 + x_2^2) + 32$.
We know that $(x_1 - x_2)^2 = 36$, so $x_1^2 - 2x_1x_2 + x_2^2 = 36$. But $(x_1 + x_2)^2 = (2k)^2 / k^2 = 4$, so $x_1^2 + 2x_1x_2 + x_2^2 = 4$. Subtracting these two equations gives $4x_1x_2 = 32$, so $x_1x_2 = 8$. Substituting this into $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 4 - 16 = -12$, we have $(x_1^2 + x_2^2) + 32 = -12 + 32 = 20$.
Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is 20. The answer is: 20

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we need to understand the given condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
This can be simplified as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$, which is the same as $|x-2y| + |- (x-2y)| = 40$.
The absolute value of a number plus its negative is always zero, so we have $2|x-2y| = 40$, or $|x-2y| = 20$.
This means that the distance between $x$ and $2y$ is always 20. We can consider two cases:
Case 1: $x \geq 2y$. Then $x - 2y = 20$, or $x = 2y + 20$.
Case 2: $x < 2y$. Then $2y - x = 20$, or $x = 2y - 20$.
Now we substitute these into the expression we want to minimize: $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.
For Case 1: $5(2y+20)^2+5y^2-8(2y+20)y$.
For Case 2: $5(2y-20)^2+5y^2-8(2y-20)y$.
Both cases give the same expression: $20y^2 + 400y + 2000 + 5y^2 - 16y^2 + 160y = 2000 + 240y$.
To minimize this expression, we take the derivative with respect to $y$ and set it equal to zero: $240 = 0$, which is a contradiction. So, we need to consider the endpoints of the interval where $y$ can range.
For Case 1: $y$ ranges from $-10$ to $\infty$.
For Case 2: $y$ ranges from $- \infty$ to $10$.
We can test the endpoints to find the minimum value:
For Case 1: If $y = -10$, then $x = 2(-10) + 20 = 0$. Substituting into the expression we want to minimize gives: $2000 + 240(-10) = 2000 - 2400 = -400$.
For Case 2: If $y = 10$, then $x = 2(10) - 20 = 0$. Substituting into the expression we want to minimize gives the same value: $2000 + 240(10) = 2000 + 2400 = 4400$.
So, the minimum value is $-400$. However, this doesn't make sense in the context of the problem, because the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is always non-negative.
Therefore, there must have been a mistake in our work. Let's go back and check our steps.
Upon revisiting the solution, we realize that we made a mistake in simplifying the absolute value condition. The correct simplification is as follows:
$|x-2y| + |- (x-2y)| = 40$ implies $2|x-2y| = 40$, so $|x-2y| = 20$.
From this, we can see that $x-2y = \pm 20$.
Let's consider the two cases again.
Case 1: $x - 2y = 20$. Substituting into the expression we want to minimize gives: $5(2y+20)^2+5y^2-8(2y+20)y$.
Case 2: $x - 2y = -20$, or $x = 2y - 20$. Substituting into the expression we want to minimize gives: $5(2y-20)^2+5y^2-8(2y-20)y$.
Again, both cases give the same expression: $20y^2 + 400y + 2000 + 5y^2 - 16y^2 + 160y = 2000 + 240y$.
Taking the derivative with respect to $y$ and setting it equal to zero gives: $240 = 0$, which is still a contradiction. So, we need to consider the endpoints of the interval where $y$ can range.
For Case 1: $y$ ranges from $-10$ to $\infty$.
For Case 2: $y$ ranges from $- \infty$ to $10$.
Testing the endpoints again, we find the minimum value:
For Case 1: If $y = -10$, then $x = 2(-10) + 20 = 0$. Substituting into the expression we want to minimize gives: $2000 + 240(-10) = 2000 - 2400 = -400$. But this result doesn't make sense in the context of the problem.
For Case 2: If $y = 10$, then $x = 2(10) - 20 = 0$. Substituting into the expression we want to minimize gives: $2000 + 240(10) = 2000 + 2400 = 4400$. But this also doesn't make sense in the context of the problem.
This suggests that we must have made another mistake. Let's go back and check our steps again.
Upon revisiting the solution once more, we realize that our mistake was in setting the derivative equal to zero. The correct step should be to set the derivative equal to zero to find the critical points, then check the values at the endpoints of the interval.
Setting the derivative of $2000 + 240y$ equal to zero gives $240 = 0$, which is a contradiction. This means that the function $2000 + 240y$ is a strictly increasing function, and its minimum value occurs at the lower endpoint of the interval.
For Case 1: $y = -10$, the expression we want to minimize is $-400$.
For Case 2: $y = 10$, the expression we want to minimize is $4400$.
So, the minimum value occurs in Case 1, with $y = -10$.
Substituting $y = -10$ into $x = 2y + 20$ gives $x = 0$.
Therefore, the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $-400$.
The answer is: $-400$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To solve this problem, we first note that the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ can be written as a quadratic in terms of $x$ and $y$. Specifically, it can be written as
\[5\left(x^2 - \frac{4}{5}xy + y^2\right) = 5\left((x - \frac{2}{5}y)^2 + \frac{3}{5}y^2\right).\]

Now, let's consider the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. This condition is equivalent to $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$, which simplifies to $|x-2y| + |x-2y| = 40$, or simply $2|x-2y| = 40$, which gives $|x-2y| = 20$. 

By the triangle inequality, we have $|x-2y| = |2y-x| \ge |(x+2y)-(2y-x)| = 2|x|$, so $|x-2y| = 20 \ge 2|x|$, or $|x| \le 10$. Similarly, we have $|y-2x| = |2x-y| \ge |(2x+y)-(2x-y)| = 2|y|$, so $|x-2y| = 20 \ge 2|y|$, or $|y| \le 10$.

Therefore, $x$ and $y$ are both bounded in the interval $[-10,10]$. 

Now we need to find the minimum of $5\left((x - \frac{2}{5}y)^2 + \frac{3}{5}y^2\right)$ under the condition $|x-2y| = 20$. To do this, we first minimize the expression $(x - \frac{2}{5}y)^2 + \frac{3}{5}y^2$. Since $(x - \frac{2}{5}y)^2 \ge 0$ and $\frac{3}{5}y^2 \ge 0$, we have $(x - \frac{2}{5}y)^2 + \frac{3}{5}y^2 \ge 0$. 

To minimize this expression, we need to make $(x - \frac{2}{5}y)^2$ as small as possible and $\frac{3}{5}y^2$ as small as possible. This happens when $x = \frac{2}{5}y$, in which case $(x - \frac{2}{5}y)^2 = 0$. Therefore, the minimum value of $(x - \frac{2}{5}y)^2 + \frac{3}{5}y^2$ is $\frac{3}{5}y^2$.

Now we need to find the minimum value of $\frac{3}{5}y^2$ under the condition $|x-2y| = 20$. Since $|x-2y| = 20$, we have $x = 2y \pm 20$. Substituting $x = 2y \pm 20$ into the expression $\frac{3}{5}y^2$, we get $\frac{3}{5}y^2 = \frac{3}{5}(y^2 \pm 10y + 100) = \frac{3}{5}(y^2 + 100)$.

Since $y$ is bounded in the interval $[-10,10]$, the minimum value of $\frac{3}{5}y^2$ occurs when $y = 0$, and is $\frac{3}{5} \cdot 0^2 = 0$. 

So the minimum value of $5\left((x - \frac{2}{5}y)^2 + \frac{3}{5}y^2\right)$ under the condition $|x-2y| = 20$ is $5 \cdot 0 = 0$. 

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 0.
The answer is: 0

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ subject to the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we can rewrite the condition as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, we know that $|x-2y| + |2y-x| \geq |(x-2y) + (2y-x)| = |0| = 0$. So the minimum value of the condition is achieved when the condition is equal to 0, which means $x-2y = 0$ and $2y-x = 0$, or $x=2y$.
Substituting $x=2y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get $5(2y)^2 + 5y^2 - 8(2y)(y) = 20y^2 + 5y^2 - 16y^2 = 9y^2$.
Now we need to find the value of $y$ that makes $9y^2$ as small as possible, given the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ reduces to $x=2y$.
Substituting $x=2y$ into the condition, we get $|2y-2y| + |y-4y| = |0| + |-3y| = 3|y| = 40$. So $|y| = \frac{40}{3}$.
Since we want the minimum value of $9y^2$, we should choose the negative value of $y$, so $y=-\frac{40}{3}$.
Substituting $y=-\frac{40}{3}$ into $x=2y$, we get $x=2(-\frac{40}{3})=-\frac{80}{3}$.
Now we can calculate the value of $9y^2$ for $y=-\frac{40}{3}$, which gives $9(-\frac{40}{3})^2 = 9*\frac{1600}{9} = 1600$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 1600. The answer is: $1600$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, let's rewrite the given condition as $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. By the property of absolute value, we have $|a - b| = |-(a - b)| = |b - a|$, so we can rewrite the condition as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$.
Expanding the absolute values, we have $(x-2y) + (2y-x) = 40$ or $(x-2y) - (2y-x) = 40$.
The first case simplifies to $0 = 40$, which is not possible. The second case simplifies to $-4y = 40$, so $y = -10$.
Substituting $y = -10$ into the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we get $|x+20| + |-20-x| = 40$. Expanding the absolute values, we have $(x+20) + (20+x) = 40$, which simplifies to $2x+40 = 40$. So $2x = 0$, and $x = 0$.
So the only solution is $x = 0$ and $y = -10$. Now we substitute these values into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, which gives $5(0)^2+5(-10)^2-8(0)(-10) = 500$. So the minimum value of the expression under the condition is $500$. The answer is: $500$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We start by simplifying the given condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. 

By the triangle inequality, we know that $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = |(x - 2y) - (y - 2x)| = |x - 2y - y + 2x| = |3x - 3y| = 3|x - y| = 40$. So, we have $|x - y| = \frac{40}{3}$.

Next, we substitute $t = x - y$ into the expression we want to minimize, $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$. By simplification, we have:
\begin{align*}
5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy &= 5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy \\
&= 5[(x - y)^2 + 2xy] - 8xy \\
&= 5[t^2 + 2(y^2 - ty)] - 8(y^2 - ty) \\
&= 5[t^2 + 2(y^2 - ty)] - 8(y^2 - ty) \\
&= 5t^2 + 10y^2 - 10ty - 8y^2 + 8ty \\
&= 5t^2 + 2y^2 - 2ty \\
&= 5t^2 + \frac{1}{2}(2y - t)^2.
\end{align*}
Since $|t| = \frac{40}{3}$, we can conclude that $5t^2 \ge -\frac{2000}{9}$. 
Moreover, $(2y - t)^2 \ge 0$ as it is a square of a real number. 

Hence, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is achieved when $t = 0$ and $y = \frac{t}{2} = 0$. 

Substitute $t = 0$ into the simplified expression, we have $5t^2 + \frac{1}{2}(2y - t)^2 = 0$. 

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ when $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$ is 0. The answer is: $0$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To begin with, we have the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
First, we can rewrite this as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$.
Now, we know that $|a| + |b|$ is the sum of the distances from $a$ and $b$ to 0 on the number line. So $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$ is the sum of the distances from $2y-x$ and $2x-y$ to 0.
By the triangle inequality, $|a+b| \leq |a| + |b|$ for all real numbers $a$ and $b$. Therefore, we have $|2y-x+2x-y| \leq |2y-x| + |2x-y|$, which simplifies to $|y| \leq |2y-x| + |2x-y|$. This inequality is always true, so the only way that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can hold is when equality holds in the triangle inequality, i.e., when $(2y-x)$ and $(2x-y)$ have the same sign. There are two cases to consider:
1) If $2y-x \geq 0$ and $2x-y \geq 0$, then we have $2y-x = 20$ and $2x-y = 20$. Solving this system of equations gives us $x = 10$ and $y = 5$.
2) If $2y-x \leq 0$ and $2x-y \leq 0$, then we have $2y-x = -20$ and $2x-y = -20$. Solving this system of equations gives us $x = -10$ and $y = -5$.
In both cases, the value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is the same:
\[5(10)^2+5(5)^2-8(10)(5) = 500+125-400 = 325.\]
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 325.
The answer is: 325.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To begin with, we have the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. We can rewrite this equation by using the property $|a| + |b| = |a+b| + |a-b|$. So the equation becomes $|(x-2y) + (y-2x)| + |(x-2y) - (y-2x)| = 40$, which simplifies to $| -x - y | + | x - y | = 40$.

Now, we use the property of absolute value $|a| = a$ if $a \geq 0$, and $|a| = -a$ if $a < 0$. So we can split this into two cases:
1. If $ -x - y \geq 0$ and $x - y \geq 0$, then we have $-x - y + x - y = 40$, which simplifies to $-2y = 40$ and $y = -20$. Substituting $y = -20$ into $x - y \geq 0$ gives $x + 20 \geq 0$, so $x \geq -20$. The minimum value is achieved when $x = -20$.
2. If $ -x - y < 0$ and $x - y < 0$, then we have $x + y + x - y = 40$, which simplifies to $2x = 40$ and $x = 20$. Substituting $x = 20$ into $x - y < 0$ gives $20 - y < 0$, so $y > 20$. But this contradicts with our original assumption that $ -x - y < 0$. So this case is not possible.

Thus, the minimum value is achieved when $x = -20$ and $y = -20$. Now we substitute these values into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
\[5(-20)^2 + 5(-20)^2 - 8(-20)(-20) = 5 \cdot 400 + 5 \cdot 400 - 8 \cdot 400 = 2000 + 2000 - 3200 = 800.\]

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the given condition is 800. The answer is: $800$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ given the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$,
we can first use the triangle inequality to rewrite the condition:
\[|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |x-2y| + |2x-y| \geq |(x-2y) + (2x-y)| = |3x-3y| = 3|x-y| = 40.\]
This gives us the condition $3|x-y| = 40$.
From this we can solve for $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$.
Now we can use the inequality $(x-y)^2 \geq 0$, which expands to $x^2 - 2xy + y^2 \geq 0$, to get:
\[(x^2 - 2xy + y^2) \geq 0.\]
Rearranging, we have $x^2 + y^2 - 2xy \geq 0$.
We can rewrite this as $(x-y)^2 \geq 0$.
From our earlier condition $3|x-y| = 40$, we have $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$, so squaring both sides, we have:
\[(x-y)^2 = \left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{1600}{9}.\]
Substituting this into our inequality $(x-y)^2 \geq 0$, we have $\frac{1600}{9} \geq 0$, which is always true.
Now we can use the fact that $(a-b)^2 \geq 0$ implies $a^2 - 2ab + b^2 \geq 0$, or equivalently, $2ab \leq 2a^2 + 2b^2$, which gives $ab \leq \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}$.
Setting $a = x$ and $b = y$, we have $xy \leq \frac{x^2 + y^2}{2}$.
Substituting this into our expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$, we have:
\[5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = 5(x^2 + y^2) - 8\left(\frac{x^2 + y^2}{2}\right) = 5(x^2 + y^2) - 4(x^2 + y^2) = (5-4)(x^2 + y^2) = x^2 + y^2.\]
To minimize $x^2 + y^2$, we need to minimize $(x-y)^2$ since $x^2 + y^2 = (x-y)^2 + 2xy$.
From our earlier condition, we have $(x-y)^2 = \frac{1600}{9}$, and since $(x-y)^2 \geq 0$, the minimum value of $(x-y)^2$ is 0, which occurs when $x=y$.
Substituting $x=y$ into the condition $3|x-y| = 40$, we have $3|x-x| = 40$, or $3 \cdot 0 = 40$, which is not true.
However, we can use the fact that $(x-y)^2 \geq 0$ to show that $x^2 + y^2 \geq 2xy$.
Rearranging, we have $x^2 - 2xy + y^2 \geq 0$, or $(x-y)^2 \geq 0$.
This tells us that the minimum value of $x^2 + y^2 - 2xy = (x-y)^2 \geq 0$, which implies that $x^2 + y^2 \geq 2xy$.
Therefore, to minimize $x^2 + y^2$, we need to maximize $xy$.
From our earlier inequality $ab \leq \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}$, we have $xy \leq \frac{x^2 + y^2}{2}$.
Substituting $x=y$, we have $x^2 \leq \frac{x^2 + x^2}{2}$, or $x^2 \leq x^2$.
This tells us that the maximum value of $xy$ occurs when $x=y$, so the minimum value of $x^2 + y^2$ is when $x=y$.
Substituting $x=y$ into $x^2 + y^2$, we have $2x^2$, so to minimize $2x^2$, we need to minimize $x^2$.
Setting $x=y$, we can substitute this into our earlier condition $3|x-y| = 40$, which becomes $3|x-x| = 40$, or $3 \cdot 0 = 40$, which is not true.
However, we can use the fact that $|x-y| \geq 0$ to show that $x^2 \geq xy$.
From our earlier inequality $|x-y| \geq 0$, we have $(x-y)^2 \geq 0$, or $x^2 - 2xy + y^2 \geq 0$.
Rearranging, we have $x^2 + y^2 \geq 2xy$, which implies that $x^2 \geq xy$.
Therefore, to minimize $x^2 + y^2$, we need to maximize $xy$, which occurs when $x=y$.
Substituting $x=y$ into $x^2 + y^2 - 8xy$, we have $x^2 + y^2 - 8x^2 = y^2 - 7x^2$.
To minimize this expression, we need to minimize $y^2 - 7x^2$.
Since we have already established that the minimum value of $x^2 + y^2$ occurs when $x=y$, we can substitute $x=y$ into $y^2 - 7x^2$, which becomes $y^2 - 7y^2 = -6y^2$.
To minimize $-6y^2$, we need to minimize $y^2$, which occurs when $y=0$.
Substituting $y=0$ into the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we have $|x-0| + |0-2x| = 40$, or $|x| + |-2x| = 40$, or $|x| + |2x| = 40$.
This simplifies to $3|x| = 40$, or $|x| = \frac{40}{3}$.
Since $x=y$, we have $x=y=0$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is $5(0)^2 + 5(0)^2 - 8(0)(0) = 0$.
The answer is: $\boxed{

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions.
The quantity inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, can be either positive or negative.
If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 > 0$, we have $\vert x-1 \vert > 2$. This means $x-1 > 2$ or $x-1 < -2$. Solving these inequalities gives us $x > 3$ or $x < -1$.
If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0$, we have $\vert x-1 \vert < 2$. This means $-2 < x-1 < 2$. Simplifying the inequalities gives $-1 < x < 3$.
So, the solutions to the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ are the values of $x$ in the intervals $(-\infty, -1)$, $(-1, 1)$, $(1, 3)$, and $(3, \infty)$.
For the equation to have four distinct solutions, the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be chosen such that it creates exactly one value of $x$ in each of the four intervals above.
This means $\frac{m}{100}$ must be in the interval $(0, 1)$.
So, the value of $m$ must be in the interval $(0, 100)$.
There are 99 positive integers in this interval, so there are 99 possible values of $m$.
The value of $m$ must be such that the equation has exactly four distinct solutions.
By trial and error or by examining the properties of absolute value, we find that $m=50$ is the only value that works.
Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is 1, and the value of $m$ is 50. The answer is: $1$

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


For the equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ to have 4 distinct solutions,
the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be strictly between $0$ and $2$.
This means $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$,
so $0 < m < 200$.
Since $m$ is a positive integer, the possible values of $m$ are $1, 2, ..., 199$.
Counting the number of integers in this range, we get $\boxed{199}$. The answer is: $199$

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.
This means that the right-hand side, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be equal to $2$ or $1$.
If $\frac{m}{100}=2$, then $m=200$.
If $\frac{m}{100}=1$, then $m=100$.
Thus, there are only $2$ possible values for $m$.

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $||x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}=2$. This is because $||x-1|-2|$ is a piecewise function that has four distinct solutions when the right side of the equation equals the value at which the function changes its behavior (in this case, 2).

So, we solve the equation $\frac{m}{100}=2$ for $m$ to get:

\[m = 2 * 100 = 200.\]

Therefore, the value of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 200. The answer is: $\boxed{1}$.

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The number of distinct solutions of the equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $4$ means that the graph of $| |x-1|-2|$ has $4$ "hills and valleys".
The graph of $| |x-1|-2|$ consists of two "waves": one for $|x-1|-2$ and one for $-(|x-1|-2)$.
Each wave consists of two "hills" and two "valleys".
So, the number of "hills and valleys" is equal to the total number of "hills" and "valleys" in both waves, which is equal to $4$.
Therefore, the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be $2$.
Solving $\frac{m}{100}=2$, we find $m=200$.
Thus, there is only one positive integer $m$ that satisfies the equation, and that is $m=200$. The answer is: $1$

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The given equation is $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$.

We know that $| |x - 1| - 2 |$ can be equal to $\frac{m}{100}$ for 4 distinct solutions only when $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. This is because the function $| |x - 1| - 2 |$ oscillates between 0 and 4, and only when the right hand side of the equation is 2, there are 4 distinct solutions.

So, we set $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, then we can solve for $m$ to get $m = 200$.

Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ such that the equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. The value of $m$ is $200$.
The answer is: $1$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The expression $AB=0$ is satisfied if either $A=0$ or $B=0$. So, we can break down the problem into two cases:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
For the square of absolute values to be zero, the absolute values themselves must be zero. This gives us two equations:
1) $|x+y| = 10 \implies x+y = \pm10$
2) $|x-y| = 10 \implies x-y = \pm10$

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
Again, for the square of absolute values to be zero, the absolute values themselves must be zero. This gives us two equations:
1) $|x| = 8 \implies x = \pm8$
2) $|y| = 8 \implies y = \pm8$

Combining the results of both cases, we get the four points $(\pm8, \pm8)$. These are the vertices of a square with side length $16$. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So, the area of the convex polygon is $256$ square units. The answer is: $256$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


For the product to be zero, at least one of the factors must be zero. That is, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
If the first factor is zero, then both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only possible values for $(x, y)$ in this case are $(8, 2)$ and $(2, 8)$, because these are the only pairs of numbers that satisfy both $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
If the second factor is zero, then both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The only possible values for $(x, y)$ in this case are $(8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.
Putting all this together, the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the original equation are $(8, 2)$, $(2, 8)$, $(8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, and $(-8, -8)$. These points are the vertices of a hexagon. To find the area of the hexagon, we can divide it into six equilateral triangles each with side length 10 (from the points $(8, 2)$ and $(2, 8)$ to the other four points).
The area of each equilateral triangle is $\frac{s^2 \sqrt{3}}{4}$, where $s$ is the side length.
The total area of the hexagon is $6 \times \frac{10^2 \sqrt{3}}{4} = 150 \sqrt{3}$. The answer is: $150\sqrt{3}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation given is
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$
For the product to be zero, at least one of the factors must be zero.
This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
These equations represent two lines: $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.
If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
These equations represent four lines: $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
The intersections of these lines form a square with side length 16.
The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
So the area of the convex polygon is 256.
The answer is: 256

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



Firstly, note that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of them is zero. This means we can set each factor of the product equal to zero separately to find the solutions to the equation.

The first factor is $ ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This is the case only when $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$. These four points form the vertices of a square with side length 20.

The second factor is $ ((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This is the case only when $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. These four points form the vertices of a square with side length 16.

The two squares overlap in a smaller square with side length 8.

The total area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares minus the area of the overlapping square.

The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side. So the area of the first square is $20^2 = 400$, the area of the second square is $16^2 = 256$, and the area of the overlapping square is $8^2 = 64$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $400 + 256 - 64 = 592$. The answer is: $\boxed{592}$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ will equal zero if either of the two expressions inside the multiplication are zero.
This means either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The only way the first expression can equal zero is if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
This means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the square as $(8, 2), (8, -2), (-8, -2), (-8, 2)$.
The only way the second expression can equal zero is if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
So the vertices of the square are also $(8, 8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8), (8, -8)$.
Combining both squares, we get a 4x4 square with side length 8. The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of this square is $8^2 = 64$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{64}$. The answer is: $64$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
For $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$.
This means $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
Similarly, for $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
For $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
For $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

By solving these equations, we find that the points satisfying the given equation are the vertices of a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
So, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation is satisfied if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
For the first two equations, this means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
For the last two equations, this means $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The solutions are the vertices of a square with side length 16.
To find the area of the square, we square the length of one side, so the area is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find $f(100)$, we can start by finding the value of $f(f(100))$ using the second equation given. 
We have $f(2(50)) = 2f(50) + 1$. 
So, $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.
Now, let's substitute this into the first equation given, $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. 
We have $f(f(f(100))) = 8(100) - 7 = 793$.
Using the second equation again, we have $f(f(100)) = 2f(f(50)) + 1$.
And substituting this into the equation above, we get $f(2f(f(50)) + 1) = 793$.
Let's set $x = f(50)$, then we have $f(2x + 1) = 793$.
Now, we need to find $f(50)$. We can use the second equation again to find a relationship between $f(50)$ and $f(25)$. 
We have $f(2(25)) = 2f(25) + 1$.
So, $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.
Continuing this process, we can keep breaking down the numbers and using the second equation until we reach a value that can be easily found from the first equation.
By repeatedly applying the second equation, we can eventually find that $f(1) = 1$.
Using this, we can find $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 3$, $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 7$, and so on.
After a lot of work, we find that $f(50) = 199$.
Substituting this back into the equation $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$, we can find that $f(25) = 99$.
And then using the second equation again, we can find that $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2(199) + 1 = 399$.
So, the value of $f(100)$ is 399.
The answer is: $399$.

## QUESTION 4 - 1

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we use the second equation to find the value of $f(100)$. Since $100 = 2 \cdot 50$, we have $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.
Next, we need to find the value of $f(50)$. Using the same equation, since $50 = 2 \cdot 25$, we have $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.
Continuing this process, we find $f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1$.
But $12.5$ is not a natural number, so we cannot continue this process indefinitely.
However, we notice that the first equation gives us a clue as to how to proceed. If we substitute $f(n)$ with $n$ in the first equation, we have $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$.
If we substitute $f(n)$ with $n$ in the second equation, we have $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$.
By trying out small values of $n$, we find that $f(1) = 1$, $f(2) = 3$, $f(3) = 5$, and so on, so it appears that $f(n) = 2n - 1$.
To confirm this, we substitute $f(n) = 2n - 1$ into the first equation: $f(f(f(n))) = f(f(2n - 1)) = f(2(2n - 1) - 1) = f(4n - 3) = 8n - 7$.
And substituting $f(n) = 2n - 1$ into the second equation: $f(2n) = 2(2n - 1) + 1 = 4n - 1$.
Thus, $f(n) = 2n - 1$ satisfies both given equations, so we can conclude that $f(n) = 2n - 1$.
Now we can find $f(100) = 2(100) - 1 = 199$. The value of $f(100)$ is 199. The answer is: $\boxed{199}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we can plug in $n = 1$ into the second equation to find $f(1)$. 
We have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. 
Since the value of $f(1)$ is not given in the problem, we cannot directly calculate $f(100)$ using the second equation. 
We can, however, use the first equation to help us find $f(1)$.
By setting $n = 1$, we get $f(f(f(1))) = 8 - 7 = 1$.
Since $f(f(f(1))) = 1$, we know that $f(1)$ must be an integer such that when $f$ is applied three times, it gives us 1. 
By trying different values, we find that $f(1) = 1$ satisfies this condition because $f(f(f(1))) = f(f(1)) = f(1) = 1$.
Now that we know $f(1) = 1$, we can use the second equation to calculate other values of $f(n)$. 
For example, $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2(1) + 1 = 3$.
Now we can calculate $f(100)$ using the second equation.
Using the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, we can calculate $f(100)$ by repeatedly applying this equation. 
First, we calculate $f(200)$: $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$.
Next, we calculate $f(400)$: $f(400) = 2f(200) + 1$.
Continuing this process, we can keep applying the equation until we reach $f(100)$.
We eventually find that $f(400) = 799$.
Then $f(200) = (799 - 1)/2 = 399$.
And finally, $f(100) = (399 - 1)/2 = 199$.
So $f(100) = 199$.
The answer is: 199

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We can start by calculating $f(1)$ using the second condition $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$.
Letting $n=1$, we get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. But we know that $f(f(f(1))) = 8(1) - 7 = -1$, and since $f$ maps only to natural numbers, we must have $f(1) = 1$. Then, $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2(1) + 1 = 3$.
Now we can use the second condition to find $f(3)$: $f(6) = 2f(3) + 1$. But we know from the first condition that $f(f(f(3))) = 8(3) - 7 = 19$. Since $f(f(3)) = f(6)$, we have $f(6) = 19$. Substituting this into the equation $f(6) = 2f(3) + 1$, we get $19 = 2f(3) + 1$, so $2f(3) = 18$, and $f(3) = 9$.
Now we can continue this process to find $f(4)$, $f(5)$, and so on, until we reach $f(100)$. It turns out that $f(100) = 199$. The answer is: $199$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's plug $n=1$ into the second equation to get $f(2)=2f(1)+1$.
Since $f(f(f(1)))=f(0)=8(1)-7=1$, we have $f(2)=1$.
Then, plug $n=2$ into the second equation to get $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2(1)+1=3$.
And, $f(f(f(2)))=f(1)=8(2)-7=9$.
So, $f(4)=3$.
Continuing this way, we get $f(6)=5$, $f(8)=7$, and $f(10)=9$.
We notice that $f(n)=2n-1$ for all positive even integers $n$.
Now, let's check this with the second equation: $f(2n)=2f(n)+1=2(2n-1)+1=4n-1$.
This is consistent with our previous results.
Now, we know that $f(100)=2(100)-1=199$. So, $f(100)=199$.
The answer is: $199$
