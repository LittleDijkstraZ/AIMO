Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The point of intersection between the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ and the line $y = 4$ satisfy the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$. This is a quadratic equation, and since the parabola and line intersect at two points, the discriminant of this equation is positive. The discriminant is given by $(2k)^2 - 4k(l-4) = 4k^2 - 4k(l-4) = 4k^2 - 4kl + 16k$. Since this is positive, we know that $k^2 - kl + 4k > 0$.

The points of intersection are given by the quadratic formula as $x = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{(2k)^2 - 4k(l-4)}}{2k} = 1 \pm \sqrt{1 - (l-4)}$. Let $x_1 = 1 + \sqrt{1 - (l-4)}$ and $x_2 = 1 - \sqrt{1 - (l-4)}$. Then the points of intersection are $(x_1, 4)$ and $(x_2, 4)$.

The distance between these two points is given by $\sqrt{(x_1 - x_2)^2 + (4 - 4)^2} = \sqrt{(x_1 - x_2)^2} = |x_1 - x_2| = 6$. Thus, we have $|1 + \sqrt{1 - (l-4)} - (1 - \sqrt{1 - (l-4)})| = 6$, which simplifies to $2\sqrt{1 - (l-4)} = 6$, so $\sqrt{1 - (l-4)} = 3$. Squaring both sides gives $1 - (l-4) = 9$, or $l-4 = -8$, so $l = -4$.

We want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The distance from $(x_1, 4)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x_1^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{(1 + \sqrt{1 - (l-4)})^2 + 16} = \sqrt{(1 + \sqrt{1 + 8})^2 + 16} = \sqrt{2^2 + 16} = \sqrt{20}$. Similarly, the distance from $(x_2, 4)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{(1 - \sqrt{1 + 8})^2 + 16} = \sqrt{2^2 + 16} = \sqrt{20}$.

Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $2 \times 20 = 40$. The answer is: 40

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To solve this problem, we first need to find the points $A$ and $B$ where the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$. We can find these points by setting the two equations equal to each other and solving for $x$:
$$kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4.$$
Rearranging the equation gives:
$$kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0.$$
This is a quadratic equation with solutions for $x$ given by the quadratic formula:
$$x = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{(2k)^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k}.$$
$$x = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k}.$$
$$x = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}}{2k}.$$
$$x = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{4k(k - l + 4)}}{2k}.$$
$$x = 1 \pm \sqrt{\frac{k - l + 4}{k}}.$$
Let $x = 1 + \sqrt{\frac{k - l + 4}{k}}$ be the x-coordinate of point $A$ and $x = 1 - \sqrt{\frac{k - l + 4}{k}}$ be the x-coordinate of point $B$. The y-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$ are both 4 since they lie on the line $y = 4$.

The distance between points $A$ and $B$ is given as 6, so we have:
$$|1 + \sqrt{\frac{k - l + 4}{k}} - (1 - \sqrt{\frac{k - l + 4}{k}})| = 6,$$
$$\sqrt{\frac{k - l + 4}{k}} \cdot 2 = 6.$$
$$\sqrt{\frac{k - l + 4}{k}} = 3.$$
Squaring both sides gives:
$$\frac{k - l + 4}{k} = 9.$$
$$k - l + 4 = 9k.$$
$$l = \frac{8k}{9} + 4.$$

The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is the sum of $x_A^2 + y_A^2$ and $x_B^2 + y_B^2$, where $(x_A, y_A) = (1 + \sqrt{\frac{k - l + 4}{k}}, 4)$ and $(x_B, y_B) = (1 - \sqrt{\frac{k - l + 4}{k}}, 4)$. This gives:
$$(1 + \sqrt{\frac{k - l + 4}{k}})^2 + 4^2 + (1 - \sqrt{\frac{k - l + 4}{k}})^2 + 4^2.$$
$$(1 + \sqrt{\frac{k - l + 4}{k}})^2 + (1 - \sqrt{\frac{k - l + 4}{k}})^2 + 32.$$
$$2 + 2\left(\sqrt{\frac{k - l + 4}{k}}\right)^2 + 32.$$
$$2 + 2\left(\frac{k - l + 4}{k}\right) + 32.$$
$$2 + 2\left(\frac{k - \left(\frac{8k}{9} + 4\right) + 4}{k}\right) + 32.$$
$$2 + 2\left(\frac{k - \frac{8k}{9} - 4 + 4}{k}\right) + 32.$$
$$2 + 2\left(\frac{k - \frac{8k}{9}}{k}\right) + 32.$$
$$2 + 2\left(\frac{k^2 - 8k}{9k}\right) + 32.$$
$$2 + \frac{2(k^2 - 8k)}{9k} + 32.$$
$$\frac{2(k^2 - 8k) + 18k}{9k} + 32.$$
$$\frac{2k^2 - 16k + 18k}{9k} + 32.$$
$$\frac{2k^2 + 2k}{9k} + 32.$$
$$\frac{2k(k + 1)}{9k} + 32.$$
$$\frac{2(k + 1)}{9} + 32.$$

Now, we need to find the value of $k$ that satisfies the condition. We know that the distance between points $A$ and $B$ is 6, so the distance formula gives:
$$\sqrt{(1 + \sqrt{\frac{k - l + 4}{k}} - (1 - \sqrt{\frac{k - l + 4}{k}}))^2 + (4 - 4)^2} = 6.$$
$$\sqrt{\left(2\sqrt{\frac{k - l + 4}{k}}\right)^2} = 6.$$
$$2\sqrt{\frac{k - l + 4}{k}} = 6.$$
$$\sqrt{\frac{k - l + 4}{k}} = 3.$$
Squaring both sides gives:
$$\frac{k - l + 4}{k} = 9.$$
$$k - l + 4 = 9k.$$
$$l = \frac{8k}{9} + 4.$$

Substituting this value of $l$ into the distance formula gives:
$$\sqrt{\left(2\sqrt{\frac{k - \left(\frac{8k}{9} + 4\right) + 4}{k}}\right)^2} = 6.$$
$$\sqrt{\left(2\sqrt{\frac{k - \frac{8k}{9} - 4 + 4}{k}}\right)^2} = 6.$$
$$\sqrt{\left(2\sqrt{\frac{k - \frac{8k}{9}}{k}}\right)^2} = 6.$$
$$\sqrt{\left(2\sqrt{\frac{k^2 - 8k}{9k}}\right)^2} = 6.$$
$$\sqrt{\left(2\frac{\sqrt{k^2 - 8k}}{3\sqrt{k}}\right)^2} = 6.$$
$$\sqrt{\frac{4(k^2 - 8k)}{9k}} = 6.$$
$$\frac{2\sqrt{k^2 - 8k}}{3\sqrt{k}} = 6.$$
$$\frac{2\sqrt{k(k - 8)}}{3\sqrt{k}} = 6.$$
$$\frac{2\sqrt{k - 8}}{3} = 6.$$
$$\sqrt{k - 8} = 9.$$
$$k - 8 = 81.$$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we find the intersection points of the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ and the line $y = 4$. By setting them equal to each other, we get $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$.
Rearranging terms, we have $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$. This is a quadratic equation.

Let's say that the two intersection points $A$ and $B$ have $x$-coordinates $x_1$ and $x_2$, respectively. Since these are the roots of the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$, we have $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$.

Given that the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, we have $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 36$, which can be expanded to $x_1^2 - 2x_1x_2 + x_2^2 = 36$. We substitute $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$ into this equation to get $x_1^2 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) + x_2^2 = 36$.

We also know from the Pythagorean theorem that the square of the distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $x^2 + y^2$. Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $x_1^2 + y_1^2 + x_2^2 + y_2^2 = x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2 + x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2$.

Since $y_1 = kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l$ and $y_2 = kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l$, we can simplify the expression to $x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2 + x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2$.

Using the equation $x_1^2 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) + x_2^2 = 36$, we can substitute $x_1^2 = 36 + 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) + x_2^2$ into the expression above to get:
$$36 + 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) + x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2$$.

Next, we substitute $x_2 = 2 - x_1$ into the equation $x_1^2 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) + x_2^2 = 36$ to get:
$$x_1^2 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) + (2 - x_1)^2 = 36$$.

This simplifies to:
$$x_1^2 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) + 4 - 4x_1 + x_1^2 = 36$$, which further simplifies to:
$$2x_1^2 - 4x_1 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) + 4 = 36$$, and then to:
$$2x_1^2 - 4x_1 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = 32$$.

Dividing through by 2 gives:
$$x_1^2 - 2x_1 - \left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = 16$$.

Substituting $x_1 = 1$ (from the quadratic formula) into this equation, we get:
$$1 - 2 - \left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = 16$$, which simplifies to:
$$-1 - \left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = 16$$, and then to:
$$- \left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = 17$$.

Multiplying through by $-k$ gives:
$$l - 4 = -17k$$, and then to:
$$l = -17k + 4$$.

Substitute $l = -17k + 4$ into the equation $x_1^2 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) + x_2^2 = 36$ to get:
$$x_1^2 - 2\left(\frac{-17k + 4 - 4}{k}\right) + (2 - x_1)^2 = 36$$, which simplifies to:
$$x_1^2 - 2\left(\frac{-17k}{k}\right) + (2 - x_1)^2 = 36$$, and then to:
$$x_1^2 + 34 + (2 - x_1)^2 = 36$$.

Expanding $(2 - x_1)^2$ gives:
$$x_1^2 + 34 + 4 - 4x_1 + x_1^2 = 36$$, which simplifies to:
$$2x_1^2 - 4x_1 + 38 = 36$$, and then to:
$$2x_1^2 - 4x_1 + 2 = 0$$.

Dividing through by 2 gives:
$$x_1^2 - 2x_1 + 1 = 0$$, which is a perfect square trinomial and factors as $(x_1 - 1)^2 = 0$. Therefore, $x_1 = 1$.

Since $x_2 = 2 - x_1 = 1$, we find that the two intersection points $A$ and $B$ have the same $x$-coordinate. Therefore, they must be on a vertical line. Since they are distance 6 apart horizontally, the line segment connecting them must be vertical. Therefore, the $y$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$ must be the same, which means $y_1 = y_2$.

Finally, substituting $x_1 = 1$ into the equation $y_1 = kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l$, we get:
$$y_1 = k - 2k + l = l - k$$.

Substituting $l

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, we set the equations $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ and $y = 4$ equal to each other to find the $x$-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$. This gives us:
\[kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4.\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0.\]
Let $x_1$ and $x_2$ be the roots of this quadratic equation. By Vieta's formulas, we know that $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$.

Since the points $A$ and $B$ are distance 6 apart, we can use the distance formula:
\[(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 36.\]
Expanding, we have:
\[x_2^2 - 2x_1x_2 + x_1^2 = 36.\]
Substituting the values from Vieta's formulas, we get:
\[(x_1x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 + (x_1x_2)^2 = 36.\]
Simplifying, we have:
\[2(x_1x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 36.\]
Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
\[(x_1x_2)^2 - x_1x_2 = 18.\]
Substituting the value of $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$, we have:
\[\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right)^2 - \frac{l - 4}{k} = 18.\]
Multiplying both sides by $k^2$, we get:
\[(l - 4)^2 - k(l - 4)k = 18k^2.\]
Expanding, we have:
\[l^2 - 8l + 16 - k^2l + 4k^2 = 18k^2.\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[l^2 - k^2l - 8l + 16 = 18k^2.\]
Rearranging again, we have:
\[l^2 - k^2l - 8l - 16k^2 + 16 = 0.\]
Factoring out a common factor of $l$, we get:
\[l(l - k^2) - 8(l - 2k^2) = 0.\]
Factoring again, we have:
\[(l - 8)(l - k^2) = 0.\]
So, we have two possibilities: $l - 8 = 0$ or $l - k^2 = 0$. If $l - 8 = 0$, then $l = 8$. If $l - k^2 = 0$, then $l = k^2$.

Substituting $l = 8$ into the equation for the distance between $A$ and $B$, we get:
\[6^2 = 36 = 2(x_1x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right)^2 - 2\frac{l - 4}{k}.\]
Substituting $l = 8$, we have:
\[36 = 2\left(\frac{8 - 4}{k}\right)^2 - 2\frac{8 - 4}{k} = 2\left(\frac{4}{k}\right)^2 - 2\frac{4}{k}.\]
Simplifying, we have:
\[36 = \frac{32}{k^2} - \frac{8}{k}.\]
Multiplying both sides by $k^2$, we get:
\[36k^2 = 32k - 8k^2.\]
Rearranging terms, we have:
\[36k^2 + 8k^2 = 32k.\]
Simplifying, we have:
\[44k^2 = 32k.\]
Dividing both sides by 4, we get:
\[11k^2 = 8k.\]
If $k = 0$, then the parabola would not exist. So, we can divide both sides by $k$ to get:
\[11k = 8.\]
Solving for $k$, we have:
\[k = \frac{8}{11}.\]
Substituting this value into the equation $l = k^2$, we have:
\[l = \left(\frac{8}{11}\right)^2 = \frac{64}{121}.\]
Therefore, the only valid solution is $l = \frac{64}{121}$.

Finally, we want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. The coordinates of $A$ and $B$ are the solutions to the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$, so they are of the form $(x, 4)$.

The distance from $A$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x_1^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{\left(\frac{2k}{k} - x_2\right)^2 + 16} = \sqrt{(2 - x_2)^2 + 16}$.
The distance from $B$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x_2^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{x_2^2 + 16}$.

The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is:
\[(\sqrt{(2 - x_2)^2 + 16})^2 + (\sqrt{x_2^2 + 16})^2 = (2 - x_2)^2 + 16 + x_2^2 + 16 = 4 - 4x_2 + x_2^2 + 32 = x_2^2 - 4x_2 + 36.\]
Substituting $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k} = \frac{\frac{64}{121} - 4}{\frac{8}{11}} = \frac{-20}{11}$, we have:
\[(\sqrt{(2 - x_2)^2 + 16})^2 + (\sqrt{x_2^2 + 16})^2 = x_2^2 - 4x_2 + 36 = \left(\frac{-20}{11}\right)^2 - 4\left(\frac{-20}{11}\right) + 36.\]
Calculating, we have:
\[x_2^2 - 4x_2 +

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we need to find the x-coordinates of points A and B by setting $y = 4$ in the equation of the parabola:
\[4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l.\]
Rearranging the equation, we get:
\[kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0.\]
We are given that the distance between A and B is 6, so the difference of the roots of this equation is 6. By Vieta's formulas, the difference of the roots is $\frac{2k}{\sqrt{k^2 - k(l-4)}}$. So we have:
\[\frac{2k}{\sqrt{k^2 - k(l-4)}} = 6.\]
Squaring both sides, we get:
\[\frac{4k^2}{k^2 - k(l-4)} = 36.\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[4k^2 = 36k^2 - 36k(l-4).\]
Expanding, we get:
\[4k^2 = 36k^2 - 36kl + 144k.\]
Rearranging, we get:
\[32k^2 = 36kl - 144k.\]
Dividing both sides by 4, we get:
\[8k^2 = 9kl - 36k.\]
Rearranging, we get:
\[8k^2 + 36k = 9kl.\]
Dividing both sides by k, we get:
\[8k + 36 = 9l.\]
Now, we need to find the sum of the squares of the distances from A and B to the origin. The x-coordinates of A and B are the roots of the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$. Let $x_1$ and $x_2$ be the roots of this equation. Then the sum of the squares of the distances from A and B to the origin is:
\[(x_1)^2 + (x_2)^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = \left(\frac{2k}{k}\right)^2 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = 4 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right).\]
From $8k + 36 = 9l$, we can solve for l:
\[l = \frac{8k + 36}{9}.\]
Substituting this into the equation above, we get:
\[4 - 2\left(\frac{\frac{8k + 36}{9} - 4}{k}\right) = 4 - 2\left(\frac{8k + 36 - 36}{9k}\right) = 4 - 2\left(\frac{8k}{9k}\right) = 4 - \frac{16}{9} = \frac{20}{9}.\]
Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from A and B to the origin is $\frac{20}{9}$. The answer is: $\frac{20}{9}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



To find the points of intersection, we set the two equations equal to each other:
\[kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4.\]
Rearranging, we have:
\[kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0.\]
This is a quadratic equation in terms of $x$.

Given that the points $A$ and $B$ are distance 6 apart, the difference of the roots of the equation is 6. From Vieta's formulas, we know that the difference of the roots is $\sqrt{\frac{4k^2 - 4k(l-4)}{k^2}}$, which equals 6.

Simplifying, we get:
\[\sqrt{\frac{4k^2 - 4k(l-4)}{k^2}} = 6.\]
Squaring both sides, we have:
\[\frac{4k^2 - 4k(l-4)}{k^2} = 36.\]
Multiplying both sides by $k^2$, we get:
\[4k^2 - 4k(l-4) = 36k^2.\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[32k^2 = 4k(l-4).\]
Dividing both sides by $4k$, we get:
\[8k = l - 4.\]
We can solve for $l$:
\[l = 8k + 4.\]

Now, we substitute $l = 8k + 4$ into the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$ to get:
\[kx^2 - 2kx + 8k = 0.\]
The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is equal to $x_1^2 + x_2^2$, where $x_1$ and $x_2$ are the roots of the equation. From Vieta's formulas, we know that $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2$, where $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{8k}{k} = 8$. Thus, $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = 2^2 - 2 \cdot 8 = 4 - 16 = -12$.

However, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin cannot be negative, so there must be a mistake in our calculations. Let's revisit the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$.

From Vieta's formulas, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin should be equal to $(x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2$, where $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l-4}{k} = \frac{8k + 4 - 4}{k} = 8 + \frac{4}{k}$.
Thus, $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = 2^2 - 2(8 + \frac{4}{k}) = 4 - 16 - \frac{8}{k} = -12 - \frac{8}{k}$.

Again, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin cannot be negative, so there must be another mistake in our calculations. Let's revisit the condition that the points $A$ and $B$ are distance 6 apart.

The condition that the points $A$ and $B$ are distance 6 apart implies that $(x_1 - x_2)^2 = 6^2 = 36$. From Vieta's formulas, we know that $(x_1 - x_2)^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 4x_1x_2$, where $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l-4}{k} = \frac{8k + 4 - 4}{k} = 8 + \frac{4}{k}$.

Thus, $(x_1 - x_2)^2 = 2^2 - 4(8 + \frac{4}{k}) = 4 - 32 - \frac{16}{k} = -28 - \frac{16}{k}$.
Setting this equal to 36, we have:
\[-28 - \frac{16}{k} = 36.\]
Multiplying through by $k$, we get:
\[-28k - 16 = 36k.\]
Adding $28k$ to both sides, we get:
\[-16 = 64k.\]
Dividing both sides by $64$, we get:
\[k = -\frac{1}{4}.\]
However, since $k$ is given to be positive, we must have made a mistake in our calculations. Let's reexamine our work and see where we went wrong.

We made a mistake when we wrote $(x_1 - x_2)^2 = 6^2 = 36$. The correct equation should be $(x_1 - x_2)^2 = 6^2 = 36$.

From Vieta's formulas, we know that $(x_1 - x_2)^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 4x_1x_2$, where $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l-4}{k} = \frac{8k + 4 - 4}{k} = 8 + \frac{4}{k}$.

Thus, $(x_1 - x_2)^2 = 2^2 - 4(8 + \frac{4}{k}) = 4 - 32 - \frac{16}{k} = -28 - \frac{16}{k}$.

Setting this equal to 36, we have:
\[-28 - \frac{16}{k} = 36.\]
Multiplying through by $k$, we get:
\[-28k - 16 = 36k.\]
Adding $28k$ to both sides, we get:
\[-16 = 64k.\]
Dividing both sides by $64$, we get:
\[k = -\frac{1}{4}.\]
However, since $k$ is given to be positive, we must have made a mistake in our calculations. Let's reexamine our work and see where we went wrong.

When we set up the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$, we assumed that

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The points of intersection of the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ and the line $y = 4$ satisfy the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$. This simplifies to $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$. Let's call this equation (1).

Given that the points of intersection, $A$ and $B$, are distance 6 apart, this means the difference of the x-coordinates of $A$ and $B$ is 3 (since the distance from $A$ to $B$ is twice the length of the segment from the midpoint of $A$ and $B$ to the x-axis).

By the quadratic formula, the solutions for $x$ from equation (1) are $x = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{(2k)^2 - 4k(l-4)}}{2k} = 1 \pm \sqrt{1 - \frac{l-4}{k}}$.

Let's denote $x_1 = 1 + \sqrt{1 - \frac{l-4}{k}}$ and $x_2 = 1 - \sqrt{1 - \frac{l-4}{k}}$. Then $x_1 - x_2 = 2\sqrt{1 - \frac{l-4}{k}} = 3$ (by the property of the difference of the roots of a quadratic equation). This gives $\sqrt{1 - \frac{l-4}{k}} = \frac{3}{2}$.

Squaring both sides gives $1 - \frac{l-4}{k} = \frac{9}{4}$. Simplifying this equation gives $\frac{l-4}{k} = 1 - \frac{9}{4} = -\frac{1}{4}$. Multiplying through by $k$ gives $l - 4 = -\frac{k}{4}$. Rearranging terms gives $l = 4 - \frac{k}{4}$.

The distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin are $\sqrt{x_1^2 + y_1^2} = \sqrt{x_1^2 + 4}$ and $\sqrt{x_2^2 + y_2^2} = \sqrt{x_2^2 + 4}$, respectively. We are asked to find the sum of the squares of these distances, which is $x_1^2 + y_1^2 + x_2^2 + y_2^2 = x_1^2 + 4 + x_2^2 + 4 = (x_1^2 + x_2^2) + 8$.

We know that $(x_1 + x_2)^2 - 4x_1x_2 = (2)^2 - 4(1)(1 - \frac{l-4}{k}) = 4 - 4 + 4\frac{l-4}{k} = 4\frac{l-4}{k}$. But we know from our earlier work that $4\frac{l-4}{k} = 9$.

Therefore, $(x_1 + x_2)^2 - 4x_1x_2 = 9$, and $(x_1^2 + x_2^2) = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 9 + 8 = 17$.

So the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $17 + 8 = 25$.
The value of the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is 25.
The answer is: 25

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We first solve the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$. This equation represents the points of intersection of the parabola and the line $y = 4$. The solutions $x_1$ and $x_2$ of this equation are the $x$-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$. We have: $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$. The distance between $A$ and $B$ is $6$, so $|x_1 - x_2| = 6$. The discriminant of the quadratic equation is $(2k)^2 - 4k(l - 4) = 4k^2 - 4kl + 16k$. By the quadratic formula, $x_{1,2} = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}}{2k} = 1 \pm \sqrt{1 - l + 4}$. So we have $\sqrt{(x_1 - 0)^2 + (4 - 0)^2} + \sqrt{(x_2 - 0)^2 + (4 - 0)^2} = \sqrt{x_1^2 + 16} + \sqrt{x_2^2 + 16}$. By the distance formula and the fact that $|x_1 - x_2| = 6$, this simplifies to $\sqrt{x_1^2 + 16} + \sqrt{x_2^2 + 16} = \sqrt{(x_1 - x_2)^2 + 32} = \sqrt{36 + 32} = \sqrt{68}$. Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $(\sqrt{x_1^2 + 16})^2 + (\sqrt{x_2^2 + 16})^2 = x_1^2 + 16 + x_2^2 + 16 = (x_1^2 + x_2^2) + 32$.
We know that $(x_1 - x_2)^2 = 36$, so $x_1^2 - 2x_1x_2 + x_2^2 = 36$. But $(x_1 + x_2)^2 = (2k)^2 / k^2 = 4$, so $x_1^2 + 2x_1x_2 + x_2^2 = 4$. Subtracting these two equations gives $4x_1x_2 = 32$, so $x_1x_2 = 8$. Substituting this into $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 4 - 16 = -12$, we have $(x_1^2 + x_2^2) + 32 = -12 + 32 = 20$.
Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is 20. The answer is: 20
