Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The expression $AB=0$ is satisfied if either $A=0$ or $B=0$. So, we can break down the problem into two cases:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
For the square of absolute values to be zero, the absolute values themselves must be zero. This gives us two equations:
1) $|x+y| = 10 \implies x+y = \pm10$
2) $|x-y| = 10 \implies x-y = \pm10$

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
Again, for the square of absolute values to be zero, the absolute values themselves must be zero. This gives us two equations:
1) $|x| = 8 \implies x = \pm8$
2) $|y| = 8 \implies y = \pm8$

Combining the results of both cases, we get the four points $(\pm8, \pm8)$. These are the vertices of a square with side length $16$. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So, the area of the convex polygon is $256$ square units. The answer is: $256$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


For the product to be zero, at least one of the factors must be zero. That is, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
If the first factor is zero, then both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only possible values for $(x, y)$ in this case are $(8, 2)$ and $(2, 8)$, because these are the only pairs of numbers that satisfy both $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
If the second factor is zero, then both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The only possible values for $(x, y)$ in this case are $(8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.
Putting all this together, the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the original equation are $(8, 2)$, $(2, 8)$, $(8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, and $(-8, -8)$. These points are the vertices of a hexagon. To find the area of the hexagon, we can divide it into six equilateral triangles each with side length 10 (from the points $(8, 2)$ and $(2, 8)$ to the other four points).
The area of each equilateral triangle is $\frac{s^2 \sqrt{3}}{4}$, where $s$ is the side length.
The total area of the hexagon is $6 \times \frac{10^2 \sqrt{3}}{4} = 150 \sqrt{3}$. The answer is: $150\sqrt{3}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation given is
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$
For the product to be zero, at least one of the factors must be zero.
This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
These equations represent two lines: $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.
If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
These equations represent four lines: $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
The intersections of these lines form a square with side length 16.
The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
So the area of the convex polygon is 256.
The answer is: 256

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



Firstly, note that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of them is zero. This means we can set each factor of the product equal to zero separately to find the solutions to the equation.

The first factor is $ ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This is the case only when $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$. These four points form the vertices of a square with side length 20.

The second factor is $ ((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This is the case only when $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. These four points form the vertices of a square with side length 16.

The two squares overlap in a smaller square with side length 8.

The total area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares minus the area of the overlapping square.

The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side. So the area of the first square is $20^2 = 400$, the area of the second square is $16^2 = 256$, and the area of the overlapping square is $8^2 = 64$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $400 + 256 - 64 = 592$. The answer is: $\boxed{592}$.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ will equal zero if either of the two expressions inside the multiplication are zero.
This means either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The only way the first expression can equal zero is if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
This means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the square as $(8, 2), (8, -2), (-8, -2), (-8, 2)$.
The only way the second expression can equal zero is if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
So the vertices of the square are also $(8, 8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8), (8, -8)$.
Combining both squares, we get a 4x4 square with side length 8. The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of this square is $8^2 = 64$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{64}$. The answer is: $64$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
For $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$.
This means $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
Similarly, for $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
For $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
For $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

By solving these equations, we find that the points satisfying the given equation are the vertices of a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
So, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation is satisfied if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
For the first two equations, this means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
For the last two equations, this means $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The solutions are the vertices of a square with side length 16.
To find the area of the square, we square the length of one side, so the area is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$
