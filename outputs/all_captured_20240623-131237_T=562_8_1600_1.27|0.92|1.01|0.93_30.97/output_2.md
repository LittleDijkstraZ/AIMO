Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions.
The quantity inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, can be either positive or negative.
If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 > 0$, we have $\vert x-1 \vert > 2$. This means $x-1 > 2$ or $x-1 < -2$. Solving these inequalities gives us $x > 3$ or $x < -1$.
If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0$, we have $\vert x-1 \vert < 2$. This means $-2 < x-1 < 2$. Simplifying the inequalities gives $-1 < x < 3$.
So, the solutions to the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ are the values of $x$ in the intervals $(-\infty, -1)$, $(-1, 1)$, $(1, 3)$, and $(3, \infty)$.
For the equation to have four distinct solutions, the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be chosen such that it creates exactly one value of $x$ in each of the four intervals above.
This means $\frac{m}{100}$ must be in the interval $(0, 1)$.
So, the value of $m$ must be in the interval $(0, 100)$.
There are 99 positive integers in this interval, so there are 99 possible values of $m$.
The value of $m$ must be such that the equation has exactly four distinct solutions.
By trial and error or by examining the properties of absolute value, we find that $m=50$ is the only value that works.
Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is 1, and the value of $m$ is 50. The answer is: $1$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


For the equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ to have 4 distinct solutions,
the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be strictly between $0$ and $2$.
This means $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$,
so $0 < m < 200$.
Since $m$ is a positive integer, the possible values of $m$ are $1, 2, ..., 199$.
Counting the number of integers in this range, we get $\boxed{199}$. The answer is: $199$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.
This means that the right-hand side, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be equal to $2$ or $1$.
If $\frac{m}{100}=2$, then $m=200$.
If $\frac{m}{100}=1$, then $m=100$.
Thus, there are only $2$ possible values for $m$.
The answer is: $2$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $||x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}=2$. This is because $||x-1|-2|$ is a piecewise function that has four distinct solutions when the right side of the equation equals the value at which the function changes its behavior (in this case, 2).

So, we solve the equation $\frac{m}{100}=2$ for $m$ to get:

\[m = 2 * 100 = 200.\]

Therefore, the value of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 200. The answer is: $\boxed{1}$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The number of distinct solutions of the equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $4$ means that the graph of $| |x-1|-2|$ has $4$ "hills and valleys".
The graph of $| |x-1|-2|$ consists of two "waves": one for $|x-1|-2$ and one for $-(|x-1|-2)$.
Each wave consists of two "hills" and two "valleys".
So, the number of "hills and valleys" is equal to the total number of "hills" and "valleys" in both waves, which is equal to $4$.
Therefore, the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be $2$.
Solving $\frac{m}{100}=2$, we find $m=200$.
Thus, there is only one positive integer $m$ that satisfies the equation, and that is $m=200$. The answer is: $1$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The given equation is $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$.

We know that $| |x - 1| - 2 |$ can be equal to $\frac{m}{100}$ for 4 distinct solutions only when $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. This is because the function $| |x - 1| - 2 |$ oscillates between 0 and 4, and only when the right hand side of the equation is 2, there are 4 distinct solutions.

So, we set $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, then we can solve for $m$ to get $m = 200$.

Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ such that the equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. The value of $m$ is $200$.
The answer is: $1$
