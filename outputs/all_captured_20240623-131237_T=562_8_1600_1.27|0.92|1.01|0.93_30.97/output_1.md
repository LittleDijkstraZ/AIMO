Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we need to understand the given condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
This can be simplified as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$, which is the same as $|x-2y| + |- (x-2y)| = 40$.
The absolute value of a number plus its negative is always zero, so we have $2|x-2y| = 40$, or $|x-2y| = 20$.
This means that the distance between $x$ and $2y$ is always 20. We can consider two cases:
Case 1: $x \geq 2y$. Then $x - 2y = 20$, or $x = 2y + 20$.
Case 2: $x < 2y$. Then $2y - x = 20$, or $x = 2y - 20$.
Now we substitute these into the expression we want to minimize: $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.
For Case 1: $5(2y+20)^2+5y^2-8(2y+20)y$.
For Case 2: $5(2y-20)^2+5y^2-8(2y-20)y$.
Both cases give the same expression: $20y^2 + 400y + 2000 + 5y^2 - 16y^2 + 160y = 2000 + 240y$.
To minimize this expression, we take the derivative with respect to $y$ and set it equal to zero: $240 = 0$, which is a contradiction. So, we need to consider the endpoints of the interval where $y$ can range.
For Case 1: $y$ ranges from $-10$ to $\infty$.
For Case 2: $y$ ranges from $- \infty$ to $10$.
We can test the endpoints to find the minimum value:
For Case 1: If $y = -10$, then $x = 2(-10) + 20 = 0$. Substituting into the expression we want to minimize gives: $2000 + 240(-10) = 2000 - 2400 = -400$.
For Case 2: If $y = 10$, then $x = 2(10) - 20 = 0$. Substituting into the expression we want to minimize gives the same value: $2000 + 240(10) = 2000 + 2400 = 4400$.
So, the minimum value is $-400$. However, this doesn't make sense in the context of the problem, because the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is always non-negative.
Therefore, there must have been a mistake in our work. Let's go back and check our steps.
Upon revisiting the solution, we realize that we made a mistake in simplifying the absolute value condition. The correct simplification is as follows:
$|x-2y| + |- (x-2y)| = 40$ implies $2|x-2y| = 40$, so $|x-2y| = 20$.
From this, we can see that $x-2y = \pm 20$.
Let's consider the two cases again.
Case 1: $x - 2y = 20$. Substituting into the expression we want to minimize gives: $5(2y+20)^2+5y^2-8(2y+20)y$.
Case 2: $x - 2y = -20$, or $x = 2y - 20$. Substituting into the expression we want to minimize gives: $5(2y-20)^2+5y^2-8(2y-20)y$.
Again, both cases give the same expression: $20y^2 + 400y + 2000 + 5y^2 - 16y^2 + 160y = 2000 + 240y$.
Taking the derivative with respect to $y$ and setting it equal to zero gives: $240 = 0$, which is still a contradiction. So, we need to consider the endpoints of the interval where $y$ can range.
For Case 1: $y$ ranges from $-10$ to $\infty$.
For Case 2: $y$ ranges from $- \infty$ to $10$.
Testing the endpoints again, we find the minimum value:
For Case 1: If $y = -10$, then $x = 2(-10) + 20 = 0$. Substituting into the expression we want to minimize gives: $2000 + 240(-10) = 2000 - 2400 = -400$. But this result doesn't make sense in the context of the problem.
For Case 2: If $y = 10$, then $x = 2(10) - 20 = 0$. Substituting into the expression we want to minimize gives: $2000 + 240(10) = 2000 + 2400 = 4400$. But this also doesn't make sense in the context of the problem.
This suggests that we must have made another mistake. Let's go back and check our steps again.
Upon revisiting the solution once more, we realize that our mistake was in setting the derivative equal to zero. The correct step should be to set the derivative equal to zero to find the critical points, then check the values at the endpoints of the interval.
Setting the derivative of $2000 + 240y$ equal to zero gives $240 = 0$, which is a contradiction. This means that the function $2000 + 240y$ is a strictly increasing function, and its minimum value occurs at the lower endpoint of the interval.
For Case 1: $y = -10$, the expression we want to minimize is $-400$.
For Case 2: $y = 10$, the expression we want to minimize is $4400$.
So, the minimum value occurs in Case 1, with $y = -10$.
Substituting $y = -10$ into $x = 2y + 20$ gives $x = 0$.
Therefore, the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $-400$.
The answer is: $-400$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To solve this problem, we first note that the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ can be written as a quadratic in terms of $x$ and $y$. Specifically, it can be written as
\[5\left(x^2 - \frac{4}{5}xy + y^2\right) = 5\left((x - \frac{2}{5}y)^2 + \frac{3}{5}y^2\right).\]

Now, let's consider the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. This condition is equivalent to $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$, which simplifies to $|x-2y| + |x-2y| = 40$, or simply $2|x-2y| = 40$, which gives $|x-2y| = 20$. 

By the triangle inequality, we have $|x-2y| = |2y-x| \ge |(x+2y)-(2y-x)| = 2|x|$, so $|x-2y| = 20 \ge 2|x|$, or $|x| \le 10$. Similarly, we have $|y-2x| = |2x-y| \ge |(2x+y)-(2x-y)| = 2|y|$, so $|x-2y| = 20 \ge 2|y|$, or $|y| \le 10$.

Therefore, $x$ and $y$ are both bounded in the interval $[-10,10]$. 

Now we need to find the minimum of $5\left((x - \frac{2}{5}y)^2 + \frac{3}{5}y^2\right)$ under the condition $|x-2y| = 20$. To do this, we first minimize the expression $(x - \frac{2}{5}y)^2 + \frac{3}{5}y^2$. Since $(x - \frac{2}{5}y)^2 \ge 0$ and $\frac{3}{5}y^2 \ge 0$, we have $(x - \frac{2}{5}y)^2 + \frac{3}{5}y^2 \ge 0$. 

To minimize this expression, we need to make $(x - \frac{2}{5}y)^2$ as small as possible and $\frac{3}{5}y^2$ as small as possible. This happens when $x = \frac{2}{5}y$, in which case $(x - \frac{2}{5}y)^2 = 0$. Therefore, the minimum value of $(x - \frac{2}{5}y)^2 + \frac{3}{5}y^2$ is $\frac{3}{5}y^2$.

Now we need to find the minimum value of $\frac{3}{5}y^2$ under the condition $|x-2y| = 20$. Since $|x-2y| = 20$, we have $x = 2y \pm 20$. Substituting $x = 2y \pm 20$ into the expression $\frac{3}{5}y^2$, we get $\frac{3}{5}y^2 = \frac{3}{5}(y^2 \pm 10y + 100) = \frac{3}{5}(y^2 + 100)$.

Since $y$ is bounded in the interval $[-10,10]$, the minimum value of $\frac{3}{5}y^2$ occurs when $y = 0$, and is $\frac{3}{5} \cdot 0^2 = 0$. 

So the minimum value of $5\left((x - \frac{2}{5}y)^2 + \frac{3}{5}y^2\right)$ under the condition $|x-2y| = 20$ is $5 \cdot 0 = 0$. 

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 0.
The answer is: 0

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ subject to the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we can rewrite the condition as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, we know that $|x-2y| + |2y-x| \geq |(x-2y) + (2y-x)| = |0| = 0$. So the minimum value of the condition is achieved when the condition is equal to 0, which means $x-2y = 0$ and $2y-x = 0$, or $x=2y$.
Substituting $x=2y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get $5(2y)^2 + 5y^2 - 8(2y)(y) = 20y^2 + 5y^2 - 16y^2 = 9y^2$.
Now we need to find the value of $y$ that makes $9y^2$ as small as possible, given the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ reduces to $x=2y$.
Substituting $x=2y$ into the condition, we get $|2y-2y| + |y-4y| = |0| + |-3y| = 3|y| = 40$. So $|y| = \frac{40}{3}$.
Since we want the minimum value of $9y^2$, we should choose the negative value of $y$, so $y=-\frac{40}{3}$.
Substituting $y=-\frac{40}{3}$ into $x=2y$, we get $x=2(-\frac{40}{3})=-\frac{80}{3}$.
Now we can calculate the value of $9y^2$ for $y=-\frac{40}{3}$, which gives $9(-\frac{40}{3})^2 = 9*\frac{1600}{9} = 1600$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 1600. The answer is: $1600$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, let's rewrite the given condition as $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. By the property of absolute value, we have $|a - b| = |-(a - b)| = |b - a|$, so we can rewrite the condition as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$.
Expanding the absolute values, we have $(x-2y) + (2y-x) = 40$ or $(x-2y) - (2y-x) = 40$.
The first case simplifies to $0 = 40$, which is not possible. The second case simplifies to $-4y = 40$, so $y = -10$.
Substituting $y = -10$ into the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we get $|x+20| + |-20-x| = 40$. Expanding the absolute values, we have $(x+20) + (20+x) = 40$, which simplifies to $2x+40 = 40$. So $2x = 0$, and $x = 0$.
So the only solution is $x = 0$ and $y = -10$. Now we substitute these values into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, which gives $5(0)^2+5(-10)^2-8(0)(-10) = 500$. So the minimum value of the expression under the condition is $500$. The answer is: $500$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We start by simplifying the given condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. 

By the triangle inequality, we know that $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = |(x - 2y) - (y - 2x)| = |x - 2y - y + 2x| = |3x - 3y| = 3|x - y| = 40$. So, we have $|x - y| = \frac{40}{3}$.

Next, we substitute $t = x - y$ into the expression we want to minimize, $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$. By simplification, we have:
\begin{align*}
5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy &= 5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy \\
&= 5[(x - y)^2 + 2xy] - 8xy \\
&= 5[t^2 + 2(y^2 - ty)] - 8(y^2 - ty) \\
&= 5[t^2 + 2(y^2 - ty)] - 8(y^2 - ty) \\
&= 5t^2 + 10y^2 - 10ty - 8y^2 + 8ty \\
&= 5t^2 + 2y^2 - 2ty \\
&= 5t^2 + \frac{1}{2}(2y - t)^2.
\end{align*}
Since $|t| = \frac{40}{3}$, we can conclude that $5t^2 \ge -\frac{2000}{9}$. 
Moreover, $(2y - t)^2 \ge 0$ as it is a square of a real number. 

Hence, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is achieved when $t = 0$ and $y = \frac{t}{2} = 0$. 

Substitute $t = 0$ into the simplified expression, we have $5t^2 + \frac{1}{2}(2y - t)^2 = 0$. 

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ when $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$ is 0. The answer is: $0$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To begin with, we have the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
First, we can rewrite this as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$.
Now, we know that $|a| + |b|$ is the sum of the distances from $a$ and $b$ to 0 on the number line. So $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$ is the sum of the distances from $2y-x$ and $2x-y$ to 0.
By the triangle inequality, $|a+b| \leq |a| + |b|$ for all real numbers $a$ and $b$. Therefore, we have $|2y-x+2x-y| \leq |2y-x| + |2x-y|$, which simplifies to $|y| \leq |2y-x| + |2x-y|$. This inequality is always true, so the only way that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can hold is when equality holds in the triangle inequality, i.e., when $(2y-x)$ and $(2x-y)$ have the same sign. There are two cases to consider:
1) If $2y-x \geq 0$ and $2x-y \geq 0$, then we have $2y-x = 20$ and $2x-y = 20$. Solving this system of equations gives us $x = 10$ and $y = 5$.
2) If $2y-x \leq 0$ and $2x-y \leq 0$, then we have $2y-x = -20$ and $2x-y = -20$. Solving this system of equations gives us $x = -10$ and $y = -5$.
In both cases, the value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is the same:
\[5(10)^2+5(5)^2-8(10)(5) = 500+125-400 = 325.\]
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 325.
The answer is: 325.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To begin with, we have the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. We can rewrite this equation by using the property $|a| + |b| = |a+b| + |a-b|$. So the equation becomes $|(x-2y) + (y-2x)| + |(x-2y) - (y-2x)| = 40$, which simplifies to $| -x - y | + | x - y | = 40$.

Now, we use the property of absolute value $|a| = a$ if $a \geq 0$, and $|a| = -a$ if $a < 0$. So we can split this into two cases:
1. If $ -x - y \geq 0$ and $x - y \geq 0$, then we have $-x - y + x - y = 40$, which simplifies to $-2y = 40$ and $y = -20$. Substituting $y = -20$ into $x - y \geq 0$ gives $x + 20 \geq 0$, so $x \geq -20$. The minimum value is achieved when $x = -20$.
2. If $ -x - y < 0$ and $x - y < 0$, then we have $x + y + x - y = 40$, which simplifies to $2x = 40$ and $x = 20$. Substituting $x = 20$ into $x - y < 0$ gives $20 - y < 0$, so $y > 20$. But this contradicts with our original assumption that $ -x - y < 0$. So this case is not possible.

Thus, the minimum value is achieved when $x = -20$ and $y = -20$. Now we substitute these values into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
\[5(-20)^2 + 5(-20)^2 - 8(-20)(-20) = 5 \cdot 400 + 5 \cdot 400 - 8 \cdot 400 = 2000 + 2000 - 3200 = 800.\]

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the given condition is 800. The answer is: $800$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ given the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$,
we can first use the triangle inequality to rewrite the condition:
\[|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |x-2y| + |2x-y| \geq |(x-2y) + (2x-y)| = |3x-3y| = 3|x-y| = 40.\]
This gives us the condition $3|x-y| = 40$.
From this we can solve for $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$.
Now we can use the inequality $(x-y)^2 \geq 0$, which expands to $x^2 - 2xy + y^2 \geq 0$, to get:
\[(x^2 - 2xy + y^2) \geq 0.\]
Rearranging, we have $x^2 + y^2 - 2xy \geq 0$.
We can rewrite this as $(x-y)^2 \geq 0$.
From our earlier condition $3|x-y| = 40$, we have $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$, so squaring both sides, we have:
\[(x-y)^2 = \left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{1600}{9}.\]
Substituting this into our inequality $(x-y)^2 \geq 0$, we have $\frac{1600}{9} \geq 0$, which is always true.
Now we can use the fact that $(a-b)^2 \geq 0$ implies $a^2 - 2ab + b^2 \geq 0$, or equivalently, $2ab \leq 2a^2 + 2b^2$, which gives $ab \leq \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}$.
Setting $a = x$ and $b = y$, we have $xy \leq \frac{x^2 + y^2}{2}$.
Substituting this into our expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$, we have:
\[5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = 5(x^2 + y^2) - 8\left(\frac{x^2 + y^2}{2}\right) = 5(x^2 + y^2) - 4(x^2 + y^2) = (5-4)(x^2 + y^2) = x^2 + y^2.\]
To minimize $x^2 + y^2$, we need to minimize $(x-y)^2$ since $x^2 + y^2 = (x-y)^2 + 2xy$.
From our earlier condition, we have $(x-y)^2 = \frac{1600}{9}$, and since $(x-y)^2 \geq 0$, the minimum value of $(x-y)^2$ is 0, which occurs when $x=y$.
Substituting $x=y$ into the condition $3|x-y| = 40$, we have $3|x-x| = 40$, or $3 \cdot 0 = 40$, which is not true.
However, we can use the fact that $(x-y)^2 \geq 0$ to show that $x^2 + y^2 \geq 2xy$.
Rearranging, we have $x^2 - 2xy + y^2 \geq 0$, or $(x-y)^2 \geq 0$.
This tells us that the minimum value of $x^2 + y^2 - 2xy = (x-y)^2 \geq 0$, which implies that $x^2 + y^2 \geq 2xy$.
Therefore, to minimize $x^2 + y^2$, we need to maximize $xy$.
From our earlier inequality $ab \leq \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}$, we have $xy \leq \frac{x^2 + y^2}{2}$.
Substituting $x=y$, we have $x^2 \leq \frac{x^2 + x^2}{2}$, or $x^2 \leq x^2$.
This tells us that the maximum value of $xy$ occurs when $x=y$, so the minimum value of $x^2 + y^2$ is when $x=y$.
Substituting $x=y$ into $x^2 + y^2$, we have $2x^2$, so to minimize $2x^2$, we need to minimize $x^2$.
Setting $x=y$, we can substitute this into our earlier condition $3|x-y| = 40$, which becomes $3|x-x| = 40$, or $3 \cdot 0 = 40$, which is not true.
However, we can use the fact that $|x-y| \geq 0$ to show that $x^2 \geq xy$.
From our earlier inequality $|x-y| \geq 0$, we have $(x-y)^2 \geq 0$, or $x^2 - 2xy + y^2 \geq 0$.
Rearranging, we have $x^2 + y^2 \geq 2xy$, which implies that $x^2 \geq xy$.
Therefore, to minimize $x^2 + y^2$, we need to maximize $xy$, which occurs when $x=y$.
Substituting $x=y$ into $x^2 + y^2 - 8xy$, we have $x^2 + y^2 - 8x^2 = y^2 - 7x^2$.
To minimize this expression, we need to minimize $y^2 - 7x^2$.
Since we have already established that the minimum value of $x^2 + y^2$ occurs when $x=y$, we can substitute $x=y$ into $y^2 - 7x^2$, which becomes $y^2 - 7y^2 = -6y^2$.
To minimize $-6y^2$, we need to minimize $y^2$, which occurs when $y=0$.
Substituting $y=0$ into the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we have $|x-0| + |0-2x| = 40$, or $|x| + |-2x| = 40$, or $|x| + |2x| = 40$.
This simplifies to $3|x| = 40$, or $|x| = \frac{40}{3}$.
Since $x=y$, we have $x=y=0$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is $5(0)^2 + 5(0)^2 - 8(0)(0) = 0$.
The answer is: $\boxed{
