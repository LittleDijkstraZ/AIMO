Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find $f(100)$, we can start by finding the value of $f(f(100))$ using the second equation given. 
We have $f(2(50)) = 2f(50) + 1$. 
So, $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.
Now, let's substitute this into the first equation given, $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. 
We have $f(f(f(100))) = 8(100) - 7 = 793$.
Using the second equation again, we have $f(f(100)) = 2f(f(50)) + 1$.
And substituting this into the equation above, we get $f(2f(f(50)) + 1) = 793$.
Let's set $x = f(50)$, then we have $f(2x + 1) = 793$.
Now, we need to find $f(50)$. We can use the second equation again to find a relationship between $f(50)$ and $f(25)$. 
We have $f(2(25)) = 2f(25) + 1$.
So, $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.
Continuing this process, we can keep breaking down the numbers and using the second equation until we reach a value that can be easily found from the first equation.
By repeatedly applying the second equation, we can eventually find that $f(1) = 1$.
Using this, we can find $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 3$, $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 7$, and so on.
After a lot of work, we find that $f(50) = 199$.
Substituting this back into the equation $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$, we can find that $f(25) = 99$.
And then using the second equation again, we can find that $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2(199) + 1 = 399$.
So, the value of $f(100)$ is 399.
The answer is: $399$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we use the second equation to find the value of $f(100)$. Since $100 = 2 \cdot 50$, we have $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.
Next, we need to find the value of $f(50)$. Using the same equation, since $50 = 2 \cdot 25$, we have $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.
Continuing this process, we find $f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1$.
But $12.5$ is not a natural number, so we cannot continue this process indefinitely.
However, we notice that the first equation gives us a clue as to how to proceed. If we substitute $f(n)$ with $n$ in the first equation, we have $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$.
If we substitute $f(n)$ with $n$ in the second equation, we have $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$.
By trying out small values of $n$, we find that $f(1) = 1$, $f(2) = 3$, $f(3) = 5$, and so on, so it appears that $f(n) = 2n - 1$.
To confirm this, we substitute $f(n) = 2n - 1$ into the first equation: $f(f(f(n))) = f(f(2n - 1)) = f(2(2n - 1) - 1) = f(4n - 3) = 8n - 7$.
And substituting $f(n) = 2n - 1$ into the second equation: $f(2n) = 2(2n - 1) + 1 = 4n - 1$.
Thus, $f(n) = 2n - 1$ satisfies both given equations, so we can conclude that $f(n) = 2n - 1$.
Now we can find $f(100) = 2(100) - 1 = 199$. The value of $f(100)$ is 199. The answer is: $\boxed{199}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we can plug in $n = 1$ into the second equation to find $f(1)$. 
We have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. 
Since the value of $f(1)$ is not given in the problem, we cannot directly calculate $f(100)$ using the second equation. 
We can, however, use the first equation to help us find $f(1)$.
By setting $n = 1$, we get $f(f(f(1))) = 8 - 7 = 1$.
Since $f(f(f(1))) = 1$, we know that $f(1)$ must be an integer such that when $f$ is applied three times, it gives us 1. 
By trying different values, we find that $f(1) = 1$ satisfies this condition because $f(f(f(1))) = f(f(1)) = f(1) = 1$.
Now that we know $f(1) = 1$, we can use the second equation to calculate other values of $f(n)$. 
For example, $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2(1) + 1 = 3$.
Now we can calculate $f(100)$ using the second equation.
Using the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, we can calculate $f(100)$ by repeatedly applying this equation. 
First, we calculate $f(200)$: $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$.
Next, we calculate $f(400)$: $f(400) = 2f(200) + 1$.
Continuing this process, we can keep applying the equation until we reach $f(100)$.
We eventually find that $f(400) = 799$.
Then $f(200) = (799 - 1)/2 = 399$.
And finally, $f(100) = (399 - 1)/2 = 199$.
So $f(100) = 199$.
The answer is: 199

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We can start by calculating $f(1)$ using the second condition $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$.
Letting $n=1$, we get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. But we know that $f(f(f(1))) = 8(1) - 7 = -1$, and since $f$ maps only to natural numbers, we must have $f(1) = 1$. Then, $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2(1) + 1 = 3$.
Now we can use the second condition to find $f(3)$: $f(6) = 2f(3) + 1$. But we know from the first condition that $f(f(f(3))) = 8(3) - 7 = 19$. Since $f(f(3)) = f(6)$, we have $f(6) = 19$. Substituting this into the equation $f(6) = 2f(3) + 1$, we get $19 = 2f(3) + 1$, so $2f(3) = 18$, and $f(3) = 9$.
Now we can continue this process to find $f(4)$, $f(5)$, and so on, until we reach $f(100)$. It turns out that $f(100) = 199$. The answer is: $199$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's plug $n=1$ into the second equation to get $f(2)=2f(1)+1$.
Since $f(f(f(1)))=f(0)=8(1)-7=1$, we have $f(2)=1$.
Then, plug $n=2$ into the second equation to get $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2(1)+1=3$.
And, $f(f(f(2)))=f(1)=8(2)-7=9$.
So, $f(4)=3$.
Continuing this way, we get $f(6)=5$, $f(8)=7$, and $f(10)=9$.
We notice that $f(n)=2n-1$ for all positive even integers $n$.
Now, let's check this with the second equation: $f(2n)=2f(n)+1=2(2n-1)+1=4n-1$.
This is consistent with our previous results.
Now, we know that $f(100)=2(100)-1=199$. So, $f(100)=199$.
The answer is: $199$
