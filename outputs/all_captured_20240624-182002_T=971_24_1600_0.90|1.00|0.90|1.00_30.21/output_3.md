The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. Therefore, one of the expressions must be zero for the entire equation to be true. This gives us two conditions:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first condition to be true, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the points $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, and $(-5,-5)$.

For the second condition to be true, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations, we get the points $(8,0)$, $(0,8)$, $(-8,0)$, and $(0,-8)$.

Plotting these points on a coordinate plane, we see that they form a square with side length 10. Therefore, the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$.

The equation given is a product of two functions equal to zero, so each function must be zero. That gives us two sets of equations to solve:

1. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$, which simplifies to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$.
2. $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which simplifies to $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x - y = \pm 10$.
3. $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$, which simplifies to $\vert x \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$.
4. $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which simplifies to $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $y = \pm 8$.

Solving these sets of equations, we find that the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equation are the vertices of a square with side length 10, centered at the origin. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. So the area of the convex polygon is 100.
The answer is: $100$

 The given equation is of the form $AB = 0$, which implies that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. So, we have two cases to consider:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. Solving these two equations gives us two lines: $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ (the other solutions give the same lines but reflected).
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us two more lines: $x = 8$ and $y = 8$.
These four lines enclose a rectangle with side lengths $10$ and $16$, so its area is $10 \times 16 = 160$.
The answer is: $160$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either of the terms must be zero for the entire product to be zero. So we have two cases to consider:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
For the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations we get four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.
For the second case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations we get four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.
The intersection points of these lines are the vertices of the polygon. By plotting these lines on a coordinate plane and finding the intersection points, we find that the vertices of the polygon are $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$. The polygon is a square with side length $16$. Therefore, the area of the polygon is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
The only way this equation can be true is if either of the two factors is equal to zero.
For the first factor to be zero, either $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$.
Solving these equations gives $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
For the second factor to be zero, either $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.
Solving these equations gives $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
Putting these together, we have four lines: $x + y = \pm 10$, $x - y = \pm 10$, $x = \pm 8$, and $y = \pm 8$.
These lines enclose a square with side length 16 (the distance between the points $(8,0)$ and $(-8,0)$), so the area of the convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $\boxed{256}$.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either of the terms has to be zero for the equation to hold true. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
The absolute value equations can be split into two separate equations:
$x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, or $x - y = -10$.
These equations represent the sides of the square.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
Again, the absolute value equations can be split into two separate equations:
$x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, or $y = -8$.
These equations represent the sides of the square.

The intersection of these two cases gives us the vertices of the square. The square has side length 10 (from the distance between the lines $x+y=10$ and $x+y=-10$), so its area is $10^2 = 100$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units.

Here's a Python program to calculate the area of the square:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_square():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    side_length = 10
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = area_of_square()
print(result)
```

The area of the convex polygon is 100 square units. The answer is $\boxed{100}$.

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term or the second term must be zero. This translates to the following systems of equations:

1) $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$
2) $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$

Each system of equations has four solutions. For the first system, the solutions are: $(x, y) = (10,10), (10,-10), (-10,10), (-10,-10)$.
And for the second system, the solutions are: $(x, y) = (8,8), (8,-8), (-8,8), (-8,-8)$.
These points are the vertices of the polygon.

The polygon is a square with side length of 20 units. The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.

So the area of the convex polygon is $400$. The answer is: $400$

 The given equation is a product of two terms, and the product equals to zero if and only if at least one of the terms equals to zero. Therefore, the solutions to the equation are the union of the solutions to the equations:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From 1. and 2., we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies that $x = 0$ and $y = 0$.
From 3. and 4., we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that $-8 \leq x \leq 8$ and $-8 \leq y \leq 8$.

The solution is a square with side length 16, so the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length**2
    return area

result = area_of_polygon()

The area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is $\boxed{256}$.

This problem involves the concept of absolute value, which makes it a bit tricky to solve directly using programming (Python) or pen and paper. However, we can simplify the problem if we observe that, for the expression to be zero, both of the expressions in the parentheses must be zero. This means that:
1. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10$
2. $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x - y \vert = 10$
3. $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8$
4. $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert y \vert = 8$

From 3. and 4., we can deduce that x and y must be between -8 and 8.

From 1. and 2., we can deduce that the points satisfying these conditions must lie on a square with side length 10 centered at the origin.

From 3. and 4., we can deduce that the points we are interested in lie within a square of side length 16 centered at the origin.

Therefore, the area of the polygon is the area of the square with side length 16, which is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $\boxed{256}$
