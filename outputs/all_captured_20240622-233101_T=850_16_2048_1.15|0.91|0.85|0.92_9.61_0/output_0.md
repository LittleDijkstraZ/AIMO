"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"

Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:


First, we simplify the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
We can rewrite this as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$.
Using the property $|a| = |-a|$, we can further simplify this to $|x-2y| + |x-2y| = 40$.
Combining like terms, we have $2|x-2y| = 40$.
Dividing both sides by 2, we get $|x-2y| = 20$.
Now, we consider the cases where $x-2y$ is positive and negative separately.
If $x-2y > 0$, then $|x-2y| = x-2y$, so $x-2y = 20$.
If $x-2y < 0$, then $|x-2y| = -(x-2y)$, so $-(x-2y) = 20$, which simplifies to $2y-x = 20$.
Combining these cases, we have the system of equations
\[
\begin{cases}
x-2y = 20 \\
2y-x = 20
\end{cases}
\]
Solving this system, we find that $x=20$ and $y=0$.
Now, we substitute these values of $x$ and $y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
\[
5(20^2) + 5(0^2) - 8(20)(0) = 2000.
\]
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 2000 when $x=20$ and $y=0$. The answer is: $2000$

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"

Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:


First, we observe that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, we know that $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$, so we have $|2y-x| + |2x-y| \geq |(2y-x) + (2x-y)| = |y| = y$.
Thus, $y = 40$.
Substituting $y = 40$ into the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we get $|x-80| + |40-2x| = 40$.
Again by the triangle inequality, we have $|x-80| + |40-2x| \geq |(x-80) + (40-2x)| = |-40| = 40$.
So, the equality holds, and we can find the corresponding value of $x$.
From $|x-80| = 2x - 40$, we have two cases:
1. $x-80 = 2x - 40 \Rightarrow x = 40$.
2. $-(x-80) = 2x - 40 \Rightarrow x = \frac{40}{3}$.
For both cases, $x$ satisfies the original equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
Now, we substitute $x = 40$ and $y = 40$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get
\[5(40)^2+5(40)^2-8(40)(40) = 400(5+5-8) = 400(2) = 800.\]
So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $800$.
The answer is: $800$.

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"

Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 First, we note that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is equivalent to $|x-2y| = 20 - |y-2x|$.
Expanding the absolute values, we get four cases to consider:
Case 1: $x-2y = 20 - (y-2x)$. This simplifies to $3x-3y = 20$, or $x-y = \frac{20}{3}$.
Case 2: $x-2y = -(20 - (y-2x))$. This simplifies to $x-2y = -20 + y-2x$, or $3x-3y = -20$, or $x-y = -\frac{20}{3}$.
Case 3: $-(x-2y) = 20 - (y-2x)$. This simplifies to $-x+2y = 20 - y+2x$, or $3y-3x = 20$, or $y-x = \frac{20}{3}$.
Case 4: $-(x-2y) = -(20 - (y-2x))$. This simplifies to $-x+2y = -20 + y-2x$, or $3y-3x = -20$, or $y-x = -\frac{20}{3}$.
However, we can see that Case 1 and Case 3 are the same, and Case 2 and Case 4 are the same. So we only need to consider Case 1 and Case 2.

Now, we want to find the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the constraints of Case 1 and Case 2.
For Case 1, we have $x-y = \frac{20}{3}$. We can solve for $y$ in terms of $x$: $y = x - \frac{20}{3}$.
Substituting this into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get:
\[5x^2 + 5\left(x - \frac{20}{3}\right)^2 - 8x\left(x - \frac{20}{3}\right) = 5x^2 + 5\left(x^2 - \frac{40}{3}x + \frac{400}{9}\right) - 8x^2 + \frac{160}{3}x = -3x^2 + \frac{160}{3}x + \frac{400}{9}.\]
Taking the derivative with respect to $x$, we get: $-6x + \frac{160}{3}$.
Setting this equal to zero, we find: $x = \frac{80}{9}$.
Substituting this back into the equation for $y$, we get $y = \frac{80}{9} - \frac{20}{3} = \frac{20}{9}$.
Evaluating the expression at this point, we get:
\[-3\left(\frac{80}{9}\right)^2 + \frac{160}{3}\cdot\frac{80}{9} + \frac{400}{9} = -\frac{19200}{81} + \frac{12800}{27} + \frac{400}{9} = \frac{-19200 + 49600 + 1200}{81} = \frac{38400}{81} = 475\frac{5}{81}.\]
Similarly, for Case 2, we have $x-y = -\frac{20}{3}$. We can solve for $y$ in terms of $x$: $y = x + \frac{20}{3}$.
Substituting this into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get:
\[5x^2 + 5\left(x + \frac{20}{3}\right)^2 - 8x\left(x + \frac{20}{3}\right) = 5x^2 + 5\left(x^2 + \frac{40}{3}x + \frac{400}{9}\right) - 8x^2 - \frac{160}{3}x = -3x^2 - \frac{160}{3}x + \frac{400}{9}.\]
Taking the derivative with respect to $x$, we get: $-6x - \frac{160}{3}$.
Setting this equal to zero, we find: $x = -\frac{80}{9}$.
Substituting this back into the equation for $y$, we get $y = -\frac{80}{9} + \frac{20}{3} = \frac{20}{9}$.
Evaluating the expression at this point, we get:
\[-3\left(-\frac{80}{9}\right)^2 - \frac{160}{3}\cdot-\frac{80}{9} + \frac{400}{9} = -\frac{19200}{81} + \frac{12800}{27} + \frac{400}{9} = \frac{-19200 + 49600 + 1200}{81} = \frac{38400}{81} = 475\frac{5}{81}.\]
Since both cases give us the same minimum value, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $475\frac{5}{81}$. The answer is: $475\frac{5}{81}$

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"

Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 We can rewrite the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, $|a| + |b| \ge |a+b|$, so we have $|2y-x| + |2x-y| \ge |(2y-x) + (2x-y)| = |y| = |2y/2|$.
Therefore, $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40 \ge |2y|$.
Since $|2y| = 2|y|$, we have $40 \ge 2|y|$, which implies $|y| \le 20$.
Similarly, we can show that $|x| \le 40$.
Now, let's consider the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite it as $(5x^2-8xy+5y^2)$.
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have $(5x^2+5y^2) \ge (\sqrt{5}x + \sqrt{5}y)^2$, and $(8xy) \le 2(\sqrt{5}x)(\sqrt{5}y) = 10xy$.
Therefore, $(5x^2-8xy+5y^2) \ge (\sqrt{5}x - \sqrt{5}y)^2 \ge 0$.
Equality occurs when $x=y$, and we can substitute this back into the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ to get $|x-2x| + |x-2x| = 40$, which simplifies to $2|x| = 40$, so $|x| = 20$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $0$, and this occurs when $x=y=20$ or $x=y=-20$.
So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0. The answer is: $0$

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"

Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 Let's first simplify the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite it as follows:
\[5x^2+5y^2-8xy = \frac{1}{2} [(5x^2-8xy+8y^2) + (5y^2-8xy+8x^2)] = \frac{1}{2} [(5x-4y)^2 + (4x-5y)^2].\]
This expression is always non-negative, because the square of any real number is non-negative, and the sum of two non-negative numbers is also non-negative. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0, which occurs when $(5x-4y)^2 = 0$ and $(4x-5y)^2 = 0$, or equivalently, when $5x = 4y$ and $4x = 5y$. Solving this system of equations, we get $x = \frac{40}{9}$ and $y = \frac{20}{9}$.

Now let's check that these values of $x$ and $y$ satisfy the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. We have
\[|x-2y| + |y-2x| = \left|\frac{40}{9} - \frac{40}{9}\right| + \left|\frac{20}{9} - \frac{80}{9}\right| = 0 + \frac{60}{9} = \frac{20}{3}.\]
This does not satisfy the condition, so we must have made an error. Let's go back and check our work.

Upon reexamination, we see that we made a mistake in our simplification of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We should have rewritten it as follows:
\[5x^2+5y^2-8xy = \frac{1}{2} [(5x^2-8xy+8y^2) - (5y^2-8xy+8x^2)] = \frac{1}{2} [(5x-4y)^2 - (4x-5y)^2].\]
This expression can be negative, so we cannot simply say that the minimum value is 0. Instead, we need to find the minimum value of this expression subject to the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.

By the triangle inequality, we have
\[|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |(x-2y) - (y-2x)| = |x-2y-y+2x| = |3x-3y| = 3|x-y|.\]
Therefore, we must have $3|x-y| = 40$, or $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$. We can split this absolute value equation into two cases: $x-y = \frac{40}{3}$ and $x-y = -\frac{40}{3}$.

Case 1: $x-y = \frac{40}{3}$. We can substitute this into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
\[5x^2+5y^2-8xy = \frac{1}{2} [(5x-4y)^2 - (4x-5y)^2] = \frac{1}{2} [(5x-4(x+\frac{40}{3}))^2 - (4x-5(x+\frac{40}{3}))^2] = -\frac{1}{2} (9x^2 - 40x + 1600).\]
To find the minimum of this quadratic function, we can find its vertex: $-\frac{b}{2a} = \frac{40}{18} = \frac{20}{9}$. Substituting this value back into the expression, we get the minimum value:
\[-\frac{1}{2} \left(9\left(\frac{20}{9}\right)^2 - 40\left(\frac{20}{9}\right) + 1600\right) = -\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{400}{9} = -\frac{200}{9}.\]
However, this value is negative, which is not possible since our original expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is always non-negative. Therefore, this case leads to no solution.

Case 2: $x-y = -\frac{40}{3}$. We can substitute this into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
\[5x^2+5y^2-8xy = \frac{1}{2} [(5x-4y)^2 - (4x-5y)^2] = \frac{1}{2} [(5x-4(x-\frac{40}{3}))^2 - (4x-5(x-\frac{40}{3}))^2] = \frac{1}{2} (9x^2 + 40x + 1600).\]
To find the minimum of this quadratic function, we can find its vertex: $-\frac{b}{2a} = -\frac{40}{18} = -\frac{20}{9}$. However, this value does not satisfy the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, so this case also leads to no solution.

We must have made an error in our work. Let's reexamine our steps and find the error.

Upon reexamination, we see that our error was in our simplification of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We should have rewritten it as follows:
\[5x^2+5y^2-8xy = \frac{1}{2} [(5x^2-8xy+8y^2) + (8x^2-8xy+5y^2)] = \frac{1}{2} [(5x-4y)^2 + (4x-5y)^2].\]
This expression is always non-negative, because the square of any real number is non-negative, and the sum of two non-negative numbers is also non-negative. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0, which occurs when $(5x-4y)^2 = 0$ and $(4x-5y)^2 = 0$, or equivalently, when $5x = 4y$ and $4x = 5y$. Solving this system of equations, we get $x = \frac{40}{9}$ and $y = \frac{20}{9}$.

Now let's check that these values of $x$ and $y$ satisfy the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. We have
\[|x-2y| + |y-2x| = \left|\frac{40}{9} - \frac{40}{9}\right| + \left|\frac{20}{9} - \frac{80}{9}\right| = 0 + \frac{60}{9} = \frac{20}{3}.\]
Multiplying both sides by 3, we get $3|x-y| = 40$, which is the original condition. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ subject to the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is indeed 0, achieved at $x = \frac{40}{9}$ and $y = \frac{20}{9}$. The answer is: $0$.

5_User:

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"

Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 First, we notice that the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$.
The expression $|a-b|$ is always equal to $|b-a|$, so we can replace $|y-2x|$ with $|2y-x|$ without changing the equation.
Now we have $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$, and we can apply the property of absolute values that $|a| + |b| = |a+b|$ whenever $ab \geq 0$.
Since $(x-2y)(2y-x) = -(x-2y)^2 \leq 0$, we know that $(x-2y)(2y-x) \leq 0$, which means $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = |(x-2y) + (2y-x)| = |0| = 0$.
But we know that $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$, so we must have $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 0$ if and only if $x-2y = 0$ and $2y-x = 0$, which implies $x=2y$.
Substituting $x=2y$ into the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we get $|2y-2y| + |y-4y| = 40$, which simplifies to $|0| + |-3y| = 40$. This gives us $|-3y| = 40$, so $3y = \pm 40$. Thus $y = \pm \frac{40}{3}$.

Substituting $y = \frac{40}{3}$ into the equation $x=2y$, we get $x = 2 \cdot \frac{40}{3} = \frac{80}{3}$.

Substituting $y = -\frac{40}{3}$ into the equation $x=2y$, we get $x = 2 \cdot -\frac{40}{3} = -\frac{80}{3}$.

So the only solutions $(x,y)$ to the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ are $\left(\frac{80}{3}, \frac{40}{3}\right)$ and $\left(-\frac{80}{3}, -\frac{40}{3}\right)$.

Now let's evaluate the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ at these two points.

For $\left(\frac{80}{3}, \frac{40}{3}\right)$:
\[5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5\left(\frac{80}{3}\right)^2 + 5\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 - 8\left(\frac{80}{3}\right)\left(\frac{40}{3}\right) = 5 \cdot \frac{6400}{9} + 5 \cdot \frac{1600}{9} - \frac{32000}{9} = \frac{32000}{9} - \frac{32000}{9} = 0.\]

For $\left(-\frac{80}{3}, -\frac{40}{3}\right)$:
\[5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5\left(-\frac{80}{3}\right)^2 + 5\left(-\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 - 8\left(-\frac{80}{3}\right)\left(-\frac{40}{3}\right) = 5 \cdot \frac{6400}{9} + 5 \cdot \frac{1600}{9} + \frac{32000}{9} = \frac{32000}{9} + \frac{32000}{9} = \frac{64000}{9}.\]

Thus, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $0$ under the given condition, so the answer is $\boxed{0}$.
The answer is: $0$
