**Problem:** 
"Let \[f(x) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
-x + 3 & \text{if } x \le 0, \\
2x - 5 & \text{if } x > 0.
\end{array}
\right.\]How many solutions does the equation $f(f(x)) = 4$ have?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
To solve the equation $f(f(x)) = 4,$ we first find the values $x$ such that $f(x) = 4.$

Either $f(x) = -x + 3$ (for $x \le 0$) or $f(x) = 2x - 5$ (for $x > 0$). If $-x + 3 = 4,$ then $x = -1.$ Note that this value satisfies $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = 4,$ then $x = 9/2.$ Note that this value satisfies $x > 0.$ Therefore, the solutions to $f(x) = 4$ are $x = -1$ and $x = 9/2.$

Next, we solve for the values $x$ such that $f(x) = -1.$ If $-x + 3 = -1,$ then $x = 4.$ This value does not satisfy $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = -1,$ then $x = 2.$ This value satisfies $x > 0.$

Finally, we solve for the values $x$ such that $f(x) = 9/2.$ If $-x + 3 = 9/2,$ then $x = -3/2.$ This value satisfies $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = 9/2,$ then $x = 19/4.$ This value satisfies $x > 0.$

Therefore, the equation $f(f(x)) = 4$ has the solutions $x = 2,$ $-3/2,$ and $19/4,$ for a total of $\boxed{3}$ solutions. The answer is $\boxed{3}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The number of distinct solutions of the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] is equal to $4$ if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a piecewise linear function with $4$ segments of equal length $1$, and the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to the height of one of the segments. The height of each segment is $2$. Therefore, we have $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, which implies $m = 200$. So the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $m = 200$. The answer is: $1$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many integers are solutions to the equation $$(x-2)^{(25-x^2)}=1?$$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
We need some basic facts from number theory: $a^0 = 1$ for any $a,$ $1^b = 1$ for any $b,$ and $(-1)^c = 1$ if $c$ is an even integer. Unless the base is a complex number (which is excluded since we are looking for integer solutions), there are no other ways to get an RHS of $1.$ Thus, either the exponent is zero $($giving the equation $25 - x^2 = 0),$ the base is $1$ $($giving $x -2 = 1),$ or the base is $-1$ and the exponent is even $($giving the simultaneous equations $x - 2 = -1$ and $25 - x^2 = 2n$ for some integer $n).$ Solving the first equation gives $x = \pm 5,$ and solving the second gives $x = 3.$ The third equation implies that $x = 1,$ in which case $25 - x^2 = 24$ is indeed even, so $x = 1$ is a valid solution. In all, there are $\boxed{4}$ integer solutions. The answer is $\boxed{4}$

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The problem involves finding the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly $4$ distinct solutions.

To solve this problem, we need to consider the different cases of the absolute value equation. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be rewritten as four separate equations based on the absolute value properties:

1. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$
2. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$
3. $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = \frac{m}{100}$
4. $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = -\frac{m}{100}$

Each of these equations can be solved separately. The number of distinct solutions to each equation will be counted and the total will be the number of $m$ we are looking for.

Let's solve each equation:

1. $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which gives two equations: $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x-1 = -(2 + \frac{m}{100})$. Solving these gives $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$ respectively. The number of distinct solutions to this equation is 1 if $3 + \frac{m}{100} > -1 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $m > -100$.

2. $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which gives two equations: $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x-1 = -(2 - \frac{m}{100})$. Solving these gives $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$ respectively. The number of distinct solutions to this equation is 1 if $3 - \frac{m}{100} > -1 + \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $m < 100$.

3. $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which gives the same solutions as equation 2. So the number of distinct solutions is 1 if $0 < m < 100$.

4. $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which gives the same solutions as equation 1. So the number of distinct solutions is 1 if $-100 < m < 0$.

Combining all these conditions, we find that the number of distinct solutions to the original equation is 4 if $-100 < m < 0$ or $0 < m < 100$. So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is the number of positive integers in the interval $(0, 100)$, which is $100$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has exactly 4 distinct solutions is 100. The answer is: $100$

## QUESTION 2 - 2

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"For certain ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ of real numbers, the system of equations
\[\begin{aligned} ax+by&=1 \\ x^2 + y^2 &= 50  \end{aligned}\]has at least one solution, and each solution is an ordered pair $(x,y)\,$ of integers. How many such ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ are there?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The graph of $ax+by=1$ is a line, while the graph of $x^2+y^2=50$ is a circle centered at the origin. Therefore, $(a, b)$ satisfies the conditions if and only if the line and circle intersect at least once, and they intersect only at lattice points (points with integer coordinates).

Knowing this, it makes sense to look for lattice points on the circle whose equation is $x^2+y^2=50$. Testing cases, we find that there are twelve lattice points on the circle: $(\pm 1, \pm 7)$, $(\pm 7, \pm 1)$, and $(\pm 5, \pm 5)$ (where the two $\pm$ signs in each pair are independent of each other).

There are $\tbinom{12}{2} = 66$ pairs of these points, and each pair determines a line. However, the graph of $ax+by=1$ can never pass through the origin $(0, 0)$, since if $x=y=0$, then $ax+by=0 \neq 1$. Therefore, the six pairs which consist of diametrically opposed points are invalid, since the line through them passes through the origin. This corrects our count to $66 - 6 = 60$.

In addition, for each of the twelve points, there is a line tangent to the circle at that point, so that the only solution to the system is that one point. This brings the final total to $60 + 12 = \boxed{72}$. The answer is $\boxed{72}$

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



We are given the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ and we are asked to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ represents a family of piecewise linear functions, where the number of pieces and their slopes depend on the value of $m$. The equation can be rewritten as:

\[
\begin{cases}
\vert x-1 -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100} & \text{if } x-1 \geq 2 \\
\vert x-1 +2 \vert=\frac{m}{100} & \text{if } 1 \leq x-1 < 2 \\
\vert x-1 -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100} & \text{if } x-1 < 1
\end{cases}
\]

or

\[
\begin{cases}
\vert x-3 \vert=\frac{m}{100} & \text{if } x \geq 3 \\
\vert x+1 \vert=\frac{m}{100} & \text{if } 1 \leq x < 3 \\
\vert x-3 \vert=\frac{m}{100} & \text{if } x < 1
\end{cases}
\]

This gives us three cases to consider:

1. For $x < 1$, we have $\vert x-3 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, which gives us two linear equations: $x-3 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $-(x-3) = \frac{m}{100}$.
2. For $1 \leq x < 3$, we have $\vert x+1 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, which gives us two linear equations: $x+1 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $-(x+1) = \frac{m}{100}$.
3. For $x \geq 3$, we have $\vert x-3 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, which gives us two linear equations: $x-3 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $-(x-3) = \frac{m}{100}$.

For each of these cases, we need to find the value of $m$ for which the four lines intersect at four distinct points. This can be done by setting the equations equal to each other and solving for $x$. The number of solutions will be the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy this condition.

After solving the equations and counting the number of positive integer solutions for each case, we find that the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 2. The answer is: $2$

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**



The problem is asking for how many positive integers $m$ does the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have $4$ distinct solutions. 

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have $4$ distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is between $0$ and $2$. Therefore, we need to find the value of $m$ that makes $\frac{m}{100}$ fall within this range. 

The minimum value of $m$ is obtained when $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $0$, so $m = 0 \times 100 = 0$. 

The maximum value of $m$ is obtained when $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $2$, so $m = 2 \times 100 = 200$.

Therefore, the possible values of $m$ are the integers from $0$ to $200$. 

The number of positive integers from $0$ to $200$ is $200$. However, $m$ cannot be $0$ because $\frac{m}{100}$ cannot be $0$. So the number of positive integers $m$ that make the equation have $4$ distinct solutions is $200 - 1 = 199$.

However, this is not the correct answer because the problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$, not the number of non-negative integers $m$. 

When $m = 0$, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ simplifies to $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=0$, which further simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert =2$. This equation has two solutions: $x = 3$ and $x = -1$. However, these are not distinct solutions because they are not positive. 

So we need to exclude $m = 0$ from the count. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that make the equation have $4$ distinct solutions is $199 - 1 = 198$.

Therefore, there are $198$ positive integers $m$ that make the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have $4$ distinct solutions.

The value of $m$ that makes $\frac{m}{100}$ equal to $2$ is $m = 2 \times 100 = 200$. 

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that make the equation have $4$ distinct solutions is $198$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let \[f(x) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
-x + 3 & \text{if } x \le 0, \\
2x - 5 & \text{if } x > 0.
\end{array}
\right.\]How many solutions does the equation $f(f(x)) = 4$ have?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
To solve the equation $f(f(x)) = 4,$ we first find the values $x$ such that $f(x) = 4.$

Either $f(x) = -x + 3$ (for $x \le 0$) or $f(x) = 2x - 5$ (for $x > 0$). If $-x + 3 = 4,$ then $x = -1.$ Note that this value satisfies $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = 4,$ then $x = 9/2.$ Note that this value satisfies $x > 0.$ Therefore, the solutions to $f(x) = 4$ are $x = -1$ and $x = 9/2.$

Next, we solve for the values $x$ such that $f(x) = -1.$ If $-x + 3 = -1,$ then $x = 4.$ This value does not satisfy $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = -1,$ then $x = 2.$ This value satisfies $x > 0.$

Finally, we solve for the values $x$ such that $f(x) = 9/2.$ If $-x + 3 = 9/2,$ then $x = -3/2.$ This value satisfies $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = 9/2,$ then $x = 19/4.$ This value satisfies $x > 0.$

Therefore, the equation $f(f(x)) = 4$ has the solutions $x = 2,$ $-3/2,$ and $19/4,$ for a total of $\boxed{3}$ solutions. The answer is $\boxed{3}$

**Solution:**



This problem is a complex problem that requires a deep understanding of absolute value functions and their properties. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 1 and 2. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ takes on the values of 0, 1, and 2 exactly once and then decreases to 0. Therefore, the value $\frac{m}{100}$ must be strictly between 1 and 2 for the equation to have 4 distinct solutions.

This means $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which simplifies to $100 < m < 200$. The number of positive integers $m$ in this range is $200 - 100 - 1 = 99$.

"How many distinct solutions are there to the equation $|x-7| = |x+1|$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
If $|x-7| = |x+1|$, then either $x-7 = x+1$ or $x-7 = -(x+1)$.  Simplifying $x-7=x+1$ gives $0=8$, which has no solutions, so no values of $x$ satisfy $x-7 = x+1$.  If $x-7 = -(x+1)$, then $x-7 = -x-1$, so $2x = 6$, which gives $x=3$.  So, there is $\boxed{1}$ solution.

Therefore, we want to find the number of integers in the list $1, 2, \dots, 100$ which are not perfect squares. The perfect squares in the list are $1^2, 2^2, \dots, 10^2,$ so there are $10$ perfect squares, and \[100 - 10 = \boxed{90}\]integers which are not perfect squares. The answer is $\boxed{90}$

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $2$. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a graph with a "V" shape, with the two "points" of the "V" located at $x=1 \pm 2$. The distance between these two points is 4, so the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be strictly between 1 and 2 for the equation to have 4 distinct solutions.

This means $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which simplifies to $100 < m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are precisely the integers from 101 to 199, inclusive. To find the number of such integers, we can subtract the smallest integer in the range from the largest integer in the range and then add 1. This gives us $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$.

Therefore, there are 99 positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.
