Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation given is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. In order for the product of two terms to be zero, either one of the terms must be zero. This gives us two conditions:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From the first condition, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the four lines $y = x \pm 10$ and $y = -(x \pm 10)$.

From the second condition, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations, we get the four lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

The intersection points of these lines form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256. To output the result, we use the `{}` notation:

The area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{256}$.

Please note that this is a symbolic computation and the result is a positive integer. However, it is important to note that this result is derived from an analysis of the problem and not from a direct computation using sympy. If you are looking for a solution using sympy, the problem as stated does not have a straightforward sympy solution. The analysis and simplification of the problem is essential to arrive at a numerical answer. The sympy library is not designed to directly solve such equations.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Step 1: The problem is to find the area of the polygon enclosed by the points $\left(x, y\right)$ that satisfy the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

Step 2: To solve this problem, we can use the properties of absolute value and the fact that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of them is zero. So, we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This is the equation of a square with side length 10 and vertices at $(5,5), (5,-5), (-5,-5), (-5,5)$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This is the equation of a square with side length 16 and vertices at $(8,8), (8,-8), (-8,-8), (-8,8)$.

Step 3: To find the area of the polygon, we can find the area of each square and add them up. The area of a square with side length $s$ is $s^2$. So, the area of the first square is $10^2 = 100$ and the area of the second square is $16^2 = 256$.

Step 4: The total area of the polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares, which is $100 + 256 = 356$.

Step 5: We have found that the area of the polygon is 356, which is a positive integer.

The answer is: $356$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation given is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.

Let's consider each term separately:

1) $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$

This equation is satisfied when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

2) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

This equation is satisfied when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So we get four more lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We are asked to find the area of the polygon formed by the intersection of the curves defined by the given equations.
2. We know that the area of intersection of two curves is given by the double integral over the region defined by the intersection of the curves.
3. However, solving this problem using double integration seems quite complex.
4. Instead, we can notice that the given equation is a product of two terms, each of which is a sum of absolute values. This suggests that the points that satisfy the equation must lie on the intersection of the curves defined by each term being zero.
5. Let's consider the first term, $|x+y| - 10 = 0$. This equation represents a diamond centered at the origin with side length 20. Similarly, the second term, $|x-y| - 10 = 0$, also represents a diamond centered at the origin with side length 20.
6. The product of these two terms being zero implies that the points that satisfy the equation must lie on the intersection of these two diamonds.
7. The intersection of these two diamonds is a square with side length 10, centered at the origin.
8. Finally, the absolute value terms $|x| - 8 = 0$ and $|y| - 8 = 0$ represent two lines at x = ±8 and y = ±8 respectively. The intersection of this square with these lines gives a square with side length 16 and centered at the origin.
9. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the polygon is 256 square units.
The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

This equation is equal to 0 if and only if both factors are equal to 0. Therefore, we have two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

For the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$, $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us a square with side length 16.

For the second case, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$, $\vert y \vert = 8$. This also gives us a square with side length 16.

So, the points satisfying the equation enclose a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256. This is a positive integer, so we are correct. The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The problem statement defines a set of points that satisfy a condition, and then asks for the area of the region they enclose.

2. The condition is that $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

3. This condition is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

4. For the first condition to be true, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us four lines: $y = -x \pm 10$, $y = x \pm 10$. These lines form a square with side length 20 and area $400$.

5. For the second condition to be true, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. These lines form a square with side length 16 and area $256$.

6. The total area of the region is the sum of the areas of the two squares, $400 + 256 = 656$.

However, we made a mistake in our reasoning. The intersection of the two regions is not empty, it's a smaller square with side length 8 and area $64$. So, the total area of the region should be the sum of the areas of the two squares minus the area of the intersection, which is $400 + 256 - 64 = 592$.

The answer is: $592$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The given equation is: $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$

The product of two terms equals zero if and only if at least one of the terms is zero. Therefore, either:

(a) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
or
(b) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

2. If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. This means $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.

3. If $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.

4. If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$. This means $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.

5. If $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

6. Combining all the above cases, we find that the points satisfying the equation are:

   (8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8), (10, 0), (0, 10), (-10, 0), (0, -10)

7. These points form a square with side length 16. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256. This is a positive integer, so our answer is correct.
The answer is: $256$
