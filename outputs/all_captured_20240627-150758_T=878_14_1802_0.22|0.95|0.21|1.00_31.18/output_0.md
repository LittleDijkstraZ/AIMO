**Problem:** 
"Find the distance between the vertex of the graph of the equation $y=x^2 + 2x - 6 $ and the point $(4, 5)$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Completing the square, we get $y=(x + 1)^2 - 7 $. The vertex of the graph of this equation is thus $(-1, -7)$.The distance between $(4, 5)$ and $(-1, -7)$ is $\sqrt{(4-(-1))^2 + (5-(-7))^2} = \sqrt{25+144} =\boxed{13}$. The answer is $\boxed{13}$

The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $2(k^2 + l^2)$. However, we know that the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, which implies that $(k^2 + l^2) = 9$ (since the distance squared is equal to 36). Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $2*9 = 18$. The answer is $\boxed{18}$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"The smallest distance between the origin and a point on the parabola $y=x^2-5$ can be expressed as $\sqrt{a}/b$, where $a$ and $b$ are positive integers, and $a$ is not divisible by the square of any prime.  Find $a+b$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the distance formula, we are trying to minimize $\sqrt{x^2+y^2}=\sqrt{x^2+x^4-10x^2+25}$. In general minimization problems like this require calculus, but one elementary optimization method that sometimes works is completing the square.  We have $$\sqrt{x^2+x^4-10x^2+25}=\sqrt{(x^2-9/2)^2+(25-81/4)}.$$This expression is minimized when the square equals $0$, i.e. when $x=\pm 3/\sqrt{2}.$ For this value of $x$, the distance is $$\sqrt{25-\frac{81}{4}}=\frac{\sqrt{19}}{2}.$$Hence the desired answer is $\boxed{21}$. The answer is $\boxed{21}$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $\mathcal{P}$ be the parabola in the plane determined by the equation $y = x^2.$  Suppose a circle $\mathcal{C}$ intersects $\mathcal{P}$ at four distinct points.  If three of these points are $(-28,784),$ $(-2,4),$ and $(13,169),$ find the sum of the distances from the focus of $\mathcal{P}$ to all four of the intersection points."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Let the four intersection points be $(a,a^2),$ $(b,b^2),$ $(c,c^2),$ and $(d,d^2).$  Let the equation of the circle be
\[(x - k)^2 + (y - h)^2 = r^2.\]Substituting $y = x^2,$ we get
\[(x - k)^2 + (x^2 - h)^2 = r^2.\]Expanding this equation, we get a fourth degree polynomial whose roots are $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ and $d.$  Furthermore, the coefficient of $x^3$ is 0, so by Vieta's formulas, $a + b + c + d = 0.$

We are given that three intersection points are $(-28,784),$ $(-2,4),$ and $(13,196),$ so the fourth root is $-((-28) + (-2) + 13) = 17.$

The distance from the focus to a point on the parabola is equal to the distance from the point to the directrix, which is $y = -\frac{1}{4}.$  Thus, the sum of the distances is
\[784 + \frac{1}{4} + 4 + \frac{1}{4} + 169 + \frac{1}{4} + 17^2 + \frac{1}{4} = \boxed{1247}.\] The answer is $\boxed{1247}$

However, we know that the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, which gives us the equation $6^2 = (2k)^2 - 4k(k - l + 4)$, or $36 = 4k^2 - 4k^2 + 4kl - 16k$. Solving this equation for $l$ in terms of $k$ gives us $l = \frac{36 + 16k}{4k}$. Substituting this into the expression for the sum of squares of distances gives us:

**Problem:** 
"Let $\mathcal{P}$ be the parabola in the plane determined by the equation $y = x^2.$  Suppose a circle $\mathcal{C}$ intersects $\mathcal{P}$ at four distinct points.  If three of these points are $(-28,784),$ $(-2,4),$ and $(13,169),$ find the sum of the distances from the focus of $\mathcal{P}$ to all four of the intersection points."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Let the four intersection points be $(a,a^2),$ $(b,b^2),$ $(c,c^2),$ and $(d,d^2).$  Let the equation of the circle be
\[(x - k)^2 + (y - h)^2 = r^2.\]Substituting $y = x^2,$ we get
\[(x - k)^2 + (x^2 - h)^2 = r^2.\]Expanding this equation, we get a fourth degree polynomial whose roots are $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ and $d.$  Furthermore, the coefficient of $x^3$ is 0, so by Vieta's formulas, $a + b + c + d = 0.$

We are given that three intersection points are $(-28,784),$ $(-2,4),$ and $(13,196),$ so the fourth root is $-((-28) + (-2) + 13) = 17.$

The distance from the focus to a point on the parabola is equal to the distance from the point to the directrix, which is $y = -\frac{1}{4}.$  Thus, the sum of the distances is
\[784 + \frac{1}{4} + 4 + \frac{1}{4} + 169 + \frac{1}{4} + 17^2 + \frac{1}{4} = \boxed{1247}.\] The answer is $\boxed{1247}$

**Problem**
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



1. First, we need to find the x-coordinates of points A and B by setting $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ equal to 4 and solving for x.
2. The equation to solve is $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$. Let's denote the roots of this equation as $x_1$ and $x_2$, which represent the x-coordinates of points A and B respectively.
3. We know that the distance between A and B is 6, so $|x_1 - x_2| = 6$. By Vieta's formulas, we know that $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$.
4. From the equation $|x_1 - x_2| = 6$, we can square both sides to get $(x_1 - x_2)^2 = 36$, which simplifies to $x_1^2 - 2x_1x_2 + x_2^2 = 36$.
5. Substituting $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$ into the equation, we get $x_1^2 + x_2^2 - 2\frac{l - 4}{k} = 36$.
6. We know that $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 2^2 - 2\frac{l - 4}{k} = 4 - 2\frac{l - 4}{k}$.
7. Substituting this into the equation from step 5, we get $4 - 2\frac{l - 4}{k} - 2\frac{l - 4}{k} = 36$, which simplifies to $4 - 4\frac{l - 4}{k} = 36$.
8. Solving for $\frac{l - 4}{k}$, we get $\frac{l - 4}{k} = \frac{32}{4} = 8$.
9. Multiplying both sides by k, we get $l - 4 = 8k$.
10. Now, we need to find the sum of the squares of the distances from A and B to the origin. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. For point A with x-coordinate $x_1$, the y-coordinate is 4, so the distance is $\sqrt{x_1^2 + 4^2}$. Similarly, for point B with x-coordinate $x_2$, the distance is $\sqrt{x_2^2 + 4^2}$.
11. The sum of the squares of the distances is then $(\sqrt{x_1^2 + 4^2})^2 + (\sqrt{x_2^2 + 4^2})^2 = x_1^2 + 16 + x_2^2 + 16 = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32$.
12. From step 6, we know that $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = 4 - 2\frac{l - 4}{k} = 4 - 2*8 = -12$.
13. Substituting this into the equation from step 11, we get $-12 + 32 = 20$.

So, the sum of the squares of the distances from A and B to the origin is 20. The answer is: $20$

**Problem:** 
"The smallest distance between the origin and a point on the parabola $y=x^2-5$ can be expressed as $\sqrt{a}/b$, where $a$ and $b$ are positive integers, and $a$ is not divisible by the square of any prime.  Find $a+b$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the distance formula, we are trying to minimize $\sqrt{x^2+y^2}=\sqrt{x^2+x^4-10x^2+25}$. In general minimization problems like this require calculus, but one elementary optimization method that sometimes works is completing the square.  We have $$\sqrt{x^2+x^4-10x^2+25}=\sqrt{(x^2-9/2)^2+(25-81/4)}.$$This expression is minimized when the square equals $0$, i.e. when $x=\pm 3/\sqrt{2}.$ For this value of $x$, the distance is $$\sqrt{25-\frac{81}{4}}=\frac{\sqrt{19}}{2}.$$Hence the desired answer is $\boxed{21}$. The answer is $\boxed{21}$

The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $\boxed{\frac{2(2k - l + 4)}{k}}$. However, we know that the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, and the difference of the solutions is 3.

The error is due to the fact that the variable `x` is not defined. This is because we are not actually solving for `x` in this problem. Instead, we are trying to find the sum of the squares of the solutions to the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$. To do this, we can use the formula for the sum of the squares of the roots of a quadratic equation, which is given by $(r_1^2 + r_2^2) = (r_1 + r_2)^2 - 2r_1r_2$.

The sum of the roots $r_1 + r_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$, and the product of the roots $r_1r_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k} = l - 4$. Therefore, the sum of the squares of the roots is $(2)^2 - 2(l - 4) = 4 - 2l + 8 = 12 - 2l$.

Now, we know that the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, and the difference of the solutions is 3. Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $12 - 2l$.

We also know that the difference of the solutions is 3, which means that the square of the difference is 9. The square of the difference of the roots is $(r_1 - r_2)^2 = (r_1 + r_2)^2 - 4r_1r_2 = (2)^2 - 4(l - 4) = 4 - 4l + 16 = 20 - 4l$. Setting this equal to 9, we get $20 - 4l = 9$, which simplifies to $4l = 11$, and $l = \frac{11}{4}$.

Substituting $l = \frac{11}{4}$ into the equation $12 - 2l$, we get the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin as $12 - 2\left(\frac{11}{4}\right) = 12 - \frac{11}{2} = \frac{24 - 11}{2} = \frac{13}{2}$. However, this is not an integer, which contradicts the problem statement.

We must have made a mistake in our calculations. Let's go back and check our work.

Upon reexamination, we realize that we made a mistake in the formula for the sum of the squares of the roots of a quadratic equation. The correct formula is $(r_1^2 + r_2^2) = (r_1 + r_2)^2 - 2r_1r_2 + 2(r_1r_2)^2$. Using this formula, we get $(r_1^2 + r_2^2) = (2)^2 - 2(l - 4) + 2(l - 4)^2 = 4 - 2l + 8 + 2(l^2 - 8l + 16) = 12 - 2l + 2l^2 - 16l + 32 = 44 - 18l + 2l^2$.

Now, we know that the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, and the difference of the solutions is 3. Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $44 - 18l + 2l^2$.

We also know that the difference of the solutions is 3, which means that the square of the difference is 9. The square of the difference of the roots is $(r_1 - r_2)^2 = (r_1 + r_2)^2 - 4r_1r_2 + 4(r_1r_2)^2 = (2)^2 - 4(l - 4) + 4(l - 4)^2 = 4 - 4l + 16 + 4(l^2 - 8l + 16) = 20 - 4l + 4l^2 - 64l + 128 = 14

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 To solve this problem, we first need to find the coordinates of points $A$ and $B$. Since the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$, we can set $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$. Rearranging the equation gives $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$. Let's call this equation (1).

The distance between points $A$ and $B$ is given as 6. By the distance formula, if $A = (x_1, y_1)$ and $B = (x_2, y_2)$, then $\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} = 6$. Since $y_1 = y_2 = 4$, this simplifies to $\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2} = 6$, or $|x_2 - x_1| = 6$. By Vieta's formulas, we know that $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$. Since $|x_2 - x_1| = 6$, we can use the difference of squares identity to get $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = (x_2 + x_1)^2 - 4x_1x_2 = 36$. Substituting the values of $x_1 + x_2$ and $x_1x_2$ from above gives $4 - \frac{4(l - 4)}{k} = 36$. Simplifying this equation gives $4k - 4l + 16 = 36k$, or $36k - 4k = 4l - 16$, or $32k = 4l - 16$. Dividing by 4 gives $8k = l - 4$, or $l = 8k + 4$.

Substituting this value of $l$ into equation (1) gives $kx^2 - 2kx + 8k + 4 - 4 = 0$, or $kx^2 - 2kx + 8k = 0$. The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $x_1^2 + y_1^2 + x_2^2 + y_2^2 = x_1^2 + 16 + x_2^2 + 16 = (x_1^2 + x_2^2) + 32$. By the identity $(x_1 + x_2)^2 = x_1^2 + 2x_1x_2 + x_2^2$, we can substitute the values of $x_1 + x_2$ and $x_1x_2$ from above to get $(2)^2 = x_1^2 + 2(\frac{l - 4}{k}) + x_2^2$, or $4 = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + \frac{2(8k + 4 - 4)}{k} = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + \frac{16k}{k} = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 16$. Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32 = 4 + 32 = 36$.

So the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is 36. The answer is: $36$

The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $\boxed{\frac{(k - \sqrt{k(k - l + 4)})^2}{k^2} + \frac{(k + \sqrt{k(k - l + 4)})^2}{k^2}}$. However, we know that $k > 0$ and $l > 0$, and the expression under the square root in the square root, $k(k - l + 4)$, must be nonnegative. This implies that $k - l + 4 \geq 0$, or $l \leq k + 4$. Since $l > 0$, we must have $l \geq 1$. Therefore, $k - l + 4 \geq 0$ is always true. So we can simplify the expression for the sum of squares of distances as follows:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, simplify

def simplify_expression():
    """Simplify the expression for the sum of squares of distances"""
    k, l = symbols('k l')

    # Expression for the sum of squares of distances
    sum_of_squares = (k - sqrt(k*(k - l + 4)))**2/k**2 + (k + sqrt(k*(k - l + 4)))**2/k**2

    # Simplify the expression
    simplified_sum_of_squares = simplify(sum_of_squares)

    return simplified_sum_of_squares

simplified_sum_of_squares = simplify_expression()
print(simplified_sum_of_squares)
```

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
2*(2*k - l + 4)/k
```
The simplified expression for the sum of squares of distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $\frac{2(2k - l + 4)}{k}$. Since $l \leq k + 4$, we have $2k - l + 4 \geq 0$. Therefore, the sum of squares of distances is always positive. To find the numerical value of the sum of squares of distances for a specific choice of $k$ and $l$, we can substitute the values of $k$ and $l$ into the simplified expression. For example, if we choose $k = 1$ and $l = 1$, we get:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def calculate_sum_of_squares():
    """Calculate the sum of squares of distances for k = 1 and l = 1"""

    # Calculate the sum of squares of distances
    sum_of_squares_value = sum_of_squares.subs({k: k, l: l})

    return sum_of_squares_value

sum_of_squares_value = calculate_sum_of_squares()
print(sum_of_squares_value)

The error in the last calculation is due to the fact that we are trying to substitute a float (the value of k and l) into a sympy expression. This is not possible. Instead, we should have used the values of k and l directly in the simplified expression. Let's correct this:

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:


This problem requires a bit of analytical geometry and algebra. Let's start by setting the two equations equal to each other to find the points of intersection:
\[kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4.\]
Rearranging terms gives:
\[kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0.\]
This is a quadratic equation in $x$. Let's call the roots of this equation $x_1$ and $x_2$, which represent the x-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$. Since the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, we have:
\[(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 6^2 = 36.\]
By Vieta's formulas, we know that $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$. We can use these to express $(x_2 - x_1)^2$ in terms of $k$ and $l$:
\[(x_2 - x_1)^2 = (x_2 + x_1)^2 - 4x_1x_2 = 4 - 4\frac{l - 4}{k} = 36.\]
Simplifying this equation gives:
\[4k - 4l + 16 = 36k \implies 36k - 4k + 4l = 16 \implies 32k + 4l = 16.\]
Dividing through by 4 gives:
\[8k + l = 4.\]
Now, we want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. For point $A$, this is $\sqrt{x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2}$, and for point $B$, it's $\sqrt{x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2}$.

We can simplify this expression by noting that the parabola is symmetric about the line $x = 1$, so $x_1$ and $x_2$ are equidistant from 1. Let $d = |x_1 - 1|$, then $x_1 = 1 - d$ and $x_2 = 1 + d$. Then the sum of the squares of the distances is:
\[S = (1 - d)^2 + (k(1 - d)^2 - 2k(1 - d) + l)^2 + (1 + d)^2 + (k(1 + d)^2 - 2k(1 + d) + l)^2.\]
This simplifies to:
\[S = 2[(1 - d)^2 + (k(1 - d)^2 - 2k(1 - d) + l)^2].\]
We can substitute $x_1 = 1 - d$ into the equation $8k + l = 4$ to get:
\[8k + (1 - d)^2 = 4.\]
Solving for $l$ gives:
\[l = 4 - 8k + 2kd - d^2.\]
Substituting this into the equation for $S$ gives:
\[S = 2[(1 - d)^2 + (k(1 - d)^2 - 2k(1 - d) + 4 - 8k + 2kd - d^2)^2].\]
This is a complicated expression, but we can simplify it by noting that the parabola is symmetric about the line $x = 1$, so the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is twice the square of the distance from the point of symmetry $(1, k - 2k + l) = (1, l)$ to the origin. This distance is $\sqrt{1 + l^2}$.

So, we have:
\[S = 2(\sqrt{1 + l^2})^2 = 2(1 + l^2).\]
Substituting $l = 4 - 8k + 2kd - d^2$ into this equation gives:
\[S = 2(1 + (4 - 8k + 2kd - d^2)^2).\]
This is still a complicated expression, but we can simplify it further by noting that the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, so $d = 3$. Substituting this into the equation for $l$ gives:
\[l = 4 - 8k + 6k - 9 = -4k - 5.\]
Substituting this into the equation for $S$ gives:
\[S = 2(1 + (-4k - 5)^2).\]
Expanding and simplifying gives:
\[S = 2(1 + 16k^2 + 40k + 25) = 2(16k^2 + 40k + 26).\]
Finally, we can substitute $8k + l = 4$ with $l = -4k - 5$ to get:
\[8k - 4k - 5 = 4 \implies 4k = 9 \implies k = \frac{9}{4}.\]
Substituting this into the equation for $S$ gives:
\[S = 2(16\left(\frac{9}{4}\right)^2 + 40\left(\frac{9}{4}\right) + 26) = 2(81 + 90 + 26) = 2(297) = 594.\]
So, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is 594. The answer is: $594$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Find the distance between the vertex of the graph of the equation $y=x^2 + 2x - 6 $ and the point $(4, 5)$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Completing the square, we get $y=(x + 1)^2 - 7 $. The vertex of the graph of this equation is thus $(-1, -7)$.The distance between $(4, 5)$ and $(-1, -7)$ is $\sqrt{(4-(-1))^2 + (5-(-7))^2} = \sqrt{25+144} =\boxed{13}$. The answer is $\boxed{13}$

CODE RESULTS (36*k - 2*l + 8)/k

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
(36*k - 2*l + 8)/k
```
The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $\frac{36k - 2l + 8}{k}$. However, we know that $k$ and $l$ are related by the condition that the parabola intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points. To find this relationship, we can substitute $y = 4$ into the equation of the parabola and set it equal to zero:

$$4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l \Rightarrow kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0.$$

This is a quadratic equation in $x$, and its discriminant must be positive for it to have two distinct real roots:

$$(2k)^2 - 4k(l - 4) > 0 \Rightarrow 4k^2 - 4kl + 16k > 0.$$

Dividing through by 4 gives:

$$k^2 - kl + 4k > 0.$$

Now we can substitute this relationship into the expression for the sum of squares of distances:

$$(36k - 2l + 8)/k = (36k - 2(k^2 - kl + 4k) + 8)/k = (36k - 2k^2 + 2kl - 8k + 8)/k = (28k + 2kl - 2k^2 + 8)/k.$$

This simplifies to:

$$(28 + 2l - 2k + \frac{8}{k})/k = (28 + 2l - 2k + \frac{8}{k})/\frac{k^2}{k} = (28 + 2l - 2k + \frac{8}{k})/\frac{k}{1} = (28 + 2l - 2k + \frac{8}{k})k.$$

Now we can substitute the relationship $l = k^2 - 4k + 4$ back into this expression:

$$(28 + 2(k^2 - 4k + 4) - 2k + \frac{8}{k})k = (28 + 2k^2 - 8k + 8 - 2k + \frac{8}{k})k = (2k^2 - 10k + 36 + \frac{8}{k})k.$$

This simplifies to:

$$2k^3 - 10k^2 + 36k + 8.$$

Now we can substitute $k = 1$ (since $k > 0$) into this expression:

$$2(1)^3 - 10(1)^2 + 36(1) + 8 = 2 - 10 + 36 + 8 = 36.$$

So the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is 36. The answer is: $36$
