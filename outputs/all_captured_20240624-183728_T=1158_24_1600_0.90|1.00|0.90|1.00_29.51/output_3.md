Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if both factors are equal to zero.
The first factor is equal to zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
The second factor is equal to zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The graphs of these equations are a square with side length 16 centered at the origin. The square is symmetric about both the x and y axes, so the vertices of the square are $(\pm 8, 0), (0, \pm 8), (\pm 8, \pm 8)$.
The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{256}$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is equal to zero if and only if both terms in the product are equal to zero. This gives us two sets of equations:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From these equations, we get the following solutions:
$x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$, $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$.

2. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$, $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$, $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.

From these equations, we get the following solutions:
$x = -10, y = 10$, $x = 10, y = 10$, $x = -10, y = -10$, $x = 10, y = -10$.

These solutions represent the vertices of a square with side length $20$. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $400$. The answer is: $400$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if either of the following two conditions holds:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
From the first condition, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $-8 \leq x, y \leq 8$ and $x + y = \pm 10$. The solutions are $(x, y) = (5, 5), (5, -5), (-5, 5), (-5, -5)$.
From the second condition, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $-8 \leq x, y \leq 8$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. The solutions are $(x, y) = (5, -5), (5, 5), (-5, 5), (-5, -5)$.
Therefore, the points satisfying the given condition are $(5, 5), (5, -5), (-5, 5), (-5, -5)$. These points form a square with side length $10$, so the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The expression $AB = 0$ is true if and only if $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the given equation is satisfied if and only if either
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0\]
or
\[((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]
The first equation is satisfied if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies that $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$. The second equation is satisfied if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
Therefore, the points satisfying the equation are the vertices of a square with side length 20. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.
The answer is: $400$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ equals to 0 if and only if both of the factors equal to 0. 

This happens if and only if $|\vert x + y \vert - 10| = 0$, $|\vert x - y \vert - 10| = 0$, $|\vert x \vert - 8| = 0$, and $|\vert y \vert - 8| = 0$.

The solutions to $|\vert x + y \vert - 10| = 0$ and $|\vert x - y \vert - 10| = 0$ are all points $(x, y)$ such that $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$. These are four lines in the coordinate plane, and the convex polygon they form is a square with side length 10.

The solutions to $|\vert x \vert - 8| = 0$ and $|\vert y \vert - 8| = 0$ are all points $(x, y)$ such that $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. These are two lines parallel to the x-axis at $y = \pm 8$ and two lines parallel to the y-axis at $x = \pm 8$. These lines enclose a square with side length 16.

Comparing the two squares, the square formed by the solutions to $|\vert x + y \vert - 10| = 0$ and $|\vert x - y \vert - 10| = 0$ is contained within the square formed by the solutions to $|\vert x \vert - 8| = 0$ and $|\vert y \vert - 8| = 0$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of the square with side length 10, which is $10^2 = 100$.

 The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied only if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, or both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This means either $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$, or $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$.

Assistant:

 The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So, we have two cases to consider:
Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
For $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = \pm 10$. Similarly, for the other three cases we have $x - y = \pm 10$, $x = \pm 8$, and $y = \pm 8$.
These equations represent eight lines in the coordinate plane. The intersection points of these lines form a square with side length 8. The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$.

Case 2: Both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ are zero. This means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we find that the only possible solution is $x = 0$ and $y = 0$.
However, this point $(0,0)$ does not satisfy $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, so we discard this case.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 64.
The answer is: $64$

Assistant:

 The given expression is equal to zero if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. Each of these equations is satisfied when the absolute value expressions are equal to zero, i.e., when the values inside the absolute value are zero. This gives us the following system of equations:

1) $x + y = 0$ or $x + y = -20$ or $x + y = 20$.
2) $x - y = 0$ or $x - y = -20$ or $x - y = 20$.
3) $x = 0$ or $x = -16$ or $x = 16$.
4) $y = 0$ or $y = -16$ or $y = 16$.

The points satisfying these equations are the vertices of the polygon. We can find these vertices by solving the system of equations:

1) For $x + y = 0$, the vertices are $(0,0)$, $(8,-8)$, and $(-8,8)$.
2) For $x - y = 0$, the vertices are $(0,0)$, $(8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.
3) For $x = 0$, the vertices are $(0,0)$, $(0,8)$, and $(0,-8)$.
4) For $y = 0$, the vertices are $(0,0)$, $(8,0)$, and $(-8,0)$.

The polygon is a square with side length 16 units. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$ square units. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units.
The answer is: $256$

First, we need to understand that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ must be true for any point $(x, y)$ that lies on the boundary of the polygon.

Considering the first equation, we have $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These conditions define a square with side length 10 units.

Considering the second equation, we have $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This conditions defines a square with side length 16 units.

The convex polygon is the intersection of these two squares, which is a square with side length 10 units. To find its area, we simply square the side length, which gives $10^2 = 100$ square units. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units.

The answer is: $100$

Assistant:


The given equation is of the form $AB = 0$, where $A$ and $B$ are two expressions. The only way this equation can be true is if at least one of the expressions $A$ or $B$ is zero. So, we have two sets of conditions:

1) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From the first set of conditions, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$, and $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$. Solving these system of equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(0,10), (0,-10), (10,0), (-10,0)$.

From the second set of conditions, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = 8$ or $x = -8$, and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. Solving these system of equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(8,8), (8,-8), (-8,8), (-8,-8)$.

So, the polygon is a square with side length of $10$ units. The area of a square is given by the formula $side^2$, so the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$ square units. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $100$ square units. The answer is: $100$
