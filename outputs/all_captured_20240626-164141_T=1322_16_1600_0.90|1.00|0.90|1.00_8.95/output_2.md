"How many integers $x$ satisfy the equation \[\left(x^2-x-1\right)^{x+2} = 1?\]
$\mathrm{(A)\ } 2 \qquad \mathrm{(B) \ }3 \qquad \mathrm{(C) \  } 4 \qquad \mathrm{(D) \  } 5 \qquad \mathrm{(E) \  }\text{none of these}$"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 

We recall that for real numbers $a$ and $b$ , there are exactly $3$ ways in which we can have $a^b = 1$ , namely $a = 1$ $b = 0$ and $a \neq 0$ ; or $a = -1$ and $b$ is an even integer.
The first case therefore gives \begin{align*}x^2-x-1 = 1 &\iff x^2-x-2 = 0 \\&\iff (x-2)(x+1) = 0 \\&\iff x = 2 \text{ or } x = -1.\end{align*}
Similarly, the second case gives $x+2 = 0$ , i.e. $x = -2$ , and this indeed gives $x^2-x-1 = 4+2-1 = 5 \neq 0$ , so $x = -2$ is a further valid solution.
Lastly, for the third case, we have \begin{align*}x^2-x-1 = -1 &\iff x^2-x = 0 \\&\iff x(x-1) = 0 \\&\iff x = 0 \text{ or } x = 1,\end{align*} but $x = 1$ would give $x+2 = 3$ , which is odd, whereas $x = 0$ gives $x+2 = 2$ , which is even. Therefore, this case gives only one further solution, namely $x = 0$
Accordingly, the possible values of $x = -2$ $-1$ $0$ , or $2$ , yielding a total of $\boxed{4}$ solutions. The answer is $\boxed{4}$

**Problem:** 

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 



For an equation with the form $|A|=B$, it has solutions if and only if $B>0$. So, the equation $| |x-1|-2 |=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} > 0$ and $\frac{m}{100} < 2$. This simplifies to $0 < m < 200$. The number of positive integers $m$ in this range is $199$. Therefore, the answer is: $\boxed{199}$. The answer is: $\boxed{199}$.

**Problem:** 

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 



The given equation has $4$ distinct solutions, $ \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$. We first sketch the graph of $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, which consists of three segments of lines:

- From $x < -1$, the equation becomes $\vert -(x-1) - 2 \vert = \vert -x - 1 \vert = x + 1 + 2 = x + 3$.
- From $-1 \leq x < 1$, the equation becomes $\vert x - 1 - 2 \vert = \vert x - 3 \vert = 3 - x$.
- From $x \geq 1$, the equation becomes $\vert x - 1 - 2 \vert = \vert x - 3 \vert = x - 3 + 2 = x - 1$.

So the graph consists of a line segment from $(- \infty, -1)$ with equation $y = x + 3$, a line segment from $(-1, 1)$ with equation $y = 3 - x$, and a line segment from $(1, \infty)$ with equation $y = x - 1$.

The right-hand side of the equation is $y = \frac{m}{100}$, which is a horizontal line at $y = \frac{m}{100}$. To ensure the equation has $4$ distinct solutions, we need to set this line such that it intersects the graph of $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ at $4$ distinct points. The graph of $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ intersects the $x$-axis at $x = -1$, $x = 1$, and $x = 3$, so the line $y = \frac{m}{100}$ must be above the $x$-axis and cross the graph of $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ in the region between the lines $x = -1$ and $x = 3$. The minimum value of $m$ that achieves this is when the line $y = \frac{m}{100}$ just touches the line $y = 3 - x$ at the point $(1, 2)$. This gives $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, so $m = 200$. The maximum value of $m$ that achieves this is when the line $y = \frac{m}{100}$ just touches the line $y = x + 3$ at the point $(-1, 2)$. This gives $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, so $m = 200$.

So the only value of $m$ that works is $m = 200$.

The number of positive integers $m$ that work is $1$, so the answer is $\boxed{1}$.
The answer is: $\boxed{1}$

**Problem:** 

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $2$. This is because the graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has $4$ "humps" when it equals a number strictly between $1$ and $2$. Therefore, $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Multiplying all sides of the inequalities by $100$ gives $100 < m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from $101$ to $199$, inclusive. The number of these integers is $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$. Therefore, there are $99$ positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions. The answer is: $99$

**Problem:** 

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 



The equation $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $2$. This is because the expression $| |x-1| - 2 |$ is a "V" shape with a maximum of $2$ and a minimum of $0$, and it equals $\frac{m}{100}$ exactly $4$ times in this interval. 

So we want to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Multiplying all sides of the inequalities by $100$ gives $100 < m < 200$. The number of positive integers in this interval is $200 - 100 - 1 = 99$. 

So, there are $99$ positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions. The answer is: $99$.

**Problem:** 

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 



First, let's analyze the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. The right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, is always positive and will determine the number of solutions to the equation. The absolute value function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ will equal $\frac{m}{100}$ four times: once when $\vert x-1 \vert -2$ is positive and once when $\vert x-1 \vert -2$ is negative. This gives us two cases to consider:

Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 =\frac{m}{100}$

This simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. This will give us two sub-cases to consider:

Sub-case 1.1: $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Sub-case 1.2: $-(x-1) = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Case 2: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. This will also give us two sub-cases:

Sub-case 2.1: $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Sub-case 2.2: $-(x-1) = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

So, we have four distinct solutions: $3 + \frac{m}{100}$, $-1 + \frac{m}{100}$, $3 - \frac{m}{100}$, and $-1 - \frac{m}{100}$. For these to be distinct, the denominator $100$ must be greater than the numerator $m$. Therefore, the value of $m$ that makes $\frac{m}{100}$ as small as possible is $m=1$. 

This gives us four distinct solutions: $3 + \frac{1}{100}$, $-1 + \frac{1}{100}$, $3 - \frac{1}{100}$, and $-1 - \frac{1}{100}$. 

Therefore, there is only one value of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions, namely $m=1$. The answer is: $1$

**Problem:** 

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 



We first consider the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.

For $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=0$, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$, which gives us two equations: $x-1=2$ and $x-1=-2$. Solving these gives us $x=3$ and $x=-1$. So, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=0$ has two solutions.

For $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ to have four distinct solutions, we need $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ to be equal to a positive number. This means $\vert x-1 \vert -2 > 0$, or $\vert x-1 \vert > 2$. This gives us two cases:

1. $x-1 > 2$, which gives $x > 3$.
2. $x-1 < -2$, which gives $x < -1$.

However, we are looking for positive solutions, so we discard the second case. Now we consider the interval $x > 3$. In this interval, $\vert x-1 \vert = x-1$, so our equation becomes $x-1-2 = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x-3 = \frac{m}{100}$. Solving for $x$ gives $x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$. For this to be a valid solution, we need $\frac{m}{100} + 3 > 3$, or $\frac{m}{100} > 0$, which is always true. So in the interval $x > 3$, we get one solution.

Next, we consider the interval $-1 < x < 3$. In this interval, $\vert x-1 \vert = 1-x$, so our equation becomes $1-x-2 = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $1-x-2 = \frac{m}{100}$, or $x = 1 - \frac{m}{100}$. For this to be a valid solution, we need $1 - \frac{m}{100} < 3$, or $\frac{m}{100} > -2$, which is always true. So in the interval $-1 < x < 3$, we also get one solution.

And finally, we consider the case where $x < -1$. In this case, $\vert x-1 \vert = 1-x$, so our equation becomes $1-x-2 = \frac{m}{100}$, or $x = 1 - \frac{m}{100}$. For this to be a valid solution, we need $1 - \frac{m}{100} < -1$, or $\frac{m}{100} > 2$, or $m > 200$, which is not possible since $m$ is a positive integer less than 100. So, in the case $x < -1$, we do not get any solutions.

Therefore, for the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ to have four distinct solutions, $m$ must be a positive integer such that $0 < m < 100$. The number of such positive integers $m$ is 100. However, since the problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions, we must determine for how many of these values of $m$ the equation does indeed have $4$ distinct solutions.

We have already seen that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=0$ has two solutions. For $0 < m < 100$, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has one solution in the interval $x > 3$ and one solution in the interval $-1 < x < 3$. Therefore, for each such $m$, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has a total of $1+1+2=4$ distinct solutions. 

So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions is 100. The answer is: $100$

**Solution:** 



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}=1$ or $\frac{m}{100}=2$.

Similarly, the second case gives $x+2 = 0$ , i.e. $x = -2$ , and this indeed gives $x^2-x-1 = 4+2-1 = 5 \neq 0$ , so $x = -2$ is a further valid solution.
Lastly, for the third case, we have \begin{align*}x^2-x-1 = -1 &\iff x^2-x = 0 \\&\iff x(x-1) = 0 \\&\iff x = 0 \text{ or } x = 1,\end{align*} but $x = 1$ would give $x+2 = 3$ , which is odd, whereas $x = 0$ gives $x+2 = 2$ , which is even. Therefore, this case gives only one further solution, namely $x = 0$
Accordingly, the possible values of $x = -2$ $-1$ $0$ , or $2$ , yielding a total of $\boxed{4}$ solutions. The answer is $\boxed{4}$

**Problem:** 

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 



The equation $|\ |x-1|-2\ |= \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is the maximum of two distinct positive numbers $a$ and $b$ such that $|x-1|-2 = a$ and $|x-1|-2 = -a$ and $|x-1|-2 = b$ and $|x-1|-2 = -b$ have two solutions each. This is because each pair of equations (for example, $|x-1|-2 = a$ and $|x-1|-2 = -a$) will give rise to two solutions for $x$, and we need a total of 4 distinct solutions.

The equation $|x-1|-2 = a$ simplifies to $|x-1| = a+2$. This equation has two solutions if and only if $a+2>0$, or $a>-2$. The equation $|x-1|-2 = -a$ simplifies to $|x-1| = 2-a$. This equation has two solutions if and only if $2-a>0$, or $a<2$. Therefore, $a$ must lie in the interval $(-2, 2)$.

Similarly, the equation $|x-1|-2 = b$ simplifies to $|x-1| = b+2$, and the equation $|x-1|-2 = -b$ simplifies to $|x-1| = 2-b$. Therefore, $b$ must also lie in the interval $(-2, 2)$.

Since we want $a$ and $b$ to be distinct, $a$ and $b$ must lie in disjoint intervals. The maximum value of $a$ is 1 (attained when $a=1-2=-1$), and the maximum value of $b$ is also 1 (attained when $b=2-1=1$). Therefore, $\frac{m}{100}=1$, or $m=100$.

Hence, the value of $m$ is 100. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Problem:** 

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 



The equation $||x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $0$ and $2$. This means $0<\frac{m}{100}<2$, which implies $0<m<200$. 

The number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality is $199$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 199. The answer is: $199$

**Problem:** 

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 



The equation $| |x-1| -2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions. 

We can think of $| |x-1| -2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ as follows: 

$| |x-1| -2 |$ is a distance between the point $x$ and the point $3$ or $-1$ on the number line, and $\frac{m}{100}$ is a fixed distance. 

So, we are looking for the number of values of $m$ such that the distance between the point $x$ and the point $3$ or $-1$ is exactly $\frac{m}{100}$, and this distance creates four distinct segments on the number line.

For $|x - 1| - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$, we have two cases:

1. When $x - 1 \geq 0$, $|x - 1| - 2 = x - 3 = \frac{m}{100}$. This gives us the equation $x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$.

2. When $x - 1 < 0$, $|x - 1| - 2 = -(x - 1) - 2 = -x + 1 - 2 = -x - 1 = \frac{m}{100}$. This gives us the equation $x = - \frac{m}{100} - 1$.

For $|x - 1| - 2 = - \frac{m}{100}$, we have the same two cases:

1. When $x - 1 \geq 0$, $|x - 1| - 2 = -(x - 1) - 2 = -x + 1 - 2 = -x - 1 = - \frac{m}{100}$. This gives us the equation $x = - \frac{m}{100} + 1$.

2. When $x - 1 < 0$, $|x - 1| - 2 = x - 1 - 2 = x - 3 = - \frac{m}{100}$. This gives us the equation $x = - \frac{m}{100} + 3$.

Now, we draw these equations on the number line:

 - [x] -- (-1) -- (-3) -- (1) -- (3) --

The four distinct segments are $[-1, 1]$, $[1, 3]$, $[-3, -1]$, and $[-1, -3]$. The lengths of these segments are $2$, $2$, $4$, and $4$, respectively.

So, the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be either $2$ or $4$. This gives us $m = 200$ or $m = 400$.

Therefore, there are $\boxed{2}$ values of $m$ for which the equation $| |x-1| -2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.
The answer is $\boxed{2}$

**Problem:** 

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$ . This is because the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a graph that is a $"V"$ shape, with its minimum value occurring at $x = 1$ with a value of $2$ . The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$ , because this is the minimum value of the function. Solving the equation $\frac{m}{100} = 2$ gives $m = 200$ . Therefore, the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $m = 200$ . The answer is $\boxed{1}$.
