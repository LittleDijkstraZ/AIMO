"Let $S$ be the set of circles in the coordinate plane that are tangent to each of the three circles with equations $x^{2}+y^{2}=4$ $x^{2}+y^{2}=64$ , and $(x-5)^{2}+y^{2}=3$ . What is the sum of the areas of all circles in $S$"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 

We denote by $C_1$ the circle that has the equation $x^2 + y^2 = 4$ .
We denote by $C_2$ the circle that has the equation $x^2 + y^2 = 64$ .
We denote by $C_3$ the circle that has the equation $(x-5)^2 + y^2 = 3$
We denote by $C_0$ a circle that is tangent to $C_1$ $C_2$ and $C_3$ .
We denote by $\left( u, v \right)$ the coordinates of circle $C_0$ , and $r$ the radius of this circle.
From the graphs of circles $C_1$ $C_2$ $C_3$ , we observe that if $C_0$ is tangent to all of them, then $C_0$ must be internally tangent to $C_2$ .
We have \[ u^2 + v^2 = \left( 8 - r \right)^2 . \hspace{1cm} (1) \]
We do the following casework analysis in terms of the whether $C_0$ is externally tangent to $C_1$ and $C_3$
Case 1: $C_0$ is externally tangent to $C_1$ and $C_3$
We have \[ u^2 + v^2 = \left( r + 2 \right)^2   \hspace{1cm} (2) \] and \[ (u-5)^2 + v^2 = \left( r + \sqrt{3} \right)^2 . \hspace{1cm} (3) \]
Taking $(2) - (1)$ , we get $r + 2 = 8 - r$ . Thus, $r = 3$ .
We can further compute (omitted here) that there exist feasible $(u,v)$ with this given $r$
Case 2: $C_1$ is internally tangent to $C_0$ and $C_3$ is externally tangent to $C_0$
We have \[ u^2 + v^2 = \left( r - 2 \right)^2  \hspace{1cm} (2) \] and \[ (u-5)^2 + v^2 = \left( r + \sqrt{3} \right)^2 . \hspace{1cm} (3) \]
Taking $(2) - (1)$ , we get $r - 2 = 8 - r$ . Thus, $r = 5$ .
We can further compute (omitted here) that there exist feasible $(u,v)$ with this given $r$
Case 3: $C_1$ is externally tangent to $C_0$ and $C_3$ is internally tangent to $C_0$
We have \[ u^2 + v^2 = \left( r + 2 \right)^2  \hspace{1cm} (2) \] and \[ (u-5)^2 + v^2 = \left( r - \sqrt{3} \right)^2 . \hspace{1cm} (3) \]
Taking $(2) - (1)$ , we get $r + 2 = 8 - r$ . Thus, $r = 3$ .
We can further compute (omitted here) that there exist feasible $(u,v)$ with this given $r$
Case 4: $C_1$ is internally tangent to $C_0$ and $C_3$ is internally tangent to $C_0$
We have \[ u^2 + v^2 = \left( r - 2 \right)^2  \hspace{1cm} (2) \] and \[ (u-5)^2 + v^2 = \left( r - \sqrt{3} \right)^2 . \hspace{1cm} (3) \]
Taking $(2) - (1)$ , we get $r - 2 = 8 - r$ . Thus, $r = 5$ .
We can further compute (omitted here) that there exist feasible $(u,v)$ with this given $r$
Because the graph is symmetric with the $x$ -axis, and for each case above, the solution of $v$ is not 0. Hence, in each case, there are two congruent circles whose centers are symmetric through the $x$ -axis.
Therefore, the sum of the areas of all the circles in $S$ is $2\left( 3^2 \pi +5^2 \pi +3^2 \pi +5^2 \pi \right) = \boxed{136}$ The answer is $\boxed{136}$

**Problem:** 

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 



The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is equal to 0 when either of the two factors is equal to 0. This gives us two sets of equations:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
2. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first set, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

For the second set, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersection of these lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$. The area of this rectangle is $16 \times 16 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points satisfying the given equation is 256. The answer is: 256

Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 

We denote by $C_1$ the circle that has the equation $x^2 + y^2 = 4$ .
We denote by $C_2$ the circle that has the equation $x^2 + y^2 = 64$ .
We denote by $C_3$ the circle that has the equation $(x-5)^2 + y^2 = 3$
We denote by $C_0$ a circle that is tangent to $C_1$ $C_2$ and $C_3$ .
We denote by $\left( u, v \right)$ the coordinates of circle $C_0$ , and $r$ the radius of this circle.
From the graphs of circles $C_1$ $C_2$ $C_3$ , we observe that if $C_0$ is tangent to all of them, then $C_0$ must be internally tangent to $C_2$ .
We have \[ u^2 + v^2 = \left( 8 - r \right)^2 . \hspace{1cm} (1) \]
We do the following casework analysis in terms of the whether $C_0$ is externally tangent to $C_1$ and $C_3$
Case 1: $C_0$ is externally tangent to $C_1$ and $C_3$
We have \[ u^2 + v^2 = \left( r + 2 \right)^2   \hspace{1cm} (2) \] and \[ (u-5)^2 + v^2 = \left( r + \sqrt{3} \right)^2 . \hspace{1cm} (3) \]
Taking $(2) - (1)$ , we get $r + 2 = 8 - r$ . Thus, $r = 3$ .
We can further compute (omitted here) that there exist feasible $(u,v)$ with this given $r$
Case 2: $C_1$ is internally tangent to $C_0$ and $C_3$ is externally tangent to $C_0$
We have \[ u^2 + v^2 = \left( r - 2 \right)^2  \hspace{1cm} (2) \] and \[ (u-5)^2 + v^2 = \left( r + \sqrt{3} \right)^2 . \hspace{1cm} (3) \]
Taking $(2) - (1)$ , we get $r - 2 = 8 - r$ . Thus, $r = 5$ .
We can further compute (omitted here) that there exist feasible $(u,v)$ with this given $r$
Case 3: $C_1$ is externally tangent to $C_0$ and $C_3$ is internally tangent to $C_0$
We have \[ u^2 + v^2 = \left( r + 2 \right)^2  \hspace{1cm} (2) \] and \[ (u-5)^2 + v^2 = \left( r - \sqrt{3} \right)^2 . \hspace{1cm} (3) \]
Taking $(2) - (1)$ , we get $r + 2 = 8 - r$ . Thus, $r = 3$ .
We can further compute (omitted here) that there exist feasible $(u,v)$ with this given $r$
Case 4: $C_1$ is internally tangent to $C_0$ and $C_3$ is internally tangent to $C_0$
We have \[ u^2 + v^2 = \left( r - 2 \right)^2  \hspace{1cm} (2) \] and \[ (u-5)^2 + v^2 = \left( r - \sqrt{3} \right)^2 . \hspace{1cm} (3) \]
Taking $(2) - (1)$ , we get $r - 2 = 8 - r$ . Thus, $r = 5$ .
We can further compute (omitted here) that there exist feasible $(u,v)$ with this given $r$
Because the graph is symmetric with the $x$ -axis, and for each case above, the solution of $v$ is not 0. Hence, in each case, there are two congruent circles whose centers are symmetric through the $x$ -axis.
Therefore, the sum of the areas of all the circles in $S$ is $2\left( 3^2 \pi +5^2 \pi +3^2 \pi +5^2 \pi \right) = \boxed{136}$ The answer is $\boxed{136}$

**Problem:** 

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 



The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. 

From $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, we get $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(8,2)$, $(8,-2)$, $(-8,2)$, $(-8,-2)$, $(2,8)$, $(-2,8)$, $(2,-8)$, and $(-2,-8)$. 

These points form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is $\boxed{256}$.

Case 1: $C_0$ is externally tangent to $C_1$ and $C_3$

**Problem:** 

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 



The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ equals zero only if both of the factors equal zero.

For the first factor to equal zero, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two lines in the coordinate plane.

For the second factor to equal zero, either $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of four lines in the coordinate plane.

The intersection of these lines form a square with side length $10 + 8 = 18$. The area of this square is $18^2 = \boxed{324}$.
The answer is $\boxed{324}$.

**Problem:** 

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 



The given equation is a product of two terms, so it equals zero if and only if at least one of the terms equals zero. This means we can break the problem into two cases:

**Case 1:** $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$

For this to be true, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This is only possible if $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$. So we have four points: $(10, 10)$, $(10, -10)$, $(-10, 10)$, and $(-10, -10)$.

**Case 2:** $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For this to be true, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This is only possible if $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So we have four points: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The eight points $(10, 10)$, $(10, -10)$, $(-10, 10)$, $(-10, -10)$, $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$ form a square with side length $20$. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.

So the area of the convex polygon formed by the points satisfying the given equation is 400. The answer is: $400$

Because the graph is symmetric with the $x$ -axis, and for each case above, the solution of $v$ is not 0. Hence, in each case, there are two congruent circles whose centers are symmetric through the $x$ -axis.
Therefore, the sum of the areas of all the circles in $S$ is $2\left( 3^2 \pi +5^2 \pi +3^2 \pi +5^2 \pi \right) = \boxed{136}$ The answer is $\boxed{136}$

**Problem:** 

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 



The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is equal to 0 if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first case, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we know that both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only way this can happen is if $x = y = 5$ or $x = y = -5$.

For the second case, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we know that both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The only way this can happen is if $x = 8$ and $y = 8$ or $x = -8$ and $y = -8$.

So the points $\left(x, y\right)$ that satisfy the given equation are $(5, 5)$, $(-5, -5)$, $(8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$. These points form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10 \times 10 = 100$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{100}$. The answer is $\boxed{100}$.

7_**Problem:** 

"Let $S$ be the set of circles in the coordinate plane that are tangent to each of the three circles with equations $x^{2}+y^{2}=4$ $x^{2}+y^{2}=64$ , and $(x-5)^{2}+y^{2}=3$ . What is the sum of the areas of all circles in $S$"

We denote by $\left( u, v \right)$ the coordinates of circle $C_0$ , and $r$ the radius of this circle.
From the graphs of circles $C_1$ $C_2$ $C_3$ , we observe that if $C_0$ is tangent to all of them, then $C_0$ must be internally tangent to $C_2$ .
We have \[ u^2 + v^2 = \left( 8 - r \right)^2 . \hspace{1cm} (1) \]
We do the following casework analysis in terms of the whether $C_0$ is externally tangent to $C_1$ and $C_3$
Case 1: $C_0$ is externally tangent to $C_1$ and $C_3$
We have \[ u^2 + v^2 = \left( r + 2 \right)^2   \hspace{1cm} (2) \] and \[ (u-5)^2 + v^2 = \left( r + \sqrt{3} \right)^2 . \hspace{1cm} (3) \]

Taking $(2) - (1)$ , we get $r + 2 = 8 - r$ . Thus, $r = 3$ .

Taking $(2) - (1)$ , we get $r - 2 = 8 - r$ . Thus, $r = 5$ .

**Problem:** 

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 



The expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ equals zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two lines passing through the origin with slopes 1 and -1.

The expression $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2$ equals zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which are the equations of two lines passing through the origin with slopes 0.

The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 10, and the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is $\boxed{100}$.

**Problem:** 

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 



The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if either of the two factors is equal to zero. 

1. The first factor is zero when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two orthogonal lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, and their opposites $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$.

2. The second factor is zero when $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of four lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersection points of these lines are the vertices of the polygon. We can find these intersection points by solving the systems of equations formed by pairs of these lines.

The vertices of the polygon are: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(2, 8)$, $(-2, 8)$, $(2, -8)$, and $(-2, -8)$.

The polygon is a square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$, since the distance between any two adjacent vertices, for example, $(8, 2)$ and $(8, -2)$, is $\sqrt{(0)^2 + (-4)^2} = 4$ (using the distance formula), and the square root of the sum of the squares of the coordinates of $(8, 2)$ and $(8, -2)$ is $\sqrt{(8 - 8)^2 + (2 - (-2))^2} = \sqrt{0 + 16} = 4\sqrt{2}$.

Therefore, the area of the polygon is $(10\sqrt{2})^2 = 200$. The answer is: $200$

**Problem:** 

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 



The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. 

For the first case, we have $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. These equations imply that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these equations are all points $(x, y)$ such that the distance between $(x, y)$ and the line $x = -y$ is 10 and the distance between $(x, y)$ and the line $x = y$ is also 10. These lines are simply the bisectors of the axes, so the polygon is a square with side length 20. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.

For the second case, we have $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. These equations imply that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are all points $(x, y)$ such that the distance between $(x, y)$ and the $x$-axis is 8 and the distance between $(x, y)$ and the $y$-axis is also 8. These lines are simply the lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$, and the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$. The polygon is a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

However, since the two cases are mutually exclusive, the only points that satisfy both conditions are the points on the lines $y = \pm x$, and $x = \pm 8$, $y = \pm 8$. But these points do not form a polygon.

So, the only valid solution is the first case. The area of the convex polygon is therefore $400$. The answer is: $400$

**Problem:** 

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 



Notice that the expression on the left is the product of two terms. Therefore, the expression equals zero if and only if one or both the terms equal zero.

The two terms are $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$. Each of these is a square, so they are both nonnegative. Therefore, for the product to equal zero, it must be the case that $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. This means that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

The solutions to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ are given by $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$, and the solutions to $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ are given by $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$. This gives us a total of 4 lines in the plane: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

Similarly, the term $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ forces $\vert x \vert = 8$, which gives us $x = 8$ and $x = -8$. And $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2$ forces $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us $y = 8$ and $y = -8$. This gives us 4 more lines in the plane: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

These 8 lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$. The area of this rectangle is $(8 - (-8))(8 - (-8)) = 16 \times 16 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points that satisfy the original equation is 256. The answer is: 256$

11_**Problem:** 

"Let $S$ be the set of circles in the coordinate plane that are tangent to each of the three circles with equations $x^{2}+y^{2}=4$ $x^{2}+y^{2}=64$ , and $(x-5)^{2}+y^{2}=3$ . What is the sum of the areas of all circles in $S$"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 

We denote by $C_1$ the circle that has the equation $x^2 + y^2 = 4$ .
We denote by $C_2$ the circle that has the equation $x^2 + y^2 = 64$ .
We denote by $C_3$ the circle that has the equation $(x-5)^2 + y^2 = 3$
We denote by $C_0$ a circle that is tangent to $C_1$ $C_2$ and $C_3$ .
We denote by $\left( u, v \right)$ the coordinates of circle $C_0$ , and $r$ the radius of this circle.
From the graphs of circles $C_1$ $C_2$ $C_3$ , we observe that if $C_0$ is tangent to all of them, then $C_0$ must be internally tangent to $C_2$ .
We have \[ u^2 + v^2 = \left( 8 - r \right)^2 . \hspace{1cm} (1) \]
We do the following casework analysis in terms of the whether $C_0$ is externally tangent to $C_1$ and $C_3$
Case 1: $C_0$ is externally tangent to $C_1$ and $C_3$
We have \[ u^2 + v^2 = \left( r + 2 \right)^2   \hspace{1cm} (2) \] and \[ (u-5)^2 + v^2 = \left( r + \sqrt{3} \right)^2 . \hspace{1cm} (3) \]
Taking $(2) - (1)$ , we get $r + 2 = 8 - r$ . Thus, $r = 3$ .
We can further compute (omitted here) that there exist feasible $(u,v)$ with this given $r$
Case 2: $C_1$ is internally tangent to $C_0$ and $C_3$ is externally tangent to $C_0$
We have \[ u^2 + v^2 = \left( r - 2 \right)^2  \hspace{1cm} (2) \] and \[ (u-5)^2 + v^2 = \left( r + \sqrt{3} \right)^2 . \hspace{1cm} (3) \]
Taking $(2) - (1)$ , we get $r - 2 = 8 - r$ . Thus, $r = 5$ .
We can further compute (omitted here) that there exist feasible $(u,v)$ with this given $r$
Case 3: $C_1$ is externally tangent to $C_0$ and $C_3$ is internally tangent to $C_0$
We have \[ u^2 + v^2 = \left( r + 2 \right)^2  \hspace{1cm} (2) \] and \[ (u-5)^2 + v^2 = \left( r - \sqrt{3} \right)^2 . \hspace{1cm} (3) \]
Taking $(2) - (1)$ , we get $r + 2 = 8 - r$ . Thus, $r = 3$ .
We can further compute (omitted here) that there exist feasible $(u,v)$ with this given $r$
Case 4: $C_1$ is internally tangent to $C_0$ and $C_3$ is internally tangent to $C_0$
We have \[ u^2 + v^2 = \left( r - 2 \right)^2  \hspace{1cm} (2) \] and \[ (u-5)^2 + v^2 = \left( r - \sqrt{3} \right)^2 . \hspace{1cm} (3) \]
Taking $(2) - (1)$ , we get $r - 2 = 8 - r$ . Thus, $r = 5$ .
We can further compute (omitted here) that there exist feasible $(u,v)$ with this given $r$
Because the graph is symmetric with the $x$ -axis, and for each case above, the solution of $v$ is not 0. Hence, in each case, there are two congruent circles whose centers are symmetric through the $x$ -axis.
Therefore, the sum of the areas of all the circles in $S$ is $2\left( 3^2 \pi +5^2 \pi +3^2 \pi +5^2 \pi \right) = \boxed{136}$ The answer is $\boxed{136}$

**Problem:** 

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 



The product of two real numbers is zero if and only if one or both of them are zero. Thus, one of the following two cases must hold:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
If two absolute values are equal to the same number, then their arguments must be equal or equal but with opposite signs. So this case leads to the system of equations
\begin{align*}
x+y &= \pm 10,\\
x-y &= \pm 10.
\end{align*} Solving for $x$ and $y$ in each combination of signs gives the points: $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, and $(-10, 0)$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
This case leads to $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$, which gives us the points: $(8, 0)$, $(-8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, and $(0, -8)$.

If we plot these points, we see that they form a $8 \times 16$ rectangle. The area of this rectangle is $8 \times 16 = 128$. The answer is: $\boxed{128}$

**Problem:** 

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 



The product of two numbers is zero if and only if one or both of the numbers are zero. So, we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two squares in the coordinate plane.

For the second case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two squares in the coordinate plane.

The intersection of these squares forms a regular octagon. The side length of the octagon is 8 (since $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$ implies that the distance from the origin to the sides of the squares is 8).

The area of a regular octagon with side length $a$ is $2a^2(1 + \sqrt{2})$. So, the area of the octagon is $2 \cdot 8^2(1 + \sqrt{2}) = 2 \cdot 64(1 + \sqrt{2}) = 128(1 + \sqrt{2})$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $128(1 + \sqrt{2})$. The answer is: $128(1 + \sqrt{2})$

**Problem:** 

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 



The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if and only if at least one of the following two conditions is satisfied:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$,
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first condition to be satisfied, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This is the equation of a square with side length 10 and vertices at $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,-5)$, and $(-5,5)$.

For the second condition to be satisfied, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This is the equation of a square with side length 16 and vertices at $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,-8)$, and $(-8,8)$.

The intersection of these two squares is a square with side length 8 and vertices at $(4,4)$, $(4,-4)$, $(-4,-4)$, and $(-4,4)$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $8^2 = 64$. The answer is $\boxed{64}$.

**Problem:** 

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 



The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is the product of two terms. So it equals zero if and only if at least one of the terms equals zero.

Each term is a square, so setting each term equal to zero makes it so that the value inside the absolute value is zero.

For the first term, $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ which means $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.

For the second term, $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$ means $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ which means $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.

For the third term, $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ means $\vert x \vert = 8$ which means $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.

For the fourth term, $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$ means $\vert y \vert = 8$ which means $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

So, the points that satisfy the equation are:

1. $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ which gives $x = 10$ and $y = 0$.
2. $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$ which gives $x = 0$ and $y = 10$.
3. $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$ which gives $x = -10$ and $y = -0$.
4. $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$ which gives $x = -0$ and $y = -10$.
5. $x = 8$ and $y = 8$.
6. $x = 8$ and $y = -8$.
7. $x = -8$ and $y = 8$.
8. $x = -8$ and $y = -8$.

Plotting these points on a coordinate plane, we can see that they form a square with side length 20.

The area of this square is side length squared, so the area is $20^2 = 400$.
The answer is $\boxed{400}$.

Case 3: $C_1$ is externally tangent to $C_0$ and $C_3$ is internally tangent to $C_0$
We have \[ u^2 + v^2 = \left( r + 2 \right)^2  \hspace{1cm} (2) \] and \[ (u-5)^2 + v^2 = \left( r - \sqrt{3} \right)^2 . \hspace{1cm} (3) \]
Taking $(2) - (1)$ , we get $r + 2 = 8 - r$ . Thus, $r = 3$ .

Because the graph is symmetric with the $x$ -axis, and for each case above, the solution of $v$ is not 0. Hence, in each case, there are two congruent circles whose centers are symmetric through the $x$ -axis.
Therefore, the sum of the areas of all the circles in $S$ is $2\left( 3^2 \pi +5^2 \pi +3^2 \pi +5^2 \pi \right) = \boxed{136}$ The answer is $\boxed{136}$

**Problem:** 

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 



The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is true if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only way this can be true is if $x = 0$ and $y = 0$.

The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on a square with side length 16.

Therefore, the points that satisfy the given equation are the points $(0, 0)$ and all points on the square with side length 16 centered at the origin. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon enclosed by these points is 256. The answer is: $256$
