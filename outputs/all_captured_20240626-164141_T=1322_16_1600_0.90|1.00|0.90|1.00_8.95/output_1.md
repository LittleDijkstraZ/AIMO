0_**Problem:** 

"For how many positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $1000$ is $(\sin t + i \cos t)^n = \sin nt + i \cos nt$ true for all real $t$"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 

We know by De Moivre's Theorem that $(\cos t + i \sin t)^n = \cos nt + i \sin nt$ for all real numbers $t$ and all integers $n$ .  So, we'd like to somehow convert our given expression into a form from which we can apply De Moivre's Theorem.
Recall the trigonometric identities $\cos \left(\frac{\pi}2 - u\right) = \sin u$ and $\sin \left(\frac{\pi}2 - u\right) = \cos u$ hold for all real $u$ .  If our original equation holds for all $t$ , it must certainly hold for $t = \frac{\pi}2 - u$ .  Thus, the question is equivalent to asking for how many positive integers $n \leq 1000$ we have that $\left(\sin\left(\frac\pi2 - u\right) + i \cos\left(\frac\pi 2 - u\right)\right)^n = \sin n \left(\frac\pi2 -u \right) + i\cos n \left(\frac\pi2 - u\right)$ holds for all real $u$
$\left(\sin\left(\frac\pi2 - u\right) + i \cos\left(\frac\pi 2 - u\right)\right)^n = \left(\cos u + i \sin u\right)^n = \cos nu + i\sin nu$ .  We know that two complex numbers are equal if and only if both their real part and imaginary part are equal.  Thus, we need to find all $n$ such that $\cos n u = \sin n\left(\frac\pi2 - u\right)$ and $\sin nu = \cos n\left(\frac\pi2 - u\right)$ hold for all real $u$
$\sin x = \cos y$ if and only if either $x + y = \frac \pi 2 + 2\pi \cdot k$ or $x - y = \frac\pi2 + 2\pi\cdot k$ for some integer $k$ .  So from the equality of the real parts we need either $nu + n\left(\frac\pi2 - u\right) = \frac\pi 2 + 2\pi \cdot k$ , in which case $n = 1 + 4k$ , or we need $-nu + n\left(\frac\pi2 - u\right) = \frac\pi 2 + 2\pi \cdot k$ , in which case $n$ will depend on $u$ and so the equation will not hold for all real values of $u$ .  Checking $n = 1 + 4k$ in the equation for the imaginary parts, we see that it works there as well, so exactly those values of $n$ congruent to $1 \pmod 4$ work.  There are $\boxed{250}$ of them in the given range. The answer is $\boxed{250}$

**Problem:** 

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 



First, we observe that $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|2y - x| + |2x - y| = 40$. This is the absolute value of the sum of two absolute values, which is always greater than or equal to the absolute value of their sum, so we must have $|(2y - x) + (2x - y)| = |y + x| = 40$. This simplifies to $|x + y| = 40$.

Next, we let $s = x + y$ and $d = x - y$. Then $x = \frac{s + d}{2}$ and $y = \frac{s - d}{2}$. Substituting these into the given expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ gives:

\begin{align*}
5\left(\frac{s + d}{2}\right)^2 + 5\left(\frac{s - d}{2}\right)^2 - 8\left(\frac{s + d}{2}\right)\left(\frac{s - d}{2}\right) &= \frac{5}{4}(s^2 + 2sd + d^2) + \frac{5}{4}(s^2 - 2sd + d^2) - 2(s^2 - d^2) \\
&= \frac{5s^2 + 5d^2 + 10sd + 5s^2 - 5d^2 - 10sd - 8s^2 + 8d^2}{4} \\
&= \frac{-3s^2 + 8d^2}{4} \\
&= -\frac{3}{4}s^2 + 2d^2.
\end{align*}

Since $|x + y| = 40$, we have $s = 40$. Substituting this into the above expression gives $-\frac{3}{4}(40)^2 + 2d^2 = -300 + 2d^2$.

To minimize this expression, we need to minimize $2d^2$ while keeping $|x - y| = |d| = \sqrt{(x - y)^2} = \sqrt{\left(\frac{s - d}{2} - \frac{s + d}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{s + d}{2} - \frac{s - d}{2}\right)^2} = \sqrt{d^2 + s^2}/2 = \sqrt{d^2 + 40^2}/2 = \sqrt{d^2 + 1600}/2$ as small as possible. This happens when $d = 0$, in which case $x = y$.

Substituting $d = 0$ into the expression $-\frac{3}{4}(40)^2 + 2d^2 = -300 + 2(0)^2 = -300$ gives the minimum value of the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$. 

So the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is $-300$. The answer is: $\boxed{-300}$

1_**Problem:** 

"For how many positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $1000$ is $(\sin t + i \cos t)^n = \sin nt + i \cos nt$ true for all real $t$"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 

We know by De Moivre's Theorem that $(\cos t + i \sin t)^n = \cos nt + i \sin nt$ for all real numbers $t$ and all integers $n$ .  So, we'd like to somehow convert our given expression into a form from which we can apply De Moivre's Theorem.
Recall the trigonometric identities $\cos \left(\frac{\pi}2 - u\right) = \sin u$ and $\sin \left(\frac{\pi}2 - u\right) = \cos u$ hold for all real $u$ .  If our original equation holds for all $t$ , it must certainly hold for $t = \frac{\pi}2 - u$ .  Thus, the question is equivalent to asking for how many positive integers $n \leq 1000$ we have that $\left(\sin\left(\frac\pi2 - u\right) + i \cos\left(\frac\pi 2 - u\right)\right)^n = \sin n \left(\frac\pi2 -u \right) + i\cos n \left(\frac\pi2 - u\right)$ holds for all real $u$
$\left(\sin\left(\frac\pi2 - u\right) + i \cos\left(\frac\pi 2 - u\right)\right)^n = \left(\cos u + i \sin u\right)^n = \cos nu + i\sin nu$ .  We know that two complex numbers are equal if and only if both their real part and imaginary part are equal.  Thus, we need to find all $n$ such that $\cos n u = \sin n\left(\frac\pi2 - u\right)$ and $\sin nu = \cos n\left(\frac\pi2 - u\right)$ hold for all real $u$
$\sin x = \cos y$ if and only if either $x + y = \frac \pi 2 + 2\pi \cdot k$ or $x - y = \frac\pi2 + 2\pi\cdot k$ for some integer $k$ .  So from the equality of the real parts we need either $nu + n\left(\frac\pi2 - u\right) = \frac\pi 2 + 2\pi \cdot k$ , in which case $n = 1 + 4k$ , or we need $-nu + n\left(\frac\pi2 - u\right) = \frac\pi 2 + 2\pi \cdot k$ , in which case $n$ will depend on $u$ and so the equation will not hold for all real values of $u$ .  Checking $n = 1 + 4k$ in the equation for the imaginary parts, we see that it works there as well, so exactly those values of $n$ congruent to $1 \pmod 4$ work.  There are $\boxed{250}$ of them in the given range. The answer is $\boxed{250}$

**Problem:** 

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 



We first note that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is equivalent to $2|x-2y| = 40$, or $|x-2y| = 20$.
This is equivalent to the condition that the distance between $(x, y)$ and $(2y, y)$ is 20.

We can rewrite the given expression as $5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy = 5((x-y)^2 + 2xy) - 8xy = 5(x-y)^2 + 3xy$.

Now consider the expression $3xy$. We know that $3xy = \frac{9}{2}((x-y)^2 + 2xy) - \frac{9}{2}(x-y)^2 = \frac{9}{2}(x^2+y^2) - \frac{9}{2}(x-y)^2$.

Substitute this into our original expression, we have $5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy = 5(x^2+y^2) - \frac{9}{2}(x^2+y^2) + \frac{9}{2}(x-y)^2 = \frac{1}{2}(x^2+y^2) + \frac{9}{2}(x-y)^2$.

This expression is minimized when $(x-y)^2 = 0$, or $x=y$. Substituting $x=y$ into the distance condition $|x-2y|=20$, we get $|x-2x|=|x|=20$, or $x=y=\pm 10$.

So the minimum value is achieved when $x=y=10$ or $x=y=-10$. Substitute into our original expression, we get $5(10^2+10^2) - 8*10*10 = 5*200 - 800 = 1000 - 800 = 200$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $200$. The answer is $\boxed{200}$.

2_**Problem:** 

"For how many positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $1000$ is $(\sin t + i \cos t)^n = \sin nt + i \cos nt$ true for all real $t$"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 

We know by De Moivre's Theorem that $(\cos t + i \sin t)^n = \cos nt + i \sin nt$ for all real numbers $t$ and all integers $n$ .  So, we'd like to somehow convert our given expression into a form from which we can apply De Moivre's Theorem.
Recall the trigonometric identities $\cos \left(\frac{\pi}2 - u\right) = \sin u$ and $\sin \left(\frac{\pi}2 - u\right) = \cos u$ hold for all real $u$ .  If our original equation holds for all $t$ , it must certainly hold for $t = \frac{\pi}2 - u$ .

$\left(\sin\left(\frac\pi2 - u\right) + i \cos\left(\frac\pi 2 - u\right)\right)^n = \left(\cos u + i \sin u\right)^n = \cos nu + i\sin nu$ .  We know that two complex numbers are equal if and only if both their real part and imaginary part are equal.  Thus, we need to find all $n$ such that $\cos n u = \sin n\left(\frac\pi2 - u\right)$ and $\sin nu = \cos n\left(\frac\pi2 - u\right)$ hold for all real $u$
$\sin x = \cos y$ if and only if either $x + y = \frac \pi 2 + 2\pi \cdot k$ or $x - y = \frac\pi2 + 2\pi\cdot k$ for some integer $k$ .

**Problem:** 

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 



First, we simplify the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. By the absolute value triangle inequality, we have $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |x-2y + (y-2x)| = |-x-y| = |-(x+y)| = |x+y|$, so the condition becomes $|x+y| = 40$.

Now, we want to minimize the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite this expression as $(x^2-2xy+y^2) + 4(x^2-2xy+y^2) = (x-y)^2 + 4(x^2-2xy+y^2) = (x-y)^2 + 4(x-y)^2 = 5(x-y)^2$.

Since we know that $|x+y| = 40$, we can square both sides to get $x^2+2xy+y^2 = 1600$, or $(x+y)^2 = 1600$. This gives us $2xy = (x+y)^2 - x^2 - y^2 = 1600 - x^2 - y^2$.

Substituting this into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get $5x^2+5y^2-8(1600 - x^2 - y^2) = 5x^2+5y^2-12800+8x^2+8y^2 = 13x^2+13y^2-12800$.

This expression is minimized when $x=y=0$, because the terms $13x^2$ and $13y^2$ will always be non-negative. So the minimum value of the expression is $13(0)^2+13(0)^2-12800 = -12800$. But this is not possible, because the expression is always non-negative (since it is a sum of squares), and a minimum value of $-12800$ would mean it is negative.

However, we made an error in our calculations. The correct way to solve this problem is as follows:

First, we know that $(x-y)^2 \ge 0$, so $5(x-y)^2 \ge 0$. This means that $5x^2+5y^2-8xy \ge 0$. Therefore, the minimum value of the expression is $0$, which occurs when $x=y=\frac{20}{\sqrt{2}} = 10\sqrt{2}$.

Substituting $x=y=10\sqrt{2}$ into the condition $|x+y| = 40$, we get $|20\sqrt{2}| = 40$, which is true.

So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $0$. The answer is: $0$

3_**Problem:** 

"For how many positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $1000$ is $(\sin t + i \cos t)^n = \sin nt + i \cos nt$ true for all real $t$"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 

We know by De Moivre's Theorem that $(\cos t + i \sin t)^n = \cos nt + i \sin nt$ for all real numbers $t$ and all integers $n$ .  So, we'd like to somehow convert our given expression into a form from which we can apply De Moivre's Theorem.
Recall the trigonometric identities $\cos \left(\frac{\pi}2 - u\right) = \sin u$ and $\sin \left(\frac{\pi}2 - u\right) = \cos u$ hold for all real $u$ .  If our original equation holds for all $t$ , it must certainly hold for $t = \frac{\pi}2 - u$ .  Thus, the question is equivalent to asking for how many positive integers $n \leq 1000$ we have that $\left(\sin\left(\frac\pi2 - u\right) + i \cos\left(\frac\pi 2 - u\right)\right)^n = \sin n \left(\frac\pi2 -u \right) + i\cos n \left(\frac\pi2 - u\right)$ holds for all real $u$
$\left(\sin\left(\frac\pi2 - u\right) + i \cos\left(\frac\pi 2 - u\right)\right)^n = \left(\cos u + i \sin u\right)^n = \cos nu + i\sin nu$ .  We know that two complex numbers are equal if and only if both their real part and imaginary part are equal.  Thus, we need to find all $n$ such that $\cos n u = \sin n\left(\frac\pi2 - u\right)$ and $\sin nu = \cos n\left(\frac\pi2 - u\right)$ hold for all real $u$
$\sin x = \cos y$ if and only if either $x + y = \frac \pi 2 + 2\pi \cdot k$ or $x - y = \frac\pi2 + 2\pi\cdot k$ for some integer $k$ .

**Problem:** 

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 



First, we simplify the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
The expression $|x-2y| + |y-2x|$ is the same as $|2y-x| + |2x-y|$, which is the same as $|2y-x| + |x-2y|$.
The absolute value of a number is always non-negative, so we can remove the absolute values and just consider the two cases separately.
Case 1: $2y-x + x-2y = 40$, which simplifies to $0 = 40$, a contradiction. So this case doesn't give us any solutions.
Case 2: $2y-x - (x-2y) = 40$, which simplifies to $4y - 2x = 40$.
Dividing both sides by 2, we get $2y - x = 20$.
Multiplying both sides by 2, we get $4y - 2x = 40$, which is the same as case 2. So this case also doesn't give us any solutions.
This means that the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ has no solutions.
So the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ has no effect on the value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.
Now we just need to find the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.
The expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is the same as $5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy$.
Completing the square for the $xy$ term, we get $5[(x-y)^2 + 2xy] - 8xy$.
Simplifying, we get $5(x-y)^2 + 5(2xy) - 8xy$.
Combining like terms, we get $5(x-y)^2 - 3xy$.
Since $5(x-y)^2$ is always non-negative, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is achieved when $xy$ is maximized.
From the equation $2y - x = 20$, we can solve for $y$ in terms of $x$: $y = \frac{x+20}{2}$.
Substituting this into the expression $-3xy$, we get $-3x\left(\frac{x+20}{2}\right) = -\frac{3x(x+20)}{2}$.
Expanding, we get $-\frac{3x^2 - 60x}{2} = -\frac{3}{2}x^2 + 30x$.
To maximize this expression, we take the derivative with respect to $x$ and set it equal to zero:
$-\frac{3}{2}(2x) + 30 = 0$.
Simplifying, we get $-3x + 30 = 0$, so $x = 10$.
Substituting this back into $y = \frac{x+20}{2}$, we get $y = \frac{10+20}{2} = 15$.
So the maximum value of $xy$ is $10 \cdot 15 = 150$.
Substituting this back into $5(x-y)^2 - 3xy$, we get $5(10-15)^2 - 3(150) = 5(-5)^2 - 450 = 125 - 450 = -325$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $-325$. The answer is $\boxed{-325}$.

4_**Problem:** 

"For how many positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $1000$ is $(\sin t + i \cos t)^n = \sin nt + i \cos nt$ true for all real $t$"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 

We know by De Moivre's Theorem that $(\cos t + i \sin t)^n = \cos nt + i \sin nt$ for all real numbers $t$ and all integers $n$ .  So, we'd like to somehow convert our given expression into a form from which we can apply De Moivre's Theorem.
Recall the trigonometric identities $\cos \left(\frac{\pi}2 - u\right) = \sin u$ and $\sin \left(\frac{\pi}2 - u\right) = \cos u$ hold for all real $u$ .  If our original equation holds for all $t$ , it must certainly hold for $t = \frac{\pi}2 - u$ .  Thus, the question is equivalent to asking for how many positive integers $n \leq 1000$ we have that $\left(\sin\left(\frac\pi2 - u\right) + i \cos\left(\frac\pi 2 - u\right)\right)^n = \sin n \left(\frac\pi2 -u \right) + i\cos n \left(\frac\pi2 - u\right)$ holds for all real $u$
$\left(\sin\left(\frac\pi2 - u\right) + i \cos\left(\frac\pi 2 - u\right)\right)^n = \left(\cos u + i \sin u\right)^n = \cos nu + i\sin nu$ .  We know that two complex numbers are equal if and only if both their real part and imaginary part are equal.  Thus, we need to find all $n$ such that $\cos n u = \sin n\left(\frac\pi2 - u\right)$ and $\sin nu = \cos n\left(\frac\pi2 - u\right)$ hold for all real $u$
$\sin x = \cos y$ if and only if either $x + y = \frac \pi 2 + 2\pi \cdot k$ or $x - y = \frac\pi2 + 2\pi\cdot k$ for some integer $k$ .  So from the equality of the real parts we need either $nu + n\left(\frac\pi2 - u\right) = \frac\pi 2 + 2\pi \cdot k$ , in which case $n = 1 + 4k$ , or we need $-nu + n\left(\frac\pi2 - u\right) = \frac\pi 2 + 2\pi \cdot k$ , in which case $n$ will depend on $u$ and so the equation will not hold for all real values of $u$ .  Checking $n = 1 + 4k$ in the equation for the imaginary parts, we see that it works there as well, so exactly those values of $n$ congruent to $1 \pmod 4$ work.  There are $\boxed{250}$ of them in the given range. The answer is $\boxed{250}$

**Problem:** 

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 



We start by simplifying the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.

We know that $|a-b| = |-(a-b)| = |b-a|$, so we can rewrite the equation as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$.

This simplifies to $|x-2y| - |x-2y| = 40$, which simplifies further to $0 = 40$. But this is a contradiction. So we must have made a mistake in our simplification.

Let's correct our mistake. The absolute value function $|a-b|$ is equal to $a-b$ if $a-b \geq 0$, and is equal to $-(a-b)$ if $a-b < 0$. So when we simplified $|x-2y| + |y-2x|$, we should consider the cases when $x-2y \geq 0$ and $x-2y < 0$ separately.

Case 1: If $x-2y \geq 0$, then $|x-2y| = x-2y$ and $|y-2x| = -(y-2x) = 2x-y$. So the equation becomes $(x-2y) + (2x-y) = 40$, which simplifies to $3x-3y = 40$ or $x-y = \frac{40}{3}$.

Case 2: If $x-2y < 0$, then $|x-2y| = -(x-2y) = 2y-x$ and $|y-2x| = y-2x$. So the equation becomes $(2y-x) + (y-2x) = 40$, which simplifies to $3y-3x = 40$ or $y-x = \frac{40}{3}$.

So the given equation actually splits into two cases, $x-y = \frac{40}{3}$ and $y-x = \frac{40}{3}$, which are equivalent.

Now we substitute $y = x + \frac{40}{3}$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to find its minimum value. We get
\[5x^2 + 5\left(x + \frac{40}{3}\right)^2 - 8x\left(x + \frac{40}{3}\right).\]
Simplifying this gives
\[5x^2 + 5\left(x^2 + \frac{80x}{3} + \frac{1600}{9}\right) - 8x^2 - \frac{320x}{3} = -\frac{5x^2}{3} - \frac{160x}{3} + \frac{800}{3}.\]
Let $f(x) = -\frac{5x^2}{3} - \frac{160x}{3} + \frac{800}{3}$. To find the minimum of $f(x)$, we take its derivative with respect to $x$ and set it equal to zero. We get
\[f'(x) = -\frac{10x}{3} - \frac{160}{3} = 0.\]
Solving this we find $x = -\frac{16}{1} = -16$. Substituting $x = -16$ into $y = x + \frac{40}{3}$, we get $y = -16 + \frac{40}{3} = \frac{8}{3}$.

Finally we substitute $x = -16$ and $y = \frac{8}{3}$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to find its minimum value. We get
\[5(-16)^2 + 5\left(\frac{8}{3}\right)^2 - 8(-16)\left(\frac{8}{3}\right) = 1280 + \frac{640}{9} + \frac{1024}{3} = 1280 + \frac{640 + 2048}{9} = 1280 + \frac{2688}{9} = 1280 + \frac{298.666667}{1} = 1280 + 298.666667 = 1578.666667.\]
However, this is not an integer. We must have made a mistake somewhere.

Let's go back and check our algebra. It turns out that we made a mistake when we took the derivative of $f(x)$. The correct derivative is
\[f'(x) = -\frac{10x}{3} - \frac{160}{3} = 0.\]
Solving this we find $x = -\frac{16}{1} = -16$. Substituting $x = -16$ into $y = x + \frac{40}{3}$, we get $y = -16 + \frac{40}{3} = \frac{8}{3}$.

We also made a mistake when we substituted $x = -16$ and $y = \frac{8}{3}$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. The correct calculation is
\[5(-16)^2 + 5\left(\frac{8}{3}\right)^2 - 8(-16)\left(\frac{8}{3}\right) = 1280 + \frac{640}{9} + \frac{1024}{3} = 1280 + \frac{640 + 2048}{9} = 1280 + \frac{2688}{9} = 1280 + 298.\overline{6} = 1578.\overline{6}.\]
This is not an integer either. It seems like we are making a mistake in our calculations.

Let's go back and check our algebraic steps. It turns out that we made a mistake when we substituted $y = x + \frac{40}{3}$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. The correct substitution is
\[5x^2 + 5\left(x + \frac{40}{3}\right)^2 - 8x\left(x + \frac{40}{3}\right).\]
Simplifying this gives
\[5x^2 + 5\left(x^2 + \frac{80x}{3} + \frac{1600}{9}\right) - 8x^2 - \frac{320x}{3} = -\frac{5x^2}{3} - \frac{160x}{3} + \frac{800}{3}.\]
We also made a mistake when we took the derivative of $f(x)$. The correct derivative is
\[f'(x) =

5_**Problem:** 

"For how many positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $1000$ is $(\sin t + i \cos t)^n = \sin nt + i \cos nt$ true for all real $t$"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 

We know by De Moivre's Theorem that $(\cos t + i \sin t)^n = \cos nt + i \sin nt$ for all real numbers $t$ and all integers $n$ .  So, we'd like to somehow convert our given expression into a form from which we can apply De Moivre's Theorem.
Recall the trigonometric identities $\cos \left(\frac{\pi}2 - u\right) = \sin u$ and $\sin \left(\frac{\pi}2 - u\right) = \cos u$ hold for all real $u$ .  If our original equation holds for all $t$ , it must certainly hold for $t = \frac{\pi}2 - u$ .  Thus, the question is equivalent to asking for how many positive integers $n \leq 1000$ we have that $\left(\sin\left(\frac\pi2 - u\right) + i \cos\left(\frac\pi 2 - u\right)\right)^n = \sin n \left(\frac\pi2 -u \right) + i\cos n \left(\frac\pi2 - u\right)$ holds for all real $u$
$\left(\sin\left(\frac\pi2 - u\right) + i \cos\left(\frac\pi 2 - u\right)\right)^n = \left(\cos u + i \sin u\right)^n = \cos nu + i\sin nu$ .  We know that two complex numbers are equal if and only if both their real part and imaginary part are equal.  Thus, we need to find all $n$ such that $\cos n u = \sin n\left(\frac\pi2 - u\right)$ and $\sin nu = \cos n\left(\frac\pi2 - u\right)$ hold for all real $u$
$\sin x = \cos y$ if and only if either $x + y = \frac \pi 2 + 2\pi \cdot k$ or $x - y = \frac\pi2 + 2\pi\cdot k$ for some integer $k$ .  So from the equality of the real parts we need either $nu + n\left(\frac\pi2 - u\right) = \frac\pi 2 + 2\pi \cdot k$ , in which case $n = 1 + 4k$ , or we need $-nu + n\left(\frac\pi2 - u\right) = \frac\pi 2 + 2\pi \cdot k$ , in which case $n$ will depend on $u$ and so the equation will not hold for all real values of $u$ .  Checking $n = 1 + 4k$ in the equation for the imaginary parts, we see that it works there as well, so exactly those values of $n$ congruent to $1 \pmod 4$ work.  There are $\boxed{250}$ of them in the given range. The answer is $\boxed{250}$

**Problem:** 

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 



We start by simplifying the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. 

We know that $|a-b| = |b-a|$, so $|x-2y| = |2x-y|$. This gives us two cases:

1. $x-2y = 2x-y$, which simplifies to $x=y$.
2. $x-2y = -(2x-y)$, which simplifies to $x=3y$.

Now we substitute $x=y$ into the condition: $|x-2x| + |x-2x| = | -x | + | -x | = 2|x| = 40 \implies |x| = 20$. So the pairs $(x, y)$ that satisfy the condition are of the form $(x, x)$ with $|x| = 20$.

Next we substitute $x=3y$ into the condition: $|3y-2y| + |y-6y| = |y| + |-5y| = 6|y| = 40 \implies |y| = \frac{20}{3}$. So the pairs $(x, y)$ that satisfy the condition are of the form $(3y, y)$ with $|\frac{y}{3}| = \frac{20}{3} \implies |y| = 20$.

Now we substitute $x=y$ and $x=3y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. If $x=y$ then the expression simplifies to $5x^2+5x^2-8x^2 = 2x^2$. If $x=3y$ then the expression simplifies to $5(3y)^2+5y^2-8(3y)y = 5*9y^2 + 5y^2 - 24y^2 = 20y^2$.

So the value of the expression is either $2x^2$ or $20y^2$. We know that $|x|=20$ and $|y|=\frac{20}{3}$, so $x^2 = y^2 = 400$. Thus the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is the smaller of the values of $2*400 = 800$ and $20*400 = 8000$. Since $800 < 8000$, the minimum value is $800$. The answer is: $800$

$\left(\sin\left(\frac\pi2 - u\right) + i \cos\left(\frac\pi 2 - u\right)\right)^n = \left(\cos u + i \sin u\right)^n = \cos nu + i\sin nu$ .

**Problem:** 

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 



First, we need to understand the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. This is a bit tricky, so let's try to simplify it. We know that $|a - b| = |b - a|$, so we can rewrite the condition as $|x - 2y| + |2x - y| = 40$. Now, let's consider the two cases:
1. If $x - 2y \ge 0$ and $2x - y \ge 0$, then the condition becomes $x - 2y + 2x - y = 40$, which simplifies to $3x - 3y = 40$.
2. If $x - 2y < 0$ and $2x - y < 0$, then the condition becomes $-(x - 2y) - (2x - y) = 40$, which simplifies to $-3x + 3y = 40$.

These are two linear equations, indicating that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $3x - 3y = 40$ and $-3x + 3y = 40$. These are two parallel lines, and they form a strip between them. The minimum value of the original expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ will occur at the point where the distance from the origin $(0, 0)$ to the line is the shortest. The distance from the origin to the line $ax + by = c$ is given by $|c| / \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$. The distance from the origin to the line $3x - 3y = 40$ is $|40| / \sqrt{3^2 + (-3)^2} = 40 / \sqrt{18} = 40\sqrt{2} / 6 = 20\sqrt{2} / 3$. Similarly, the distance from the origin to the line $-3x + 3y = 40$ is also $20\sqrt{2} / 3$. The minimum value of the given expression will occur at the midpoint of the segment connecting these two lines. The midpoint of the line segment connecting the points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is given by $\left( \frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} \right)$. The midpoint of the line segment connecting the points $(20/3, 0)$ and $(0, 20/3)$ is $\left( \frac{20/3 + 0}{2}, \frac{0 + 20/3}{2} \right) = \left( 10/3, 10/3 \right)$.

Now we need to find the minimum value of the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ at the point $(x, y) = \left( \frac{10}{3}, \frac{10}{3} \right)$. We plug these values into the expression:
\[5 \left( \frac{10}{3} \right)^2 + 5 \left( \frac{10}{3} \right)^2 - 8 \left( \frac{10}{3} \right) \left( \frac{10}{3} \right) = \frac{500}{9} + \frac{500}{9} - \frac{800}{9} = \frac{200}{9}.\]
So the minimum value of the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ under the given condition is $200/9$. The answer is: $\boxed{\frac{200}{9}}$.

"For how many positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $1000$ is $(\sin t + i \cos t)^n = \sin nt + i \cos nt$ true for all real $t$"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 

We know by De Moivre's Theorem that $(\cos t + i \sin t)^n = \cos nt + i \sin nt$ for all real numbers $t$ and all integers $n$ .  So, we'd like to somehow convert our given expression into a form from which we can apply De Moivre's Theorem.
Recall the trigonometric identities $\cos \left(\frac{\pi}2 - u\right) = \sin u$ and $\sin \left(\frac{\pi}2 - u\right) = \cos u$ hold for all real $u$ .  If our original equation holds for all $t$ , it must certainly hold for $t = \frac{\pi}2 - u$ .  Thus, the question is equivalent to asking for how many positive integers $n \leq 1000$ we have that $\left(\sin\left(\frac\pi2 - u\right) + i \cos\left(\frac\pi 2 - u\right)\right)^n = \sin n \left(\frac\pi2 -u \right) + i\cos n \left(\frac\pi2 - u\right)$ holds for all real $u$
$\left(\sin\left(\frac\pi2 - u\right) + i \cos\left(\frac\pi 2 - u\right)\right)^n = \left(\cos u + i \sin u\right)^n = \cos nu + i\sin nu$ .  We know that two complex numbers are equal if and only if both their real part and imaginary part are equal.  Thus, we need to find all $n$ such that $\cos n u = \sin n\left(\frac\pi2 - u\right)$ and $\sin nu = \cos n\left(\frac\pi2 - u\right)$ hold for all real $u$
$\sin x = \cos y$ if and only if either $x + y = \frac \pi 2 + 2\pi \cdot k$ or $x - y = \frac\pi2 + 2\pi\cdot k$ for some integer $k$ .  So from the equality of the real parts we need either $nu + n\left(\frac\pi2 - u\right) = \frac\pi 2 + 2\pi \cdot k$ , in which case $n = 1 + 4k$ , or we need $-nu + n\left(\frac\pi2 - u\right) = \frac\pi 2 + 2\pi \cdot k$ , in which case $n$ will depend on $u$ and so the equation will not hold for all real values of $u$ .

**Problem:** 

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 



First, let's simplify the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. We know that $|a-b| = |b-a|$, so we can rewrite it as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$.

When $x-2y \geq 0$ and $2y-x \geq 0$, we have $x-2y + 2y-x = 40$, which simplifies to $0 = 40$, a contradiction.

When $x-2y < 0$ and $2y-x < 0$, we have $-(x-2y) - (2y-x) = 40$, which simplifies to $-2(x-2y) = 40$, or $x-2y = -20$.

When $x-2y < 0$ and $2y-x \geq 0$, we have $-(x-2y) + (2y-x) = 40$, which simplifies to $-2x+4y = 40$, or $x-2y = -20$.

When $x-2y \geq 0$ and $2y-x < 0$, we have $(x-2y) - (2y-x) = 40$, which simplifies to $2x-4y = 40$, or $x-2y = 20$.

So we have $x-2y = -20$ or $x-2y = 20$. The latter doesn't satisfy the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. 

Therefore, the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ simplifies to $x-2y = -20$. 

Now, let's substitute $y = \frac{x+20}{2}$ into the given expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
\[5x^2+5\left(\frac{x+20}{2}\right)^2-8x\left(\frac{x+20}{2}\right).\]
Simplify the expression:
\[5x^2 + \frac{5(x^2+40x+400)}{4} - 4x^2 - 40x = \frac{5x^2 + 5x^2 + 100x + 2000 - 16x^2 - 160x}{4} = \frac{-x^2 + 60x + 2000}{4}.\]
Now let's denote $f(x) = \frac{-x^2 + 60x + 2000}{4}$. To find the minimum value of $f(x)$, we need to find its critical points. 

Take the derivative of $f(x)$:
\[f'(x) = \frac{-2x + 60}{4} = -\frac{x}{2} + 15.\]
Set $f'(x) = 0$, we get $x = 30$. 

We need to check the endpoints of the domain of $x$, since the problem only requires $x$ and $y$ to be real numbers. When $x = -20$, we have $y = 0$ and $f(-20) = 500$. When $x = 20$, we have $y = 20$ and $f(20) = 500$. When $x = 30$, we have $y = 25$ and $f(30) = 500$. So the minimum value is $500$. 

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $500$. The answer is $\boxed{500}$.

$\left(\sin\left(\frac\pi2 - u\right) + i \cos\left(\frac\pi 2 - u\right)\right)^n = \left(\cos u + i \sin u\right)^n = \cos nu + i\sin nu$ .

**Problem:** 

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 



First, we rewrite the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$.

By the triangle inequality, $|2y-x| + |2x-y| \geq |(2y-x) - (2x-y)| = |y-3x|$, so we have $|y-3x| = 40$.

Now let $A = (3,1)$ and $B = (-3,-1)$ be two points in the plane. 

For any point $(x,y)$, $|y-3x|$ is the distance from $(x,y)$ to the line $y=3x$. 

So the equation $|y-3x| = 40$ describes the set of all points in the plane that are 40 units away from the line $y=3x$.

This set of points can be visualised as two parallel lines, each 20 units away from the line $y=3x$.

Now let's return to the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. 

We can rewrite this as $\frac{1}{2}((x-4y)^2 + (6x-2y)^2)$.

By the triangle inequality, $(x-4y)^2 + (6x-2y)^2 \geq (x-4y + 6x-2y)^2 = (7x-6y)^2$.

So $\frac{1}{2}(7x-6y)^2 \leq \frac{1}{2}((x-4y)^2 + (6x-2y)^2) = 5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.

The minimum value of $(7x-6y)^2$ when $(x,y)$ is restricted to the region defined by $|y-3x| = 40$ is $0$, which occurs when $x= \frac{120}{7}$ and $y= \frac{40}{7}$.

So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\frac{1}{2}(0) = 0$. The answer is : $0$

Thus, the question is equivalent to asking for how many positive integers $n \leq 1000$ we have that $\left(\sin\left(\frac\pi2 - u\right) + i \cos\left(\frac\pi 2 - u\right)\right)^n = \sin n \left(\frac\pi2 -u \right) + i\cos n \left(\frac\pi2 - u\right)$ holds for all real $u$
$\left(\sin\left(\frac\pi2 - u\right) + i \cos\left(\frac\pi 2 - u\right)\right)^n = \left(\cos u + i \sin u\right)^n = \cos nu + i\sin nu$ .  We know that two complex numbers are equal if and only if both their real part and imaginary part are equal.  Thus, we need to find all $n$ such that $\cos n u = \sin n\left(\frac\pi2 - u\right)$ and $\sin nu = \cos n\left(\frac\pi2 - u\right)$ hold for all real $u$
$\sin x = \cos y$ if and only if either $x + y = \frac \pi 2 + 2\pi \cdot k$ or $x - y = \frac\pi2 + 2\pi\cdot k$ for some integer $k$ .  So from the equality of the real parts we need either $nu + n\left(\frac\pi2 - u\right) = \frac\pi 2 + 2\pi \cdot k$ , in which case $n = 1 + 4k$ , or we need $-nu + n\left(\frac\pi2 - u\right) = \frac\pi 2 + 2\pi \cdot k$ , in which case $n$ will depend on $u$ and so the equation will not hold for all real values of $u$ .  Checking $n = 1 + 4k$ in the equation for the imaginary parts, we see that it works there as well, so exactly those values of $n$ congruent to $1 \pmod 4$ work.  There are $\boxed{250}$ of them in the given range. The answer is $\boxed{250}$

**Problem:** 

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 



We first solve the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. We can consider four cases:

1. $x-2y \geq 0$ and $y-2x \geq 0$: In this case, the equation becomes $x-2y + y-2x = 40$, which simplifies to $-x-y = 40$, or $x + y = -40$.

2. $x-2y \geq 0$ and $y-2x < 0$: The equation becomes $x-2y - (y-2x) = 40$, which simplifies to $x-3y = 40$.

3. $x-2y < 0$ and $y-2x \geq 0$: The equation becomes -(x-2y) + y-2x = 40, which simplifies to $-3x + y = 40$.

4. $x-2y < 0$ and $y-2x < 0$: The equation becomes -(x-2y) - (y-2x) = 40, which simplifies to $x + y = -40$.

Comparing these cases, we see that the first case $x + y = -40$ is the only solution that gives real values for $x$ and $y$. We can substitute $y = -40 - x$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:

$$5x^2 + 5(-40-x)^2 - 8x(-40-x).$$

Expanding and simplifying, we get

$$5x^2 + 5(1600 + 80x + x^2) + 320x + 8x^2,$$

which simplifies further to

$$13x^2 + 400x + 8000.$$

To minimize this expression, we can find its derivative and set it equal to zero:

$$26x + 400 = 0.$$

Solving for $x$, we get $x = -\frac{200}{13}$. Substituting this back into $y = -40 - x$, we get $y = -\frac{460}{13}$.

Substituting these values into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get

$$5\left(-\frac{200}{13}\right)^2 + 5\left(-\frac{460}{13}\right)^2 - 8\left(-\frac{200}{13}\right)\left(-\frac{460}{13}\right),$$

which simplifies to $-4000$.

However, this is not the minimum value. The minimum value of a quadratic function $ax^2 + bx + c$ is achieved at $x = -\frac{b}{2a}$. In our case, the quadratic is $13x^2 + 400x + 8000$, so the minimum is achieved at $x = -\frac{400}{2*13} = -\frac{200}{13}$. Substituting this back into the expression, we get

$$13\left(-\frac{200}{13}\right)^2 + 400\left(-\frac{200}{13}\right) + 8000,$$

which simplifies to $-4000$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $-4000$ when $x = -\frac{200}{13}$ and $y = -\frac{460}{13}$, and the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is true for these values of $x$ and $y$. The answer is $\boxed{-4000}$.

"For how many positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $1000$ is $(\sin t + i \cos t)^n = \sin nt + i \cos nt$ true for all real $t$"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 

We know by De Moivre's Theorem that $(\cos t + i \sin t)^n = \cos nt + i \sin nt$ for all real numbers $t$ and all integers $n$ .  So, we'd like to somehow convert our given expression into a form from which we can apply De Moivre's Theorem.
Recall the trigonometric identities $\cos \left(\frac{\pi}2 - u\right) = \sin u$ and $\sin \left(\frac{\pi}2 - u\right) = \cos u$ hold for all real $u$ .  If our original equation holds for all $t$ , it must certainly hold for $t = \frac{\pi}2 - u$ .  Thus, the question is equivalent to asking for how many positive integers $n \leq 1000$ we have that $\left(\sin\left(\frac\pi2 - u\right) + i \cos\left(\frac\pi 2 - u\right)\right)^n = \sin n \left(\frac\pi2 -u \right) + i\cos n \left(\frac\pi2 - u\right)$ holds for all real $u$
$\left(\sin\left(\frac\pi2 - u\right) + i \cos\left(\frac\pi 2 - u\right)\right)^n = \left(\cos u + i \sin u\right)^n = \cos nu + i\sin nu$ .  We know that two complex numbers are equal if and only if both their real part and imaginary part are equal.  Thus, we need to find all $n$ such that $\cos n u = \sin n\left(\frac\pi2 - u\right)$ and $\sin nu = \cos n\left(\frac\pi2 - u\right)$ hold for all real $u$
$\sin x = \cos y$ if and only if either $x + y = \frac \pi 2 + 2\pi \cdot k$ or $x - y = \frac\pi2 + 2\pi\cdot k$ for some integer $k$ .

**Problem:**

Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 



We first solve the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |x-2y + (y-2x)| = |-x-y| = |-(x+y)| = |x+y|$.
So we have $|x+y| = 40$.
Now we want to minimize $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the constraint $|x+y| = 40$.
We can rewrite the expression as $(5x^2-8xy+5y^2) = (x^2-2xy+y^2) + 4(x^2-2xy+4y^2) = (x-y)^2 + 4(x-2y)^2$.
Now let $u = x-y$, then by the constraint $|u| = 40$.
We want to minimize $u^2 + 4(2u)^2 = u^2 + 16u^2 = 17u^2$.
Since $|u| = 40$, we have $u^2 = 1600$, so the minimum value is $17 \cdot 1600 = 27200$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $27200$. The answer is: $27200$

**Problem:** 

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 



First, let's simplify the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. We know that $|a-b| = |b-a|$, so we can rewrite the equation as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$. 

The absolute value function $|a|$ can be expressed as $\sqrt{a^2}$, and the square root function is non-decreasing. This implies that $|a| + |b|$ is minimized when $a$ and $b$ have the same sign. So, we can rewrite the equation as $(x-2y) + (2y-x) = 40$, which simplifies to $0 = 40$. This is a contradiction, so we must have made an error in our reasoning.

The mistake we made is that we assumed that $|a-b| = |b-a|$ implies $|a| + |b|$ is minimized when $a$ and $b$ have the same sign. However, this is not necessarily true. We need to consider both cases separately.

Case 1: If $x-2y \ge 0$ and $2y-x \ge 0$, then the equation $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$ simplifies to $(x-2y) + (2y-x) = 40$, which simplifies to $0 = 40$, a contradiction.

Case 2: If $x-2y < 0$ and $2y-x < 0$, then the equation $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$ simplifies to $-(x-2y) - (2y-x) = 40$, which simplifies to $0 = 40$, a contradiction again.

So, we must consider the case where $x-2y > 0$ and $2y-x > 0$. This means $x > 2y$ and $2y > x$. There's no intersection of these two inequalities. However, we can consider the case where $x-2y \ge 0$ and $2y-x \le 0$, or $x \ge 2y$ and $2y \le x$. We get the following system of inequalities:

\[
\begin{cases}
x \ge 2y \\
2y \le x
\end{cases}
\]

which simplifies to $x = 2y$. Substituting $x = 2y$ into our original equation gives $|2y-2y| + |y-4y| = 40$, which simplifies to $0 + |-3y| = 40$, or $| -3y | = 40$. This gives us $-3y = 40$ or $-3y = -40$. Solving for $y$ gives $y = -\frac{40}{3}$ or $y = \frac{40}{3}$. Since $x = 2y$, this gives us $x = -\frac{80}{3}$ or $x = \frac{80}{3}$.

Now, we substitute these values of $x$ and $y$ into our original expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$:

\[
5\left(-\frac{80}{3}\right)^2 + 5\left(-\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 - 8\left(-\frac{80}{3}\right)\left(-\frac{40}{3}\right)
\]

\[
= 5\left(\frac{6400}{9}\right) + 5\left(\frac{1600}{9}\right) + \frac{32000}{9}
\]

\[
= \frac{32000}{9} + \frac{8000}{9} + \frac{32000}{9}
\]

\[
= \frac{68000}{9}.
\]

So the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is $\frac{68000}{9}$. However, this value doesn't seem right because the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ should be minimized under the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. We must have made a mistake in our reasoning.

Let's go back and look at the original problem again. Instead of trying to minimize $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, let's try to minimize $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ directly. This is a quadratic function with variables $x$ and $y$, so its graph is a paraboloid opening upwards (since the coefficients of $x^2$ and $y^2$ are positive). This means that the minimum value of the function occurs at the vertex of the paraboloid.

To find the vertex, we can take the partial derivatives of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ with respect to $x$ and $y$, set them equal to zero, and solve for $x$ and $y$. The partial derivatives are:

\[
\frac{\partial}{\partial x} (5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy) = 10x - 8y
\]

\[
\frac{\partial}{\partial y} (5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy) = 10y - 8x
\]

Setting these equal to zero gives:

\[
10x - 8y = 0
\]

\[
10y - 8x = 0
\]

Solving this system of equations gives $x = \frac{4}{3}y$. Substituting $x = \frac{4}{3}y$ into our original equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ gives $| \frac{4}{3}y - 2y | + | y - \frac{8}{3}y | = 40$, which simplifies to $\left| -\frac{2}{3}y \right| + \left| -\frac{y}{3} \right| = 40$, or $\frac{2}{3}|y| + \frac{1}{3}|y| = 40$, or $\frac{3}{3}|y| = 40$, or $|y| = 40$. Since $y$ can be positive or negative, this gives $y = 40$ or $y = -40$. Substituting these values into $x = \frac{4}{3}y$ gives $x = \frac{4}{3}(40) = \frac{160}{3}$ or $x = \frac{4}{3}(-40) = -\frac{160}{3}$.

Now, we substitute these values of $x$ and $y$ into our original expression $5x^2 + 5y

"For how many positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $1000$ is $(\sin t + i \cos t)^n = \sin nt + i \cos nt$ true for all real $t$"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 

We know by De Moivre's Theorem that $(\cos t + i \sin t)^n = \cos nt + i \sin nt$ for all real numbers $t$ and all integers $n$ .  So, we'd like to somehow convert our given expression into a form from which we can apply De Moivre's Theorem.
Recall the trigonometric identities $\cos \left(\frac{\pi}2 - u\right) = \sin u$ and $\sin \left(\frac{\pi}2 - u\right) = \cos u$ hold for all real $u$ .  If our original equation holds for all $t$ , it must certainly hold for $t = \frac{\pi}2 - u$ .  Thus, the question is equivalent to asking for how many positive integers $n \leq 1000$ we have that $\left(\sin\left(\frac\pi2 - u\right) + i \cos\left(\frac\pi 2 - u\right)\right)^n = \sin n \left(\frac\pi2 -u \right) + i\cos n \left(\frac\pi2 - u\right)$ holds for all real $u$
$\left(\sin\left(\frac\pi2 - u\right) + i \cos\left(\frac\pi 2 - u\right)\right)^n = \left(\cos u + i \sin u\right)^n = \cos nu + i\sin nu$ .  We know that two complex numbers are equal if and only if both their real part and imaginary part are equal.  Thus, we need to find all $n$ such that $\cos n u = \sin n\left(\frac\pi2 - u\right)$ and $\sin nu = \cos n\left(\frac\pi2 - u\right)$ hold for all real $u$
$\sin x = \cos y$ if and only if either $x + y = \frac \pi 2 + 2\pi \cdot k$ or $x - y = \frac\pi2 + 2\pi\cdot k$ for some integer $k$ .  So from the equality of the real parts we need either $nu + n\left(\frac\pi2 - u\right) = \frac\pi 2 + 2\pi \cdot k$ , in which case $n = 1 + 4k$ , or we need $-nu + n\left(\frac\pi2 - u\right) = \frac\pi 2 + 2\pi \cdot k$ , in which case $n$ will depend on $u$ and so the equation will not hold for all real values of $u$ .  Checking $n = 1 + 4k$ in the equation for the imaginary parts, we see that it works there as well, so exactly those values of $n$ congruent to $1 \pmod 4$ work.  There are $\boxed{250}$ of them in the given range. The answer is $\boxed{250}$

**Problem:** 

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 



First, we simplify the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. We note that $|a| = |-a|$ for all real numbers $a$, so we can replace $|x-2y|$ with $|2y-x|$ and $|y-2x|$ with $|2x-y|$ without changing the equation. Thus, we have $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$.

Next, we use the property of absolute value that $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$. Applying this to our equation gives $|(2y-x) + (2x-y)| = |x+y| = 40$.

Now we simplify the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite it as $5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x-y)^2 + 2xy] - 8xy = 5(x-y)^2 + 3xy$.

We want to minimize this expression. By the Trivial Inequality, $(x-y)^2 \geq 0$ and $xy \geq -\frac{(x+y)^2}{4}$.

Substituting $|x+y| = 40$ into $xy \geq -\frac{(x+y)^2}{4}$ gives $xy \geq -100$.

Substituting these into $5(x-y)^2 + 3xy$ gives $5(x-y)^2 + 3xy \geq 5*0 - 300 = -300$.

Thus, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $-300$. The answer is: $-300$

**Problem:** 

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 



The given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ simplifies to $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$, which implies $|x-2y| = |2y-x| = 20$ or $|x-2y| = |2y-x| = 0$. 

The only solution to $|x-2y| = |2y-x| = 0$ is $x=y$. But this is not useful because it doesn't simplify our expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. 

So let's consider the case where $|x-2y| = |2y-x| = 20$. Without loss of generality, let's assume $x > 2y$. Then $x - 2y = 20$, so $x = 2y + 20$. Substitute this into $|2y-x| = 20$, we get $|2y - (2y + 20)| = | -20| = 20$, which is true. 

Now, substitute $x = 2y + 20$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get 
\[5(2y+20)^2 + 5y^2 - 8y(2y+20) = 20y^2 + 200y + 2000 + 5y^2 - 16y^2 - 160y = 4y^2 + 40y + 2000.\]

Now, let's find the minimum of this expression. It's a quadratic function in $y$, and its graph is a parabola opening upward. The $y$-coordinate of the vertex is $-\frac{b}{2a} = -\frac{40}{2 \cdot 4} = -5$. Substitute $y = -5$ into the expression, we get $4(-5)^2 + 40(-5) + 2000 = 100 - 200 + 2000 = 1900$.

So the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ subject to the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 1900. The answer is: $1900$

## QUESTION 1 - 14 
- TIME_SPENT : 350 secs

14_**Problem:** 

"For how many positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $1000$ is $(\sin t + i \cos t)^n = \sin nt + i \cos nt$ true for all real $t$"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 

We know by De Moivre's Theorem that $(\cos t + i \sin t)^n = \cos nt + i \sin nt$ for all real numbers $t$ and all integers $n$ .  So, we'd like to somehow convert our given expression into a form from which we can apply De Moivre's Theorem.
Recall the trigonometric identities $\cos \left(\frac{\pi}2 - u\right) = \sin u$ and $\sin \left(\frac{\pi}2 - u\right) = \cos u$ hold for all real $u$ .  If our original equation holds for all $t$ , it must certainly hold for $t = \frac{\pi}2 - u$ .  Thus, the question is equivalent to asking for how many positive integers $n \leq 1000$ we have that $\left(\sin\left(\frac\pi2 - u\right) + i \cos\left(\frac\pi 2 - u\right)\right)^n = \sin n \left(\frac\pi2 -u \right) + i\cos n \left(\frac\pi2 - u\right)$ holds for all real $u$
$\left(\sin\left(\frac\pi2 - u\right) + i \cos\left(\frac\pi 2 - u\right)\right)^n = \left(\cos u + i \sin u\right)^n = \cos nu + i\sin nu$ .  We know that two complex numbers are equal if and only if both their real part and imaginary part are equal.  Thus, we need to find all $n$ such that $\cos n u = \sin n\left(\frac\pi2 - u\right)$ and $\sin nu = \cos n\left(\frac\pi2 - u\right)$ hold for all real $u$
$\sin x = \cos y$ if and only if either $x + y = \frac \pi 2 + 2\pi \cdot k$ or $x - y = \frac\pi2 + 2\pi\cdot k$ for some integer $k$ .  So from the equality of the real parts we need either $nu + n\left(\frac\pi2 - u\right) = \frac\pi 2 + 2\pi \cdot k$ , in which case $n = 1 + 4k$ , or we need $-nu + n\left(\frac\pi2 - u\right) = \frac\pi 2 + 2\pi \cdot k$ , in which case $n$ will depend on $u$ and so the equation will not hold for all real values of $u$ .  Checking $n = 1 + 4k$ in the equation for the imaginary parts, we see that it works there as well, so exactly those values of $n$ congruent to $1 \pmod 4$ work.  There are $\boxed{250}$ of them in the given range. The answer is $\boxed{250}$

**Problem:** 

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 



First, we recognize that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|x-2y| + |2x-y| = 40$. 

The Triangle Inequality states that $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$ for all real numbers $a$ and $b$. Therefore, we have $|x-2y| + |2x-y| \geq |x-2y + 2x-y| = |3x-3y| = 3|x-y|$. 

Setting this equal to $40$, we have $3|x-y| = 40$, so $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$.

Now, we substitute $x-y = \frac{40}{3}$ or $x-y = -\frac{40}{3}$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.

If $x-y = \frac{40}{3}$, then $y = x - \frac{40}{3}$ and we can substitute this into the expression to get:
$$5x^2+5\left(x - \frac{40}{3}\right)^2-8x\left(x - \frac{40}{3}\right)$$
$$= 5x^2+5\left(x^2 - \frac{80x}{3} + \frac{1600}{9}\right) - 8x^2 + \frac{320x}{3}$$
$$= 5x^2 + 5x^2 - \frac{400x}{3} + \frac{800}{3} - 8x^2 + \frac{320x}{3}$$
$$= 2x^2 - \frac{80x}{3} + \frac{800}{3}.$$

Differentiating this with respect to $x$ and setting it equal to $0$ gives us:
$$\frac{d}{dx}\left(2x^2 - \frac{80x}{3} + \frac{800}{3}\right) = 4x - \frac{80}{3} = 0,$$
which gives us $x = \frac{20}{3}$.

Substituting $x = \frac{20}{3}$ into $y = x - \frac{40}{3}$ gives us $y = -\frac{20}{3}$.

Substituting $x = \frac{20}{3}$ and $y = -\frac{20}{3}$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ gives us:
$$5\left(\frac{20}{3}\right)^2 + 5\left(-\frac{20}{3}\right)^2 - 8\left(\frac{20}{3}\right)\left(-\frac{20}{3}\right)$$
$$= 5\left(\frac{400}{9}\right) + 5\left(\frac{400}{9}\right) - \frac{3200}{9}$$
$$= \frac{2000}{9} - \frac{3200}{9} = -\frac{1200}{9} = -\frac{400}{3}.$$

Now, if $x-y = -\frac{40}{3}$, then $y = x + \frac{40}{3}$ and we can substitute this into the expression to get:
$$5x^2+5\left(x + \frac{40}{3}\right)^2-8x\left(x + \frac{40}{3}\right)$$
$$= 5x^2+5\left(x^2 + \frac{80x}{3} + \frac{1600}{9}\right) - 8x^2 - \frac{320x}{3}$$
$$= 5x^2 + 5x^2 + \frac{400x}{3} + \frac{800}{3} - 8x^2 - \frac{320x}{3}$$
$$= 2x^2 + \frac{80x}{3} + \frac{800}{3}.$$

Differentiating this with respect to $x$ and setting it equal to $0$ gives us:
$$\frac{d}{dx}\left(2x^2 + \frac{80x}{3} + \frac{800}{3}\right) = 4x + \frac{80}{3} = 0,$$
which gives us $x = -\frac{20}{3}$.

Substituting $x = -\frac{20}{3}$ into $y = x + \frac{40}{3}$ gives us $y = \frac{20}{3}$.

Substituting $x = -\frac{20}{3}$ and $y = \frac{20}{3}$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ gives us:
$$5\left(-\frac{20}{3}\right)^2 + 5\left(\frac{20}{3}\right)^2 - 8\left(-\frac{20}{3}\right)\left(\frac{20}{3}\right)$$
$$= 5\left(\frac{400}{9}\right) + 5\left(\frac{400}{9}\right) + \frac{3200}{9}$$
$$= \frac{2000}{9} + \frac{3200}{9} = \frac{5200}{9}.$$

Comparing the two values we found, $-\frac{400}{3}$ and $\frac{5200}{9}$, the minimum value is $-\frac{400}{3}$. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $-\frac{400}{3}$. The answer is: $-\frac{400}{3}$.
