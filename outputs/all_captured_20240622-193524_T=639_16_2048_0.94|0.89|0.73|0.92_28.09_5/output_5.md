Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The expression equals 0 if any of the terms equals 0. Thus, the four equations are: $|x+y| - 10 = 0$, $|x-y| - 10 = 0$, $|x| - 8 = 0$, and $|y| - 8 = 0$.
2. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.
3. Now we can plot these points on a coordinate plane to visualize the polygon.
4. The polygon is a square with side length 16.
5. The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

The answer is: $256$ square units.
