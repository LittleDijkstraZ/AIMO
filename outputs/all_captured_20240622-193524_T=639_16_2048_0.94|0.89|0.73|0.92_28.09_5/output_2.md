Below is a math problem you are to solve (hint: answer is a natural number):

Problem Statement: "The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Instructions:
- Start with a brief discussion on the theory or mathematical concepts applicable to the problem.
- Break down the problem into manageable parts and describe how each part relates to the theory.
- Apply these concepts step-by-step to solve the problem, citing relevant mathematical laws or theorems.
- Use diagrams or graphs if necessary to illustrate key points or relationships.
- Explain how the solution could be checked for correctness using an alternative method or additional example.
- Conclude with the final answer and a recap of the concepts applied.



Solution:

The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

Let's consider the first term:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0.$$
The square of a real number is zero if and only if the number itself is zero. So, we have:
$$\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad \vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0.$$
This implies that:
$$\vert x + y \vert = 10 \quad \text{and} \quad \vert x - y \vert = 10.$$
The only way both of these equations can hold true is if $x = y = 0$ or $x = -y$. Thus, the points that satisfy the first term are $(0,0)$ and all points of the form $(x, -x)$.

Now, let's consider the second term:
$$((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$
Similarly, this implies that:
$$\vert x \vert = 8 \quad \text{and} \quad \vert y \vert = 8.$$
The only way both of these equations can hold true is if $x = 8$ or $x = -8$ and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. Thus, the points that satisfy the second term are $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

The points that satisfy the given equation are the intersections of the points that satisfy the first term and the points that satisfy the second term. These points are $(0,0)$, $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, and $(-8,8)$. These points form a square with side length 8.

The area of this square is side length squared, so the area is $8^2 = 64$.
The answer is: $64$
