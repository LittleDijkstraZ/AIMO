 This problem is asking for the area of a polygon formed by the points that satisfy the given equation. The equation is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
The equation will be equal to zero if either of the factors is zero. Therefore, we have two cases:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. This gives us a square with side length 20, and its area is $20^2 = 400$.

For the second case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us a square with side length 16, and its area is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares, which is $400 + 256 = 656$.
The answer is: $656$

The given equation is equal to zero if and only if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The absolute values $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ represent the equations of two squares with side length 10 centered at the origin.
The absolute values $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ represent the equations of two squares with side length 8 centered at the origin.
The intersection of these four squares is the convex polygon we are looking for.
The area of a square is given by the square of the side length, so the area of the square with side length 10 is $10^2 = 100$, and the area of the square with side length 8 is $8^2 = 64$.
The intersection of the four squares forms a square with side length equal to the difference of the side lengths of the two squares, which is $10 - 8 = 2$.
The area of this square is $2^2 = 4$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two smaller squares, which is $64 + 4 = 68$.
The answer is: $68$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant: 
Here is the approach:



1. First, we need to realize that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So, we have two cases to consider:
   a) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
   b) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

2. For case a), we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

3. For case b), we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

4. The intersection points of these lines are the vertices of the polygon. We can find these intersection points by solving the equations.

5. To find the area of the polygon, we can divide the polygon into triangles and find the area of each triangle. The area of a triangle with vertices $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$, and $(x_3, y_3)$ is given by $\frac{1}{2} |x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2)|$.

6. Sum the areas of all the triangles to get the total area of the polygon.

Now let's implement this in Python:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solve, Abs, Rational

def area_of_polygon():
    # Define the variables
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # Case a)
    eq1 = Abs(x + y) - 10
    eq2 = Abs(x - y) - 10

    # Solve the equations to get the intersection points
    solutions_a = solve((eq1, eq2), (x, y))

    # Case b)
    eq3 = Abs(x) - 8
    eq4 = Abs(y) - 8

    # Solve the equations to get the intersection points
    solutions_b = solve((eq3, eq4), (x, y))

    # Combine all the solutions
    solutions = solutions_a + solutions_b

    # Calculate the area of the polygon
    area = 0
    for i in range(len(solutions)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(solutions)):
            # Calculate the area of the triangle formed by the points
            area += abs(0.5 * (solutions[i][0] * (solutions[j][1] - solutions[j][1]) + solutions[j][0] * (solutions[i][1] - solutions[i][1]) + solutions[0][0] * (solutions[i][1] - solutions[j][1])))

    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

1340.00000000000

CODE RESULTS 1340.00000000000

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
1340.00000000000

The area of the convex polygon is 1340.
The answer is $\boxed{1340}$.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:


The given equation is $0 = ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$.
This equation is equal to zero if and only if both terms are zero, i.e.,
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0\]
and
\[((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]
The first term is zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies that $x = \pm y$.
The second term is zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that $-8 \le x, y \le 8$.
Therefore, the points that satisfy the equation are those for which $x = \pm y$ and $-8 \le x, y \le 8$.
These points form a square with side length 16, so the area of the convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$

2. The equation is satisfied only when both factors are zero.
3. The first factor is zero when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This forms a square with side length 10 units.
4. The second factor is zero when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This forms a square with side length 16 units.
5. To find the area of the convex polygon, we need to find the area of the intersection of these two squares.
6. The intersection of the two squares forms a square with side length 8 units (the smaller square is completely inside the larger square).
7. To find the area of this square, we square the side length: $8^2 = 64$.

The area of the convex polygon is 64 square units. The answer is: $64$

Here is the approach:



1. We first observe that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to the following system of equations:

   $ (\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 $,
   $ (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 $,
   $ (\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 $,
   $ (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 $.

2. Each of these equations has the form $(\vert z \vert - k)^2 = 0$, where $z$ is a variable and $k$ is a constant. This equation has two solutions: $z = k$ and $z = -k$. So, each of the above equations has two solutions.

3. From the equations $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two lines in the plane.

4. From the equations $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two circles centered at the origin with radius 8.

5. The intersection of these lines and circles gives the vertices of the polygon.

6. To find the area of the polygon, we can calculate the area of the square formed by the vertices $(8,8)$, $(-8,8)$, $(-8,-8)$, and $(8,-8)$, and subtract the areas of the four right triangles formed by the vertices $(8,8)$, $(-8,8)$, $(0,0)$ and $(0,0)$, $(-8,-8)$, $(0,0)$, and $(0,0)$, $(8,-8)$, $(0,0)$, respectively.

7. The side length of the square is $16$, so its area is $256$. Each right triangle has half the area of a rectangle with dimensions $16 \times 16$, so each right triangle has an area of $128$. Since there are four right triangles, their total area is $512$.

8. Therefore, the area of the polygon is $256 - 512 = -256$. However, area cannot be negative. The mistake we made is that we calculated the area of the square and the triangles with respect to the origin, but the vertices of the polygon lie on the lines $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, not on the lines $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. So we need to recompute the area.

9. The lines $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ form a square with side length $20$. The area of this square is $400$. The four right triangles formed by the vertices of the square and the origin each have half the area of a rectangle with dimensions $10 \times 10$, so each triangle has an area of $25$. Since there are four triangles, their total area is $100$.

10. Therefore, the area of the polygon is $400 - 100 = 300$.

The correct answer is $300$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solve, Abs

def calculate_area():
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # The vertices of the polygon are the solutions of the system of equations
    vertices = solve([Abs(x + y) - 10, Abs(x - y) - 10, Abs(x) - 8, Abs(y) - 8])

    # The side length of the square formed by the vertices
    side_length = max(max(abs(vertex[0]) for vertex in vertices), max(abs(vertex[1]) for vertex in vertices)) * 2

    # The area of the square
    area_square = side_length**2

    # The area of the four right triangles
    area_triangles = 4 * 0.5 * side_length**2

    # The area of the polygon
    area_polygon = area_square - area_triangles

    return area_polygon

It seems the code is having some problem with finding the maximum absolute value of x and y from the vertices of the polygon. Let's try to find the maximum absolute values of x and y manually:

The vertices of the polygon are the solutions of the system of equations

\[\begin{cases}
|x + y| = 10 \\
|x - y| = 10 \\
|x| = 8 \\
|y| = 8
\end{cases}\]

From $|x| = 8$, we have $x = 8$ or $x = -8$. Similarly, from $|y| = 8$, we have $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

Now, let's consider the equations $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$. We can try all possible combinations of $x$ and $y$:

- If $x = 8$ and $y = 8$, then $|x + y| = |8 + 8| = 16 \neq 10$ and $|x - y| = |8 - 8| = 0 \neq 10$. This combination does not satisfy the equations.
- If $x = 8$ and $y = -8$, then $|x + y| = |8 - 8| = 0 \neq 10$ and $|x - y| = |8 + 8| = 16 \neq 10$. This combination does not satisfy the equations.
- If $x = -8$ and $y = 8$, then $|x + y| = |-8 + 8| = 0 \neq 10$ and $|x - y| = |-8 - 8| = 16 \neq 10$. This combination does not satisfy the equations.
- If $x = -8$ and $y = -8$, then $|x + y| = |-8 - 8| = 16 \neq 10$ and $|x - y| = |-8 + 8| = 0 \neq 10$. This combination does not satisfy the equations.

Since none of the combinations satisfy the equations, we must have made a mistake in our calculations. Let's go back and recheck our work.

Upon closer inspection, we realize that we made an error when calculating the absolute values of the sums and differences of $x$ and $y$. The correct calculations should be:

- If $x = 8$ and $y = 8$, then $|x + y| = |8 + 8| = 16$ and $|x - y| = |8 - 8| = 0$. This combination does not satisfy the equations.
- If $x = 8$ and $y = -8$, then $|x + y| = |8 - 8| = 0$ and $|x - y| = |8 + 8| = 16$. This combination satisfies the equations.
- If $x = -8$ and $y = 8$, then $|x + y| = |-8 + 8| = 0$ and $|x - y| = |-8 - 8| = 16$. This combination satisfies the equations.
- If $x = -8$ and $y = -8$, then $|x + y| = |-8 - 8| = 16$ and $|x - y| = |-8 + 8| = 0$. This combination does not satisfy the equations.

So, the vertices of the polygon are $(-8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, and their reflections across the origin, i.e., $(8,8)$ and $(-8,-8)$.

Now, let's find the maximum absolute values of $x$ and $y$:

\[\max(|x|) = \max(8, 8, |-8|, |-8|) = 8\]
\[\max(|y|) = \max(8, |-8|, 8, |-8|) = 8\]

Now we can calculate the side length of the square formed by the vertices:

\[side\_length = 2 * \max(|x|, |y|) =

 The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This can only happen if $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$. Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which can only happen if $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Therefore, the points satisfying the equation are $(\pm 10, \pm 10)$ and $(\pm 8, \pm 8)$. These points form a square with side length 20, so the area of the square is $20^2 = 400$.
The answer is: $400$

 The equation $A \cdot B = 0$ is true if and only if $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to the system of equations:
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0,\]
\[((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]
From the first equation, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, -2)$, and $(-8, 2)$.
From the second equation, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$.
The convex polygon formed by the union of these two squares is a 4x4 square, so its area is $4^2 = 16$. The answer is: $16$

 The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. These four equations give us the vertices of a square with side length 20.
Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. These four equations give us the vertices of a square with side length 16.
The intersection of these two squares is a smaller square with side length 8. The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$. So the area of the convex polygon is 64 square units. The answer is: $64$

To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Here is the approach:



1. First, let's understand the equation. The equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.

2. Now, we need to find the solutions of the equations $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$, $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$, and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.

3. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

4. Now, we need to calculate the area of the polygon formed by these vertices. The vertices form a square with side length 16. The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of the polygon is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256.

Here is the python code to calculate the area:
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    # The side length of the square
    side_length = 16
    # The area of the square
    area = side_length**2
    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

256

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is $256$.
The answer is $\boxed{256}$.

Here is the approach:



1. First, we need to understand that the equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ will be true only if each term individually equals to zero.

2. For the first equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, each term will be zero only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us the system of equations $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$. Solving these systems of equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, and $(-5,-5)$.

3. For the second equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, each term will be zero only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us the vertices of the polygon as $(8,0)$, $(0,8)$, $(-8,0)$, and $(0,-8)$.

4. Now we have all the vertices of the polygon, which is a square with side length 10. To find the area of the square, we simply square the side length, so the area is $10^2 = 100$.

Here is the Python code to calculate the area:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def square_area():
    side_length = 10
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = square_area()
print(result)
```

100

The area of the convex polygon is 100 square units. The answer is: $\boxed{100}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if at least one of the factors is equal to zero. This gives us four cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
3. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
4. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For each case, we can find the values of $x$ and $y$ that satisfy the equations, and then plot these points in the coordinate plane to visualize the polygon.

1. For the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$. This gives us the vertices $(8,2)$, $(8,-2)$, $(-8,2)$, and $(-8,-2)$.
2. For the second case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us the vertices $(2,8)$, $(2,-8)$, $(-2,8)$, and $(-2,-8)$.
3. For the third case, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$. This gives us the vertices $(8,2)$, $(8,-2)$, $(-8,2)$, and $(-8,-2)$.
4. For the fourth case, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us the vertices $(2,8)$, $(2,-8)$, $(-2,8)$, and $(-2,-8)$.

From the above analysis, we see that the points satisfying the equation are the vertices of a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$
