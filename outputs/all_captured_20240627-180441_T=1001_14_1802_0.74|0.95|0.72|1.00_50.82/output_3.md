**Problem:** 
"Let $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_ 2= (-16,2).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that
\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as
\[\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1.\]Find $h + k + a + b.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The expression is equal to zero if and only if both factors are zero. This gives us the following four equations:

1. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$
2. $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$
3. $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$
4. $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$

From equations 3 and 4, we have:

5. $x = \pm 8$
6. $y = \pm 8$

From equations 1 and 2, we have:

7. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$
8. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$

By substituting equations 5 and 6 into equations 7 and 8, we can find the possible combinations of x and y:

- If $x = 8$ and $y = 8$, then from equation 7, $\vert 16 \vert = 10$, which is not true.
- If $x = 8$ and $y = -8$, then from equation 7, $\vert 0 \vert = 10$, which is not true.
- If $x = -8$ and $y = 8$, then from equation 7, $\vert 0 \vert = 10$, which is not true.
- If $x = -8$ and $y = -8$, then from equation 7, $\vert -16 \vert = 10$, which is not true.

So, the only possible combination is when $x = 8$ and $y = -8$, or $x = -8$ and $y = 8$. This forms a rectangle with side lengths of 16 and 16, so the area of the rectangle is $16 \times 16 = 256$.

However, this is not the correct answer, as the area of the rectangle formed by the solutions is actually $16 \times 16 = 256$.

Let's analyze the problem further:

The expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the absolute values of the sum and difference of x and y are both 10. The only way this can happen is if $x = 8$ and $y = -8$ or $x = -8$ and $y = 8$. 

The expression $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means that x and y can be either 8 or -8.

Combining these two conditions, we see that the only possible combination is when $x = 8$ and $y = -8$, or $x = -8$ and $y = 8$. This forms a rectangle with side lengths of 16 and 16, so the area of the rectangle is $16 \times 16 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon formed by the points that satisfy the given equation is 256.

The answer is: $256$

**Problem:** 
"Five identical rectangles are arranged to form a larger rectangle $PQRS$, as shown.  The area of $PQRS$ is $4000$.  What is the length, $x$, rounded off to the nearest integer? [asy]

draw(left--right);
label("$x$", (x/2, -0.1), S);

[/asy]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Let $w$ be the width of each of the identical rectangles. Since $PQ=3w$, $RS=2x$ and $PQ=RS$ (because $PQRS$ is a rectangle), then $2x = 3w$, or $$w=\frac{2}{3}x.$$ Therefore, the area of each of the five identical rectangles is $$x\left(\frac{2}{3}x\right)=\frac{2}{3}x^2.$$ Since the area of $PQRS$ is 4000 and it is made up of five of these identical smaller rectangles, then $$5\left(\frac{2}{3}x^2\right)=4000$$ or $$\frac{10}{3}x^2 = 4000$$ or $x^2 = 1200$ or $x \approx 34.6$ which, when rounded off to the nearest integer, is $\boxed{35}.$ The answer is $\boxed{35}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


This problem is a bit complex and requires knowledge of absolute value and inequalities. However, we can start by analyzing the given equation. The equation is equal to zero if and only if both of the factors are equal to zero. This gives us the following four equations:

1. $|x + y| - 10 = 0 \Rightarrow |x + y| = 10$.
2. $|x - y| - 10 = 0 \Rightarrow |x - y| = 10$.
3. $|x| - 8 = 0 \Rightarrow |x| = 8$.
4. $|y| - 8 = 0 \Rightarrow |y| = 8$.

The solutions to $|x + y| = 10$ are given by the lines $y = -x + 10$ and $y = -x - 10$. The solutions to $|x - y| = 10$ are given by the lines $y = x + 10$ and $y = x - 10$. The solutions to $|x| = 8$ are given by the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$. The solutions to $|y| = 8$ are given by the lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

Plotting these lines on a coordinate plane, we find that they form a square with side length $20$. Therefore, the area of the square is $20^2 = 400$. The answer is: 400

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many square units are in the area of the triangle whose vertices are the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the curve $y = (x-3)^2 (x+2)$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we need to find where this curve intersects the $x$ and $y$ axes.  If $y=0$, then $(x-3)^2(x+2)=0$, which has solutions of $x=3$ and $x=-2$.  If $x=0$, then $y=(-3)^2(2)=18$.  So, the curve has two $x$-intercepts and one $y$-intercept.  The length of the base along the $x$-axis is $3-(-2)=5$.  The height from this base is equal to the $y$-intercept, 18.  The area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 5\cdot 18=\boxed{45}$. The answer is $\boxed{45}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we can use the properties of absolute value and the principle of zero products. The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.

Let's consider the first expression: $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$. This expression is zero only when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these two equations are the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ and their reflections across the coordinate axes. These lines form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

Now let's consider the second expression: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This expression is zero only when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$, and the lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

However, the points that satisfy both expressions are the points that lie on the intersection of the two squares, which is a smaller square with side length 8. The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points that satisfy the given equation is $64$.
The answer is: $\boxed{64}$

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The expression $A = ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to 0 if and only if at least one of the factors is equal to 0.

2. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

3. These equations simplify to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

4. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(8,0)$, $(-8,0)$, $(0,8)$, and $(0,-8)$.

5. These points form a square with side length 16.

6. The area of a square is given by the formula $side^2$, so the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

The answer is: $256$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"An ellipse is defined parametrically by
\[(x,y) = \left( \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t}, \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t} \right).\]Then the equation of the ellipse can be written in the form
\[Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0,\]where $A,$ $B,$ $C,$ $D,$ $E,$ and $F$ are integers, and $\gcd(|A|,|B|,|C|,|D|,|E|,|F|) = 1.$  Find $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F|.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
In the equation $y = \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\cos t$ to get
\[\cos t = \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3}.\]In the equation $x = \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\sin t$ to get
\[\sin t = \frac{1}{2} x (2 - \cos t) + 1 = \frac{1}{2} x \left( 2 - \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right) + 1 = 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)}.\]Since $\cos^2 t + \sin^2 t = 1,$
\[\left( \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right)^2 + \left( 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)} \right)^2 = 1.\]Multiplying both sides by $(2(y + 3))^2$ and expanding, it will simplify to
\[81x^2 - 36xy + 16y^2 - 108x + 240y + 900 = 0.\]Therefore, $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F| = 81 + 36 + 16 + 108 + 240 + 900 = \boxed{1381}.$ The answer is $\boxed{1381}$

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Let $w$ be the width of each of the identical rectangles. Since $PQ=3w$, $RS=2x$ and $PQ=RS$ (because $PQRS$ is a rectangle), then $2x = 3w$, or $$w=\frac{2}{3}x.$$ Therefore, the area of each of the five identical rectangles is $$x\left(\frac{2}{3}x\right)=\frac{2}{3}x^2.$$ Since the area of $PQRS$ is 4000 and it is made up of five of these identical smaller rectangles, then $$5\left(\frac{2}{3}x^2\right)=4000$$ or $$\frac{10}{3}x^2 = 4000$$ or $x^2 = 1200$ or $x \approx 34.6$ which, when rounded off to the nearest integer, is $\boxed{35}.$ The answer is $\boxed{35}$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, -2)$, and $(-8, 2)$.

Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So the vertices of the square are also $(8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(8, -8)$.

The intersection of these two squares is a smaller square with side length 4 and vertices at $(4, 6)$, $(4, -6)$, $(-4, -6)$, and $(-4, 6)$. The area of this square is $4^2 = 16$.

The area of the convex polygon is therefore 16.

**Solution:** 


This problem requires a careful understanding of absolute value and how it affects the geometry of the region defined by the equation. The equation is a product of two terms, each of which is a sum of squares of absolute values. Each term is zero if and only if the absolute value inside is zero.

For the first term, $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ implies $|x+y| = 10$, which means $x+y = 10$ or $x+y = -10$. Similarly, $|x-y| - 10 = 0$ implies $x-y = 10$ or $x-y = -10$. This gives us a total of four lines in the plane: $x+y = 10$, $x+y = -10$, $x-y = 10$, and $x-y = -10$. These lines divide the plane into 9 regions.

For the second term, $|x| - 8 = 0$ implies $|x| = 8$, which means $x = 8$ or $x = -8$. Similarly, $|y| - 8 = 0$ implies $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. This gives us a total of 4 more lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines further divide the plane into 16 smaller regions.

The intersection of these lines defines the vertices of the polygon. By calculating the intersections, we find that the polygon is a square with side length 16 units. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: 256

To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


The problem asks for the area of a convex polygon formed by the points that satisfy the given equation. The equation is:
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]

A product of two terms is zero if and only if at least one of the terms is zero. Therefore, the given equation is satisfied if either:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, or
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

Each of these four equations is equivalent to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The first two equations represent two pairs of parallel lines, $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$.

The second two equations represent two pairs of parallel lines, $x = 8$ and $x = -8$, $y = 8$ and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length $16$.

The total area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of these two squares. The area of a square with side length $a$ is $a^2$, so the total area is $(10\sqrt{2})^2 + 16^2 = 200 + 256 = 456$.

However, this is not the correct answer. The two squares intersect in a smaller square with side length $8$. We need to subtract the area of this square from our previous result. The area of the smaller square is $8^2 = 64$.

So the area of the convex polygon is $456 - 64 = 392$.
The answer is: $\boxed{392}$.

Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,
\begin{align*}

\end{align*}From the given condition, we have equality, so by the equality condition for Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[\frac{1 - x_1}{1} = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{1} = \frac{x_2 - x_3}{1} = \dots = \frac{x_9 - x_{10}}{1} = \frac{x_{10}}{1}.\]Let
\[d = 1 - x_1 = x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_3 = \dots = x_9 - x_{10} = x_{10}.\]Then
\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so
\[(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_{10}) = \left( \frac{10}{11}, \frac{9}{11}, \frac{8}{11}, \dots, \frac{1}{11} \right).\]In particular, there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Solution:** 


This problem involves understanding the properties of absolute values and how they relate to the square of absolute values. The equation involves the product of two terms, each of which is a squared absolute value minus a constant. The product equals zero if either of the terms equals zero.

1. The term $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ equals zero when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$. These are two lines in the plane.
2. The term $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ equals zero when $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$. These are also two lines in the plane.
3. The term $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ equals zero when $\vert x \vert = 8$, which implies $x = 8$ or $x = -8$. These are two vertical lines in the plane.
4. The term $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2$ equals zero when $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. These are two horizontal lines in the plane.

The points satisfying the equation are therefore the intersections of these lines. These intersections form a rectangle with side lengths 16 and 20. The area of this rectangle is $16 \times 20 = 320$. The answer is: $320$

\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so
\[(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_{10}) = \left( \frac{10}{11}, \frac{9}{11}, \frac{8}{11}, \dots, \frac{1}{11} \right).\]In particular, there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. This gives us four cases to consider:

1. $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x - y| - 10 = 0$.
2. $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x| - 8 = 0$.
3. $|x - y| - 10 = 0$ and $|y| - 8 = 0$.
4. $|x| - 8 = 0$ and $|y| - 8 = 0$.

Let's consider each case:

1. If $|x + y| - 10 = 0$, then $|x + y| = 10$, which implies $x + y = \pm 10$. Similarly, if $|x - y| - 10 = 0$, then $|x - y| = 10$, which implies $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these two equations simultaneously gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, and $(0, -10)$.

2. If $|x + y| - 10 = 0$, then $|x + y| = 10$, which implies $x + y = \pm 10$. If $|x| - 8 = 0$, then $|x| = 8$, which implies $x = \pm 8$. Combining these two equations gives us two lines: $x = 8$ and $x = -8$. These lines intersect with the rectangle formed in case 1, resulting in two smaller rectangles.

3. Similarly to case 2, if $|x - y| - 10 = 0$, then $|x - y| = 10$, which implies $x - y = \pm 10$. If $|y| - 8 = 0$, then $|y| = 8$, which implies $y = \pm 8$. Combining these two equations gives us two lines: $y = 8$ and $y = -8$. These lines intersect with the rectangle formed in case 1, resulting in two smaller rectangles.

4. If $|x| - 8 = 0$, then $|x| = 8$, which implies $x = \pm 8$. If $|y| - 8 = 0$, then $|y| = 8$, which implies $y = \pm 8$. This case simply gives us the rectangle formed in case 1.

In conclusion, the points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying the given equation enclose a rectangle with vertices at $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, and $(0, -10)$, which has a side length of 20 units. The area of this rectangle is $20 \times 20 = 400$.

The answer is: $400$
