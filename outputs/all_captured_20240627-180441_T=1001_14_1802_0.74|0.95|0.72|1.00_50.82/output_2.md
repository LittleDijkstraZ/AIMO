**Problem:** 
"For certain ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ of real numbers, the system of equations
\[\begin{aligned} ax+by&=1 \\ x^2 + y^2 &= 50  \end{aligned}\]has at least one solution, and each solution is an ordered pair $(x,y)\,$ of integers. How many such ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ are there?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The graph of $ax+by=1$ is a line, while the graph of $x^2+y^2=50$ is a circle centered at the origin. Therefore, $(a, b)$ satisfies the conditions if and only if the line and circle intersect at least once, and they intersect only at lattice points (points with integer coordinates).

Knowing this, it makes sense to look for lattice points on the circle whose equation is $x^2+y^2=50$. Testing cases, we find that there are twelve lattice points on the circle: $(\pm 1, \pm 7)$, $(\pm 7, \pm 1)$, and $(\pm 5, \pm 5)$ (where the two $\pm$ signs in each pair are independent of each other).

There are $\tbinom{12}{2} = 66$ pairs of these points, and each pair determines a line. However, the graph of $ax+by=1$ can never pass through the origin $(0, 0)$, since if $x=y=0$, then $ax+by=0 \neq 1$. Therefore, the six pairs which consist of diametrically opposed points are invalid, since the line through them passes through the origin. This corrects our count to $66 - 6 = 60$.

In addition, for each of the twelve points, there is a line tangent to the circle at that point, so that the only solution to the system is that one point. This brings the final total to $60 + 12 = \boxed{72}$. The answer is $\boxed{72}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



To solve this problem, we need to understand the properties of the absolute value function and the number of solutions it can have.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can have at most 4 distinct solutions. The double absolute value function will create 3 "pieces" of the graph, each of which is a line segment.

The number of solutions to this equation is equal to the number of times the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ intersects the graph of the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$.

We can start by drawing the graph of the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. The function is equal to 0 when $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$, which gives us two solutions: $x=3$ and $x=-1$. So the graph starts at $(3,0)$ and ends at $(-1,0)$.

The graph is a V-shape with the vertex at $(1,2)$. The slope of the two line segments on either side of the vertex is -1.

Now we want to find the values of $m$ such that the line $y=\frac{m}{100}$ intersects this graph exactly 4 times. This can happen in two ways:

1. The line intersects the graph at the vertex and at one of the endpoints. In this case, the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be between 0 and 2 (the height of the vertex), so $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. This gives us $0 < m < 200$.

2. The line intersects the graph at two points, one between the vertex and the midpoint of the segment connecting the vertex and an endpoint, and the other between the midpoint and the other endpoint. In this case, the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal to 2, so $m=200$.

So the values of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions are those in the interval $(0, 200]$ and the single value $m=200$. There are $200$ positive integers in this interval. So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is $200+1=201$.

However, we have made a mistake in our reasoning. The values of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions are those in the interval $(0, 200)$. So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is $200$.

The value of m for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 200. So the number of positive integers m for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 1.

The value of m for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 200. So the number of positive integers m for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 1.

The value of m for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 200. So the number of positive integers m for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 1.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. 

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can have at most 4 distinct solutions because the expression on the left side can have at most 4 different values. 

The expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ takes on the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ exactly 4 times when $m$ is an integer from 1 to 100. 

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 100.

However, the problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$. The value of $m$ cannot be greater than 100 in this case, because if $m$ is greater than 100, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can never be true.

So the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition is 100.

Here is a Python program that calculates the number of positive integers $m$:

```python

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let \[f(x) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
-x + 3 & \text{if } x \le 0, \\
2x - 5 & \text{if } x > 0.
\end{array}
\right.\]How many solutions does the equation $f(f(x)) = 4$ have?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
To solve the equation $f(f(x)) = 4,$ we first find the values $x$ such that $f(x) = 4.$

Either $f(x) = -x + 3$ (for $x \le 0$) or $f(x) = 2x - 5$ (for $x > 0$). If $-x + 3 = 4,$ then $x = -1.$ Note that this value satisfies $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = 4,$ then $x = 9/2.$ Note that this value satisfies $x > 0.$ Therefore, the solutions to $f(x) = 4$ are $x = -1$ and $x = 9/2.$

Next, we solve for the values $x$ such that $f(x) = -1.$ If $-x + 3 = -1,$ then $x = 4.$ This value does not satisfy $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = -1,$ then $x = 2.$ This value satisfies $x > 0.$

Finally, we solve for the values $x$ such that $f(x) = 9/2.$ If $-x + 3 = 9/2,$ then $x = -3/2.$ This value satisfies $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = 9/2,$ then $x = 19/4.$ This value satisfies $x > 0.$

Therefore, the equation $f(f(x)) = 4$ has the solutions $x = 2,$ $-3/2,$ and $19/4,$ for a total of $\boxed{3}$ solutions. The answer is $\boxed{3}$

**Solution:**


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions, it means that $\frac{m}{100}$ is the distance between the two "pieces" of the absolute value function, which are the lines $y=\vert x-1\vert -2$. The distance between these two lines is equal to $\frac{m}{100}$. The lines $y=\vert x-1\vert -2$ are $y=-x+3$ when $x<1$ and $y=x-3$ when $x>1$. The distance between these two lines is $2$, so $\frac{m}{100}=2$, which implies $m=200$. Therefore, the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $200$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many distinct solutions are there to the equation $|x-7| = |x+1|$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
If $|x-7| = |x+1|$, then either $x-7 = x+1$ or $x-7 = -(x+1)$.  Simplifying $x-7=x+1$ gives $0=8$, which has no solutions, so no values of $x$ satisfy $x-7 = x+1$.  If $x-7 = -(x+1)$, then $x-7 = -x-1$, so $2x = 6$, which gives $x=3$.  So, there is $\boxed{1}$ solution.

Challenge: See if you can find a quick solution to this problem by simply thinking about the graphs of $y=|x-7|$ and $y=|x+1|$. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Solution:** 


The problem asks us to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions.

We know that the right-hand side of the equation is always positive, so $\frac{m}{100} > 0$, which implies $m > 0$. Also, the absolute value of the left-hand side is at most 2, so $\frac{m}{100} \leq 2$, which implies $m \leq 200$. Therefore, $m$ is a positive integer between 1 and 200.

Now, we need to find the number of values of $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions. We can do this by plotting the left-hand side of the equation and counting the number of times it intersects the line $y=\frac{m}{100}$.

The left-hand side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, is a piecewise function that takes the value 0 at $x=1$, 1 at $x=3$, 2 at $x=5$, and 1 at $x=7$, and then repeats this pattern. The line $y=\frac{m}{100}$ intersects this function at four distinct points when $\frac{m}{100}$ is in the interval (0, 1). This occurs when $0 < m < 100$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ between 1 and 100 is 100.

So, there are 100 values of $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions. The answer is: $100$

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we need to find the value of $m$ for which the equation $| |x-1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions. 

First, we can analyze the equation $| |x-1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$. This equation has four distinct solutions if and only if the right side $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $2$. This is because the function $| |x-1| - 2|$ is a triangular wave that oscillates between $-2$ and $2$, and it takes the value of $2$ exactly once in each complete cycle.

So, we need to solve the equation $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. Multiplying both sides by $100$ gives $m = 200$.

So, the only positive integer value of $m$ for which the equation $| |x-1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions is $m = 200$.

Therefore, the value of $m$ is $200$. The answer is: $200$

Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**

Any solution to this equation must make the numerator of the left-hand side zero, while keeping the denominator non-zero. The numerator is zero when $x$ is one of the numbers $1, 2, 3, \dots, 100.$ However, for any value in this list that is a perfect square, the denominator will also be zero, so that value of $x$ will not be a root. Therefore, we want to find the number of integers in the list $1, 2, \dots, 100$ which are not perfect squares. The perfect squares in the list are $1^2, 2^2, \dots, 10^2,$ so there are $10$ perfect squares, and \[100 - 10 = \boxed{90}\]integers which are not perfect squares. The answer is $\boxed{90}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We need to find how many values of $m$ make the equation $| |x-1| -2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ have 4 distinct solutions.
2. This equation is equivalent to two cases: $|x-1| -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ or $-(|x-1| -2) = \frac{m}{100}$.
3. Simplify the equations to get $|x-1| = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $|x-1| = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ respectively.
4. These equations can be further broken down into four separate equations: $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, $x-1 = -2 - \frac{m}{100}$, $-(x-1) = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, and $-(x-1) = -2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
5. Solving these equations, we get four solutions for $x$: $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$, $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$, $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$, and $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
6. For the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, the solutions must not overlap. This means that the absolute value of the difference between any two consecutive solutions must be greater than 2.
7. Checking the differences, we find that the only way to avoid overlap is when $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$.
8. Solving the inequality $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, we get $0 < m < 200$.
9. The number of positive integer solutions for $m$ in this interval is 199.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $| |x-1| -2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 199. The answer is: $199$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let \[f(x) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
-x + 3 & \text{if } x \le 0, \\
2x - 5 & \text{if } x > 0.
\end{array}
\right.\]How many solutions does the equation $f(f(x)) = 4$ have?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
To solve the equation $f(f(x)) = 4,$ we first find the values $x$ such that $f(x) = 4.$

Either $f(x) = -x + 3$ (for $x \le 0$) or $f(x) = 2x - 5$ (for $x > 0$). If $-x + 3 = 4,$ then $x = -1.$ Note that this value satisfies $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = 4,$ then $x = 9/2.$ Note that this value satisfies $x > 0.$ Therefore, the solutions to $f(x) = 4$ are $x = -1$ and $x = 9/2.$

Next, we solve for the values $x$ such that $f(x) = -1.$ If $-x + 3 = -1,$ then $x = 4.$ This value does not satisfy $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = -1,$ then $x = 2.$ This value satisfies $x > 0.$

Finally, we solve for the values $x$ such that $f(x) = 9/2.$ If $-x + 3 = 9/2,$ then $x = -3/2.$ This value satisfies $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = 9/2,$ then $x = 19/4.$ This value satisfies $x > 0.$

Therefore, the equation $f(f(x)) = 4$ has the solutions $x = 2,$ $-3/2,$ and $19/4,$ for a total of $\boxed{3}$ solutions. The answer is $\boxed{3}$
