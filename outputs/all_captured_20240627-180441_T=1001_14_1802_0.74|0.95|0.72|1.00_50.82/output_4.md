**Problem:** 
"We define a function $f(x)$ such that $f(14)=7$, and if there exists an integer $a$ such that $f(a)=b$, then $f(b)$ is defined and

$f(b)=3b+1$ if $b$ is odd

$f(b)=\frac{b}{2}$ if $b$ is even.

What is the smallest possible number of integers in the domain of $f$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Since $f(14)=7$, we know that $f(7)$ is defined, and it must equal $22$.  Similarly, we know that $f(22)$ is defined, and it must equal $11$.  Continuing on this way,  \begin{align*}
f(11)&=34\\
f(34)&=17\\
f(17)&=52\\
f(52)&=26\\
f(26)&=13\\
f(13)&=40\\
f(40)&=20\\
f(20)&=10\\
f(10)&=5\\
f(5)&=16\\
f(16)&=8\\
f(8)&=4\\
f(4)&=2\\
f(2)&=1\\
f(1)&=4
\end{align*}We are now in a cycle $1$, $4$, $2$, $1$, and so on.  Thus there are no more values which need to be defined, as there is no $a$ currently defined for which $f(a)$ is a $b$ not already defined.  Thus the minimum number of integers we can define is the number we have already defined, which is $\boxed{18}$. The answer is $\boxed{18}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



First, we can start by calculating the first few values of the function $f$ using the given equations. We know that $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$, so $f(f(1))=1$ and $f(1)=1$. Then, using the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can find $f(2)=2f(1)+1=3$. Continuing this way, we can find $f(3)=1$, $f(4)=5$, $f(5)=1$, and so on.

After finding the first few values of the function, we can observe a pattern. It seems that $f(n)=1$ for odd $n$ and $f(n)=2n-1$ for even $n$. We can prove this by induction.

Base case: For $n=1$, $f(1)=1$, which satisfies the pattern.

Inductive step: Assume that for some even $k$, $f(k)=2k-1$. Then $f(k+1)=f(2*\frac{k+1}{2})=2f(\frac{k+1}{2})+1=2(\frac{k+1}{2}-1)+1=k$. So, if $f(k)=2k-1$, then $f(k+1)=k$, which means the pattern holds for odd $k+1$.

Similarly, assume that for some odd $k$, $f(k)=1$. Then $f(k+1)=f(2*\frac{k+1}{2})=2f(\frac{k+1}{2})+1=2*0+1=1$. So, if $f(k)=1$, then $f(k+1)=1$, which means the pattern holds for even $k+1$.

Thus, by induction, the pattern $f(n)=1$ for odd $n$ and $f(n)=2n-1$ for even $n$ holds for all $n$.

Now, we can calculate $f(100)$. Since $100$ is even, $f(100)=2*100-1=199$.

So, the value of $f(100)$ is $199$. The answer is $\boxed{199}$.

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



First, let's define a function $f$ that satisfies the given conditions:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

def find_f():
    # Define the variable
    n = symbols('n')

    # Define the function f(n)
    f_n = 2*n - 1

    # Check if f(f(f(n))) equals to 8n - 7
    check_equation = Eq(f_n.subs(n, f_n.subs(n, f_n)), 8*n - 7)

    # Check if f(2n) equals to 2f(n) + 1
    check_equation_2 = Eq(f_n.subs(n, 2*n), 2*f_n + 1)

    # If both equations are true, return the function f(n)
    if check_equation and check_equation_2:
        return f_n

f = find_f()
print(f)
```

CODE RESULTS 2*n - 1

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
2*n - 1
```
The function $f(n)$ that satisfies the given conditions is $f(n) = 2n - 1$.
Now, we can find $f(100)$ by substituting $n = 100$ into the function:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def find_f_100():
    # Substitute n = 100 into the function f(n)
    f_100 = f.subs(n, 100)

    return f_100

f_100 = find_f_100()
print(f_100)
```

```
Oops, there was a mistake. We defined $f(n) = 2n - 1$, but we didn't define $n$. Let's correct that:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols

def find_f():
    # Define the variable
    n = symbols('n')

    # Define the function f(n)
    f_n = 2*n - 1

    # Check if f(f(f(n))) equals to 8n - 7
    check_equation = Eq(f_n.subs(n, f_n.subs(n, f_n)), 8*n - 7)

    # Check if f(2n) equals to 2f(n) + 1
    check_equation_2 = Eq(f_n.subs(n, 2*n), 2*f_n + 1)

    # If both equations are true, return the function f(n)
    if check_equation and check_equation_2:
        return f_n

f = find_f()
print(f)
```

CODE RESULTS 2*n - 1

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
2*n - 1
```
The function $f(n)$ that satisfies the given conditions is $f(n) = 2n - 1$.
Now, we can find $f(100)$ by substituting $n = 100$ into the function:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def find_f_100():
    # Define the variable
    n = symbols('n')

    # Substitute n = 100 into the function f(n)
    f_100 = f.subs(n, 100)

    return f_100

f_100 = find_f_100()
print(f_100)
```

CODE RESULTS 199

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
199
```
The value of $f(100)$ is 199.
The answer is: $\boxed{199}$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"The function $f$ is defined on the set of integers and satisfies \[f(n)= \begin{cases}  n-3 & \mbox{if }n\ge 1000 \\  f(f(n+5)) & \mbox{if }n<1000. \end{cases}\]Find $f(84)$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Denote by (1) and (2) the two parts of the definition of $f$, respectively. If we begin to use the definition of $f$ to compute $f(84)$, we use (2) until the argument is at least $1000$: \[f(84) = f(f(89)) = f(f(f(94))) = \dots = f^N(1004)\](where $f^N$ denotes composing $f$ with itself $N$ times, for some $N$). The numbers $84, 89, 94, \dots, 1004$ form an arithmetic sequence with common difference $5$; since $1004 - 84 = 920 = 184 \cdot 5$, this sequence has $184 + 1 = 185$ terms, so $N = 185$.

At this point, (1) and (2) are both used: we compute \[\begin{aligned} f^N(1004) &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-1}(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-1}(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(1000) \\ &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(997) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1002) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(999) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1004). \end{aligned}\]Repeating this process, we see that \[f^N(1004) = f^{N-2}(1004) = f^{N-4}(1004) = \dots = f^3(1004).\](The pattern breaks down for $f^k(1004)$ when $k$ is small, so it is not true that $f^3(1004) = f(1004)$.) Now, we have \[f^3(1004) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^2(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^2(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(1000) \stackrel{(1)}{=} \boxed{997}.\] The answer is $\boxed{997}$

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



1. First, let's set $n = 1$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to get $f(f(f(1)))=8 \cdot 1 - 7 = 1$.
2. Since $f(f(f(1)))=1$, we know that $f(1)$ is the value that makes $f(f(x)) = 1$. Let's substitute $x = f(1)$ into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ and get $f(2 \cdot f(1)) = 2f(f(1)) + 1 = 2 \cdot 1 + 1 = 3$.
3. But we also know that $f(2 \cdot f(1)) = f(2) = 3$. So we have $f(2) = 3$.
4. Now let's substitute $n = 2$ into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to get $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2 \cdot 3 + 1 = 7$.
5. We can continue this process to find $f(8) = 15$, $f(16) = 31$, and so on. We notice that $f(2^k) = 2^k - 1$ for all positive integers $k$.
6. Now let's substitute $n = 100$ into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We get $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$.
7. We also know that $f(200) = f(2 \cdot 100) = f(2^2 \cdot 50) = f(2^3 \cdot 25) = f(2^4 \cdot 12.5)$, but $12.5$ is not an integer, so we cannot directly use the result $f(2^k) = 2^k - 1$.
8. However, we can use the fact that $f(2^4 \cdot 12.5) = f(2^4 \cdot (12 + 0.5)) = f(2^4 \cdot 12) \cdot f(2^4 \cdot 0.5)$.
9. We already know that $f(2^4 \cdot 12) = f(16 \cdot 12) = f(192) = 192 - 1 = 191$.
10. And $f(2^4 \cdot 0.5) = f(\sqrt{2^4} \cdot \sqrt{0.5}) = f(2^2 \cdot \sqrt{0.25}) = f(4 \cdot 0.5) = f(2) = 3$.
11. So $f(2^4 \cdot 12.5) = 191 \cdot 3 = 573$.
12. Finally, we substitute this into the equation $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$ to get $573 = 2f(100) + 1$, and solve for $f(100)$ to get $f(100) = \frac{573 - 1}{2} = 286$.

So, the value of $f(100)$ is $286$.
The answer is: $286$

**Problem:** 
"The function $f(n)$ is defined on the positive integers such that $f(f(n)) = 2n$ and $f(4n + 1) = 4n + 3$ for all positive integers $n.$  Find $f(1000).$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Consider the expression $f(f(f(a))).$  Since $f(f(a)) = 2a,$ this is equal to $f(2a).$  But taking $n = f(a)$ in $f(f(n)) = 2n,$ we get
\[f(f(f(a))) = 2f(a).\]Hence,
\[f(2a) = 2f(a)\]for all positive integers $a.$

Then
\[f(1000) = 2f(500) = 4f(250) = 8f(125).\]Taking $n = 31$ in $f(4n + 1) = 4n + 3,$ we get
\[f(125) = 127,\]so $f(1000) = \boxed{1016}.$ The answer is $\boxed{1016}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
**Problem**
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


To solve this problem, we can start by analyzing the second condition, $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. This implies that the function $f$ is an increasing function.

Now let's consider the first condition, $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. This implies that the function $f$ is a three-cycle function.

Since we are looking for $f(100)$, we can start by calculating $f(f(100))$. From the second condition, we have $f(2*100)=2f(100)+1$, which simplifies to $f(200)=2f(100)+1$.

Now we need to find $f(200)$ in terms of $f(100)$. From the first condition, we have $f(f(f(100)))=8*100-7=793$. Since $f(f(200))=793$, we can substitute $f(200)=2f(100)+1$ into this equation to get $f(f(2f(100)+1))=793$.

Now we need to solve this equation for $f(100)$. This can be done by iterating the function $f$ three times. Let's denote $x=f(100)$. Then we have $f(2x+1)=793$.

We can continue to iterate the function $f$ to find $f(x)$. After three iterations, we get $x=f(f(f(x)))$. Substituting $x=f(100)$, we have $f(100)=f(f(f(100)))$. From the first condition, we know that $f(f(f(100)))=8*100-7=793$.

So we have $f(100)=793$. However, this doesn't seem to be a valid value for $f(100)$ because it should be a natural number. Let's try to find a pattern in the function $f$.

From the second condition, we have $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. This implies that $f(n)$ is an odd function. Also, from the first condition, we have $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. This implies that $f$ is a three-cycle function.

Combining these two conditions, we can deduce that $f(n)$ is an odd three-cycle function. This means that $f(n)$ is an odd function and $f(f(f(n)))=n$.

Now let's try to find a function $f(n)$ that satisfies these conditions. One possible function is $f(n)=\frac{8n-1}{3}$. We can verify that this function satisfies both conditions:

For the first condition, $f(f(f(n)))=f(f(\frac{8n-1}{3}))=f(\frac{8(\frac{8n-1}{3})-1}{3})=\frac{8(\frac{8(\frac{8n-1}{3})-1}{3})-1}{3}=n$.

For the second condition, $f(2n)=f(2(\frac{3m+1}{8}))=f(\frac{3m+2}{4})=\frac{8(\frac{3m+2}{4})-1}{3}=2f(\frac{3m+1}{8})+1=2(\frac{8(\frac{3m+1}{8})-1}{3})+1=\frac{16(\frac{3m+1}{8})-2}{3}=\frac{6m+2-2}{3}=2(\frac{3m+1}{8})+1=2f(\frac{3m+1}{8})+1$.

So this function $f(n)=\frac{8n-1}{3}$ satisfies both conditions and gives $f(100)=\frac{8*100-1}{3}=266$.

Therefore, the value of $f(100)$ is 266.

The answer is: $\boxed{266}$

**Problem:** 
"We define a function $f(x)$ such that $f(14)=7$, and if there exists an integer $a$ such that $f(a)=b$, then $f(b)$ is defined and

$f(b)=3b+1$ if $b$ is odd

$f(b)=\frac{b}{2}$ if $b$ is even.

What is the smallest possible number of integers in the domain of $f$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Since $f(14)=7$, we know that $f(7)$ is defined, and it must equal $22$.  Similarly, we know that $f(22)$ is defined, and it must equal $11$.  Continuing on this way,  \begin{align*}

Thus there are no more values which need to be defined, as there is no $a$ currently defined for which $f(a)$ is a $b$ not already defined.  Thus the minimum number of integers we can define is the number we have already defined, which is $\boxed{18}$. The answer is $\boxed{18}$

**Solution:** 



We will use the second equation repeatedly to simplify the first equation.

Starting from $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we can substitute $f(f(n)) = 2f(n) + 1$ from the second equation to get $f(2f(f(n)) + 1) = 8n - 7$.

Then substitute $f(f(n)) = 2f(n) + 1$ again to get $f(2(2f(n) + 1) + 1) = 8n - 7$, or $f(4f(n) + 3) = 8n - 7$.

We can then substitute $f(n) = 2n + 1$ (derived from the second equation) to get $f(4(2n + 1) + 3) = 8n - 7$, or $f(8n + 7) = 8n - 7$.

So we have $f(x) = x - 7$ for $x = 8n + 7$.

Now we want to find $f(100)$. From the equation $f(x) = x - 7$, we know that $x = 8n + 7$ must be 100, so we have $8n + 7 = 100$, which gives $n = 12$.

Substitute $n = 12$ into $x = 8n + 7$ to get $x = 103$, so $f(100) = 103 - 7 = 96$.

So $f(100) = 96$. The answer is: $96$

If we begin to use the definition of $f$ to compute $f(84)$, we use (2) until the argument is at least $1000$: \[f(84) = f(f(89)) = f(f(f(94))) = \dots = f^N(1004)\](where $f^N$ denotes composing $f$ with itself $N$ times, for some $N$). The numbers $84, 89, 94, \dots, 1004$ form an arithmetic sequence with common difference $5$; since $1004 - 84 = 920 = 184 \cdot 5$, this sequence has $184 + 1 = 185$ terms, so $N = 185$.

At this point, (1) and (2) are both used: we compute \[\begin{aligned} f^N(1004) &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-1}(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-1}(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(1000) \\ &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(997) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1002) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(999) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1004). \end{aligned}\]Repeating this process, we see that \[f^N(1004) = f^{N-2}(1004) = f^{N-4}(1004) = \dots = f^3(1004).\](The pattern breaks down for $f^k(1004)$ when $k$ is small, so it is not true that $f^3(1004) = f(1004)$.) Now, we have \[f^3(1004) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^2(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^2(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(1000) \stackrel{(1)}{=} \boxed{997}.\] The answer is $\boxed{997}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



First, we can see that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. 

To find $f(100)$, we can use the second equation to find $f(50)$ and $f(25)$, and then substitute these values into the first equation to find $f(100)$.

Let's start by finding $f(50)$:
$$f(2 \cdot 25) = 2f(25) + 1.$$

We can substitute $f(f(f(25)))=8 \cdot 25 - 7 = 193$ into the first equation to find $f(25)$:
$$193 = f(f(f(25))).$$
Since $f(2 \cdot 25) = f(50)$, we have:
$$f(50) = 2f(25) + 1.$$

Now, let's substitute $f(25)$ into this equation:
$$f(50) = 2f(25) + 1.$$
We can substitute $f(f(f(25)))=193$ into this equation to find $f(25)$:
$$193 = f(f(f(25))).$$
Since $f(2 \cdot 25) = f(50)$, we have:
$$193 = f(f(50)).$$
Since $f(f(f(25)))=193$, we can see that $f(f(50)) = 193$, so:
$$f(25) = \frac{193 - 1}{2} = 96.$$

Now, let's substitute $f(25)$ into the equation $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$:
$$f(50) = 2 \cdot 96 + 1 = 193.$$

Now, we can find $f(100)$:
$$f(100) = f(2 \cdot 50) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2 \cdot 193 + 1 = 387.$$

So, $f(100) = 387$. The answer is $\boxed{387}$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
**Problem**
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


To find $f(100)$, we need to use the given conditions to calculate the value step by step.

First, we know that $f(f(f(100))) = 8*100 - 7 = 793$.

Let's denote $f(100)$ as $x$, then we have $f(x) = 100$.

From the second condition, we know that $f(2x) = 2f(x) + 1 = 2*100 + 1 = 201$.

Again, let's denote $f(x)$ as $y$, so we have $f(2y) = 201$.

From the second condition, we know that $f(2y) = 2f(y) + 1$. So we have $2f(y) + 1 = 201$, which gives us $2f(y) = 200$, and $f(y) = 100$.

So we have $f(x) = 100$.

Therefore, $f(100) = x$.

To find the value of $x$, we substitute $f(100)$ with $x$ in the equation $f(f(f(100))) = 793$. We get $f(f(x)) = 793$.

Again, substitute $f(x)$ with $100$, we get $f(100) = 793$.

So $x = 793$.

Therefore, $f(100) = 793$.

The answer is $\boxed{793}$.

## QUESTION 4 - 13 
- TIME_SPENT : 871 secs

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"We define a function $f(x)$ such that $f(14)=7$, and if there exists an integer $a$ such that $f(a)=b$, then $f(b)$ is defined and

$f(b)=3b+1$ if $b$ is odd

$f(b)=\frac{b}{2}$ if $b$ is even.

What is the smallest possible number of integers in the domain of $f$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Since $f(14)=7$, we know that $f(7)$ is defined, and it must equal $22$.  Similarly, we know that $f(22)$ is defined, and it must equal $11$.  Continuing on this way,  \begin{align*}
f(11)&=34\\
f(34)&=17\\
f(17)&=52\\
f(52)&=26\\
f(26)&=13\\
f(13)&=40\\
f(40)&=20\\
f(20)&=10\\
f(10)&=5\\
f(5)&=16\\
f(16)&=8\\
f(8)&=4\\
f(4)&=2\\
f(2)&=1\\
f(1)&=4
\end{align*}We are now in a cycle $1$, $4$, $2$, $1$, and so on.  Thus there are no more values which need to be defined, as there is no $a$ currently defined for which $f(a)$ is a $b$ not already defined.  Thus the minimum number of integers we can define is the number we have already defined, which is $\boxed{18}$. The answer is $\boxed{18}$

**Solution:** 


We first set up a recursive function to compute $f(n)$ based on the given conditions. The function $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ gives us a way to directly compute $f(n)$ for $n$ of the form $f(f(k))$ for some $k$. The second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ gives us a way to compute $f(n)$ for even $n$. We start with $f(1)=1$ as a base case and use these two conditions to compute $f(n)$ for larger $n$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

def calculate_f(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    elif n % 2 == 0:
        return 2 * calculate_f(n // 2) + 1
    else:
        k = (8 * n - 7) // 7
        return calculate_f(k)

f_100 = calculate_f(100)
print(f_100)
```
