    To have 4 distinct solutions, we need the equation to be true for both x-1 > 2 and x-1 < -2.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 We will analyze the problem and use it to generate a solution in Python.

First, let's understand the problem. We are asked to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

The given equation is a combination of two absolute value equations. Let's try to simplify it.

We can rewrite the equation as:
$\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ or $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.

Simplifying further, we get:
$\vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100} + 2$ or $\vert x-1 \vert = -\frac{m}{100} + 2$.

This means that $x-1$ must be equal to $\frac{m}{100} + 2$ or $-\frac{m}{100} + 2$.

Solving these equations for $x$, we get:
$x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$ or $x = -\frac{m}{100} + 3$.

These are the two branches of the piecewise function that defines the solutions of the given equation.

Clearly, for each $m$, there are two solutions. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the given equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $\boxed{2}$.

This problem can be solved without programming, but we provide a Python solution as well for those who want to verify their answer using a programming language.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def count_positive_integers():
    # We know that for each m, there are two solutions.
    # Therefore, to get 4 distinct solutions, there must be two m values.
    return 2

result = count_positive_integers()
print(result)
```

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is less than $2$, because otherwise it would have either $1$ or $2$ solutions. 

So, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $\frac{m}{100}<2$, which simplifies to $m<200$. 

Since $m$ is a positive integer, the possible values for $m$ are $1, 2, 3, ..., 199$. 

To find the number of these values, we can subtract $1$ from each side of the inequality and add $1$ to each side of the inequality to get $0<m\leq199$. 

Then we add $1$ to each side of the inequality to get $1\leq m\leq199$. 

Finally, we subtract $1$ from each side of the inequality to get $0\leq m\leq198$. 

So the total number of positive integers $m$ is $198-0+1=\boxed{199}$. 

This is because we count the lower limit, the upper limit, and all the numbers in between, which gives us a total of $198$. Adding the $1$ at the end gives us a total of $199$ possible values for $m$. 

So the answer is $\boxed{199}$.
