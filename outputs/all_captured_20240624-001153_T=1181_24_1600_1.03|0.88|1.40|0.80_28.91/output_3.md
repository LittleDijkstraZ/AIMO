Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The equation given in the problem is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.

The first term is zero when $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x - y| - 10 = 0$. These simplify to $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$.
The second term is zero when $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$, which simplifies to $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$.

The solutions to these equations are four lines forming a square with side length 16. The vertices of the square are $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

To find the area of the square, we can use the formula for the area of a square which is side length squared. The side length of the square is 16, so the area is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{256}$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

The problem states that the points $\left(x, y\right)$ that satisfy the equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. The area of this polygon can be found by considering the conditions that make the equation equal to zero.

The equation equals zero if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. 

The first condition $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. These four lines are the sides of a square with side length 10.

The second condition $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. These four lines are the sides of a square with side length 8.

The area of the convex polygon is the area of the larger square minus the area of the smaller square. The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of the larger square is $10^2 = 100$ and the area of the smaller square is $8^2 = 64$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $100 - 64 = 36$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 36 square units. The answer is: $\boxed{36}$.

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. Therefore, either of the terms must be zero for the entire expression to be zero. This gives us two sets of equations to solve:

1. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$
2. $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$

Solving these equations, we get the following vertices of the polygon:

1. $(8,8), (8,-8), (-8,8), (-8,-8)$ from the second set of equations.
2. $(10,0), (0,10), (-10,0), (0,-10)$ from the first set of equations.

Now, we can see that these vertices form a square with side length 16. The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of the convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$.

Assistant:

 The given equation is of the form $AB = 0$, which implies that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$.
The two factors are $A = (|x + y| - 10)^2 + (|x - y| - 10)^2$ and $B = (|x| - 8)^2 + (|y| - 8)^2$.
If $A = 0$, then $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$. This implies $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get four points: $(5,5), (5,-5), (-5,5), (-5,-5)$.
If $B = 0$, then $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. This implies $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations, we get four more points: $(8,0), (0,8), (-8,0), (0,-8)$.
So the eight points $(5,5), (5,-5), (-5,5), (-5,-5), (8,0), (0,8), (-8,0), (0,-8)$ form a square with side length $10$. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $100$. The answer is: $100$

 The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if either of the following two conditions are met:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This can only happen if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.

2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This can only happen if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

These lines form a square with side length $20$. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$. So the area of the convex polygon is $400$.

Here is Python code to calculate the area:

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

 This problem involves understanding the properties of absolute values and how they interact with equations. The key to solving this problem is to recognize that the product of two quantities is zero if and only if at least one of the quantities is zero. This means we can set each factor in the product equal to zero and solve for the possible values of x and y.

Setting $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ gives $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$.
Setting $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ gives $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = \pm 10$.
Setting $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ gives $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$.
Setting $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ gives $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = \pm 8$.

Now we can solve these equations to find the possible values of x and y. 

For $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$, we can solve for $x$ and $y$ in terms of each other:
If $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, then $x = 10$ and $y = 0$.
If $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$, then $x = 0$ and $y = 10$.
If $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$, then $x = 0$ and $y = -10$.
If $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$, then $x = -10$ and $y = 0$.

For $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$, the possible values are:
If $x = 8$ and $y = 8$, then $(x, y) = (8, 8)$.
If $x = 8$ and $y = -8$, then $(x, y) = (8, -8)$.
If $x = -8$ and $y = 8$, then $(x, y) = (-8, 8)$.
If $x = -8$ and $y = -8$, then $(x, y) = (-8, -8)$.

So the vertices of the polygon are $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$. These are the points that make up the vertices of a square with side length 16.

To find the area of the square, we can use the formula for the area of a square, which is side length squared. The side length of the square is 16, so the area is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

 The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied only when $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
These equations are satisfied only when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The solutions to these equations are the points $(8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, $(-8, 0)$, $(0, -8)$, $(0, 8)$, $(8, 0)$, $(0, -8)$, and $(-8, 0)$.
These points form a square with side length 16.
The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$
