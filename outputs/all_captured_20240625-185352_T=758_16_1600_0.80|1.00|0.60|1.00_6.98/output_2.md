The python code above is not working as expected because the equation inside the absolute value is not solvable in symbolic form. We need to solve this problem analytically instead of using symbolic computation.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100} = 2 - \frac{1}{4}, 2 - \frac{1}{2}, 2 - \frac{3}{4}, 2$. Solving these equations for $m$ gives us the positive integer solutions for $m$ as $150, 200, 250, 400$. Therefore, there are $\boxed{4}$ positive integer solutions for $m$.
