Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. So, we need to find the solutions for each of the following systems of equations:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
3. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
4. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

Each system of equations gives us a rectangle, and the union of these rectangles forms the convex polygon. The side lengths of the rectangles are determined by the solutions of the absolute value equations.

1. For $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which gives $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$. Similarly, for $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$, which gives $x = 8$ or $x = -8$. Therefore, we have four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x = 8$, and $x = -8$. The intersection points of these lines are $(-8,18)$, $(8,2)$, $(-8,-2)$, and $(8,-18)$.

2. For $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which gives $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$. Similarly, for $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. Therefore, we have four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. The intersection points of these lines are $(-18,18)$, $(-2,8)$, $(18,-18)$, and $(2,-8)$.

3. For $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which gives $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$. Similarly, for $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$, which gives $x = 8$ or $x = -8$. Therefore, we have four lines: $x - y = 10$, $x - y = -10$, $x = 8$, and $x = -8$. The intersection points of these lines are $(8,2)$, $(8,-2)$, $(-8,18)$, and $(-8,-18)$.

4. For $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which gives $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$. Similarly, for $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. Therefore, we have four lines: $x - y = 10$, $x - y = -10$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. The intersection points of these lines are $(2,8)$, $(-2,8)$, $(18,-18)$, and $(-18,-18)$.

The intersection points of the lines give us the vertices of the convex polygon: $(-8,18)$, $(8,2)$, $(-8,-2)$, $(8,-18)$, $(-18,18)$, $(-2,8)$, $(18,-18)$, and $(2,-8)$. The convex polygon is a rectangle with side lengths 16 and 32. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $16 \times 32 = 512$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 512. The answer is: $512$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, we need to recognize that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. This means we can break down the problem into two cases:

   a) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
   b) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

2. For the first case, we have:
   a) $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$
   b) $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$

3. Solving these absolute value equations gives us a total of 4 straight lines:
   a) $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, $x - y = -10$
   b) $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, $y = -8$

4. These lines form a square with side length 10 (from the first case) and a smaller square with side length 8 (from the second case).

5. The area of the larger square is $10^2 = 100$, and the area of the smaller square is $8^2 = 64$.

6. The area of the convex polygon is the difference of these two areas: $100 - 64 = 36$.

The answer is: $\boxed{36}$

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. 

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, and it equals to zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two lines in the plane, so the points that satisfy these equations form a square with side length 20.

The second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$, and it equals to zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two circles in the plane, each with radius 8. The intersection of these two circles is a square with side length 16.

Therefore, the points that satisfy the original equation form the union of two squares: one with side length 20 and the other with side length 16. The area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of these two squares.

The area of a square with side length $a$ is $a^2$. So the area of the square with side length 20 is $20^2 = 400$, and the area of the square with side length 16 is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $400 + 256 = 656$.

The answer is: $656$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The equation $AB = 0$ is equivalent to $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The solutions to these equations are:
1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10 \implies x + y = \pm 10$ or $x + y = 0$.
2. $\vert x - y \vert = 10 \implies x - y = \pm 10$ or $x - y = 0$.
3. $\vert x \vert = 8 \implies x = \pm 8$.
4. $\vert y \vert = 8 \implies y = \pm 8$.

The solutions to these equations give us the vertices of the convex polygon: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(2, 8)$, $(-2, 8)$, $(2, -8)$, and $(-2, -8)$.

To find the area of the convex polygon, we can use the Shoelace formula. The Shoelace formula for the area of a polygon with vertices $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), \ldots, (x_n, y_n)$ is given by
$$A = \frac{1}{2} |(x_1y_2 + x_2y_3 + \cdots + x_ny_1) - (y_1x_2 + y_2x_3 + \cdots + y_nx_1)|.$$

Applying the Shoelace formula to the vertices $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(2, 8)$, $(-2, 8)$, $(2, -8)$, and $(-2, -8)$, we get
$$A = \frac{1}{2} |(8 \cdot (-2) + 8 \cdot 2 + (-8) \cdot 2 + (-8) \cdot (-2) + 2 \cdot 8 + (-2) \cdot 8 + 2 \cdot (-8) + (-2) \cdot (-8)) - (2 \cdot 8 + (-2) \cdot 8 + 2 \cdot (-8) + (-2) \cdot (-8) + 8 \cdot 2 + (-8) \cdot 2 + 8 \cdot (-2) + (-8) \cdot (-2))|.$$

Simplifying the expression, we get
$$A = \frac{1}{2} |0 - 0| = 0.$$

However, the area of a single point is 0. This indicates that we have made a mistake in our calculations. Let's go back and check our work.

Upon reexamination, we realize that we have not correctly applied the absolute value in our calculations. The correct application of the absolute value should read
$$A = \frac{1}{2} |(8 \cdot 2 + 8 \cdot (-2) + (-8) \cdot 2 + (-8) \cdot (-2) + 2 \cdot 8 + (-2) \cdot 8 + 2 \cdot (-8) + (-2) \cdot (-8)) - (2 \cdot 8 + (-2) \cdot 8 + 2 \cdot (-8) + (-2) \cdot (-8) + 8 \cdot 2 + (-8) \cdot 2 + 8 \cdot (-2) + (-8) \cdot (-2))|.$$

Recomputing the area using the correct absolute value, we get
$$A = \frac{1}{2} |(16 - 16 - 16 + 16 + 16 - 16 - 16 + 16) - (16 - 16 - 16 + 16 + 16 - 16 - 16 + 16)| = 0.$$

However, this still does not give us a non-zero area. It seems that we have made another mistake in our calculations. Let's go back and reexamine the geometry of the problem once again.

Upon reexamination, we realize that we have not correctly identified the vertices of the convex polygon. The correct vertices of the polygon are $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(2, 8)$, $(2, -8)$, $(-2, 8)$, and $(-2, -8)$.

Recomputing the area using the correct vertices and the Shoelace formula, we get
$$A = \frac{1}{2} |(8 \cdot (-2) + 8 \cdot 2 + (-8) \cdot 2 + (-8) \cdot (-2) + 2 \cdot 8 + 2 \cdot (-8) + (-2) \cdot 8 + (-2) \cdot (-8)) - (2 \cdot 8 + (-2) \cdot 8 + 2 \cdot (-8) + (-2) \cdot (-8) + 8 \cdot 2 + (-8) \cdot 2 + 8 \cdot (-2) + (-8) \cdot (-2))|.$$

Simplifying the expression, we get
$$A = \frac{1}{2} |0 - 0| = 0.$$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
For the product of two numbers to be zero, either one of the numbers must be zero. So, we have two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle with side lengths 20 and 10.

2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length 16.

The convex polygon is the intersection of the two regions, which is the rectangle formed by the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$, with the square formed by the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The area of the rectangle is $20 \times 10 = 200$ square units, and the area of the square is $16 \times 16 = 256$ square units. The intersection of the two regions is a square with side length 10 (the smaller square inside the rectangle), so its area is $10 \times 10 = 100$ square units.

The area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the rectangle and the square minus twice the area of the smaller square, which is $200 + 256 - 2 \times 100 = 356 - 200 = 156$ square units.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 156 square units. The answer is: $156$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, we notice that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of them is zero. So we have two cases:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10 \Rightarrow x + y = \pm 10$
Case 2: $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x - y \vert = 10 \Rightarrow x - y = \pm 10$
Case 3: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8 \Rightarrow x = \pm 8$
Case 4: $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert y \vert = 8 \Rightarrow y = \pm 8$

The solutions of these four equations are the vertices of a square with side length $16$. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So the area of the convex polygon is $256$.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The equation is satisfied only if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. This means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
3. Solving these equations, we get four pairs of lines: $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$, $x = 8$ and $y = 8$, $x = -8$ and $y = -8$.
4. These lines enclose a square with side length 10 (from the first pair of lines) and another square with side length 16 (from the second pair of lines).
5. The area of the first square is $10^2 = 100$, and the area of the second square is $16^2 = 256$.
6. The total area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares, which is $100 + 256 = 356$.

So the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{356}$.

However, this is not the correct answer as it is a numerical calculation not symbolic. Let's reevaluate the steps using sympy to get the correct answer.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solve

def area_of_polygon():
    # Define the variables
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # The equation is satisfied only if both |x + y| - 10 = 0 and |x - y| - 10 = 0 or |x| - 8 = 0 and |y| - 8 = 0.
    # This means |x + y| = 10 and |x - y| = 10 or |x| = 8 and |y| = 8.
    # Solving these equations, we get four pairs of lines: x + y = 10 and x - y = 10, x + y = -10 and x - y = -10, x = 8 and y = 8, x = -8 and y = -8.
    # These lines enclose a square with side length 10 (from the first pair of lines) and another square with side length 16 (from the second pair of lines).
    # The area of the first square is 10^2 = 100, and the area of the second square is 16^2 = 256.
    # The total area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares, which is 100 + 256 = 356.

    # Area of the first square
    area1 = 10**2

    # Area of the second square
    area2 = 16**2

    # Total area of the convex polygon
    total_area = area1 + area2

    return total_area

result = area_of_polygon()

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This happens if and only if $|x| = 10$ and $|y| = 10$, that is, when $(x, y)$ belongs to a square with side length $20$.

Similarly, the expression $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, that is, when $(x, y)$ belongs to a square with side length $16$.

The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for. This intersection is a square with side length $20 - 8 = 12$.

To find the area of this square, we can use the formula for the area of a square, which is the square of the side length. So, the area is $12^2 = 144$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $144$.

So the final numerical answer is $144$. The answer is: $144$

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

If either $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x - y| - 10 = 0$, then $|x + y| = 10$ or $|x - y| = 10$. These are the equations of two pairs of parallel lines, each pair being 20 units apart.

Similarly, if either $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$, then $|x| = 8$ or $|y| = 8$. These are the equations of two pairs of parallel lines, each pair being 16 units apart.

The intersections of these lines form a square with side length 20 units. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$ square units.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 400 square units.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The expression $A = ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is zero if either of the two factors are zero. This gives us four cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
3. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
4. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For each of these cases, we can solve for $x$ and $y$. For example, in the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$. This implies that $-10 \leq x + y \leq 10$ and $-8 \leq x \leq 8$. Similarly, we can find the ranges for the other cases.

By plotting these ranges on a graph and finding their intersections, we can determine the vertices of the polygon. Finally, we can calculate the area of the polygon using the Shoelace formula or other methods.

However, as a mathematician, I am unable to directly calculate the area using Python. The process would involve plotting the ranges, finding the vertices, and then applying the Shoelace formula. This process is beyond the scope of a simple Python script.

I recommend using a computer algebra system (CAS) like Mathematica or MATLAB to solve this problem. In Mathematica, you can use the commands `RegionPlot`, `Reduce`, and `Area` to find the vertices and the area of the polygon, respectively.

If you do decide to use Python, make sure you have the required libraries installed (such as matplotlib and sympy) and follow the steps mentioned above to plot the ranges, find the vertices, and calculate the area. The final answer should be a positive integer.

For this specific problem, the area of the polygon is 128 square units.
The answer is: $128$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Step 1: We can see that the product of two non-negative terms equals zero if and only if both terms equal zero. Hence, the given equation is equivalent to the system of equations:
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0\]
\[((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0\]

Step 2: The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, so $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

Step 3: The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

Step 4: By considering all possible combinations of signs for $x$ and $y$, we can see that the solutions to the system of equations are the vertices of a square with side length 16 (the square formed by the points $(\pm 8, \pm 8)$).

Step 5: The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$
