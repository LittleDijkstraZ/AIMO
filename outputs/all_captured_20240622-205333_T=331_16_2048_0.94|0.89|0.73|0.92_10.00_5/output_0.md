Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first list the problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge, and thens solve the problem step by step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints are given by the equation
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$

The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the equation is equivalent to two separate cases:

1. Either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. Both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first case, if $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. The intersection points of these lines are $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, and $(0, -10)$.

For the second case, if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $x + y = \pm 10$, $x - y = \pm 10$, $x = \pm 8$, and $y = \pm 8$. The intersection points of these lines are $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$.

Therefore, the points satisfying the equation are $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$. These points form a square with side length $20$. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$. The answer is: $400$.

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either term must be zero for the equation to hold true. This gives us two sets of equations to solve:

1) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10 \Rightarrow x + y = \pm 10$
2) $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x - y \vert = 10 \Rightarrow x - y = \pm 10$
3) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8 \Rightarrow x = \pm 8$
4) $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert y \vert = 8 \Rightarrow y = \pm 8$

The solutions to these equations are the vertices of the polygon. By plotting these vertices on a coordinate plane and connecting them with line segments, we can determine the shape of the polygon. The polygon is a square with side length 16.

To find the area of the square, we can use the formula for the area of a square, which is side length squared. The side length of the square is 16, so the area is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge are:

1. The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ must be satisfied by all points $(x, y)$ inside the polygon.

2. The expression inside the left parenthesis can only be equal to zero if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

3. Similarly, the expression inside the right parenthesis can only be equal to zero if both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

4. From $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, we can conclude that $x = \pm 5$ and $y = \pm 5$.

5. From $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, we can conclude that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

6. Combining these results, we find that the polygon is a square with side length $10$, because the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy both conditions are the vertices of the square with side length $10$ centered at the origin.

The area of the square is therefore $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge are:

1. The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ must be satisfied for all points $(x, y)$ inside the polygon.
2. The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$ can only be zero if both $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the lines $y = x \pm 10$.
3. The expression $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ can only be zero if both $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length $20$. To find the area of this square, we simply square the length of one of its sides: $20^2 = 400$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $400$. The answer is: $400$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions, and related knowledge are:
1. The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero.
2. The absolute value of a real number is zero if and only if the number is zero.

From the constraints, we can infer that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From the conditions, we can infer that either $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The solutions to these equations are:
- $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ gives $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
- $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ gives $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
- $\vert x \vert = 8$ gives $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
- $\vert y \vert = 8$ gives $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

Now we can find the intersection points of these lines:
1. If $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, we can solve these equations to get $x = 10$ and $y = 0$.
2. If $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$, we can solve these equations to get $x = 0$ and $y = 10$.
3. If $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$, we can solve these equations to get $x = -10$ and $y = -20$.
4. If $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$, we can solve these equations to get $x = -10$ and $y = 0$.
5. If $x + y = 10$ and $x = 8$, we can substitute $x = 8$ into the first equation to get $y = 2$.
6. If $x + y = 10$ and $x = -8$, we can substitute $x = -8$ into the first equation to get $y = 18$.
7. If $x + y = -10$ and $x = 8$, we can substitute $x = 8$ into the first equation to get $y = -18$.
8. If $x + y = -10$ and $x = -8$, we can substitute $x = -8$ into the first equation to get $y = -2$.
9. If $x - y = 10$ and $x = 8$, we can substitute $x = 8$ into the second equation to get $y = -2$.
10. If $x - y = 10$ and $x = -8$, we can substitute $x = -8$ into the second equation to get $y = -18$.
11. If $x - y = -10$ and $x = 8$, we can substitute $x = 8$ into the second equation to get $y = 18$.
12. If $x - y = -10$ and $x = -8$, we can substitute $x = -8$ into the second equation to get $y = 2$.
13. If $x = 8$ and $y = 8$, we can see that this solution does not satisfy any of the equations.
14. If $x = 8$ and $y = -8$, we can see that this solution does not satisfy any of the equations.
15. If $x = -8$ and $y = 8$, we can see that this solution does not satisfy any of the equations.
16. If $x = -8$ and $y = -8$, we can see that this solution does not satisfy any of the equations.

The intersection points are: $(10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, $(-10, -20)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(8, 2)$, $(8, 18)$, $(-8, -18)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, 18)$, $(8, -2)$, $(8, -18)$, $(8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The area of the convex polygon is the area of the rectangle formed by the points $(10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, $(-10, -20)$, and $(-10, 0)$, which is $10 \times 20 = 200$.
The answer is: $200$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first list the problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge, and thens solve the problem step by step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge are:

1. The expression $AB = 0$ is equivalent to $A = 0$ or $B = 0$.
2. $|x|$ is the absolute value of $x$, which is $x$ if $x \geq 0$, and $-x$ if $x < 0$.
3. $|a + b|$ is the absolute value of the sum of $a$ and $b$.
4. $|a - b|$ is the absolute value of the difference of $a$ and $b$.

The problem asks us to find the area of the convex polygon formed by the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equation
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]

From the constraint 1, the equation is satisfied if either
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0\]
or
\[((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]

From the constraint 2, the equation $A^2 = 0$ implies $A = 0$. So the first equation is satisfied if
\[(\vert x + y \vert - 10) = 0\]
and
\[(\vert x - y \vert - 10) = 0.\]
This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these equations are all the points $(x, y)$ that lie on the lines $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. These lines form a square with side length 20.

The second equation is satisfied if
\[(\vert x \vert - 8) = 0\]
and
\[(\vert y \vert - 8) = 0.\]
This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are all the points $(x, y)$ that lie on the lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. These lines form a square with side length 16.

However, the problem asks for the area of the convex polygon formed by the intersection of these two squares. The intersection of the two squares is another square with side length 8. The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$. The answer is: $64$

 The given equation is $ ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. For the product of two numbers to be zero, either one of the numbers must be zero. Thus, we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
This equation implies that both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. So, $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the four lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This equation implies that both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. So, $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So we get the four lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersection of the lines from case 1 and case 2 form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. So the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units. The answer is: $100$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The problem's constraints are given by the equation:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$
This equation implies two separate conditions:
1. Either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. Both cannot be zero at the same time.

For the first condition to be true, we need $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get four pairs of $(x, y)$: $(5, 5)$, $(5, -5)$, $(-5, 5)$, and $(-5, -5)$.

For the second condition to be true, we need $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations, we get four more pairs of $(x, y)$: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

Therefore, the points satisfying the equation are $(5, 5)$, $(5, -5)$, $(-5, 5)$, $(-5, -5)$, $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$. These points form a square with side length $10$, so the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first list the problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge, and thens solve the problem step by step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge are:
1. The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero.
2. The absolute value function $|x|$ is always non-negative, i.e., $|x| \geq 0$ for all real numbers $x$.
3. The square of a real number is non-negative, i.e., $x^2 \geq 0$ for all real numbers $x$.
4. The sum of two non-negative numbers is also non-negative.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

The equation given is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. From constraint 1, we know that this equation is satisfied if and only if at least one of the following two equations is satisfied:

(1) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$,
(2) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From constraint 2 and 3, we know that $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 \geq 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 \geq 0$, so their sum is also non-negative. Therefore, equation (2) can only be satisfied if both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

Similarly, from constraint 2 and 3, we know that $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 \geq 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 \geq 0$, so their sum is also non-negative. Therefore, equation (1) can only be satisfied if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.

Solving these equations, we get the following vertices of the polygon: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$. These vertices form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge are as follows:

1. The equation involves absolute value functions, which means we need to consider different cases for the values of $x$ and $y$.
2. The equation is equal to zero, which means that one or both of the factors must be zero.
3. The factors involve absolute value functions, so we need to consider different cases again for the values of $x$ and $y$.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

Step 1: Consider the first factor $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. For this to be true, both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these systems of equations, we find that the points that satisfy this condition are $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, and $(-5,-5)$.

Step 2: Consider the second factor $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. For this to be true, both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So the points that satisfy this condition are $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

Step 3: The points that satisfy both conditions are the intersections of the points from steps 1 and 2. By comparing the points, we find that the only intersection is the point $(5,5)$.

Step 4: The points $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, and $(-5,-5)$ form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$
