Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

The first term is zero when $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x - y| - 10 = 0$. These equations simplify to $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle.

The second term is zero when $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$. These equations simplify to $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines also form a rectangle.

The two rectangles intersect to form a larger rectangle. The dimensions of the larger rectangle are determined by the maximum and minimum values of $x$ and $y$ that satisfy the conditions from both terms. The maximum value of $x$ from the first term is $x = 10$ and the minimum value is $x = -10$. The maximum value of $y$ from the second term is $y = 8$ and the minimum value is $y = -8$. Therefore, the dimensions of the larger rectangle are $20 \times 16$.

The area of a rectangle is given by the product of its length and width. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $20 \times 16 = 320$.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

The equation is satisfied if and only if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The first set of conditions is satisfied if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.
Solving these equations gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.
The second set of conditions is satisfied if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
Solving these equations gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.
The intersection points of these lines are the vertices of the polygon.
By plotting these lines, we find that the polygon is a square with side length 16.
The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either one of the expressions must be zero for the product to be zero. This gives us two sets of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From the first set of equations, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us four points: $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, and $(-5,-5)$.

From the second set of equations, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us four more points: $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

These eight points are the vertices of a square with side length $10$. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $100$.

```python

def area_of_polygon():

    side_length = 10

The area of the convex polygon is $100$. The answer is $\boxed{100}$.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

The given equation is equal to zero if and only if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This means that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The solutions to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ are $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$. The solutions to $\vert x \vert = 8$ are $x = 8$ and $x = -8$. The solutions to $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ are $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$. The solutions to $\vert y \vert = 8$ are $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

The eight lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, $x - y = -10$, $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$ form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. So the area of the convex polygon is 100.

Here is a Python code to calculate the area:

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The equation is satisfied if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This means that either $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The absolute value equations give us the following equations:
- For $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, we have $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
- For $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, we have $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
- For $\vert x \vert = 8$, we have $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
- For $\vert y \vert = 8$, we have $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon:
- For $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, we get $x = 5$ and $y = 5$.
- For $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$, we get $x = 0$ and $y = 10$.
- For $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$, we get $x = -5$ and $y = -5$.
- For $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$, we get $x = 0$ and $y = -10$.
- For $x = 8$ and $y = 8$, we get the vertex $(8, 8)$.
- For $x = 8$ and $y = -8$, we get the vertex $(8, -8)$.
- For $x = -8$ and $y = 8$, we get the vertex $(-8, 8)$.
- For $x = -8$ and $y = -8$, we get the vertex $(-8, -8)$.

These vertices form a square with side length $10$. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. So the area of the convex polygon is $100$.

The Python code to calculate the area of the polygon is not needed as the problem is solved analytically and the area of the polygon is directly calculated to be 100.
The answer is: $100$
