Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's consider the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
Using the property of absolute values, we can split the expression into two cases:
Case 1: $(x - 2y) + (y - 2x) = 40 \Rightarrow -x - y = 40 \Rightarrow y = -x - 40$.
Case 2: $(x - 2y) - (y - 2x) = 40 \Rightarrow 3x - 3y = 40 \Rightarrow y = x - \frac{40}{3}$.
Now, let's substitute these expressions for $y$ into the expression we want to minimize, $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$:
For Case 1, we substitute $y = -x - 40$:
\[5x^2 + 5(-x - 40)^2 - 8x(-x - 40) = 5x^2 + 5(x^2 + 80x + 1600) + 8x^2 + 320x = 18x^2 + 400x + 8000.\]
For Case 2, we substitute $y = x - \frac{40}{3}$:
\[5x^2 + 5(x - \frac{40}{3})^2 - 8x(x - \frac{40}{3}) = 5x^2 + 5(x^2 - \frac{80}{3}x + \frac{1600}{9}) - 8x^2 + \frac{320}{3}x = -\frac{11}{3}x^2 + \frac{640}{3}x + \frac{8000}{9}.\]
We want to find the minimum value of these two expressions.
To find the minimum of a quadratic function, we can find the vertex.
For the first expression, $18x^2 + 400x + 8000$, the vertex is given by $x = -\frac{b}{2a} = -\frac{400}{2(18)} = -\frac{100}{9}$.
Substituting this value back into the expression, we get
\[18(-\frac{100}{9})^2 + 400(-\frac{100}{9}) + 8000 = \frac{20000}{9}.\]
For the second expression, $-\frac{11}{3}x^2 + \frac{640}{3}x + \frac{8000}{9}$, the vertex is given by $x = -\frac{b}{2a} = -\frac{\frac{640}{3}}{2(-\frac{11}{3})} = \frac{320}{22} = \frac{160}{11}$.
Substituting this value back into the expression, we get
\[-\frac{11}{3}(\frac{160}{11})^2 + \frac{640}{3}(\frac{160}{11}) + \frac{8000}{9} = \frac{20000}{9}.\]
So, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is $\frac{20000}{9}$.
The value is positive, as required. The answer is: $\frac{20000}{9}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


Let $A = x - 2y$ and $B = y - 2x$.
Then we have $|A| + |B| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, $|A| + |B| \ge |A + B|$.
So $|A + B| \le 40$.
But $A + B = x - 2y + y - 2x = -x - y$.
Therefore, $| -x - y| \le 40$, which is equivalent to $|x + y| \le 40$.
Now consider the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$.
We can rewrite this as $5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy$.
Using the identity $(x + y)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + 2xy$, we can rewrite this as $5(x + y)^2 - 13xy$.
We know that $|x + y| \le 40$, so $(x + y)^2 \le 1600$.
We also know that $xy \le \frac{(x+y)^2}{4}$ by the AM-GM inequality (since $x$ and $y$ are both nonnegative or both nonpositive).
Therefore, $xy \le \frac{1600}{4} = 400$.
Substituting this back into the expression gives us $5(1600) - 13(400) = 8000 - 5200 = 2800$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is 2800. The answer is: 2800

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find the minimum value of the function $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ subject to the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$,
we can rewrite the constraint using the absolute value function:
$$|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40 \Rightarrow |x-2y| = 40 - |y-2x|.$$
Squaring both sides, we have:
$$(x-2y)^2 = (40 - |y-2x|)^2.$$
Expanding, we get:
$$x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2 = 1600 - 80|y-2x| + (y-2x)^2.$$
Rearranging and simplifying, we have:
$$5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = 1600 + (y-2x)^2 - 80|y-2x|.$$
Now, we know that $(y-2x)^2 \ge 0$ and $|y-2x| \ge 0$, so the right-hand side of the equation is minimized when $(y-2x)^2 = 0$ and $|y-2x| = 0$, which means $y = 2x$.
Substituting $y = 2x$ into the constraint equation, we have:
$$|x-4x| + |2x-x| = 40 \Rightarrow | -3x | + |x | = 40 \Rightarrow 3|x| + |x| = 40 \Rightarrow 4|x| = 40 \Rightarrow |x| = 10.$$
So $x = \pm 10$, and corresponding $y = \pm 20$.
Now, we substitute $y = 2x$ into the function $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get:
$$5x^2 + 5(2x)^2 - 8x(2x) = 5x^2 + 20x^2 - 16x^2 = 19x^2.$$
Substituting $x = \pm 10$, we have:
$$19x^2 = 19(10)^2 = 1900.$$
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ subject to the constraint is $1900$. The answer is: 1900

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We start by expressing the given condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ using the properties of absolute value:
$|a - b| = |b - a|$, so we can rewrite the condition as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$.
This simplifies to $2|x-2y| = 40$, and therefore $|x-2y| = 20$.
Now, we express this absolute value as a double inequality: $-20 \leq x - 2y \leq 20$.
We can split this into two cases:
1. $x - 2y \geq -20$. Rearranging gives $x - 2y + 20 \geq 0$.
2. $x - 2y \leq 20$. Rearranging gives $x - 2y - 20 \leq 0$.
These cases can be further simplified using the method of intervals:
1. For $x - 2y + 20 \geq 0$, we have $x - 2y \geq -20$, which gives us $x \geq 2y - 20$.
2. For $x - 2y - 20 \leq 0$, we have $x - 2y \leq 20$, which gives us $x \leq 2y + 20$.
Now, we substitute $x = 2y + t$ (where $t$ is a real number) into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
\begin{align*}
5(2y + t)^2 + 5y^2 - 8(2y + t)y &= 5(4y^2 + 4ty + t^2) + 5y^2 - 16y^2 - 8ty \\
&= 20y^2 + 20ty + 5t^2 + 5y^2 - 16y^2 - 8ty \\
&= (20 - 16)y^2 + (20 - 8)ty + 5t^2 \\
&= 4y^2 + 12ty + 5t^2 \\
&= 4y^2 + 12ty + 9t^2 - 4t^2 + 5t^2 \\
&= (2y + 3t)^2 + t^2.
\end{align*}
This expression is always nonnegative because the square of a real number is always nonnegative, and the sum of two nonnegative numbers is also nonnegative.
Hence, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0, and it is achieved when $x = 2y + 20$ or $x = 2y - 20$, i.e., when $x - 2y = 20$ or $x - 2y = -20$.
The answer is: $0$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


Let's denote $A = x - 2y$ and $B = y - 2x$. Then, the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|A| + |B| = 40$.
By the Triangle Inequality, we know that $|A| + |B| \geq |A + B|$, so we must have $|A + B| = 40$.
Expanding $A + B$, we get $A + B = (x - 2y) + (y - 2x) = -x - y$. Therefore, $|-x - y| = 40$, or $|x + y| = 40$.
Now, let's substitute $A$ and $B$ back into the expression we want to minimize:
\[5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy.\]
We can rewrite this as $5[(x^2 + 2xy + y^2) - 3xy] = 5[(x + y)^2 - 3xy]$.
We know that $(x + y)^2 = 40^2 = 1600$, so we can substitute this in to get
\[5[(x + y)^2 - 3xy] = 5[1600 - 3xy] = 8000 - 15xy.\]
To minimize this expression, we want to maximize the value of $15xy$. But from the equation $|x + y| = 40$, we know that $x + y$ is a fixed value, say $k$, where $|k| = 40$. Then, $xy = \frac{k^2 - (x+y)^2}{4} = \frac{k^2 - 1600}{4}$.
Thus, $15xy = 15 \cdot \frac{k^2 - 1600}{4} = \frac{15k^2 - 36000}{4}$.
Since $k$ is fixed, the maximum value of $\frac{15k^2 - 36000}{4}$ is achieved when $k^2$ is at its maximum value.
Since $|k| = 40$, we have $k^2 = 1600$. Thus, the maximum value of $\frac{15k^2 - 36000}{4}$ is $\frac{15 \cdot 1600 - 36000}{4} = \frac{24000 - 36000}{4} = -3000$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $8000 - 15xy = 8000 - (-3000) = 11000$. The answer is: $11000$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we note that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is equivalent to $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$, since $|a| = |-a|$. Now, we know that $|a| + |b|$ is the distance between $a$ and $b$ on the number line. So the given equation says that the distance between $2y$ and $x$ plus the distance between $2x$ and $y$ is 40.

We can rewrite the equation as $|2y - x| + |y - 2x| = 40$. Now, let's express the left-hand side using the properties of absolute value:
\[|2y - x| + |y - 2x| = |2y - x| + |-2x + y| = |2y - x| + |-(2x - y)| = |2y - x| + |2x - y|.\]

So we have the equation $|2y - x| + |2x - y| = 40$.

Now, let's define $a = 2y - x$ and $b = 2x - y$. Then our equation becomes $|a| + |b| = 40$. The sum of the absolute values of two numbers is a constant, which means the graph of the points $(a,b)$ satisfying this equation is a square with side length 40.

Now, let's consider the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$. We can rewrite this as $5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x - y)^2 + 2xy] - 8xy = 5(x - y)^2 + 3xy$.

Now, let's substitute $a = 2y - x$ and $b = 2x - y$ into this expression. We get $5(x - y)^2 + 3xy = 5a^2 + 3(-a - b) = 5a^2 - 3a - 3b$.

We want to minimize this expression over the square $|a| + |b| = 40$. The minimum value of $5a^2 - 3a - 3b$ occurs at the center of the square, which is when $a = b = 0$. Then the minimum value is $0$.

So the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is $0$. The answer is: $0$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, let's look at the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. This is actually a bit tricky to work with directly, so we might want to manipulate it a bit to make it easier. Notice that $|a-b| = |-(b-a)|$, so $|x-2y| = |-(2x-y)|$. Then we can rewrite the equation as $|x-2y| + |-2x+y| = 40$. Now it might be easier to work with.

Next, let's consider the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite this as $5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy$. We know that $(x-y)^2 = x^2 - 2xy + y^2$ and $(x+y)^2 = x^2 + 2xy + y^2$. Adding these two equations together gives $(x-y)^2 + (x+y)^2 = 2x^2 + 2y^2$, so $x^2+y^2 = \frac{1}{2} \left( (x+y)^2 + (x-y)^2 \right)$. Substituting this into our expression gives $5 \cdot \frac{1}{2} \left( (x+y)^2 + (x-y)^2 \right) - 8xy = \frac{5}{2}((x+y)^2 + (x-y)^2) - 8xy$.

Now, let's introduce a new variable $s = x+y$ and $t = x-y$. Then $x = \frac{s+t}{2}$ and $y = \frac{s-t}{2}$. We can substitute these into our equation to get $F(s,t) = \frac{5}{2}(s^2 + t^2) - 8 \cdot \frac{1}{4}(s^2 - t^2) = \frac{5}{2}s^2 + \frac{5}{2}t^2 - 2s^2 + 2t^2 = \frac{1}{2}s^2 + \frac{7}{2}t^2$.

Now we want to minimize this expression under the condition $|s| + |-t| = 40$. This simplifies to $|s| + |t| = 40$. This is equivalent to the equation $|s| - |t| = 40$ (since $|a| = |-a|$).

Now, let's consider the equation $|s| - |t| = 40$. If $s$ and $t$ have the same sign (i.e., $st > 0$), then $|s| - |t| = 40$ becomes $s - t = 40$, which gives $t = s - 40$. If $s$ and $t$ have opposite signs (i.e., $st < 0$), then $|s| - |t| = 40$ becomes $s + t = 40$, which gives $t = 40 - s$.

Substituting these into our expression $F(s,t) = \frac{1}{2}s^2 + \frac{7}{2}t^2$, we get two expressions: $F_1(s) = \frac{1}{2}s^2 + \frac{7}{2}(s-40)^2$ and $F_2(s) = \frac{1}{2}s^2 + \frac{7}{2}(40-s)^2$. To find the minimum value of these expressions, we can take the derivative and set it equal to 0.

For $F_1(s)$, the derivative is $F_1'(s) = s + 7(s-40)$. Setting this equal to 0 gives $8s = 280$, so $s = 35$. Substituting this back into $F_1(s)$ gives the minimum value $F_1(35) = \frac{1}{2}(35)^2 + \frac{7}{2}(35-40)^2 = 612.5$.

For $F_2(s)$, the derivative is $F_2'(s) = s + 7(40-s)$. Setting this equal to 0 gives $6s = 280$, so $s = \frac{280}{6} = \frac{140}{3}$. This value doesn't satisfy $|s| + |t| = 40$, so we discard it.

Therefore, the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 612.5 when $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. The answer is: $\boxed{612.5}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we rewrite the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, $|a| + |b| \ge |a+b|$, we have $|2y-x| + |2x-y| \ge |(2y-x) + (2x-y)| = |y| = |2y|/2$.
Thus, we have $|2y-x| + |2x-y| \ge |2y|/2$.
Hence, $40 \ge |2y|/2$, which implies $|2y| \le 80$.
This means $-80 \le 2y \le 80$, or $-40 \le y \le 40$.
Now, we want to find the minimum value of $f(x,y) = 5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.
We can rewrite $f(x,y)$ as $f(x,y) = (5x^2 - 8xy + 5y^2) = (5x^2 - 8xy + 4y^2 + y^2) = ((x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2) = ((x-2y)^2 + (2y-x)^2)$.
By the triangle inequality again, $(x-2y)^2 + (2y-x)^2 \ge 0$, so the minimum value of $f(x,y)$ is $0$.
However, we must check if there exist $x$ and $y$ such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ and $f(x,y) = 0$.
If $f(x,y) = 0$, then $(x-2y)^2 = 0$ and $(2y-x)^2 = 0$, which implies $x = 2y$.
Substituting into the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we have $|x-x| + |y-2x| = 40$, or $|y-2x| = 40$.
But if $x = 2y$, then $|y-2x| = |y-4y| = |-3y| = 3|y|$.
So we have $3|y| = 40$, which implies $|y| = \frac{40}{3}$.
Since $-40 \le y \le 40$, this means $-\frac{40}{3} \le y \le \frac{40}{3}$.
If we let $y = \frac{40}{3}$, then $x = 2y = \frac{80}{3}$, and $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = | \frac{80}{3} - 2\cdot \frac{40}{3} | + | \frac{40}{3} - 2 \cdot \frac{80}{3} | = 40$.
So the minimum value of $f(x,y)$ is 0.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 0.
The answer is: $\boxed{0}$.
