Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's analyze the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.
If we draw the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, it will have three "steps" at $x=1-2 = -1$, $x=1$, and $x=1+2 = 3$.
The function will equal $\frac{m}{100}$ at four distinct points if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ falls strictly between the three "steps".
That is, $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. This inequality simplifies to $0 < m < 200$.
Since $m$ must be a positive integer, the possible values of $m$ are the integers from $1$ to $199$.
To count the number of such integers, we subtract the smallest possible value from the largest possible value and then add 1: $199 - 1 + 1 = 199$.
Thus, there are 199 positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions. The answer is: $199$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions. 
We know that $| |x-1| - 2 |$ can take any value from 0 to 4 (inclusive). 
So, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal to a value in the range of 0 to 4.
This means $m$ must be a multiple of 100 in the range of 0 to 400.
The multiples of 100 in this range are 100, 200, and 300.
Therefore, there are 3 values of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions. The answer is: $3$

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. This is because the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ reaches its maximum value of $2$ and has three unique critical points at $x=1-2 = -1$, $x=1$ and $x=1+2 = 3$.

If we solve $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, we find that $m=200$. Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ that makes the equation have four distinct solutions, and that is $m=200$.
The answer is: $\boxed{1}$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.
First, let's solve the equation when $m=100$. The equation becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=1$.
By the property of absolute value, we can split this into two cases:
Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2=1$. This simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert =3$. Again by the property of absolute value, we split this into two cases:
Subcase 1.1: $x-1=3$ which gives $x=4$.
Subcase 1.2: $x-1=-3$ which gives $x=-2$.
Case 2: $\vert x-1 \vert -2=-1$. This simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert =1$. Similarly, we split this into two cases:
Subcase 2.1: $x-1=1$ which gives $x=2$.
Subcase 2.2: $x-1=-1$ which gives $x=0$.
So when $m=100$, the equation has four distinct solutions: $x=-2, 0, 2, 4$.
For other values of $m$, the right hand side $\frac{m}{100}$ is smaller. The number of solutions will decrease, so we only consider $m=100$.
Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 1. The answer is: 1

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has $4$ distinct solutions.
For $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ to be equal to $\frac{m}{100}$, the absolute value expression $\vert x-1 \vert -2$ must equal either $\frac{m}{100}$ or $-\frac{m}{100}$.
This gives us two separate equations to solve:

1) $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$

Solving this, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100} + 2$.
So $x-1 = \frac{m}{100} + 2$ or $x-1 = -( \frac{m}{100} + 2)$.
Solving these two equations gives us:

$x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$ or $x = 1 - \frac{m}{100} - 2 = 1 - \frac{m}{100} - 2 = - \frac{m}{100} - 1$.

2) $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = - \frac{m}{100}$

Solving this, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
So $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 = -( 2 - \frac{m}{100})$.
Solving these two equations gives us:

$x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ or $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Combining all the solutions, we have: $x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$, $x = - \frac{m}{100} - 1$, $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, and $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

For these four solutions to be distinct, the values of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be different.

This gives us the inequality $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 1$, so $0 < m < 100$.

Thus, the only positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality and make the four solutions distinct are the integers from 1 to 99, inclusive.

Counting the number of these integers, we find there are 99.
The answer is: 99

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


For the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ to have 4 distinct solutions, the right hand side $\frac{m}{100}$ must be positive (since the absolute value of a real number is always non-negative). So we require $m>0$.

Now let's consider the number of solutions of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=k$ where $k>0$ is a real number. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2=k$, then $\vert x-1 \vert=k+2$. This gives us two possible equations:
$1)$ $x-1=k+2$ which implies $x=k+3$.
$2)$ $-(x-1)=k+2$ which implies $x=1-k-2=-k-1$.

Therefore, we have two solutions for $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=k$.

Now substituting $k=\frac{m}{100}$, we have four distinct solutions if we consider each of $k+2$ and $-(k+2)$ and each of $k+3$ and $-k-1$. This means we need two values of $k$ such that $k+2>0$ and $-k-1<0$.

This gives us $0<k<2$, or equivalently $0<\frac{m}{100}<2$, which implies $0<m<200$. 

The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from 1 to 199. The number of such integers is 199. However, we want to find the number of these integers that make the original equation have 4 distinct solutions. Looking back at our work, we see that the number of such $m$ is the number of integers from 1 to 199 which are multiples of 100.

Therefore, there is only one such integer, namely 100. So, there is only one positive integer $m$ which makes the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have 4 distinct solutions. 

So the value of $m$ is 100. The answer is: $\boxed{1}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $2$. This is because the equation inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, takes on the value of $1$ and $-1$ twice each when there are four distinct solutions.

So, $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which implies $100 < m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from $101$ to $199$, inclusive. To count the number of these integers, we subtract the smallest possible value from the largest possible value and add $1$.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$.
The answer is: $99$

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.
This means that the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be equal to $2$.
Therefore, we have $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, which implies $m = 200$.
So, there is only one positive integer $m$ that makes the equation have $4$ distinct solutions, and that is $m = 200$. The answer is: $1$.
