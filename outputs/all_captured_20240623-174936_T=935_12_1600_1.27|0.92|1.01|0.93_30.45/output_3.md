Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points satisfying the given equation, we first need to find the points that satisfy the equation and then calculate the area using those points.
The equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
For this product to be zero, either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.
1) If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which gives $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.
Solving these equations gives us four points: $(8,2)$, $(8,-2)$, $(-8,2)$, and $(-8,-2)$.
2) If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which gives $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
Adding the points from both cases, we have a total of eight points: $(8,2)$, $(8,-2)$, $(-8,2)$, $(-8,-2)$, $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.
To find the area of the convex polygon enclosed by these points, we can create a square with side length 16 units. The vertices of this square are $(8,2)$, $(8,-2)$, $(-8,-2)$, and $(-8,2)$.
The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$ square units.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: 256

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $ab = 0$ implies that at least one of the factors $a$ and $b$ is zero. Therefore, the equality in the given problem can be broken down into two separate cases:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
The square of a real number is zero if and only if the number itself is zero. Therefore, we have:

$\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$.

Which simplifies to:

$\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

This gives us two equations:

1) $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
2) $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.

We can solve these equations to find the vertices of the polygon.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This implies that $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which simplifies to $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us:

$x = 8$ or $x = -8$, and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

This gives us the vertices of the polygon.

Plotting these vertices and drawing the lines connecting them, we find that the polygon is a square with side length $20$. The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side, so the area of the polygon is $20^2 = 400$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $400$. The answer is: $400$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's analyze the given equation. The product of two expressions is zero if and only if at least one of the expressions is zero. So we have two cases:
Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. That means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get four lines: $y = x + 10$, $y = x - 10$, $y = -x + 10$, and $y = -x - 10$.
Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. That means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So we have four more lines: $y = 8$, $y = -8$, $x = 8$, and $x = -8$.
These eight lines enclose a rectangle with side lengths $20$ and $16$. So the area of the rectangle is $20 \times 16 = 320$. The answer is: $320$

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



This problem is asking us to find the area of a region defined by a set of inequalities. We can start by analyzing the conditions given.

First, consider the equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. The square of a real number is zero if and only if the number itself is zero. So, for this equation to hold, we need both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. This means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

Next, consider the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. Again, the square of a real number is zero if and only if the number itself is zero. So, for this equation to hold, we need both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. This means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

These eight lines form a rectangle in the coordinate plane with vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(8, -8)$. The sides of this rectangle have length 16 and width 16, so its area is $16 \times 16 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points satisfying the given conditions is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if at least one of the factors is zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that both $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$. Solving these equations gives the points $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, and $(-5,-5)$.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that both $x = 8$ or $x = -8$ and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. This gives the points $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

Plotting these points, we can see that they form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100.
The answer is: $100$.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Thus, the equation is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The first two equations imply $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which describe squares in the coordinate plane.
The last two equations imply $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which describe two squares in the coordinate plane.
The intersection of these squares forms a convex polygon, and the area of this polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares.
The side length of the square with equation $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ is 10 (since the distance from $(0,0)$ to $(10,0)$ or $(0,10)$ is 10), so its area is $10^2 = 100$.
Similarly, the side length of the square with equation $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ is also 10, so its area is also 100.
The side length of the square with equation $\vert x \vert = 8$ is 8 (since the distance from $(0,0)$ to $(8,0)$ or $(0,8)$ is 8), so its area is $8^2 = 64$.
The side length of the square with equation $\vert y \vert = 8$ is also 8, so its area is 64.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $100 + 100 + 64 + 64 = 332$.
The answer is: $332$

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ equals to zero if and only if at least one of the factors equals zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving this system of equations gives us the vertices of the rectangle: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Adding these points to the vertices of the rectangle gives us a square with side length $16$.

The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: 256

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



We have the product of two terms equal to zero, which means either the first term is zero, or the second term is zero. So we have two cases:
Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
This means $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. That is, $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
For the equation $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, the points $(x, y)$ form a square with vertices at $(5, 5)$, $(-5, 5)$, $(-5, -5)$, $(5, -5)$.
Similarly, for the equation $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, the points $(x, y)$ form a square with vertices at $(5, -5)$, $(-5, -5)$, $(-5, 5)$, $(5, 5)$.
Therefore, the solution set of this case is the square formed by the points $(x, y)$ with vertices at $(5, 5)$, $(-5, 5)$, $(-5, -5)$, $(5, -5)$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
This means $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. That is, $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The points $(x, y)$ form a square with vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, $(8, -8)$.

Now we need to find the intersection of these two squares. The intersection of the two squares is the square with vertices at $(5, 5)$, $(-5, 5)$, $(-5, -5)$, $(5, -5)$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon formed by the solution set is the area of this square.

The side length of this square is $10$, because the distance from any vertex to the origin is $\sqrt{5^2+5^2} = \sqrt{50} = 5\sqrt{2}$, which is equal to the distance from the origin to $(5, 5)$, or $(-5, -5)$, or $(5, -5)$, or $(-5, 5)$.

The area of the square is the square of the side length, which is $10^2 = 100$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's understand what the equation is saying. The equation is equal to zero, so one of the factors must be zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

Each of these equations will be zero when the absolute value expressions equal 10 or 8. This gives us the following possible solutions:

1. $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, $y = -8$.

2. $x - y = 10$, $x - y = -10$, $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, $y = -8$.

3. $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, $y = -8$.

4. $y = 8$, $y = -8$, $x = 8$, $x = -8$.

By solving these systems of equations, we find that the solutions are:

1. $(5, 5)$, $(-5, -5)$, $(8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, $(0, -8)$, $(8, 0)$.

2. $(9, -1)$, $(-9, 1)$, $(8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, $(0, -8)$, $(8, 0)$.

3. $(8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, $(-8, 0)$, $(0, -8)$.

4. $(0, 8)$, $(8, 0)$, $(0, -8)$, $(-8, 0)$.

These points are all the vertices of the polygon. To find the area, we can draw the polygon on a coordinate plane and use the formula for the area of a polygon given its vertices:

$$Area = \frac{1}{2} \left| \sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i) \right|,$$
where $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), \ldots, (x_n, y_n)$ are the vertices of the polygon, with the understanding that $(x_{n+1}, y_{n+1}) = (x_1, y_1)$.

By calculating the area of the polygon using this formula, we find that the area is 128 square units. The positive numerical answer is $\boxed{128}$.
The answer is: $128$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to $0$ if and only if at least one of the factors is equal to $0$. Therefore, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, so $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. This means $x = y = \pm 5$.
If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, so $x = y = \pm 8$.
Therefore, the points that satisfy the equation are $(\pm 5, \pm 5)$ and $(\pm 8, \pm 8)$. These points form a square with side length $10$, so its area is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $\boxed{100}$.
