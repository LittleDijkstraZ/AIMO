"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

This problem asks for the area of a polygon formed by the points that satisfy a specific condition. The condition is that the product of two expressions equals zero, which means each of the two expressions must be zero. This gives us four separate conditions that we need to analyze:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From conditions 1 and 2, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that the points lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$.

From conditions 3 and 4, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that the points lie on the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$.

The intersection of these lines form a square with side length 10 (from the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$) and vertices at $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, -2)$, and $(-8, 2)$. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. So, the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

 The problem statement implies that the points satisfying the equation are the vertices of a polygon. The equation is equal to zero when either of the two factors are equal to zero. 

Let's analyze the two factors separately:

1. The first factor, $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$, implies that both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which further simplifies to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This results in a square with side length 20.

2. The second factor, $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$, implies that both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which further simplifies to $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This results in a square with side length 16.

The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for. The area of the convex polygon is the area of the square with side length 20 minus the area of the square with side length 16.

The area of a square is given by side length squared, so the area of the larger square is $20^2 = 400$, and the area of the smaller square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $400 - 256 = 144$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 144. The answer is: $\boxed{144}$

The equation given is a product of two terms equal to zero, which means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.

Let's analyze each term:

1. For the first term, we have $|x+y|-10=0$ and $|x-y|-10=0$. This implies that $|x+y|=10$ and $|x-y|=10$. Solving these two equations gives us four lines: $x+y=10$, $x+y=-10$, $x-y=10$, and $x-y=-10$. These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(10,0)$, $(0,10)$, $(-10,0)$, and $(0,-10)$.

2. For the second term, we have $|x|-8=0$ and $|y|-8=0$. This implies that $|x|=8$ and $|y|=8$. Solving these two equations gives us four lines: $x=8$, $x=-8$, $y=8$, and $y=-8$. These lines form a square with vertices at $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

The intersection of the regions defined by the two terms is the convex polygon we are looking for. This polygon is the intersection of the rectangle and the square, which is a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is equivalent to the product of two equations being zero, which implies that each factor must be zero. Thus we have two systems of equations:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From the first system, we get $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$. This implies $-10 \leq x + y \leq 10$ and $-8 \leq x \leq 8$. Similarly, from the second system, we get $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies $-10 \leq x - y \leq 10$ and $-8 \leq y \leq 8$.

The solution set of the given equation consists of all points $(x, y)$ that satisfy either of these systems of inequalities. The set of points satisfying these inequalities is a square with side length 16. Therefore, the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is true if and only if either of the two factors is zero.

The first factor is zero when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of a square with side length 10 and diagonals of length $10\sqrt{2}$.

The second factor is zero when $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$, which are the equations of a square with side length 8 and diagonals of length $8\sqrt{2}$.

The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for. The side length of this polygon is the smaller side length of the two squares, which is 8. The diagonals of this polygon are the shorter diagonals of the two squares, which have length $8\sqrt{2}$.

The area of a square is given by $(side length)^2$, so the area of this polygon is $8^2 = 64$. The answer is: $64$ square units.

Here is a Python function that calculates the area of the polygon:
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    side_length = 8
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output

```
The area of the convex polygon is 64 square units. The answer is: $64$ square units.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. Therefore, one of the terms must be zero for the entire equation to be zero. This gives us two conditions to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first condition, both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ must be zero. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us four lines: $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.

For the second condition, both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2$ must be zero. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us four lines: $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""

The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so the equation is satisfied if either of the expressions is zero.

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. This expression is zero if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These conditions define a square with side length 20.

The second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. This expression is zero if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These conditions define a square with side length 16.

The intersection of these two squares is a square with side length 8. The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$. So the area of the convex polygon is 64.

```python

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The expression $A \cdot B = 0$ is true if and only if $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to the system of equations
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0,\]
\[((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]
From the first equation, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we find that the points satisfying these conditions are $(5, 5), (5, -5), (-5, 5),$ and $(-5, -5)$.
From the second equation, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations, we find that the points satisfying these conditions are $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8),$ and $(-8, -8)$.
The points that satisfy both systems of equations are $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8),$ and $(-8, -8)$. These points form a square with side length $16$. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, which means either of the expressions must be zero. So we have two sets of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first set of equations, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us four lines in the coordinate plane: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length 10. The vertices of the square are $(0, 10)$, $(10, 0)$, $(0, -10)$, and $(-10, 0)$.

For the second set of equations, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us four lines in the coordinate plane: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length 16. The vertices of this square are $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The intersection of the two squares is a smaller square with side length 6. The area of this square is $6^2 = 36$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 36. The answer is: $36$

The given equation is equal to zero if either of the factors is equal to zero. This means we have two sets of equations to solve:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first set of equations, we get:
- $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, so $x + y = \pm 10$.
- $\vert x \vert = 8$, so $x = \pm 8$.
- $\vert y \vert = 8$, so $y = \pm 8$.

For the second set of equations, we get:
- $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, so $x - y = \pm 10$.
- $\vert x \vert = 8$, so $x = \pm 8$.
- $\vert y \vert = 8$, so $y = \pm 8$.

By analyzing these equations, we find that the points that satisfy them are the vertices of a square with side length 16. Therefore, the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$
