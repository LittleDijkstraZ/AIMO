 The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions.

Let's analyze the equation. The expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a piecewise function that takes on the value $0$ when $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$, takes on the value $1$ when $1 < \vert x-1 \vert < 3$, and takes on the value $2$ when $\vert x-1 \vert \geq 3$. This means the equation has four distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ equals $0$, $1$, or $2$.

Solving these equations, we get $m = 0$, $100$, or $200$. However, $m=0$ is not a positive integer. So, there is only one positive integer $m$ that makes the equation have four distinct solutions, which is $100$.

The answer is: 1

 The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

To start, let's consider the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. This equation is equivalent to a piecewise function that splits into four cases depending on the value of $x$:
1. If $x \le 1$, then $\vert -(x-1) - 2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\vert 3-x \vert = \frac{m}{100}$.
2. If $1 < x \le 3$, then $\vert x-1 - 2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\vert x-3 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$.
3. If $3 < x \le 5$, then $\vert -(x-1) - 2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\vert 3-x \vert = \frac{m}{100}$.
4. If $x > 5$, then $\vert x-1 - 2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\vert x-3 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$.

Each of these cases gives two equations: one for when the absolute value is positive and one for when it is negative.
For the first case, we have $3 - x = \frac{m}{100}$ and $x - 3 = \frac{m}{100}$.
For the second case, we have $x - 3 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $3 - x = \frac{m}{100}$.
For the third and fourth cases, the equations are the same as the first two cases, but with the inequalities reversed.

Each of these equations has two solutions for $x$, so the total number of solutions to the original equation is 8.
If these solutions are all distinct, then the equation has 4 distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when $m = 100$.
So, there is only one positive integer $m$ that satisfies this condition. The answer is: $1$

 This problem is a challenging one and requires a deep understanding of the absolute value function and its properties.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions, it implies that the value inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, will become zero three times in the interval from $0$ to $4$. This is because the absolute value function reaches its minimum at $0$.

We can set up the equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$ for the first time the expression equals zero, $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 0$ for the second time it equals zero, and $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ for the third time it equals zero.

By solving these three equations, we can find the values of $m$.

The first equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$ has no solution because the absolute value function is always non-negative, so $\vert x-1 \vert -2$ cannot be negative.

The second equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 0$ simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$. This gives us two solutions: $x = 3$ and $x = -1$. However, we are only interested in the positive solution $x = 3$.

The third equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ gives us $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. For $x = 3$, we have $2 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\frac{m}{100} = 0$, so $m = 0$. This is not possible because $m$ should be a positive integer.

For $x = -1$, we have $2 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\frac{m}{100} = 0$, so $m = 0$ again. This is not possible either.

However, we can try another approach. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be rewritten as $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \pm \frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two equations: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.

The first equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. For $x = 3$, we have $2 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\frac{m}{100} = 0$, so $m = 0$ again. This is not possible.

For $x = -1$, we have $2 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\frac{m}{100} = 0$, so $m = 0$ again. This is not possible either.

However, for the second equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. For $x = 3$, we have $2 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\frac{m}{100} = 0$, so $m = 0$ again. This is not possible.

For $x = -1$, we have $2 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\frac{m}{100} = 0$, so $m = 0$ again. This is not possible either.

We can conclude that there is no solution for $m$ that satisfies the conditions of the problem. However, we made a mistake in our analysis. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions when $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which means $0 < m < 200$. The only positive integer $m$ in this interval is $100$.

So, the value of $m$ that satisfies the condition of the problem is $100$. The answer is: $1$

Assistant:

 This problem is about finding the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly four distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be rewritten as $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. The absolute value equation $\vert y \vert = a$ has two solutions $y = a$ and $y = -a$. Therefore, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be rewritten as two separate absolute value equations: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.

For each of these equations, we can add $2$ to both sides to isolate the absolute value: $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.

The absolute value equation $\vert x-1 \vert = a$ has two solutions $x = 1 + a$ and $x = 1 - a$. Therefore, the equations $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ can be rewritten as $x = 1 \pm (2 + \frac{m}{100})$ and $x = 1 \pm (2 - \frac{m}{100})$.

Simplifying these expressions gives $x = 1 \pm (2 + \frac{m}{100})$ as $x = 3 \pm \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = 1 \pm (2 - \frac{m}{100})$ as $x = -1 \pm \frac{m}{100}$.

For the equation to have four distinct solutions, the expressions $3 \pm \frac{m}{100}$ and $-1 \pm \frac{m}{100}$ must not have any common solutions. This means that the absolute values of the expressions must be different: $|3 \pm \frac{m}{100}| \neq |-1 \pm \frac{m}{100}|$.

Simplifying these absolute values gives $|3 \pm \frac{m}{100}| = 3 \pm \frac{m}{100}$ and $|-1 \pm \frac{m}{100}| = 1 \pm \frac{m}{100}$.

Setting up the inequality $|3 \pm \frac{m}{100}| \neq |-1 \pm \frac{m}{100}|$ gives $3 \pm \frac{m}{100} \neq 1 \pm \frac{m}{100}$.

Solving this inequality gives $2 \neq 0$, which is always true. Therefore, the inequality $|3 \pm \frac{m}{100}| \neq |-1 \pm \frac{m}{100}|$ is always true.

This means that the expressions $3 \pm \frac{m}{100}$ and $-1 \pm \frac{m}{100}$ must have different absolute values for the equation to have four distinct solutions. This happens when the distances from $1$ to $3$ and $-1$ are different. The distance from $1$ to $3$ is $2$, and the distance from $1$ to $-1$ is $2$.

Therefore, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100} = 2$ or $\frac{m}{100} = 4$.

Solving these equations gives $m = 200$ or $m = 400$. Therefore, there are two positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions. The number of such $m$ is 2.

So the answer is $\boxed{2}$.

Here is a Python code to solve the problem:
```python

def find_m():
    m_values = []
    for m in range(1, 101):
        if (2 + m/100) != (2 - m/100):
            m_values.append(m)
    return len(m_values)

m_values = find_m()
print(m_values)
```

CODE RESULTS 100

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
100
```
The code finds all the values of $m$ from $1$ to $100$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions. However, it seems that the condition $|3 \pm \frac{m}{100}| \neq |-1 \pm \frac{m}{100}|$ is always true for $m$ from $1$ to $100$. This means that all the values of $m$ from $1$ to $100$ should be valid. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is $100$. This result contradicts the expected result of $2$. 

After analyzing the problem, we realized that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ actually has four distinct solutions when the distances from $1$ to $3$ and $-1$ are different, which is not the case for all values of $m$ from $1$ to $100$.

We should have checked the condition $|3 \pm \frac{m}{100}| \neq |-1 \pm \frac{m}{100}|$ for the specific values of $m$ that we found in the code. However, we didn't do that in the initial code. 

Let's correct this and re-evaluate the problem. 

We found that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100} = 2$ or $\frac{m}{100} = 4$.

Solving these equations gives $m = 200$ or $m = 400$. 

So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is 2.

The correct output should be $2$.

The previous code was not correct because it found all the values of $m$ from $1$ to $100$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions, which led to the wrong result.

After analyzing and reevaluating the problem, we found the correct solution. The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac

Assistant:


The given equation is a piecewise function, which can be written as follows:

- If $x - 1 \geq 2$, then the equation becomes $\vert x - 1 - 2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert x - 3 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$. This simplifies to two equations: $x - 3 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $x - 3 = -\frac{m}{100}$.
- If $1 - 2 \leq x - 1 < 2$, then the equation becomes $\vert - (x - 1) - 2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert - x + 1 - 2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert - x - 1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$. This simplifies to two equations: $-x - 1 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $-x - 1 = -\frac{m}{100}$.
- If $x - 1 < 1 - 2$, then the equation becomes $\vert x - 1 - 2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert x - 1 - 2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert x - 3 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$. This simplifies to two equations: $x - 3 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $x - 3 = -\frac{m}{100}$.

Solving the four equations above, we find that each of them has two solutions. So, the total number of solutions for the original equation is 8. For the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, we need to remove two of these solutions. This occurs when the right-hand side of the equation is equal to 2 or 4. 

For $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, we have $m = 200$. For $\frac{m}{100} = 4$, we have $m = 400$. So, the values of $m$ that satisfy the condition are $m = 200$ and $m = 400$. Therefore, there are 2 positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions.

Assistant:

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly less than 2 but strictly greater than 0. This is because the expression on the left side of the equation is always non-negative and takes on the value of 0, 1, or 2. If $\frac{m}{100}$ is 0 or greater than 2, then the equation will have fewer than 4 distinct solutions. If $\frac{m}{100}$ is less than 0, then the expression on the left side of the equation will be undefined. Therefore, we need $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Multiplying all parts of the inequality by 100 gives $0 < m < 200$. The number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality is 199. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 199.
The answer is: $199$

 The equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. This is because the expression $| |x - 1| - 2 |$ takes on the value of $2$ exactly four times. 

To find $m$, we simply solve the equation $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. Multiplying both sides by $100$ gives us $m = 200$.

So, the value of $m$ that makes the equation have four distinct solutions is $200$. The answer is: $200$.

 To solve this problem, we first need to understand the number of solutions of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. The number of solutions depends on the value of $\frac{m}{100}$. 

The expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is equal to 0 when $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$, which gives us two solutions $x = 3$ and $x = -1$. The expression is equal to 1 when $\vert x-1 \vert = 3$, which gives us two solutions $x = 4$ and $x = -2$. The expression is equal to 2 when $\vert x-1 \vert = 4$, which gives us two solutions $x = 5$ and $x = -3$. 

So, for the equation to have four distinct solutions, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal to 1. Therefore, $m = 100$.

Assistant:

 The problem is asking for how many values of $m$ does the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have $4$ distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is a piecewise function. We can break it down into three cases:
1. When $\vert x-1 \vert -2 > 0$, the equation becomes $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$.
2. When $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 0$, the equation becomes $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$, which has two solutions $x=3$ and $x=-1$.
3. When $\vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0$, the equation becomes $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = \frac{m}{100}$.

For the first case, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which gives us two solutions $x = 1 + 2 + \frac{m}{100} = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = 1 - 2 - \frac{m}{100} = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

For the third case, we have $-\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which gives us two solutions $x = 1 + 2 - \frac{m}{100} = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = 1 - 2 + \frac{m}{100} = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

So, the four distinct solutions are $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$, $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$, $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, and $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

For the equation to have four distinct solutions, the expressions inside the absolute values in the first and third cases must be equal to each other, i.e., $2 + \frac{m}{100} = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. Solving this gives $m = 0$, which is not a valid solution as it would make the equation unsolvable.

However, we can notice that the expressions inside the absolute values in the first and third cases must also be equal to the absolute value in the second case, i.e., $2 + \frac{m}{100} = 2$ and $2 - \frac{m}{100} = 2$. Solving these gives $m = 0$ and $m = 0$ respectively, which are not valid solutions.

The expressions inside the absolute values in the first and third cases must also be equal to each other and equal to the absolute value in the second case, i.e., $2 + \frac{m}{100} = 2$ and $2 - \frac{m}{100} = 2$. Solving these gives $m = 0$ and $m = 0$ respectively, which are not valid solutions.

 The number of distinct solutions of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ equals to $4$ if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is a number from the interval $(0,3)$. This is because the expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ can take on exactly $4$ distinct values: $0$, $1$, $2$, and $3$. Therefore, we must have $0<\frac{m}{100}<3$, which gives $0<m<300$. The positive integers $m$ satisfying this inequality are exactly the integers from $1$ to $299$.

We can calculate the number of these integers using the formula for the number of integers from $a$ to $b$: $b - a + 1$. So, the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $299 - 1 + 1 = 299$. The answer is: $299$.

Assistant:

 The number of distinct solutions to the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to 4 if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to 2. This is because the expression on the left side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, can take on values from 0 to 4, and it takes on the value of 2 exactly 4 times. Therefore, we have $\frac{m}{100}=2$, which implies $m=200$. So the only positive integer value of $m$ that satisfies the condition is 200. The answer is: $200$

The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be interpreted as a piecewise function with four cases to consider:

1. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 > 0$, then the equation becomes $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$.
2. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0$, then the equation becomes $-( \vert x-1 \vert -2 ) = \frac{m}{100}$.
3. If $x-1 > 0$, then the first equation becomes $x-1 -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, and the second equation becomes $-(x-1 -2) = \frac{m}{100}$.
4. If $x-1 < 0$, then the first equation becomes $-(x-1) -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, and the second equation becomes $-( -(x-1) -2 ) = \frac{m}{100}$.

Solving these four cases, we find that the equation has four distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, which gives $m = 200$.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation has four distinct solutions is 1, and the answer is $\boxed{1}$. The answer is: $1$
