 We will solve this problem using Python and the sympy library. The steps are as follows:

1. Find the x-coordinates of points A and B by solving the equation $k{x^2} - 2kx + l = 4$.
2. Calculate the distances from A and B to the origin using the Pythagorean theorem.
3. Square these distances and find their sum.

Here is the Python code to achieve this:

```python

The calculation seems to have failed as the error shows that the `sqrt()` function cannot handle `Mul` objects, which is the result of the `sum(abs(pt)**2 for pt in point)` calculation. This is because the `intersection_points` contains `Mul` objects, which represent the product of `k` and `l` from the `solve()` function. It is not possible to apply `sqrt()` directly to `Mul` objects without additional information. 

A possible way to solve this problem would be to first solve the system of equations obtained from the `derivatives` to get the values for `k` and `l`, then substitute these values into either the equation for the intersection points or the equation for the distances, and finally calculate the sum of squares of the distances. However, this would require additional steps and might not simplify the problem. 

A better way to approach this problem would be to utilize the given information about the distance between points $A$ and $B$ being $6$. This can be written as a constraint equation: $||A - B|| = 6$. Then, instead of calculating the distances of the intersections from the origin directly, we can use the distance formula to rewrite the sum of squares of the distances in terms of $k$, $l$, and the coordinates of the intersection points. Then, we can substitute the constraint equation into this expression and minimize it.

This approach might be more computationally intensive, but it has the potential to provide a more direct and efficient solution. It would involve using calculus to minimize the function, which would involve the use of the first and second derivative tests and possibly numerical methods if an explicit solution is not found.

If you come up with a solution to this problem using this approach, please consider sharing it with the community.

Unfortunately, with the given problem, I cannot provide a numerical answer as it depends on the values of $k$ and $l$. However, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin can be expressed as $4*k^2/l - 2*k + 8*k/l + 32$, which simplifies to $4k^2/l - 2k + 8k/l + 32$.

It seems there was a mistake in the code. The `solve` function is not returning a valid list of solutions. The problem is likely due to the fact that we are trying to solve a system of three equations with only two variables, which is not a valid setup. However, we can still solve the problem analytically.

The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$ if and only if the discriminant of the quadratic equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$ is non-negative. The discriminant is given by $D = 4k^2 - 4k(l - 4) = 4k(2k - l + 4)$. 

The points $A$ and $B$ are distance 6 apart if and only if $|x_1 - x_2| = 6$, where $x_1$ and $x_2$ are the x-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$. From the quadratic formula, we have $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k}$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$. Substituting $x_1 + x_2$ and $x_1x_2$ into the equation for $|x_1 - x_2|$, we get $\left(\frac{2k}{k}\right)^2 - 4\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = 36$. 

Simplifying, we get $4 - \frac{4(l - 4)}{k} = 36$, which simplifies to $l = -\frac{1}{2}k + 10$. 

The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $x_1^2 + y_1^2 + x_2^2 + y_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 + 2(x_1x_2) + 2(y_1^2 + y_2^2)$. Since $y_1 = y_2 = 4$, this simplifies to $(x_1 + x_2)^2 + 2(x_1x_2) + 2(16)$. 

Substituting the expressions for $x_1 + x_2$ and $x_1x_2$ in terms of $k$ and $l$, we get $\left(\frac{2k}{k}\right)^2 + 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) + 32$. 

Substituting $l = -\frac{1}{2}k + 10$, we get $\left(\frac{2k}{k}\right)^2 + 2\left(\frac{-\frac{1}{2}k + 6}{k}\right) + 32 = 4 + k + 12 + 32 = k + 48$. 

Since $k > 0$, the sum of the squares of the distances is minimized when $k$ is minimized. The minimum value of $k$ is achieved when the discriminant $D = 4k(2k - l + 4) = 0$, which gives $k = \frac{1}{2}(l - 4)$. 

Substituting $l = -\frac{1}{2}k + 10$, we get $k = \frac{1}{2}(-\frac{1}{2}k + 6)$. Solving for $k$, we get $k = 4$. 

Substituting $k = 4$ into $k + 48$, we get $52$. 

Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $\boxed{52}$.

The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $\boxed{(k - \sqrt{k(k - l + 4)})^2/k^2 + (k + \sqrt{k(k - l + 4)})^2/k^2}$.

These expressions depend on the parameters $k$ and $l$, so we need to find their values. We know that the points $A$ and $B$ are distance 6 apart, so we can set up the equation $|(k - \sqrt{k(k - l + 4)}) - (k + \sqrt{k(k - l + 4)})| = 6$ and solve for $k$ and $l$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 To solve this problem, we can break it down into several steps:

1. Find the intersection points of the parabola and the line.
2. Calculate the distance between the points.
3. Find the coordinates of the points with respect to the origin.
4. Calculate the sum of the squares of the distances from the points to the origin.

Let's start by writing the Python code for each step:

```python

Unfortunately, the above result cannot be directly numerically evaluated. However, we can find a numerical solution by setting the difference in distance (6) equal to the difference in the roots of the equation and setting the result equal to the difference in the squares of the distances from A and B to the origin. This will give us a numerical result.

Let's solve the problem step by step.

1. We have two points A and B, which are the intersections of the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ and the line $y = 4$.
2. Since these two points are 6 units apart, we can write the equation $|x_1 - x_2| = 6$, where $x_1$ and $x_2$ are the x-coordinates of points A and B, respectively.
3. We know that the roots of the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$ are $x_1$ and $x_2$.
4. Therefore, we can write the equation $|x_1 - x_2| = \sqrt{k^2 - 4(k)(l - 4)} = 6$.
5. Squaring both sides of the equation, we get $(x_1 - x_2)^2 = k^2 - 4(k)(l - 4) = 36$.
6. Since $x_1$ and $x_2$ are the roots of the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$, we can write $(x_1 - x_2)^2 = 4k(2k - l + 4)$.
7. Therefore, we have $4k(2k - l + 4) = 36$.
8. Solving this equation for $k$, we get $k = \frac{36}{4(2k - l + 4)} = \frac{9}{2k - l + 4}$.
9. Substituting this value of $k$ into the equation for the sum of the squares of the distances from A and B to the origin, we get $2\left(\frac{9}{2k - l + 4}\right)(2k - l + 4) = 18$.
10. Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from A and B to the origin is $\boxed{18}$.

Note: This solution doesn't take into account the constraint that $k$ and $l$ must be positive. However, given that the parabola and the line intersect at two points, it's reasonable to assume that $k$ and $l$ will satisfy this constraint.

Assistant:

 We can solve this problem step by step.

Step 1: Find the coordinates of points $A$ and $B$.

The parabola intersects the line $y=4$ at two points $A$ and $B$, so we can set $y=4$ and solve the equation $4=kx^2-2kx+l$ to get the $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$. The solutions of this equation are the $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$.

Step 2: Calculate the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin.

The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin $(0, 0)$ is given by $\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$. So the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin are $\sqrt{(x_1)^2+(4)^2}$ and $\sqrt{(x_2)^2+(4)^2}$, respectively, where $x_1$ and $x_2$ are the $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$.

Step 3: Calculate the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin.

The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $(x_1)^2+16+(x_2)^2+16$.

Let's implement these steps in Python to solve the problem.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:

1. Set up the equations for the parabola and the line.
2. Find the coordinates of points A and B.
3. Calculate the distances from A and B to the origin.
4. Calculate the sum of the squares of the distances.

Let's start by setting up the equations for the parabola and the line.

The parabola is given by $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$.
The line is given by $y = 4$.

To find the intersection points, we set the equations equal to each other:

$kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$

Since the parabola intersects the line at two points, we can find the x-coordinates of these points by solving the quadratic equation:

$kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$

Let's call the roots of this equation $x_1$ and $x_2$. Since the points $A$ and $B$ are distance 6 apart, we have:

$|x_1 - x_2| = 6$

Now, we can calculate the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin.

The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is given by $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$.

So, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is:

$(x_1^2 + y_1^2) + (x_2^2 + y_2^2)$

Substituting $y = 4$ into the equation of the parabola, we get:

$y_1^2 = kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l$
$y_2^2 = kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l$

Now, we can substitute these expressions into the equation for the sum of the squares of the distances:

$(x_1^2 + kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l) + (x_2^2 + kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)$

Simplifying this expression, we get:

$(1 + k)x_1^2 + (1 + k)x_2^2 - 2k(x_1 + x_2) + 2l$

Since $x_1$ and $x_2$ are roots of the quadratic equation, their sum is equal to the coefficient of the linear term divided by the coefficient of the quadratic term:

$x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$

Substituting this into the expression for the sum of the squares of the distances, we get:

$(1 + k)(2)^2 - 2k(2) + 2l = 4(1 + k) - 4k + 2l$

Finally, we substitute the value of $l$ from the equation of the parabola:

$l = 4 - kx^2 + 2kx$

Substituting this into the expression for the sum of the squares of the distances, we get:

$4(1 + k) - 4k + 2(4 - kx^2 + 2kx) = 4 + 4k - 4k + 8 - 2kx^2 + 4kx = 12 - 2kx^2 + 4kx$

Since $k$ and $x$ are positive, the sum of the squares of the distances is a positive numerical value. However, without knowing the specific values of $k$ and $x$, we cannot determine the numerical value.

The answer is $\boxed{12 - 2kx^2 + 4kx}$.
