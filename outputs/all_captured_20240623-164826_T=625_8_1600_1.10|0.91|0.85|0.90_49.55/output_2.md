To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, let's define the equation:
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solve, Eq, Abs, N

def number_of_solutions():
    x = symbols('x')
    m = symbols('m', integer=True)

    # Define the equation
    equation = Eq(Abs(Abs(x - 1) - 2), m / 100)

    # Initialize the count of distinct solutions
    count = 0

    # Iterate over possible values of m
    for possible_m in range(1, 101):
        # Substitute the value of m into the equation
        equation_substituted = equation.subs(m, possible_m)

        # Solve the equation
        solutions = solve(equation_substituted, x)

        # Count the number of distinct solutions
        distinct_solutions = len(set(N(sol.evalf()) for sol in solutions))

        # If there are 4 distinct solutions, increment the count
        if distinct_solutions == 4:
            count += 1

    return count

result = number_of_solutions()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 100

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
100
```
The number of positive integers m for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $100$.
The answer is: 100

 We know that the absolute value function has a characteristic "V" shape. The equation $|x-1| - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$ can have 4 distinct solutions if the right-hand side $\frac{m}{100}$ falls into a certain range of values.

First, we need to find the range of $m$ such that the equation $|x-1| - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. To do this, we can analyze the equation $|x-1| - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$.

1. $|x-1| - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$ can be written as $|x-1| = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.
2. The expression $|x-1|$ is equal to a value that is always greater than or equal to $0$. So, the right-hand side $2 + \frac{m}{100}$ must be greater than $0$, which gives us $m > -200$.
3. The equation $|x-1| = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when $0 < 2 + \frac{m}{100} < 2$.
4. Solving $0 < 2 + \frac{m}{100} < 2$ gives $-200 < m < 0$.

So, the possible values of $m$ are the positive integers from 1 to 199. Therefore, there are 199 positive integers $m$ such that the equation $|x-1| - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. The answer is: $199$.

We need to analyze the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ and count the number of distinct solutions for each positive integer $m$ that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can have at most 4 distinct solutions because the absolute value function compresses a line segment to a line segment of the same length but with a slope of $-1$. This means that the function can have at most 4 "pieces" that are each flat line segments.

To count the number of positive integers $m$ that make the equation have 4 distinct solutions, we need to analyze the equation. The right side of the equation is a fraction with a denominator of 100, which means that the numerator $m$ must be a multiple of 100 for the right side to be a positive number. The smallest such $m$ is 100, and the largest is 300.

Now we need to find the values of $m$ that make the equation have 4 distinct solutions. This can be done by graphing the left side of the equation and observing the number of distinct solutions for each $m$.

Through analysis, we find that the only values of $m$ that make the equation have 4 distinct solutions are $m=100$ and $m=300$. Therefore, there are 2 positive integers $m$ that make the equation have 4 distinct solutions. The answer is: $2$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is in the interval $(0,2)$. This is because the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a maximum value of 2 and a minimum value of 0. If the right-hand side of the equation is less than or equal to 0 or greater than 2, the equation will have either 0 or 2 solutions, respectively. 

Therefore, we need to find all positive integers $m$ such that $\frac{m}{100} \in (0,2)$. 

Multiplying all parts of the inequality by 100, we have $0 < m < 200$. 

The number of positive integers $m$ in this range is 199. 

But we are done here, as the question asked for a numerical answer. The number of positive integers $m$ that make the equation have 4 distinct solutions is $199$.

Therefore, the answer is $199$. We will print the result as:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

print(199)
```

The number of positive integers $m$ that make the equation have 4 distinct solutions is $199$. The answer is: $199$
