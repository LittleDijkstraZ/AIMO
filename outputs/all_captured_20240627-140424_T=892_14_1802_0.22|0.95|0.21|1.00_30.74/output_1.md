Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 To solve this problem, we can use the method of completing the square. First, let's rewrite the given expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as follows:
\[5x^2+5y^2-8xy = \frac{1}{2}((x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2).\]
Now, let's analyze the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. This constraint implies that $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2 = 40^2 = 1600$.

So, we have:
\[5x^2+5y^2-8xy = \frac{1}{2}(x-2y)^2 + \frac{1}{2}(y-2x)^2 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 1600 = 800.\]

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 800. The answer is: $800$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, we need to solve the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. This equation is equivalent to $|x-2y| = 20 - |y-2x|$. 

Now, let's denote $u = x - 2y$ and $v = y - 2x$. Then we have $|u| = 20 - |v|$. 

We know that $|u| + |v| = 20$, so we have two cases:

1. If $u \geq 0$ and $v \geq 0$, then $u + v = 20$.
2. If $u < 0$ and $v < 0$, then $-u - v = 20$.

Now, let's substitute $u = x - 2y$ and $v = y - 2x$ back into the equations:

1. If $x - 2y \geq 0$ and $y - 2x \geq 0$, then $x - 2y + y - 2x = 20$, which simplifies to $-x - y = 20$.
2. If $x - 2y < 0$ and $y - 2x < 0$, then $-(x - 2y) - (y - 2x) = 20$, which simplifies to $x + y = 20$.

Now, we need to find the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under these conditions. 

We can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. Define a new function $F(x, y, \lambda) = 5x^2+5y^2-8xy - \lambda(x + y - 20)$. 

Taking partial derivatives with respect to $x$, $y$, and $\lambda$, and setting them equal to zero, we get:

$\frac{\partial F}{\partial x} = 10x - 8y - \lambda = 0$
$\frac{\partial F}{\partial y} = 10y - 8x - \lambda = 0$
$\frac{\partial F}{\partial \lambda} = x + y - 20 = 0$

Solving this system of equations, we find that the minimum occurs at $(x, y) = (10, 10)$. 

Substituting these values into the original expression, we get $5(10)^2 + 5(10)^2 - 8(10)(10) = 1000 - 800 = 200$.

So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 200. The answer is: $200$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Find the minimum value of $2x^2 + 2y^2 + 5z^2 - 2xy - 4yz - 4x - 2z + 15$ over all real numbers $x,$ $y,$ $z.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
We can write the given expression as
\begin{align*}
&(x^2 - 4x + 4) + (x^2 - 2xy + y^2) + (y^2 - 4yz + 4z^2) + (z^2 - 2z + 1) + 10 \\
&= (x - 2)^2 + (x - y)^2 + (y - 2z)^2 + (z - 1)^2 + 10
\end{align*}The minimum value is then $\boxed{10},$ which occurs when $x = 2,$ $y = 2,$ and $z = 1.$ The answer is $\boxed{10}$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"What is the minimum value of the expression $2x^2+3y^2+8x-24y+62$ for real $x$ and $y$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Rearranging the expression, we have  \[2x^2+8x+3y^2-24y+62\]We first complete the square in $x$. Factoring a 2 from the first two terms of the expression, we get  \[2(x^2+4x)+3y^2-24y+62\]In order for the expression inside the parenthesis to be a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(4/2)^2=4$ inside the parenthesis. Doing this, we have \[2(x^2+4x+4-4)+3y^2-24y+62 \Rightarrow 2(x+2)^2+3y^2-24y+54\]Now we complete the square in $y$. Factoring a 3 from the $y$ terms in the expression, we get \[2(x+2)^2+3(y^2-8y)+54\]In order for the expression inside the second parenthesis to be a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(8/2)^2=16$ inside the parenthesis. Doing this, we have \[2(x+2)^2+3(y^2-8y+16-16)+54 \Rightarrow 2(x+2)^2+3(y-4)^2+6\]Since the minimum value of $2(x+2)^2$ and $3(y-4)^2$ is $0$ (perfect squares can never be negative), the minimum value of the entire expression is $\boxed{6}$, and is achieved when $x=-2$ and $y=4$. The answer is $\boxed{6}$
