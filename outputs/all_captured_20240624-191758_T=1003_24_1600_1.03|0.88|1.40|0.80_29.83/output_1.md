Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

    This problem is a minimization problem with the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
    We can solve this problem by analyzing the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ and the constraint.

    We know that $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is minimized when $x = y$ because the coefficient of $x^2$ and $y^2$ are both positive and the coefficient of $xy$ is negative. So, the constraint equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ should also hold when $x = y$.

    So, we can substitute $x = y$ into the constraint equation and solve it for $x$.

    After solving for $x$, we can substitute the value of $x$ back into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to get the minimum value.

    Let's start with the constraint equation.

The minimization problem with the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ cannot be solved using Sympy because it does not support solving absolute value equations with complex domains. However, we can solve this problem manually as follows:

The constraint equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|2x-y| + |2y-x| = 40$. Since the absolute value function is symmetric about the origin, we can rewrite this as $2|2x-y| = 40$. Therefore, $|2x-y| = 20$.

Now, we want to minimize the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite this as $5(x-y)^2 + 10xy$. Since $|2x-y| = 20$, we know that $(x-y)^2 \leq 20^2 = 400$. Therefore, $5(x-y)^2 \leq 5 \cdot 400 = 2000$.

To minimize $5(x-y)^2 + 10xy$, we want to minimize $10xy$. Since $|2x-y| = 20$, we know that $|x-y| \geq 10$. Therefore, $-10xy \leq 10$.

Adding these inequalities, we get $5(x-y)^2 + 10xy \geq 2000 - 10 = 1990$. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\boxed{1990}$.

However, this problem does not have a positive numerical answer, but rather a negative numerical answer. The error in the Python code is due to the fact that Sympy does not support solving absolute value equations with complex domains. To solve this problem, we need to use mathematical reasoning and analytical methods, not computational tools like Sympy.
