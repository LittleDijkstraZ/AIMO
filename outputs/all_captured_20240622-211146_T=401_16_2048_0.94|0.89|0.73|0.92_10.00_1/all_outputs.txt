 The problem's constraints, conditions, and related knowledge are as follows:

1. The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if and only if either $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$ or $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

2. If $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the points $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, and $(-5,-5)$.

3. If $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the points $(8,0)$, $(0,8)$, $(-8,0)$, and $(0,-8)$.

4. The points that satisfy the equation form a square with side length 10 units.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

The points that satisfy the equation form a square with side length 10 units. To find the area of this square, we simply square the length of one of its sides. The area of the square is $10^2 = 100$ square units.
The answer is: $100$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The problem's constraints, conditions, and related knowledge are as follows:

1. The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is given.
2. We are asked to find the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points that satisfy this equation.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

Since the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero, the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if either

(a) $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$, or
(b) $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

For (a) to be true, we must have both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the points $(5, 5)$, $(5, -5)$, $(-5, 5)$, and $(-5, -5)$.

For (b) to be true, we must have both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations, we get the points $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

Therefore, the points that satisfy the equation are $(5, 5)$, $(5, -5)$, $(-5, 5)$, $(-5, -5)$, $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$. These points form a square with side length $10$, so its area is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

The problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge are as follows:

1. The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$

2. The points $(x, y)$ satisfying this equation form a convex polygon.

3. We need to find the area of this convex polygon.

To solve this problem, we first analyze the equation. The equation is equal to zero if and only if both of its factors are equal to zero. That is,

$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first factor to be zero, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$.

For the second factor to be zero, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $-8 \leq x \leq 8$ and $-8 \leq y \leq 8$.

The points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the first factor are the four points $(\pm 10, 0)$, $(0, \pm 10)$, and the points that satisfy the second factor are all the points inside a square with side length $16$.

Therefore, the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the original equation are the four points $(\pm 10, 0)$, $(0, \pm 10)$, and the points inside the square with side length $16$. These points form a convex polygon that is a square with side length $16$.

The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$

 The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

For the product of two numbers to be zero, one of them must be zero. Therefore, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives the vertices of the polygon: $(0,10)$, $(0,-10)$, $(10,0)$, and $(-10,0)$.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives the vertices of the polygon: $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

Therefore, the polygon is a square with side length 10. The area of the square is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two expressions, and the product equals to zero if and only if at least one of the expressions equals to zero. So we have two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the four lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

For the second case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the four lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 16. Therefore, the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

The points that satisfy the equation are the intersections of these two sets, which are $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$. These points form a square with side length $16$. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions, and related knowledge are as follows:

1. The equation is satisfied if either of the factors is equal to zero.
2. The factors are products of two quadratics.
3. The absolute value function $|x|$ can be replaced by $x$ if $x \ge 0$, and by $-x$ if $x < 0$.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. If the first factor is zero, then either $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x - y| - 10 = 0$. These equations can be rewritten as $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$, respectively. By the property of absolute value, we can remove the absolute value signs to get $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. This gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

2. If the second factor is zero, then either $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$. These equations can be rewritten as $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$, respectively. Again, by the property of absolute value, we can remove the absolute value signs to get $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

3. The intersection points of these lines are the vertices of the polygon. By plotting these lines on a coordinate plane, we find that the polygon is a square with side length 16.

4. To find the area of the square, we simply square the length of one of its sides: $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$
