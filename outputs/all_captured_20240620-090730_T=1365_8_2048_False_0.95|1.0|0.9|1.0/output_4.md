Approach:


1. First, let's consider the geometric sequence. The common ratio is denoted by $r$, and the first term is $a$. Therefore, the sequence can be represented as $a, ar, ar^2, ar^3, ar^4$. We know that they are all 2-digit positive integers and the sequence is increasing.
2. Also, since the sequence is increasing, $r$ must be greater than 1. We can now start to solve for $a$ and $r$.
3. The sum of the sequence is $S = a + ar + ar^2 + ar^3 + ar^4$.
4. We know that $S$ is also equal to $a \cdot \frac{r^5 - 1}{r - 1}$, because the sum of a geometric sequence is given by the formula $S = a \cdot \frac{r^n - 1}{r - 1}$.
5. Therefore, we have the equation $a + ar + ar^2 + ar^3 + ar^4 = a \cdot \frac{r^5 - 1}{r - 1}$.
6. We can simplify this equation to $(r^5 - 1)(a(r - 1) - (a + ar + ar^2 + ar^3 + ar^4)) = 0$.
7. Since $a(r - 1) - (a + ar + ar^2 + ar^3 + ar^4) = -a - a(r + r^2 + r^3 + r^4) = -a(r^5 - 1)/(r - 1)$, the equation simplifies to $r^5 - 1 = 0$.
8. The only possible 2-digit solution for $r$ from the equation $r^5 - 1 = 0$ is $r = 2$.
9. Substituting $r = 2$ into the equation $a + ar + ar^2 + ar^3 + ar^4 = a \cdot \frac{r^5 - 1}{r - 1}$, we get $a + 2a + 4a + 8a + 16a = a \cdot \frac{31}{1}$, which simplifies to $31a = 31a$.
10. Therefore, any value of $a$ will work as long as it is a 2-digit positive integer. Let's choose $a = 16$.
11. Now we have the sequence: $16, 32, 64, 128, 256$.
12. To find the sum of this sequence, we simply add up the terms: $16 + 32 + 64 + 128 + 256 = 500$.
The value of the sum of the sequence is 500. The answer is: $500$

A geometric sequence is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a fixed, non-zero number called the common ratio. If a sequence is both increasing and geometric, the common ratio must be greater than 1.

Let's denote the first term of the sequence as $a$ and the common ratio as $r$. The five terms of the sequence will be $a$, $ar$, $ar^2$, $ar^3$, and $ar^4$. Since all terms are 2-digit positive integers, we can write down the following inequalities:

$$10 \leq a \leq 99$$
$$10 \leq ar \leq 99$$
$$10 \leq ar^2 \leq 99$$
$$10 \leq ar^3 \leq 99$$
$$10 \leq ar^4 \leq 99$$

From the first inequality, we know that $a$ must be at least 10 and at most 99. Since the sequence is increasing and geometric, $r$ must be greater than 1. The fifth term $ar^4$ must also be a 2-digit integer, so we have $ar^4 \leq 99$.

By trial and error or by using a computer program, we can find that the unique solution to this problem is $a = 10$ and $r = 2$. The five terms of the sequence are then 10, 20, 40, 80, and 160. Their sum is 310.

So, the sum of the five terms in the unique increasing geometric sequence of 2-digit positive integers is 310. The answer is: $310$

Approach:


1. First, we need to choose the common ratio $r$ for the geometric sequence. Since the sequence is increasing and consists of 2-digit positive integers, we can start with $r = 2$ because $10*2 = 20$ is the smallest 2-digit number that can be obtained by multiplying the first term (which we will denote as $a$) by the common ratio.

2. Now we can find the first term $a$ so that all five terms of the sequence are 2-digit positive integers. We know that the fifth term is $a * r^4 = a * 2^4 = 16a$. So we want 16a to be a 2-digit integer. By trying different values for a (starting from 1), we find that $a = 6$ works because $16*6 = 96$ is a 2-digit number.

3. Now we have the first term $a = 6$ and the common ratio $r = 2$. We can find the five terms of the sequence: $6, 12, 24, 48, 96$.

4. To find the sum of the sequence, we simply add up the five terms: $6 + 12 + 24 + 48 + 96 = 186$.

```python

    for i in range(n):
        sum_of_sequence += a * (r ** i)

    return sum_of_sequence

We are given a geometric sequence of five 2-digit positive integers. This means that the ratio of any term to its previous term is a constant. Let's represent the first term as `a` and the common ratio as `r`. Then the sequence will be `a`, `ar`, `ar^2`, `ar^3`, `ar^4`. We know that all these terms are 2-digit positive integers.

Let's use the sympy library to solve this problem. Here's a step-by-step solution:

def sum_of_geometric_sequence():
    """Find the sum of a unique increasing geometric sequence of five 2-digit positive integers."""

    a_values = [i for i in range(10, 100) if i % 10 != 0]
    # The common ratio r must be a positive number
    r_values = [i for i in range(1, 10)]

    for a_value in a_values:
        for r_value in r_values:
            sequence = [a_value * r_value**i for i in range(5)]

A geometric sequence is a sequence of numbers such that the ratio of any two successive members is a constant. If we have a geometric sequence of five 2-digit positive integers that is increasing, the common ratio must be greater than 1, because each term is greater than the previous one.

Let's denote the first term of the sequence as $a$ and the common ratio as $r$. The five terms of the sequence are then $a$, $ar$, $ar^2$, $ar^3$, and $ar^4$. All these terms are 2-digit positive integers. This means that $a$ is a 2-digit positive integer, and $r$ is greater than 1.

The smallest possible value of $a$ is 10 (the smallest 2-digit positive integer), and the largest possible value of $r$ can be found by setting $ar^4$ equal to the largest 2-digit positive integer, 99, and solving for $r$:

$10 \cdot r^4 = 99$
$r^4 = \frac{99}{10}$
$r^4 \approx 9.9$
$r \approx 2.1544$

However, $r$ must be an integer, so we need to find the largest integer $r$ such that $r^4$ does not exceed $\frac{99}{10}$. By trial and error or by using a calculator, we find that $r=2$ satisfies this condition, because $2^4 = 16$ which is less than $\frac{99}{10}$.

Now we can find the smallest and largest possible values of $a$. The smallest value of $a$ is 10 (as mentioned earlier), and the largest value of $a$ can be found by setting $ar^4 = 99$ and solving for $a$ when $r=2$:

$a \cdot 2^4 = 99$
$a \cdot 16 = 99$
$a = \frac{99}{16}$
$a \approx 6.1875$

Again, $a$ must be an integer, so we need to find the largest integer $a$ such that $a \cdot 2^4$ does not exceed 99. By trial and error or by using a calculator, we find that $a=6$ satisfies this condition, because $6 \cdot 2^4 = 96$ which is less than 99.

So the sequence is 10, 20, 40, 80, 160. The sum of this sequence is $10 + 20 + 40 + 80 + 160 = 310$. Therefore, the sum of the five terms in the unique increasing geometric sequence of five 2-digit positive integers is 310. The answer is: $310$

"There exists a unique increasing geometric sequence of five 2-digit positive integers. What is their sum?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.



The unique increasing geometric sequence of five 2-digit positive integers with a common ratio is: 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32.

To find the sum of this sequence, we can use the formula for the sum of a geometric series:
$$S = a \frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r}$$
where $S$ is the sum, $a$ is the first term, $r$ is the common ratio, and $n$ is the number of terms.

In this case, $a = 2$, $r = 2$, and $n = 5$. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:
$$S = 2 \frac{1 - 2^5}{1 - 2} = 2 \frac{1 - 32}{-1} = 2(31) = 62.$$

The sum of this geometric sequence is 62.

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{62}$.

Here is a Python function that calculates the sum of the geometric sequence:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def sum_geometric_sequence(a, r, n):
    return a * (1 - r**n) / (1 - r)

a = 2
r = 2
n = 5

sum_sequence = sum_geometric_sequence(a, r, n)
print(sum_sequence)
```

62.0

CODE RESULTS 62.0

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
62.0
```
The output of the Python function confirms that the sum of the geometric sequence is 62, as expected. So, the final numerical answer is $\boxed{62}$.
