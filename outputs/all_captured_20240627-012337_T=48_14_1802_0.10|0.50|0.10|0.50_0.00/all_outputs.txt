Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 To solve this problem, we first need to find the x-coordinates of points A and B, then calculate the distances from A and B to the origin, and finally find the sum of the squares of these distances.

1. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$, so we have $4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l$. Rearranging, we get $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$.

2. The points A and B are distance 6 apart, so if $x_1$ and $x_2$ are the x-coordinates of A and B, respectively, then $|x_2 - x_1| = 6$. By Vieta's formulas, we know that $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$.

3. Using the identity $(x_1 - x_2)^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 4x_1x_2$, we can solve for $l$:
\[(6)^2 = (2)^2 - 4\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right).\]
Simplifying, we get $36 = 4 - \frac{4l - 16}{k}$, or $36k = 4k - 4l + 16$, or $32k = -4l$, or $l = -8k$.

4. Now we substitute $l = -8k$ into the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$, to get $kx^2 - 2kx - 8k - 4 = 0$, or $kx^2 - 2kx - 12k = 0$.

5. This is a quadratic equation, and its solutions are given by $x = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{(2k)^2 - 4k(-12k)}}{2k} = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{4k^2 + 48k^2}}{2k} = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{52k^2}}{2k} = \frac{2k \pm 2\sqrt{13}k}{2k} = 1 \pm \sqrt{13}$.

6. So the x-coordinates of A and B are $1 + \sqrt{13}$ and $1 - \sqrt{13}$.

7. The distances from A and B to the origin are $\sqrt{(1 + \sqrt{13})^2 + 4^2}$ and $\sqrt{(1 - \sqrt{13})^2 + 4^2}$, respectively.

8. The sum of the squares of these distances is $\left(\sqrt{(1 + \sqrt{13})^2 + 4^2}\right)^2 + \left(\sqrt{(1 - \sqrt{13})^2 + 4^2}\right)^2$.

9. After calculating this expression, we find that the sum of the squares of the distances from A and B to the origin is 184.

Here is a Python code to calculate the sum of the squares of the distances:
