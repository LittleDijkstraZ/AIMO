Below is a math problem you are to solve (hint: answer is a natural number):

Problem Statement: "The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Instructions:
- Introduce the problem and state any assumptions being made explicitly.
- Describe the logical progression of the solution, starting from the simplest interpretation.
- Solve the problem using a systematic approach, testing each assumption as you progress.
- Provide mathematical justification for each step, including any transformations or operations used.
- After deriving a solution, test its validity under different conditions or parameters.
- Finish with a concise summary of the solution and any theoretical or practical implications.



Problem Statement: "The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

The given equation is a product of two terms. The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the equation is satisfied if either of the following conditions is met:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first condition, both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ must be zero. This means that $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$, as well as the lines $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$.

For the second condition, both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2$ must be zero. This means that $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$, as well as the lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length 16.

However, the points that satisfy both conditions simultaneously are the vertices of the square formed by the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$, since these are the points where the lines intersect. The side length of this square is $10\sqrt{2}$, so its area is $(10\sqrt{2})^2 = 200$.

The area of the convex polygon formed by the points that satisfy the given equation is therefore 200 square units.
The answer is:
$$200$$

Instructions:
- Introduce the problem and state any assumptions being made explicitly.
- Describe the logical progression of the solution, starting from the simplest interpretation.
- Solve the problem using a systematic approach, testing each assumption as you progress.
- Provide mathematical justification for each step, including any transformations or operations used.
- After deriving a solution, test its validity under different conditions or parameters.
- Finish with a concise summary of the solution and any theoretical or practical implications.



Solution:
The problem statement involves a product of two expressions equal to zero. The only way this can happen is if at least one of the factors is zero. Therefore, we have two separate cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$.

For case 1, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means that $x + y = \pm 10$. This forms two lines in the plane. Similarly, for case 2, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$, forming two more lines in the plane.

The intersection points of these lines are the vertices of the polygon. By plotting these lines, we find a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units. The problem can be solved using a systematic approach by analyzing the conditions given in the problem statement and applying the properties of absolute value and equations. The solution is valid and can be applied to other similar problems involving absolute value equations. The area of the convex polygon formed by the points satisfying the given conditions is 100 square units.

Solution:

Step 1: Simplify the problem

The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either of the terms must be zero. Thus, we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

Step 2: Solve the equations

For Case 1:
If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = \pm 10$.
If $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x - y = \pm 10$.

For Case 2:
If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$, which implies $x = \pm 8$.
If $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $y = \pm 8$.

Step 3: Analyze the solutions

From Case 1, we have the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. From Case 2, we have the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersections of these lines form a square with side length 16.

Step 4: Calculate the area

The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units.
The answer is $\boxed{256}$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (hint: answer is a natural number):

Problem Statement: "The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Instructions:
- Introduce the problem and state any assumptions being made explicitly.
- Describe the logical progression of the solution, starting from the simplest interpretation.
- Solve the problem using a systematic approach, testing each assumption as you progress.
- Provide mathematical justification for each step, including any transformations or operations used.

Solution:
The problem statement contains an equation that involves absolute values and squares, and the question asks for the area of the region enclosed by the points that satisfy this equation. The equation is:
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]

This equation equals zero if and only if at least one of the factors equals zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first case, this means that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This represents two lines in the $xy$-plane: $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$, and $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle with side lengths of 20 units in the $x$ and $y$ directions.

For the second case, this means that $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. This represents two lines in the $xy$-plane: $x = 8$ and $x = -8$, and $y = 8$ and $y = -8$. These lines form a rectangle with side lengths of 16 units in the $x$ and $y$ directions.

The intersection of these two rectangles forms a larger rectangle with side lengths of 20 units in the $x$ direction and 16 units in the $y$ direction. The area of this rectangle is $20 \times 16 = 320$ square units. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points that satisfy the given equation is 320 square units.
The answer is $\boxed{320}$.

## Solution

The given equation is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$. Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length $10$ (the distance between the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$), centered at the origin $(0,0)$ and with vertices at $(\pm 8, \pm 8)$. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon formed by the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the given equation is $100$.
The answer is $\boxed{100}$.

Since the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero, we have two separate cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
This equation is satisfied only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the conditions for a square with side length 10.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This equation is satisfied only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives a square with side length 16.

However, the first case implies that $-10 \leq x, y \leq 10$, while the second case implies that $-8 \leq x, y \leq 8$. The intersection of these two regions is a square with side length 8 (since $-8 \leq x, y \leq 8$ implies a square with side length 8).

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $8^2 = 64$. The answer is: $64$.

Problem Statement: "The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

We are given a set of points that satisfy the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. We are to find the area of the convex polygon that these points form.

The equation is the product of two terms, and for this product to be zero, either one of the terms must be zero. Thus, we have two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first case, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This means that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two squares with side length 10 centered at the origin. Their vertices are the points where the absolute value functions are minimized.

For the second case, either $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This means that $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two squares with side length 16 centered at the origin.

The intersection of these two sets of points forms a square with side length 10, which is the convex polygon we are looking for. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units. The answer is: $100$

Solution:

The problem statement gives us the equation:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$

This equation is equal to zero if either of the two factors is zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
This can only happen if both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$, which gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. The intersection of these lines forms a rectangle with vertices at $(10,0)$, $(-10,0)$, $(0,10)$, and $(0,-10)$. The area of this rectangle is $20 \times 20 = 400$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This can only happen if both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$, which gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. The intersection of these lines forms a square with vertices at $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$. The side length of this square is 16, so its area is $16 \times 16 = 256$.

However, the area of the convex polygon formed by the intersection of the solutions from both cases is the sum of the areas of the rectangle and the square, which is $400 + 256 = 656$. So, the area of the convex polygon is 656 square units.
The answer is $\boxed{656}$.

Solution:
The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
For the product of two numbers to be zero, either one of them must be zero. So, we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
This can only happen when $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$.
Solving these systems of equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(5,5)$ and $(-5,-5)$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
This can only happen when $x = 8$ or $x = -8$ and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.
So, the vertices of the polygon also include $(8,0)$, $(0,8)$, $(-8,0)$, and $(0,-8)$.

Thus, the polygon is a square with side length $10$. The area of the square is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is $\boxed{100}$.

Problem Statement: "The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Solution:

The problem statement provides a condition that the points $\left(x, y\right)$ must satisfy: $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. This condition implies that either of the two factors must be zero for the product to be zero. This gives us two separate conditions to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first condition to be true, both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ must be zero. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This is the condition for a square with side length 10 units, centered at the origin.

For the second condition to be true, both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2$ must be zero. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This is the condition for a square with side length 16 units, centered at the origin.

However, since the first condition is for a square with side length 10 units, and the second condition is for a square with side length 16 units, the two conditions cannot both be true at the same time for any point $\left(x, y\right)$. Therefore, the only points that satisfy the original condition are those that satisfy the first condition, which forms a square with side length 10 units.

The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$ square units. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units.
The answer is: $100$
