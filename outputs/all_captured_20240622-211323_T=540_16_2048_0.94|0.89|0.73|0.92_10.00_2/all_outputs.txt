"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We first need to understand the given equation. It's a product of two quadratic expressions equal to zero. A product is zero if at least one of the factors is zero. So we have two cases:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

2. For Case 1, we have: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions for this case are a square with side length 10, centered at the origin (0, 0).

3. For Case 2, we have: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions for this case are a square with side length 16, centered at the origin (0, 0).

4. Combining the solutions from both cases, we get the intersection of two squares, which is a smaller square with side length 10, centered at the origin.

5. To find the area of this square, we simply square the side length: $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$.

1. The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if at least one of the following two conditions is met:

   a) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two lines in the plane.
   
   b) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two lines in the plane.

2. Therefore, the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the original equation are the intersections of these lines. These lines form a square with side length 16.

3. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $\boxed{256}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, we know that the expression is equals to 0 if and only if at least one of the terms is equals to 0. So we have two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10 \Rightarrow x + y = \pm 10$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8 \Rightarrow x = \pm 8$
3. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert y \vert = 8 \Rightarrow y = \pm 8$
4. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x - y \vert = 10 \Rightarrow x - y = \pm 10$

Now let's draw these lines on the plane:

1. $y = -x + 10$ and $y = -x - 10$
2. $y = x + 8$ and $y = x - 8$
3. $y = x + 8$ and $y = x - 8$
4. $y = x + 10$ and $y = x - 10$

The lines form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The given equation is:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$

This equation is equal to zero if and only if at least one of the factors is equal to zero. Thus, we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these absolute value equations are the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, $(-10, 0)$, and $(0, -10)$.

2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these absolute value equations are the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(8, 0)$, $(-8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, and $(0, -8)$.

The intersection of the two rectangles is a square with side length $10$ (the maximum value of $x + y$ or $x - y$ when $x, y$ are in the range of $8$ to $10$). The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. So the area of the convex polygon is $100$.

So the area of the convex polygon is $100$. The answer is: $100$

1. We have the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. For the product of two numbers to be zero, either one of them must be zero. Therefore, we have two cases:

    a) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
    b) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

2. In case a), both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ must be zero. This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This forms a square with side length 10, so the area is $10^2 = 100$.

3. In case b), both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2$ must be zero. This implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This forms a square with side length 16, so the area is $16^2 = 256$.

4. However, the points that satisfy both cases a) and b) simultaneously form a square with side length 10 (the smaller square), so the area is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Step 1: Let's first look at the equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. The only way this equation can be equal to zero is if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) = 0$. So, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm10$ and $x - y = \pm10$. Solving these two systems of equations, we find that the four lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$ form a rectangle.

Step 2: Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. This also forms a rectangle.

Step 3: The intersection of the two rectangles is the convex polygon we are looking for. The vertices of the polygon are the intersection points of the lines forming the rectangles. By solving these systems of equations, we find that the vertices of the polygon are $(8,8)$, $(-8,8)$, $(-8,-8)$, and $(8,-8)$.

Step 4: To find the area of the polygon, we simply multiply the lengths of its sides. The side lengths are both 16 (since the distance between the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$ is 16, and the same for the y-coordinates). Therefore, the area of the polygon is $16 \times 16 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The condition is that the product of two quantities is zero, which means that each of them must be zero. So we have two cases: 
   a) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
   b) $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
2. For the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$. This gives us four equations:
   a) $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$
   b) $x = 8$ or $x = -8$
3. Similarly, for the second case, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us four more equations:
   a) $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$
   b) $y = 8$ or $y = -8$
4. Solving these eight equations, we get the coordinates of the vertices of the polygon.
5. To find the area of the polygon, we can use the Shoelace formula.

Now, let's write the Python script to do this:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Abs

def calculate_area():
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # List of vertices
    vertices = [(8, 2), (8, -2), (-8, 2), (-8, -2), (2, 8), (-2, 8), (2, -8), (-2, -8)]

    # Shoelace formula
    area = 0
    for i in range(len(vertices)):
        area += vertices[i][0]*vertices[(i+1)%len(vertices)][1] - vertices[i][1]*vertices[(i+1)%len(vertices)][0]
    area = abs(area / 2)

    return area

result = calculate_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 0.0

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
0.0
```
The Python script does not work as expected because we have made an error in our logic. The problem is that the conditions $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ do not give us a polygon, but rather four lines. We need to modify our approach to solve the problem correctly.

The correct approach should be as follows:

1. The condition is that the product of two quantities is zero, which means that each of them must be zero. So we have two cases: 
   a) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
   b) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
2. For the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us four lines:
   a) $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$
   b) $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$
3. Similarly, for the second case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us four lines:
   a) $x = 8$ or $x = -8$
   b) $y = 8$ or $y = -8$
4. The intersection points of these lines are the vertices of the polygon.
5. To find the area of the polygon, we can use the Shoelace formula.

Now, let's modify the Python script to do this:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Abs

def calculate_area():
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # List of vertices
    vertices = [(8, 2), (8, -2), (-8, 2), (-8, -2), (2, 8), (-2, 8), (2, -8), (-2, -8)]

    # Shoelace formula
    area = 0
    for i in range(len(vertices)):
        area += vertices[i][0]*vertices[(i+1)%len(vertices)][1] - vertices[i][1]*vertices[(i+1)%len(vertices)][0]
    area = abs(area / 2)

    return area

result = calculate_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 0.0

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
0.0
```
The Python script still does not work as expected because we have made an error in our logic. The problem is that the Shoelace formula does not work for a polygon with vertices on the axes. We need to modify our approach to solve the problem correctly.

The correct approach should be as follows:

1. The condition is that the product of two quantities is zero, which means that each of them must be zero. So we have two cases: 
   a) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
   b) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
2. For the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us four lines:
   a) $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$
   b) $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$
3. Similarly, for the second case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us four lines:
   a) $x = 8$ or $x = -8$
   b) $y = 8$ or $y = -8$
4. The intersection points of these lines are the vertices of the polygon.
5. To find the area of the polygon, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle and subtract the areas of the four right triangles formed by the axes and the sides of the rectangle.

Now, let's modify the Python script to do this:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Abs

def calculate_area():
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # Dimensions of the rectangle

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The given equation is a product of two quadratic expressions equal to zero. Therefore, the equation is satisfied if either of the expressions is equal to zero. 

For the first expression: $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$, we have that both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. From these equations, we get that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two lines in the plane: $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$.

For the second expression: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have that both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. From these equations, we get that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two lines in the plane: $x = 8$ and $y = 8$.

Now, we have a rectangle formed by the intersection of these lines. The length of the rectangle is 10 (from $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$) and the width is 8 (from $x = 8$ and $y = 8$). Therefore, the area of the rectangle is $10 \times 8 = 80$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 80.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, we need to understand that the expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ can be true only when both of the terms are zero.

2. The term $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$ can be true only when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These two equations represent a square with side length 10.

3. The term $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ can be true only when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This represents a square with side length 16.

4. The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for.

5. To find the area of this convex polygon, we just need to find the area of the square with side length 10 (the smaller square). The area of a square is given by the square of its side length, so the area of the smaller square is $10^2 = 100$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units. The answer is: $100$
