**Problem:** 
"Find the distance between the vertex of the graph of the equation $y=x^2 + 2x - 6 $ and the point $(4, 5)$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Completing the square, we get $y=(x + 1)^2 - 7 $. The vertex of the graph of this equation is thus $(-1, -7)$.The distance between $(4, 5)$ and $(-1, -7)$ is $\sqrt{(4-(-1))^2 + (5-(-7))^2} = \sqrt{25+144} =\boxed{13}$. The answer is $\boxed{13}$

The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$ means that when we substitute $y = 4$ into the equation of the parabola, we get a quadratic equation with two solutions, which are the x-coordinates of $A$ and $B$. So we have:
\[4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l.\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0.\]
This is a quadratic equation, and we know that the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6. The distance between two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is given by $\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$. In this case, $y_1 = y_2 = 4$, so the distance is simply $|x_2 - x_1| = 6$.

Now, let's denote the roots of the quadratic equation as $x_1$ and $x_2$. By Vieta's formulas, we know that $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$. We also know that $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 4x_1x_2 = 4 - 4\frac{l - 4}{k} = 4 - \frac{4l - 16}{k} = \frac{16 - 4l}{k}$. Since $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 36$, we have $\frac{16 - 4l}{k} = 36$, which simplifies to $16 - 4l = 36k$.

Now, we want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. Since $y = 4$ for both $A$ and $B$, the distance is simply $\sqrt{x^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + 16}$. The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is then $(x_1^2 + 16) + (x_2^2 + 16) = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32$.

By the identity $(x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = x_1^2 + x_2^2$, we have $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 2^2 - 2\frac{l - 4}{k} = 4 - \frac{2l - 8}{k} = \frac{8 - 2l}{k}$.

Substituting this into the expression for the sum of the squares of the distances, we get:
\[\frac{8 - 2l}{k} + 32 = \frac{8 - 2l + 32k}{k}.\]
From the equation $16 - 4l = 36k$, we can solve for $l$ to get $l = 4 + 9k$. Substituting this into the expression above, we get:
\[\frac{8 - 2(4 + 9k) + 32k}{k} = \frac{8 - 8 - 18k + 32k}{k} = \frac{14k}{k} = 14.\]
So the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is 14. The answer is $\boxed{14}$.
