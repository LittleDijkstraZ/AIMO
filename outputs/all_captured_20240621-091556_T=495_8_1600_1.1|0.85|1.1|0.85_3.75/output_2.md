0_User: Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.



The number of distinct solutions to the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $4$ if and only if $\frac{m}{100}=1$.
This is because the expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ takes the values $0$, $1$, $2$, and $3$ for $x$ in the intervals $(-\infty, -1)$, $[-1, 1)$, $[1, 3)$, and $[3, \infty)$, respectively.
So, $\frac{m}{100}=1$ gives $m=100$.
Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions, and that is $m=100$.
The answer is: $100$

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.



The problem asks for how many positive integers $m$ the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has 4 distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to the positive difference between two consecutive elements of the sequence $0, 2, 4, 6, \ldots$.

The positive difference between two consecutive elements of the sequence $0, 2, 4, 6, \ldots$ is $2$. So $\frac{m}{100}=2$, which gives $m=200$.

Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions, and that is $m=200$. The answer is: $1$

The number of distinct solutions to the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $4$ if and only if $\frac{m}{100}=1$.
To see this, note that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions when the right-hand side is equal to $1$.
Therefore, the only positive integer $m$ that satisfies the condition is $m=100$.
The answer is: $1$

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.



The problem is asking for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions.

To find the number of solutions, we need to analyze the equation. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is a piecewise function, and its solutions can be found by considering each piece separately.

For the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ to have four distinct solutions, the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal to 2. This is because the graph of the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has two "humps" with a height of 2, and the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be set to 2 in order to have four distinct solutions.

Therefore, we can set up the equation $\frac{m}{100}=2$ and solve for $m$. Multiplying both sides by 100 gives us $m=200$.

So, the only positive integer value of $m$ that makes the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have four distinct solutions is 200. Therefore, the answer is $1$.

However, this question has a mistake in it. The value of $m$ cannot be uniquely determined to be 200 from the given information. The value of $m$ actually depends on the value of $\frac{m}{100}$, and since the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is true for all positive integers $m$, any positive integer value of $m$ would make the equation have four distinct solutions. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy this condition is infinite.

So, the answer is actually $\boxed{infinite}$. However, the original problem statement was incorrect, and it was assumed that there was a unique value of $m$ that would make the equation have four distinct solutions. To correct the problem, we should change the question to "For how many positive integers $m$ between 1 and 1000 (or any other reasonable range) does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?" In this case, the value of $m$ that would make the equation have four distinct solutions is indeed 200. So, the corrected answer is 1.

To further analyze the problem, let's consider the range of $m$ between 1 and 1000. The value of $\frac{m}{100}$ will vary between 0.01 and 10. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have four distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}=2$, which gives $m=200$. However, for any other value of $m$, the equation will have either two or zero distinct solutions. Therefore, within the range of $m$ between 1 and 1000, only the value of $m=200$ will result in the equation having four distinct solutions. Thus, the number of positive integers $m$ between 1 and 1000 that satisfy this condition is 1. The answer is: 1

Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.



The number of solutions of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to the number of times the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ crosses the line $y = \frac{m}{100}$. 
The function $f(x)$ has a graph that is V-shaped with the peaks at $x = 1 \pm 2$. It oscillates between 0 and 4. 
So, for the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, we need $\frac{m}{100}$ to be strictly between 0 and 4, i.e., $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 4$. This gives $0 < m < 400$. 
The number of positive integers $m$ in this interval is 399. 
So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 399.

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.



The problem involves finding the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly $4$ distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ represents a piecewise function with $4$ cases based on the value of $x$. We can analyze each case and find the number of solutions for each $m$.

For each case, the number of solutions is determined by the value of $\frac{m}{100}$. For example, in the case where $x < 1$, the equation becomes $\vert -(x-1) - 2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\vert -x + 1 - 2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert -x - 1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$. This equation has two solutions for each $m$ in the range $0 < m < 100$.

Similarly, we can analyze the other three cases and find the number of solutions for each $m$ in the range $0 < m < 100$.

By adding up the number of solutions for each case, we find that the total number of solutions for each $m$ in the range $0 < m < 100$ is $8$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly $4$ distinct solutions is $1$.

This can be seen in the plot of the equation, where for each $m$ in the range $0 < m < 100$, the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly $4$ distinct solutions. The only value of $m$ in the range $0 < m < 100$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $m = 50$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $1$.
The answer is: $1$

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.



A positive integer $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.
We know that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can have at most 4 distinct solutions.
For the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, we need to find the value of $m$ such that the right-hand side $\frac{m}{100}$ is in the range of $0$ to $2$. This is because the absolute value function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ oscillates between $0$ and $2$. Therefore, we need to find the value of $m$ such that $0 \leq \frac{m}{100} \leq 2$.
Simplifying the inequality, we get $0 \leq m \leq 200$.
Now, we need to find the number of positive integer values of $m$ in this range. The positive integer values of $m$ in the range $0 \leq m \leq 200$ are the integers from $1$ to $200$.
To find the number of these integers, we simply subtract the smallest integer from the largest integer and add $1$.
So, the number of positive integer values of $m$ is $200 - 1 + 1 = 200$.
Therefore, there are 200 positive integer values of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. The answer is: 200.

QUESTION 2 - 7 - TIME_SPENT : 334 secs
7_User: Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.



The problem is asking for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. 

First, we need to understand the behavior of the function $| |x - 1| - 2 |$. The function $|x - 1| - 2$ has two "knees" at $x = 1 \pm 2$, which are $x = -1$ and $x = 3$. The function $| |x - 1| - 2 |$ thus "bounces" up and down between 0 and 4 as $x$ varies. 

The equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is in the range from 0 to 4, but not equal to any of the "bounces" of the function $| |x - 1| - 2 |$. 

In other words, we need $\frac{m}{100}$ to be strictly between 0 and 4, but not equal to 0, 2, or 4. 

Multiplying through by 100, we see that $m$ must be strictly between 0 and 400, but not equal to 0, 200, or 400. 

The number of such positive integers $m$ is thus the number of positive integers from 1 to 399, which is 399.

However, we must exclude the values of $m$ that make the equation have less than 4 solutions. 

If $m = 0$ or $m = 400$, the equation becomes $| |x - 1| - 2 | = 0$, which has only 2 solutions. 

If $m = 200$, the equation becomes $| |x - 1| - 2 | = 2$, which also has only 2 solutions. 

So we must subtract these three cases from our count of 399. The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is thus $399 - 3 = 396$.
The answer is: $396$.
