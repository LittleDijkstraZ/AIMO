Problem Statement: "The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Solution:

Since the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero, we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
The former equation represents a line with slope 1 and y-intercept $\pm 10$, and the latter equation represents a line with slope -1 and y-intercept $\pm 10$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The former equation represents two lines, $x = \pm 8$, and the latter equation represents two lines, $y = \pm 8$.

The intersection points of these lines are the vertices of the polygon. By plotting these lines, we find that the polygon is a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256.
The answer is: $\boxed{256}$

Solution:

First, let's define the absolute value function and its properties. The absolute value of a real number $x$, denoted as $|x|$, is defined as:
$$|x| = \begin{cases} x & \text{if } x \geq 0 \\ -x & \text{if } x < 0 \end{cases}$$
The absolute value function has the following properties:
- $|x| \geq 0$ for all $x$.
- $|x| = 0$ if and only if $x = 0$.
- $|xy| = |x| \cdot |y|$ for all real numbers $x$ and $y$.
- $|x + y| \leq |x| + |y|$ for all real numbers $x$ and $y$.

Now let's look at the given equation:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$
For the product of two factors to be zero, one of the factors must be zero. Therefore, we have two cases:
Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

From Case 2, we have $x = \pm 8$ or $y = \pm 8$.
From Case 1, we have four possible combinations:
1. $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$
2. $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$
3. $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$
4. $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$

Solving these four systems of equations, we find that the only valid solutions are $x = 5, y = 5$ and $x = -5, y = -5$. So the points that satisfy the given equation are $(5, 5)$, $(-5, -5)$, $(8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, $(-8, 0)$, and $(0, -8)$.

These points form a square with side length $10$, so its area is $10^2 = 100$. The area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points is $100$. The answer is:
$$\boxed{100}$$

Solution:

The problem is to find the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points $\left(x, y\right)$ that satisfy the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

The equation is equal to zero if either of the two factors is zero. This gives us two sets of conditions:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 \neq 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 \neq 0$.

For the first set of conditions, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which implies that $x + y = \pm 10$. Similarly, for the second set of conditions, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies that $x - y = \pm 10$.

The four lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$ enclose a rectangle with side lengths $20$ and $10\sqrt{2}$. The area of this rectangle is $200\sqrt{2}$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points $\left(x, y\right)$ that satisfy the given equation is $200\sqrt{2}$. The answer is: $\boxed{200\sqrt{2}}$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (hint: answer is a natural number):

Problem Statement: "The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Solution:

The problem statement asks for the area of the convex polygon formed by the points $\left(x, y\right)$ that satisfy the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

The equation equals zero if either of the two factors equals zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This equation is satisfied if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square formed by the points $\left(x, y\right)$: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, -2)$, and $(-8, 2)$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This equation is satisfied if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square formed by the points $\left(x, y\right)$: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$.

Combining both cases, we see that the points $\left(x, y\right)$ that satisfy the original equation form a 8x8 square. To find its area, we simply multiply the side lengths: $8 \times 8 = 64$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 64 square units. The answer is: $\boxed{64}$.

## Problem Statement
The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?

## Solution
First, we note that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to two separate conditions:

1. $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$
2. $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$

From the first condition, we have $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only way this can happen is if $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$. So the first condition defines a square with side length 20 and vertices at $(\pm 10, \pm 10)$.

From the second condition, we have $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The only way this can happen is if $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So the second condition defines a square with side length 16 and vertices at $(\pm 8, \pm 8)$.

The two squares overlap at the origin $(0, 0)$, and the convex polygon enclosed by the points satisfying the given equation is the union of the two squares. The area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares:

Area = (20 * 20) + (16 * 16) = 400 + 256 = 656.

So the area of the convex polygon is 656 square units. The answer is: $\boxed{656}$

Solution:

1. First, let's define the absolute value function: for any real number $z$, $\vert z \vert$ is equal to $z$ if $z \geq 0$, and $-z$ if $z < 0$.

2. Given conditions: The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon.

3. Approach: The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

From $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The eight lines form a square with side length 16.

4. Area of the square: The area of a square with side length $s$ is $s^2$. Therefore, the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

5. Consistency check: The given conditions are satisfied, and the calculated area is a natural number. The solution is consistent.

The area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{256}$.
The answer is $\boxed{256}$.

## Solution
The problem statement involves absolute values and the square of absolute values, which are not straightforward to work with. However, we can simplify the problem by considering the properties of absolute values. 

The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if both of its factors are equal to zero. Therefore, we can break down the problem into two parts:

1. Solve the equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. Solve the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first equation, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, it is clear that the only way for this equation to be true is if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$, which gives us four lines in the $xy$-plane: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle in the coordinate plane.

For the second equation, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, it is clear that the only way for this equation to be true is if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$, which gives us four lines in the $xy$-plane: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines also form a rectangle in the coordinate plane.

The intersection of these two rectangles is the convex polygon we are looking for. The side lengths of the rectangle are 20 and 16, so the area of the rectangle is $20 \times 16 = 320$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 320.
The answer is: $\boxed{320}$.

The given problem is a bit complex, but we can simplify it. The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, -2)$, and $(-8, 2)$. Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, so $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us the same four vertices. Therefore, the convex polygon is a square with side length $20$. The area of a square is the square of the length of its side, so the area of this square is $20^2 = 400$. The answer is: $\boxed{400}$ square units.

## Solution

The problem statement involves the absolute value function, which can be defined as follows:

For a real number $a$, $\vert a \vert = a$ if $a \ge 0$, and $\vert a \vert = -a$ if $a < 0$.

The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero: $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
This equation equals zero if either of the two terms equals zero.

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
For the square of a real number to be zero, the number itself must be zero. Therefore, we have $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
The absolute value equations can be rewritten as:
- $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$
- $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$
Solving these systems of equations, we find that the points that satisfy these conditions are $(0, 10)$, $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, and $(0, -10)$. These points form a rectangle with side lengths of 20 units.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This case leads to $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $x = 8$ or $x = -8$ and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. These points form a square with side length of 16 units.

The area of the convex polygon formed by the union of the points from both cases is the sum of the areas of the rectangle and the square.
The area of a rectangle is given by the product of its side lengths, so the area of the rectangle is $20 \times 20 = 400$ square units.
The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side, so the area of the square is $16 \times 16 = 256$ square units.

Adding the areas of the rectangle and the square, we find that the total area of the convex polygon is $400 + 256 = 656$ square units.

So the area of the convex polygon is 656 square units. The answer is:
\[656\]

The problem statement involves absolute value functions and a product of two expressions. The absolute value of a real number is its distance from zero on the number line, and is always nonnegative.

Given conditions:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From condition 1, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. From condition 2, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

Case 1: If $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$, we have $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.

- If $x = 8$, then $\vert y + 8 \vert = 10$, which gives $y = 2$ or $y = -18$.
- If $x = -8$, then $\vert y - 8 \vert = 10$, which gives $y = 18$ or $y = -2$.

So, the points are $(8, 2)$, $(8, -18)$, $(-8, 18)$, and $(-8, -2)$.

Case 2: If $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, we can similarly find the points to be $(8, 2)$, $(8, -18)$, $(-8, 18)$, and $(-8, -2)$.

Case 3: If $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, we can similarly find the points to be $(8, 2)$, $(8, -18)$, $(-8, 18)$, and $(-8, -2)$.

Case 4: If $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, we can similarly find the points to be $(8, 2)$, $(8, -18)$, $(-8, 18)$, and $(-8, -2)$.

So, the points satisfying the given conditions are $(8, 2)$, $(8, -18)$, $(-8, 18)$, and $(-8, -2)$, which form a rectangle with side lengths 16 and 20. The area of this rectangle is $16 \times 20 = 320$.

The answer is: $\boxed{320}$.

Solution:

The problem statement involves absolute value functions and multiplication of two expressions, which leads to a scenario where the product of two quantities is zero. This implies that each quantity must be zero separately. Therefore, we have two separate cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10$

Case 2: $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x - y \vert = 10$

Case 3: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8$

Case 4: $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert y \vert = 8$

From Case 3 and 4, we have $-8 \leq x, y \leq 8$.

From Case 1, we have $x + y = \pm 10$.

From Case 2, we have $x - y = \pm 10$.

Solving the system of equations formed by these four cases, we find that the points $(x, y)$ satisfying the conditions are:

$(5, 5), (5, -5), (-5, 5), (-5, -5), (8, 0), (0, 8), (-8, 0), (0, -8)$.

These points form a square with side length $10$ units. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$ square units. The answer is: $\boxed{100}$.

This problem statement requires a deeper understanding of absolute value, modulus, and the properties of squares. The given equation involves the product of two terms, and the product is zero if and only if at least one of the terms is zero. Therefore, we can break down the problem into two separate cases and solve each individually.

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$. Similarly, if $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies that $x - y = \pm 10$. Combining these two equations, we get a system of four linear equations:

1. $x + y = 10$
2. $x + y = -10$
3. $x - y = 10$
4. $x - y = -10$

Solving these equations, we get the following vertices of the polygon: $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0)$. These points form a rectangle with side lengths 20 and 20. Therefore, the area of the polygon is $20 \times 20 = 400$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$, which implies that $x = \pm 8$. Similarly, if $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that $y = \pm 8$. Combining these two equations, we get a system of four linear equations:

1. $x = 8$
2. $x = -8$
3. $y = 8$
4. $y = -8$

These points also form a rectangle with side lengths 16 and 16. The area of this rectangle is $16 \times 16 = 256$.

However, this case does not satisfy the conditions of the problem, as the points do not enclose a convex polygon.

Therefore, the only valid case is the first one, and the area of the convex polygon is 400. The answer is:
\[400\]

The given equation is:
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]

For the product of two terms to be zero, either one of the terms must be zero. Thus, we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
This equation implies that both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. For a square of a real number to be zero, the number itself must be zero. Therefore, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This equation implies that both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. For a square of a real number to be zero, the number itself must be zero. Therefore, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. Thus, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units.
The answer is: $\boxed{256}$ square units.

### Problem Statement:

The problem asks to find the area of the region enclosed by the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

### Definitions and terms:

- Absolute value: For a real number $a$, the absolute value $|a|$ is defined as $a$ if $a \geq 0$, and $-a$ if $a < 0$.
- Convex polygon: A polygon is convex if no line segment between two points on the boundary ever goes outside the polygon.

### Given conditions and constraints:

The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first case, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, it implies that both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This further implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

For the second case, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, it implies that both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This further implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which is equivalent to $-8 \leq x, y \leq 8$.

### Approach:

The first case gives us a square with side length 20, and the second case gives us a square with side length 16. The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for.

### Solution:

The first case gives us a square with side length 20, so its area is $20^2 = 400$.
The second case gives us a square with side length 16, so its area is $16^2 = 256$.
The intersection of these two squares is a square with side length 8 (the difference between 20 and 16), so its area is $8^2 = 64$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $400 + 256 - 64 = 592$.
The answer is: $592$

### Consistency check:

We can check our solution by calculating the area of the square formed by the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the original equation directly. The maximum absolute value of $x + y$ is 20 (when $x = y = 10$), and the maximum absolute value of $x - y$ is also 20 (when $x = 10$ and $y = -10$ or vice versa). Therefore, the square formed by the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the original equation has side length 20, and its area is $20^2 = 400$.

The area of the convex polygon we found (592) is greater than the area of the square formed by the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the original equation (400), which contradicts our initial assumption. Therefore, we must have made a mistake in our calculations.

After revisiting our calculations, we realize that the area of the square formed by the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the second case should be $8^2 = 64$, not $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the corrected area of the convex polygon is $400 + 64 - 64 = 400$, which is equal to the area of the square formed by the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the original equation. This consistency check validates our solution.

### Conclusion:

The area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is $592$. However, after revisiting our calculations, we realize that we made a mistake in our calculations. We have corrected our calculations and found that the area of the convex polygon is actually $400$.

The corrected solution, placed within a box for emphasis:
\[ \boxed{400} \]

The answer is $\boxed{The area of the convex polygon is 128}$.

Problem Statement: The points $(x, y)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?

Solution: The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the given equation is equal to zero if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square $(5, 5)$, $(5, -5)$, $(-5, 5)$, and $(-5, -5)$.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The convex polygon formed by the union of these two squares is a $8 \times 10$ rectangle. The area of this rectangle is $8 \times 10 = 80$. However, this is not the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points satisfying the given equation.

The correct interpretation of the given equation is that it is equal to zero if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From this interpretation, we can see that the vertices of the square formed by the points satisfying $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ are the same as the vertices of the square formed by the points satisfying $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

Therefore, the convex polygon formed by the union of these two squares is actually a $10 \times 10$ square. The area of this square is $10 \times 10 = 100$.

However, the problem asks for the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points satisfying the given equation, not the area of the square formed by the union of these points.

To find the area of the convex polygon, we need to subtract the area of the square formed by the points satisfying $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ from the area of the square formed by the points satisfying $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.

The area of the square formed by the points satisfying $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ is $100$. The area of the square formed by the points satisfying $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ is $64$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points satisfying the given equation is $100 - 64 = 36$.

However, this is not the correct area of the convex polygon. The correct area of the convex polygon is the area of the $8 \times 10$ rectangle formed by the union of the two squares, which is $80$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points satisfying the given equation is actually $80$.
The answer is $\boxed{80}$.
