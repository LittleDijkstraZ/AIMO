Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, we need to understand the given equation. The equation is equal to zero if and only if both terms are zero. This implies that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

2. From $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.

3. From $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.

4. From $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert x \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.

5. From $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

6. By combining all the cases, we can find the vertices of the polygon. They are $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

7. Now, we can calculate the area of the polygon. It's a square with side length 16. So, the area is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Real numbers $x$ and $y$ satisfy the equation $x^2 + y^2 = 10x - 6y - 34$.  What is $x+y$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
If we complete the square after bringing the $x$ and $y$ terms to the other side, we get \[(x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 0.\]Squares of real numbers are nonnegative, so we need both $(x-5)^2$ and $(y+3)^2$ to be $0.$  This only happens when $x = 5$ and $y = -3.$ Thus, $x+y = 5 + (-3) = \boxed{2}.$ The answer is $\boxed{2}$

**Solution:**


This problem involves understanding the properties of absolute values and how they can be simplified. The expression given is equal to zero if and only if each of its factors is zero. This gives us four conditions to consider:

1. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.
2. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$.
3. $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.
4. $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.

The first condition gives $x = y = 8$. The second condition gives $x = y = 0$. The third condition is already satisfied by the first condition. The fourth condition is equivalent to the second condition.

So the points that satisfy the given equation are $(0, 0)$ and $(8, 8)$. These two points form a line segment, which is the convex polygon in this case. The length of the line segment is the distance between the points, which can be found using the distance formula: $\sqrt{(8 - 0)^2 + (8 - 0)^2} = \sqrt{128} = 8\sqrt{2}$. The width of the line segment is also $8\sqrt{2}$. The area of the convex polygon (a line segment) is zero.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 0.
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import sqrt

def area_of_polygon():
    # Calculate the distance between the points (8,8) and (0,0)
    distance = sqrt((8 - 0)**2 + (8 - 0)**2)

    # The width and length of the line segment are the same
    width = distance
    length = distance

    # The area of a rectangle is width * length
    area = width * length

    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 128

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
128
```
The area of the convex polygon is $0$.
However, the calculation for the area of the rectangle using the distance formula gave a non-zero result. 
It seems that the distance formula is not applicable in this case, as the points do not form a rectangle or any other shape with a non-zero area.
The correct area should be 0.
The correct answer is 0.
The answer is: 0

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


This problem requires a mathematical analysis and understanding of the properties of absolute values and inequalities. The equation involves absolute values, which make it difficult to solve directly. However, we can interpret the equation geometrically: the product of two terms equals zero if and only if one of the terms equals zero. This gives us two separate cases to analyze.

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two lines in the plane, forming a rectangle.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two lines in the plane, forming a square.

The intersection of the two cases is the convex polygon enclosed by the points satisfying the equation. The rectangle from Case 1 has side lengths of 20 (from $\vert x + y \vert = 10$) and 20 (from $\vert x - y \vert = 10$), so its area is $20 \times 20 = 400$. The square from Case 2 has side length of 16 (from $\vert x \vert = 8$), so its area is $16 \times 16 = 256$. The intersection of the two cases is a smaller square inside the rectangle, with side length of 16, so its area is $16 \times 16 = 256$. To find the area of the convex polygon, we subtract the area of the smaller square from the area of the rectangle: $400 - 256 = 144$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 144.

The area of the convex polygon is 144.

    # Calculate the area of the rectangle
    rectangle_area = 20 * 20

    # Calculate the area of the square
    square_area = 16 * 16

    # Calculate the area of the convex polygon
    polygon_area = rectangle_area - square_area

    return polygon_area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 144

The area of the convex polygon is 144. The answer is $\boxed{144}$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"One interior angle of a convex polygon is 160 degrees. The rest of the interior angles of the polygon are each 112 degrees. How many sides does the polygon have?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Let us call $x$ the number of sides in the polygon.  The sum of all the angles of the polygon with $x$ sides is $180(x-2)$, but with the information given, it can also be expressed as $160 + 112(x-1)$.  Therefore, setting these two equations equal: \begin{align*}
180(x-2) &= 160 + 112(x-1)\\
180x - 360 &= 160 + 112x - 112\\
68x &= 408\\
x &= 6\\
\end{align*} Thus, it has $\boxed{6}$ sides, and is a hexagon. The answer is $\boxed{6}$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


This problem is a bit complex and requires a deep understanding of absolute value and inequalities. It's not feasible to solve it directly using Python or other programming languages. However, we can solve it using mathematical reasoning.

The equation is of the form $AB = 0$. The only way this equation can be true is if $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, we have two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10 \Rightarrow x + y = \pm 10$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8 \Rightarrow x = \pm 8$.

Similarly, for $y$:
1. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x - y \vert = 10 \Rightarrow x - y = \pm 10$.
2. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert y \vert = 8 \Rightarrow y = \pm 8$.

The four lines $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$ intersect the four lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$ to form a square with side length $16$. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is $256$.
The answer is: $256$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many sides would there be in a convex polygon if the sum of all but one of its interior angles is $1070^{\circ}$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The sum of the interior angles in any $n$-sided polygon is $180(n-2)$ degrees, so the angle measures in a polygon with 7 sides sum to $180(7-2) = 900$ degrees, which means that the desired polygon has more than 7 sides.  Meanwhile, the angle measures in a polygon with 8 sides sum to $180(8-2) = 1080$ degrees.  So, it's possible that the polygon has $\boxed{8}$ sides, and that the last angle measures $10^\circ$.

To see that this is the only possibility, note that the angle measures in a polygon with 9 sides sum to $180(9-2) = 1260$ degrees.  Therefore, if the polygon has more than 8 sides, then the last interior angle must measure at least $1260^\circ - 1070^\circ = 190^\circ$.  But this is impossible because each interior angle of a convex polygon has measure less than $180^\circ$. The answer is $\boxed{8}$
