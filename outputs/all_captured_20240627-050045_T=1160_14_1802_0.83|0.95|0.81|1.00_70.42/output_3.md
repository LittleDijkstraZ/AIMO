Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The given equation is $ ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

A product of two terms equals zero if and only if at least one of the terms is zero. So, either $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$ or $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

If $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$, then both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These two equations imply that $x = y$ or $x = -y$. So, the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$ lie on the lines $y = x$ and $y = -x$.

If $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$, then both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These two equations imply that $-8 \le x \le 8$ and $-8 \le y \le 8$. So, the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ lie in a square with side length $16$ centered at the origin.

The intersection of these two sets of points is a square with side length $10$ centered at the origin. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. So, the area of the convex polygon is $100$.

The answer is: $100$.

## QUESTION 3 - 1

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"An ellipse is defined parametrically by
\[(x,y) = \left( \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t}, \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t} \right).\]Then the equation of the ellipse can be written in the form
\[Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0,\]where $A,$ $B,$ $C,$ $D,$ $E,$ and $F$ are integers, and $\gcd(|A|,|B|,|C|,|D|,|E|,|F|) = 1.$  Find $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F|.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
In the equation $y = \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\cos t$ to get
\[\cos t = \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3}.\]In the equation $x = \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\sin t$ to get
\[\sin t = \frac{1}{2} x (2 - \cos t) + 1 = \frac{1}{2} x \left( 2 - \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right) + 1 = 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)}.\]Since $\cos^2 t + \sin^2 t = 1,$
\[\left( \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right)^2 + \left( 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)} \right)^2 = 1.\]Multiplying both sides by $(2(y + 3))^2$ and expanding, it will simplify to
\[81x^2 - 36xy + 16y^2 - 108x + 240y + 900 = 0.\]Therefore, $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F| = 81 + 36 + 16 + 108 + 240 + 900 = \boxed{1381}.$ The answer is $\boxed{1381}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we first need to understand that the expression is equal to zero if either of the terms inside the product is equal to zero. Therefore, we can break down the problem into four separate cases:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For each case, we can solve the equation to find the values of $x$ and $y$ that satisfy the condition. Then, we can plot these points on a coordinate plane and connect them to form the boundary of the polygon. Finally, we can calculate the area of the polygon.

The Python code below solves the problem and calculates the area of the polygon:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solve, Abs

def calculate_area():
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # Solve each case
    case1 = solve(Abs(x + y) - 10, Abs(x + y))
    case2 = solve(Abs(x - y) - 10, Abs(x - y))
    case3 = solve(Abs(x) - 8, Abs(x))
    case4 = solve(Abs(y) - 8, Abs(y))

    # Combine all solutions
    solutions = case1 + case2 + case3 + case4

    # Extract the vertices of the polygon
    vertices = [(x.evalf(subs={x: val[0], y: val[1]}), y.evalf(subs={x: val[0], y: val[1]})) for val in solutions]

    # Calculate the area of the polygon
    area = abs(0.5 * sum(x0*y1 - x1*y0 for (x0, y0), (x1, y1) in zip(vertices, vertices[1:] + [vertices[0]])))

    return area

area = calculate_area()
print(area)
```

    raise NotImplementedError('solving %s when the argument '

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
Traceback: line 1007, in solve
    raise NotImplementedError('solving %s when the argument '
NotImplementedError: solving Abs(x + y) when the argument is not real or imaginary.

FAIL

```
Unfortunately, the code above doesn't work as expected because the `solve` function doesn't support solving absolute value equations. However, we can solve these equations manually and get the vertices of the polygon.

For case 1, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$. Similarly, we can solve the other three cases and get:

1. $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$
2. $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$
3. $x = 8$ or $x = -8$
4. $y = 8$ or $y = -8$

The vertices of the polygon can be obtained by combining the solutions for each case:

1. $(8, 2)$, $(8, -18)$, $(-8, 18)$, $(-8, -2)$
2. $(18, 8)$, $(18, -8)$, $(-18, 8)$, $(-18, -8)$

The polygon is a rectangle with side lengths of 16 and 18. Therefore, the area of the polygon is $16 \times 18 = 288$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 288. The answer is $\boxed{288}$.

Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Let $w$ be the width of each of the identical rectangles. Since $PQ=3w$, $RS=2x$ and $PQ=RS$ (because $PQRS$ is a rectangle), then $2x = 3w$, or $$w=\frac{2}{3}x.$$ Therefore, the area of each of the five identical rectangles is $$x\left(\frac{2}{3}x\right)=\frac{2}{3}x^2.$$ Since the area of $PQRS$ is 4000 and it is made up of five of these identical smaller rectangles, then $$5\left(\frac{2}{3}x^2\right)=4000$$ or $$\frac{10}{3}x^2 = 4000$$ or $x^2 = 1200$ or $x \approx 34.6$ which, when rounded off to the nearest integer, is $\boxed{35}.$ The answer is $\boxed{35}$

**Solution:** 


First, we need to understand that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the equation 
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$
implies that either
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$$
or
$$((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$
For the first case,
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0,$$
this implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the four lines $y = x \pm 10$ and $y = -x \pm 10$.
For the second case,
$$((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0,$$
this implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So we get the four lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

The points $\left(x, y\right)$ that satisfy the original equation are the intersections of these lines, which form a square with side length $20$. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $400$. The answer is: $400$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Step 1: Notice that the given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. Hence, either the first expression is zero or the second one is. 

Step 2: For the first expression, either $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x - y| - 10 = 0$. This means $|x + y| = 10$ or $|x - y| = 10$. The solutions to these equations form a square with side length 20.

Step 3: For the second expression, either $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$. This means $|x| = 8$ or $|y| = 8$. The solutions to these equations form a square with side length 16.

Step 4: The intersection of the solutions to the two sets of equations is a square with side length 8 (the smaller of the two squares).

Step 5: To find the area of this square, we simply square the side length, so the area is $8^2 = 64$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 64. The python code to compute this would be:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    side_length = 8
    area = side_length ** 2

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



We have a system of equations:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From equation 1, we get $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means either $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$. Similarly, from equation 2, we get $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means either $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$. From equation 3, we get $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means either $x = 8$ or $x = -8$. And from equation 4, we get $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means either $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

Now we can find all the possible combinations of $x$ and $y$ that satisfy these equations. The solutions are:

1. $x = 8, y = 2$
2. $x = 8, y = -2$
3. $x = -8, y = 2$
4. $x = -8, y = -2$
5. $x = 2, y = 8$
6. $x = 2, y = -8$
7. $x = -2, y = 8$
8. $x = -2, y = -8$

These are the vertices of the polygon. Now we need to calculate the area of this polygon. The polygon is a square with side length 16 (since the distance between each pair of vertices is 16). The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. So the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The expression equals zero if either of the two factors equal zero. Thus, we have two systems of equations to solve.

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

Solving these equations, we find that the points that satisfy either system are:

1. $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$
2. $(10, 0), (0, 10), (-10, 0), (0, -10)$

These points form a square with side length 16. Therefore, the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. 

```python
