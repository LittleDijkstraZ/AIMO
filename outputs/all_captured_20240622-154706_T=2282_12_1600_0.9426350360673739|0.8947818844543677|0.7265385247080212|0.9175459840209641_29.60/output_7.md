Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, we can see that the equation $A*B = 0$ if and only if $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. So, we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For case 1, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us a square with side length 10, so its area is $10^2 = 100$.

For case 2, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us a square with side length 8, so its area is $8^2 = 64$.

Adding the areas of these two squares gives us the total area of the convex polygon: $100 + 64 = 164$.

However, this is not the correct answer. We made an error in our analysis. Let's reconsider the problem.

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the square with vertices at $( \pm 10, 0)$, $(0, \pm 10)$.

The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the square with vertices at $( \pm 8, 0)$, $(0, \pm 8)$.

The intersection of these two squares is the square with vertices at $( \pm 8, 0)$, $(0, \pm 8)$, which has an area of $64$. So the area of the convex polygon is 64.

The correct answer is 64.

Here is the entire script:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    # Case 1: |x + y| = 10 and |x - y| = 10
    # This gives us a square with side length 10
    area1 = 10**2

    # Case 2: |x| = 8 and |y| = 8
    # This gives us a square with side length 8
    area2 = 8**2

    # The intersection of the two squares is the square with side length 8
    # So we only consider the area of the second case
    total_area = area2

    return total_area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 64

INTERMEDIATE OUT :

The area of the convex polygon is $64$. The answer is $\boxed{64}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, we need to understand that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to two separate conditions:

   a) $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$
   
   b) $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$

2. From condition a), we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only way this can happen is if $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get four possible pairs of $(x, y)$: $(5, 5)$, $(-5, -5)$, $(5, -5)$, and $(-5, 5)$.

3. From condition b), we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The only way this can happen is if $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Thus, we have four more possible pairs of $(x, y)$: $(8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, $(8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$.

4. Now, we need to find the intersection points of these eight pairs. By comparing the four pairs from condition a) with the four pairs from condition b), we can see that the only intersection point is $(8, 8)$.

5. The points $(5, 5)$, $(-5, -5)$, $(5, -5)$, $(-5, 5)$, $(8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, $(8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$ form a square with side length $10$. Therefore, the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $100$. The answer is: $100$

The given equation is equivalent to the product of two expressions being zero, which means that each expression must be zero individually. This gives us four absolute value equations:

1. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$
2. $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$
3. $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$
4. $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$

Solving these equations, we get the following four pairs of $(x, y)$:

1. $(x, y) = (8, 8)$
2. $(x, y) = (8, -8)$
3. $(x, y) = (-8, 8)$
4. $(x, y) = (-8, -8)$

These four points form a square with side length 16. The area of the square is therefore $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $f(x,y) = ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$

is satisfied if and only if at least one of the factors is zero. This occurs if and only if at least one of the following conditions holds:

1. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$, $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$, or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.

2. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$ simultaneously.

3. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ simultaneously.

4. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$ simultaneously.

5. $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ simultaneously.

6. $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$ simultaneously.

7. $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$ simultaneously.

Now we can solve each of these conditions separately. The first condition implies that the points $(x,y)$ lie on a square with side length 16 (since $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$ means that $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives the side length of the square). The second to the seventh conditions imply that the points $(x,y)$ lie on a square with side length 20 (since $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$ means that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which gives the side length of the square).

Therefore, the points $(x,y)$ satisfying $f(x,y) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon, which is the union of two squares: one with side length 16 and the other with side length 20. The area of this convex polygon is the sum of the areas of these two squares.

Using the formula for the area of a square (side length squared), we find that the area of the square with side length 16 is $16^2 = 256$, and the area of the square with side length 20 is $20^2 = 400$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $256 + 400 = 656$. So the numerical value of the area of the convex polygon is 656. The answer is: $656$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, we need to recognize that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So we can break down the given equation into two separate equations: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. Solving the first two equations, we get $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0)$.
3. Solving the second pair of equations, we get $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So the vertices of the polygon are also $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$.
4. Plotting these points on a graph, we see that the polygon is a square with side length 10.
5. The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

First, let's import the necessary libraries, which include sympy and numpy. The `sympy` library provides the functionality to deal with mathematical expressions and symbols, while `numpy` helps in numerical computation.

It seems that there might be a mistake in the logic or the way the equations are set up. The problem might be that we are trying to solve a system of equations involving absolute values, which are not straightforward to handle using sympy. A more manual approach might be needed to solve this problem.

Let's think about the absolute value expressions. The expressions $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x-y| - 10 = 0$ imply that $x+y = 10$ and $x-y = 10$ or $x+y = 10$ and $x-y = -10$ or $x+y = -10$ and $x-y = 10$ or $x+y = -10$ and $x-y = -10$. Similarly, the expressions $|x| - 8 = 0$ and $|y| - 8 = 0$ imply that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. 

This gives us a total of 16 combinations to consider: 

1. $x+y = 10$, $x-y = 10$, $x = 8$, $y = 8$
2. $x+y = 10$, $x-y = 10$, $x = 8$, $y = -8$
3. $x+y = 10$, $x-y = 10$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$
4. $x+y = 10$, $x-y = 10$, $x = -8$, $y = -8$
5. $x+y = 10$, $x-y = -10$, $x = 8$, $y = 8$
6. $x+y = 10$, $x-y = -10$, $x = 8$, $y = -8$
7. $x+y = 10$, $x-y = -10$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$
8. $x+y = 10$, $x-y = -10$, $x = -8$, $y = -8$
9. $x+y = -10$, $x-y = 10$, $x = 8$, $y = 8$
10. $x+y = -10$, $x-y = 10$, $x = 8$, $y = -8$
11. $x+y = -10$, $x-y = 10$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$
12. $x+y = -10$, $x-y = 10$, $x = -8$, $y = -8$
13. $x+y = -10$, $x-y = -10$, $x = 8$, $y = 8$
14. $x+y = -10$, $x-y = -10$, $x = 8$, $y = -8$
15. $x+y = -10$, $x-y = -10$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$
16. $x+y = -10$, $x-y = -10$, $x = -8$, $y = -8$

After calculating the area for each of these combinations, we find that the area of the convex polygon is 128. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{128}$.

The entire python script is shown below:

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The equation given in the problem is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero, or the second expression is zero, or both are zero.

2. Let's consider each expression separately:
   - $ (|x + y| - 10)^2 = 0 $ implies $|x + y| = 10$, which further implies $x + y = \pm 10$.
   - $ (|x - y| - 10)^2 = 0 $ implies $|x - y| = 10$, which further implies $x - y = \pm 10$.
   - $ (|x| - 8)^2 = 0 $ implies $|x| = 8$, which further implies $x = \pm 8$.
   - $ (|y| - 8)^2 = 0 $ implies $|y| = 8$, which further implies $y = \pm 8$.

3. The solutions to these equations give us the vertices of the polygon:
   - For $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$, we get the vertices $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, and $(0, -10)$.
   - For $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$, we get the vertices $(8, 0)$, $(-8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, and $(0, -8)$.

4. By plotting these points, we find that they form a square with side length 20.

5. The area of a square is given by side length squared, so the area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.

The answer is: $400$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, we see that the expression equals zero if either of the two factors equals zero. That means we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x - y \vert = 10$
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8$
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert y \vert = 8$

Now, let's solve these equations:

1. For the first case, $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, this means $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
2. For the second case, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, this means $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
3. For the third case, $\vert x \vert = 8$, this means $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
4. For the fourth case, $\vert y \vert = 8$, this means $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

Now, let's consider all possible combinations of these equations and find the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy all of them.

1. If $x = 8$ and $y = 8$, then $x + y = 16 > 10$, so this combination doesn't work.
2. If $x = 8$ and $y = -8$, then $x + y = 0$, $x - y = 16 > 10$, so this combination doesn't work.
3. If $x = -8$ and $y = 8$, then $x + y = 0$, $x - y = -16 < -10$, so this combination doesn't work.
4. If $x = -8$ and $y = -8$, then $x + y = -16 < -10$, so this combination doesn't work.

The only combination that works is $x = 8$ and $y = -8$. Similarly, we can find the other three combinations that work: $(x, y) = (8, 8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$.

So the convex polygon is a square with side length 16. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So, we have two cases to consider: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = \pm 10$.
3. If $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x - y = \pm 10$.
4. If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$, which implies $x = \pm 8$.
5. If $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $y = \pm 8$.
6. Combining all these cases, we find that the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equation are: $(8, 8), (-8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, -8), (10, 0), (-10, 0), (0, 10), (0, -10)$. These points form a square with side length 16.
7. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    # The side length of the square is 16
    side_length = 16

    # The area of the square is side_length^2
    area = side_length**2

    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$.
