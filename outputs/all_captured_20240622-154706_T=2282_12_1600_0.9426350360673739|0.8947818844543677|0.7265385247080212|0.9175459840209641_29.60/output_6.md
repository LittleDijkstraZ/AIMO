Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"Suppose that we roll four 6-sided fair dice with faces numbered 1 to~6. Let $a/b$ be the probability that the highest roll is a 5, where $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $a + b$."
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Step 1: Calculate the total number of outcomes when rolling four 6-sided dice. This would be $6^4$.

Step 2: Calculate the number of outcomes where the highest roll is a 5. This would be the sum of the number of outcomes where exactly one die shows a 5, exactly two dice show a 5, exactly three dice show a 5, and all four dice show a 5.

- The number of outcomes where exactly one die shows a 5 can be calculated as ${4 \choose 1} \cdot 5^3 \cdot 1^1$.
- The number of outcomes where exactly two dice show a 5 can be calculated as ${4 \choose 2} \cdot 5^2 \cdot 1^2$.
- The number of outcomes where exactly three dice show a 5 can be calculated as ${4 \choose 3} \cdot 5^1 \cdot 1^3$.
- The number of outcomes where all four dice show a 5 can be calculated as ${4 \choose 4} \cdot 5^0 \cdot 1^4$.

Step 3: Calculate the probability that the highest roll is a 5 by dividing the number of outcomes where the highest roll is a 5 by the total number of outcomes.

Step 4: Express the probability as a simplified fraction $a/b$, where $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime positive integers.

Step 5: The final answer is $a + b$.

Now, let's code it in Python using sympy:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import binomial, Rational, simplify

def calculate_probability():
    total_outcomes = 6**4

    # Calculate the number of outcomes where the highest roll is a 5
    one_five = binomial(4, 1) * 5**3 * 1**1
    two_five = binomial(4, 2) * 5**2 * 1**2
    three_five = binomial(4, 3) * 5**1 * 1**3
    four_five = binomial(4, 4) * 5**0 * 1**4
    outcomes_highest_five = one_five + two_five + three_five + four_five

    # Calculate the probability
    probability = Rational(outcomes_highest_five, total_outcomes)

    # Simplify the probability
    simplified_probability = simplify(probability)

    return simplified_probability

result = calculate_probability()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 671/1296

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
671/1296
```

The probability that the highest roll is a 5 is $\frac{671}{1296}$. The sum of the numerator and the denominator of this fraction is the answer we are looking for:

$$a + b = 671 + 1296 = 1967.$$

However, it seems we made a mistake in our calculations. Let's go back and check our steps.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of outcomes when rolling four 6-sided dice. This would be $6^4$.

Step 2: Calculate the number of outcomes where the highest roll is a 5. This would be the sum of the number of outcomes where exactly one die shows a 5, exactly two dice show a 5, exactly three dice show a 5, and all four dice show a 5.

- The number of outcomes where exactly one die shows a 5 can be calculated as ${4 \choose 1} \cdot 5^3 \cdot 1^1$. However, this calculation is wrong. The correct calculation should be ${4 \choose 1} \cdot 5^3 \cdot 6^1$.
- The number of outcomes where exactly two dice show a 5 can be calculated as ${4 \choose 2} \cdot 5^2 \cdot 1^2$. This calculation is correct.
- The number of outcomes where exactly three dice show a 5 can be calculated as ${4 \choose 3} \cdot 5^1 \cdot 1^3$. This calculation is correct.
- The number of outcomes where all four dice show a 5 can be calculated as ${4 \choose 4} \cdot 5^0 \cdot 1^4$. This calculation is correct.

Step 3: Calculate the probability that the highest roll is a 5 by dividing the number of outcomes where the highest roll is a 5 by the total number of outcomes.

Step 4: Express the probability as a simplified fraction $a/b$, where $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime positive integers.

Step 5: The final answer is $a + b$.

Let's correct our code and re-run it:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import binomial, Rational, simplify

def calculate_probability():
    total_outcomes = 6**4

    # Calculate the number of outcomes where the highest roll is a 5
    one_five = binomial(4, 1) * 5**3 * 6**1
    two_five = binomial(4, 2) * 5**2 * 1**2
    three_five = binomial(4, 3) * 5**1 * 1**3
    four_five = binomial(4, 4) * 5**0 * 1**4
    outcomes_highest_five = one_five + two_five + three_five + four_five

    # Calculate the probability
    probability = Rational(outcomes_highest_five, total_outcomes)

    # Simplify the probability
    simplified_probability = simplify(probability)

    return simplified_probability

result = calculate_probability()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 1057/432

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
1057/432
```

The probability that the highest roll is a 5 is $\frac{1057}{432}$. However, this fraction is not in its simplest form. Let's simplify it:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import gcd, simplify

def simplify_fraction(fraction):
    numerator, denominator = fraction.as_numer_denom()
    g = gcd(numerator, denominator)
    simplified_fraction = simplify(fraction)
    return simplified_fraction

simplified_probability = simplify_fraction(result)
print(simplified_probability)
```

CODE RESULTS 1057/432

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
1057/432
```

The simplified probability is still $\frac{1057}{432}$. This seems correct.

Now, let's calculate the sum of the numerator and the denominator of this fraction:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

result_sum = simplified_probability.p + simplified_probability.q
print(result_sum)
``````output

CODE RESULTS 1489

INTERMEDIATE OUT :

1489
```
The sum of the numerator and the denominator of the simplified probability fraction is 1489. So the answer is $1489$. However, this is not the correct answer. Let's go back and check our calculations again.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"Suppose that we roll four 6-sided fair dice with faces numbered 1 to~6. Let $a/b$ be the probability that the highest roll is a 5, where $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $a + b$."
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability that the highest roll of four 6-sided dice is a 5. 

First, we calculate the total number of outcomes when rolling four dice. Each die has 6 outcomes, so for four dice, the total number of outcomes is $6^4 = 1296$.

Next, we need to calculate the number of outcomes where the highest roll is a 5. This means that one die must show a 5, and the other three dice must show a number less than or equal to 5. The die showing the 5 can be any of the four dice, and the three dice showing a number less than or equal to 5 can show any of the 5 numbers (1 to 5) with equal probability. So the number of outcomes is $4 \times 5^3 = 500$.

Therefore, the probability that the highest roll is a 5 is $\frac{500}{1296}$. We simplify this fraction to its lowest terms by dividing the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 4. We get $\frac{125}{324}$.

So, $a = 125$ and $b = 324$, and $a + b = 125 + 324 = 449$. The answer is: $449$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Step 1: First, we need to calculate the total number of outcomes when rolling four 6-sided dice. This is simply $6^4$.

Step 2: Now we need to calculate the number of outcomes where the highest roll is a 5. This means that at least one of the dice must show a 5, and the others can show any number from 1 to 4 (since the highest roll is a 5). The number of ways to choose which die shows the 5 is 4 (since there are 4 dice), and the number of ways to choose the rolls for the other dice is $4^4$ (since each of the other dice can show a number from 1 to 4). So the total number of outcomes with the highest roll as 5 is $4 \times 4^4$.

Step 3: The probability that the highest roll is a 5 is then the ratio of the number of outcomes with the highest roll as 5 to the total number of outcomes. So the probability is $\frac{4 \times 4^4}{6^4}$.

Step 4: To express this probability in the form $\frac{a}{b}$, where $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime positive integers, we can simplify the fraction.

Step 5: Finally, we need to find $a + b$, where $a$ and $b$ are the numerator and denominator of the simplified fraction.

Here is the python code to perform these calculations:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, simplify

def calculate_probability():
    total_outcomes = 6**4
    outcomes_with_highest_5 = 4 * 4**4

```

CODE RESULTS 1.79012345679012

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
1.79012345679012
```

It seems we have made a mistake here. We are getting a decimal value which is not possible for the sum of numerator and denominator of a fraction. Let's revisit the calculations.

We have calculated the number of outcomes where the highest roll is a 5 as $4 \times 4^4$. However, this is not correct. Each die can show a number from 1 to 5 (not 4), so the number of outcomes where the highest roll is a 5 is $5^4 - 4^4$. This is because $5^4$ represents the total number of outcomes when rolling four dice, and $4^4$ represents the number of outcomes when all dice show a number from 1 to 4 (the highest roll is not a 5).

Let's correct the calculations:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, simplify

def calculate_probability():
    total_outcomes = 6**4
    outcomes_with_highest_5 = 5**4 - 4**4
    probability = outcomes_with_highest_5 / total_outcomes
    simplified_probability = simplify(probability)
    a, b = simplified_probability.as_numer_denom()
    return a + b

result = calculate_probability()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 1.28472222222222

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
1.28472222222222
```

Again, we are getting a decimal value. Let's revisit the calculations one more time.

The number of outcomes where the highest roll is a 5 is not $5^4 - 4^4$. This is because the number of ways to choose which die shows the 5 is 4 (since there are 4 dice), and the number of ways to choose the rolls for the other dice is $4^4$. So the total number of outcomes with the highest roll as 5 is $4 \times (5^3 - 4^3)$.

Let's correct the calculations again:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, simplify

def calculate_probability():
    total_outcomes = 6**4
    outcomes_with_highest_5 = 4 * (5**3 - 4**3)
    probability = outcomes_with_highest_5 / total_outcomes
    simplified_probability = simplify(probability)
    a, b = simplified_probability.as_numer_denom()
    return a + b

result = calculate_probability()
print(result)
``````output

CODE RESULTS 1.18827160493827

INTERMEDIATE OUT :

1.18827160493827
```

Still not the correct answer. Let's analyze the calculations one more time.

The number of outcomes where the highest roll is a 5 is indeed $4 \times (5^3 - 4^3)$. But when we calculate the probability, we should divide this by the total number of outcomes, which is $6^4$, not $5^4$.

Let's correct the calculations one last time:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, simplify

def calculate_probability():
    total_outcomes = 6**4
    outcomes_with_highest_5 = 4 * (5**3 - 4**3)
    probability = outcomes_with_highest_5 / total_outcomes
    simplified_probability = simplify(probability)
    a, b = simplified_probability.as_numer_denom()
    return a + b

result = calculate_probability()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 1.18827160493827

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
1.18827160493827
```

The result is still a decimal value. This suggests that we might have made an error in our calculations. Let's go back and re-evaluate the problem step by step.

Step 1: First, we need to calculate the total number of outcomes when rolling four 6-sided dice. This is simply $6^4$.

Step 2: Now we need to calculate the number of outcomes where the highest roll is a 5. This means that at least one of the dice must show a 5, and the others can show any number from 1 to 4 (since the highest roll is a 5). The number of ways to choose which die shows the 5 is 4 (since there are 4 dice), and the number of ways to choose the rolls for the other dice is $4^3$. So the total number of outcomes with the highest roll as 5 is $4 \times 4^3$.

Step 3: The probability that the highest roll is a 5 is then the ratio of the number of outcomes with the highest roll as 5 to the total number of outcomes. So the probability is $\frac{4 \times 4^3}{6^4}$.

Step 4: To express this probability in the form $\frac{a}{b}$, where $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime positive integers, we can simplify the fraction.

Step 5: Finally, we need to find $a + b$, where $a$ and $b$ are the numerator and denominator of the simplified fraction.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"Suppose that we roll four 6-sided fair dice with faces numbered 1 to~6. Let $a/b$ be the probability that the highest roll is a 5, where $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $a + b$."
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability that the highest roll is a 5 when rolling four 6-sided fair dice.

The total number of possible outcomes when rolling four dice is $6^4 = 1296$.

The event that the highest roll is a 5 means that at least one die must show a 5, and the other three dice can show any value from 1 to 4. The number of ways this can happen is calculated as follows:

- Choose one die to show a 5: $\binom{4}{1} = 4$ ways
- The die showing 5 can be any of the four dice: $4$ ways
- The other three dice can show any value from 1 to 4: $4^3 = 64$ ways

So the total number of favorable outcomes is $4 * 4 * 64 = 1024$.

The probability that the highest roll is a 5 is therefore $\frac{1024}{1296}$.

However, we need to express this probability in the form $a/b$, where $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime positive integers. We can simplify $\frac{1024}{1296}$ by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 16.

$\frac{1024}{1296} = \frac{64}{81}$.

So the probability that the highest roll is a 5 is $64/81$.

Finally, we need to find $a + b$, where $a$ and $b$ are the numerator and denominator of the simplified fraction.

$a + b = 64 + 81 = 145$.

Therefore, the value of $a + b$ is 145.
The answer is: $145$

Assistant:

 To solve this problem, we can use the concept of combinations. The total number of outcomes when rolling four 6-sided dice is $6^4$.
The event that the highest roll is a 5 can occur in the following ways:
1. All four dice show a 5. There is only 1 way this can happen: (5, 5, 5, 5).
2. Three dice show a 5, and one dice shows a number less than 5. There are 4 ways this can happen: (5, 5, 5, 1), (5, 5, 5, 2), (5, 5, 5, 3), (5, 5, 5, 4).
3. Two dice show a 5, and two dice show a number less than 5. There are 6 ways this can happen: (5, 5, 1, 1), (5, 5, 1, 2), (5, 5, 1, 3), (5, 5, 1, 4), (5, 5, 2, 3), (5, 5, 2, 4).
4. One dice shows a 5, and three dice show a number less than 5. There are 4 ways this can happen: (5, 1, 1, 1), (5, 1, 1, 2), (5, 1, 1, 3), (5, 1, 1, 4).
5. No dice shows a 5. This is not possible because the event we are considering requires the highest roll to be a 5.

So the total number of ways the event can occur is $1 + 4 + 6 + 4 = 15$.

Therefore, the probability that the highest roll is a 5 is $\frac{15}{6^4} = \frac{15}{1296}$.

We are asked to find the value of $a + b$, where $a/b$ is this probability. So $a = 15$ and $b = 1296$.

Finally, $a + b = 15 + 1296 = 1311$.
The answer is: $1311$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We first calculate the total number of outcomes when four 6-sided dice are rolled. Each die has 6 outcomes, so the total number of outcomes is $6^4 = 1296$.

2. To calculate the number of outcomes where the highest roll is a 5, we can consider the number of ways to get a 5 on at least one die and subtract the number of ways to get a 5 on all dice.

3. The number of ways to get a 5 on at least one die is equal to the total number of outcomes minus the number of outcomes where no die shows a 5. Since each die can show a number from 1 to 6 with equal probability, the probability of getting a number less than 5 on a single die is 4/6. The probability of getting a number less than 5 on all four dice is $(4/6)^4 = 16/81$. So the number of outcomes where at least one die shows a 5 is $1296 - (16/81)*1296 = 1152$.

4. The number of outcomes where all dice show a 5 is $1^4 = 1$.

5. Therefore, the number of outcomes where the highest roll is a 5 is $1152 - 1 = 1151$.

6. The probability of the highest roll being a 5 is then $1151/1296$.

7. To get $a$ and $b$ in the form $a/b$ we can use the fraction function in sympy.

Now let's write the script:

```python

from sympy import Rational

def calculate_probability():
    total_outcomes = 6**4
    outcomes_less_than_5 = (4/6)**4 * total_outcomes

    return probability

result = calculate_probability()
print(result)
```

This is not in the form $a/b$ where $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime positive integers. Let's correct this:

def calculate_probability():
    total_outcomes = 6**4
    outcomes_less_than_5 = (4/6)**4 * total_outcomes

    return a, b

a, b = calculate_probability()
print(a, b)
```

Now we have $a$ and $b$ in the form $a/b$ where $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime positive integers. To find $a + b$, we simply add the values of $a$ and $b$.

```python

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



There are $6^4$ total outcomes when rolling four six-sided dice. 

To get the highest roll to be a 5, exactly one of the dice must show a 5, and the other three dice must show values from 1 to 4. The number of ways to choose which die shows the 5 is $\binom{4}{1} = 4$. And the number of outcomes for the other three dice is $4^3 = 64$. So the number of successful outcomes is $4 \times 64 = 256$.

The probability of the highest roll being a 5 is then the number of successful outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes, or $\frac{256}{6^4}$.

We can use Python's `sympy` library to simplify this fraction and calculate the sum of the numerator and denominator:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import Rational, simplify

def calculate_probability():
    total_outcomes = 6**4
    successful_outcomes = 4 * 4**3

    simplified_probability = simplify(probability)

    # Calculate the sum of the numerator and denominator

 To solve this problem, we can first consider the total number of outcomes when rolling four 6-sided dice. This is simply $6^4 = 1296$.
Next, we consider the number of outcomes where the highest roll is a 5. This means that one die must show a 5, and the other three dice must show values from 1 to 4. The number of ways to choose which die shows the 5 is 4 (it can be any of the four dice), and the number of ways to roll the other three dice is $4^3 = 64$. So the total number of outcomes where the highest roll is a 5 is $4 \times 64 = 256$.
Therefore, the probability that the highest roll is a 5 is $\frac{256}{1296}$.
We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 16. This gives us $\frac{16}{81}$. So $a = 16$ and $b = 81$.
Finally, we find $a + b = 16 + 81 = 97$.

The answer is: $97$

 To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability that the highest roll is a 5 when four 6-sided fair dice are rolled. 

The probability that a single die roll results in a 5 is 1/6, since there is one 5 and six possible outcomes.

The probability that all four dice show a 5 is the product of the probabilities of each individual die showing a 5. So, the probability is $(1/6) * (1/6) * (1/6) * (1/6) = 1/1296$.

However, the highest roll could be a 5 in more than one way. It could be a 5 on exactly one die, two dice, three dice, or all four dice.

The number of ways a 5 can appear exactly once in four dice is given by the binomial coefficient $\binom{4}{1} = 4$.
The number of ways a 5 can appear exactly twice in four dice is given by the binomial coefficient $\binom{4}{2} = 6$.
The number of ways a 5 can appear exactly thrice in four dice is given by the binomial coefficient $\binom{4}{3} = 4$.
The number of ways a 5 can appear exactly four times in four dice is given by the binomial coefficient $\binom{4}{4} = 1$.

So, the total number of ways the highest roll could be a 5 is $4 + 6 + 4 + 1 = 15$.

Therefore, the probability that the highest roll is a 5 is $15 * (1/1296) = 15/1296$.

This fraction can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3. So, the simplified fraction is $5/432$.

The problem asks for the sum of the numerator and the denominator of the simplified fraction, so the answer is $5 + 432 = 437$.

Here is the Python code to calculate the probability:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import binomial

def calculate_probability():
    total_ways = 6**4
    ways_with_highest_five = sum(binomial(4, k) for k in range(1, 5))
    probability = ways_with_highest_five / total_ways
    simplified_probability = probability.simplify()
    return simplified_probability

probability = calculate_probability()
print(probability)
```

CODE RESULTS 5/432

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
5/432
```

The probability that the highest roll is a 5 is $5/432$.

To find the value of $a + b$ where $a/b$ is the simplified fraction representation of the probability, we can simply add the numerator and the denominator of the probability:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def calculate_sum():
    a, b = probability.as_numer_denom()
    return a + b

sum_value = calculate_sum()
print(sum_value)
```

CODE RESULTS 437

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
437
```

The value of $a + b$ is $437$. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{437}$.
The answer is $\boxed{437}$.

Assistant:

 To solve this problem, we need to find the probability that the highest roll is a 5 when rolling four 6-sided fair dice. The highest roll is a 5 means that all four dice show a number less than or equal to 5. The probability of getting a number less than or equal to 5 on a single die is 5/6. Since the rolls are independent, we can simply raise the probability of getting a number less than or equal to 5 on a single die to the power of the number of dice (4 in this case). So the probability that the highest roll is a 5 is $(5/6)^4$. 

To express this probability in the form of a fraction $a/b$, we can calculate the value of $(5/6)^4$ and then simplify it to its lowest terms. The Python code to do this is shown below:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import Rational, simplify

def calculate_probability():
    probability = Rational(5, 6)**4
    simplified_probability = simplify(probability)
    return simplified_probability

result = calculate_probability()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 625/1296

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
625/1296
```
So the probability that the highest roll is a 5 is $625/1296$. Now we need to find $a + b$, where $a$ and $b$ are the numerator and denominator of the probability, respectively.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def calculate_sum():
    a = 625
    b = 1296
    sum_ab = a + b
    return sum_ab

sum_ab = calculate_sum()
print(sum_ab)
```

CODE RESULTS 1921

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output

So the sum of the numerator and denominator of the probability is $1921$. The answer is: $1921$.

Assistant:

 The total number of outcomes when rolling four 6-sided dice is $6^4 = 1296$.
To get the highest roll to be a 5, there are three possibilities for the four dice rolls:
1. One die shows a 5, and the other three dice show numbers from 1 to 4. The number of ways this can happen is $\binom{4}{1} \cdot 4^3 = 256$.
2. Two dice show a 5, and the other two dice show numbers from 1 to 4. The number of ways this can happen is $\binom{4}{2} \cdot 4^2 = 144$.
3. Three dice show a 5, and the last die shows a number from 1 to 4. The number of ways this can happen is $\binom{4}{3} \cdot 4 = 16$.
4. All four dice show a 5. The number of ways this can happen is $\binom{4}{4} = 1$.
So the total number of ways the highest roll is a 5 is $256 + 144 + 16 + 1 = 417$.
Therefore, the probability that the highest roll is a 5 is $\frac{417}{1296}$.
Simplifying the fraction, we find that the probability is $\frac{139}{432}$.
Finally, we need to find $a + b$ where $a/b$ is the simplified form of the probability.
So $a = 139$ and $b = 432$.
Finally, we calculate $a + b = 139 + 432 = 571$. The answer is: $571$

To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, we need to calculate the total number of outcomes when we roll four 6-sided dice. This is simply $6^4$.

Next, we need to calculate the number of outcomes where the highest roll is a 5. This means that exactly one of the dice shows a 5, and the other three dice show numbers from 1 to 4. The number of ways to choose which die shows the 5 is 4 (since there are 4 dice), and the number of ways to arrange the other three dice is $4^3$. So the number of favorable outcomes is $4 * 4^3$.

The probability that the highest roll is a 5 is then the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes, which is $\frac{4 * 4^3}{6^4}$.

Let's simplify this fraction using sympy:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Rational, simplify

def calculate_probability():
    a, b = symbols('a b')

    # Calculate the total number of outcomes
    total_outcomes = 6**4

    # Calculate the number of favorable outcomes
    favorable_outcomes = 4 * 4**3

    # Calculate the probability
    probability = Rational(favorable_outcomes, total_outcomes)

    # Simplify the probability
    simplified_probability = simplify(probability)

    return simplified_probability

result = calculate_probability()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 16/81

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
16/81
```

The probability that the highest roll is a 5 is $\frac{16}{81}$. Therefore, $a = 16$ and $b = 81$, and $a + b = 16 + 81 = 97$. The answer is $\boxed{97}$.
