Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



We are asked to find a unique increasing geometric sequence of five 2-digit positive integers. This means we are looking for five 2-digit numbers that are in a geometric progression.

Let's denote the first term as $a$, the common ratio as $r$, and the number of terms as $n=5$. 

The $n$-th term of a geometric sequence can be expressed as $a \cdot r^{(n-1)}$. So the five terms of our sequence will be: $a, ar, ar^2, ar^3, ar^4$.

We want all these terms to be 2-digit numbers. This means $10 \leq a, ar, ar^2, ar^3, ar^4 \leq 99$.

Now we need to find the values of $a$ and $r$. We can start by setting $a = 10$ (the smallest 2-digit number) and then try to find a suitable $r$. 

After some trial and error, we find that $r = 2$ gives us the sequence: $10, 20, 40, 80, 160$, which all are 2-digit numbers.

However, the last term $160$ is a 3-digit number, so we need to try a smaller value for $a$. 

If we set $a = 5$ and $r = 2$, we get the sequence: $5, 10, 20, 40, 80$, which all are 2-digit numbers.

Now we have our sequence, and we can sum them up to find the total: $5 + 10 + 20 + 40 + 80 = 155$.

So the sum of the unique increasing geometric sequence of five 2-digit positive integers is $155$.

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{155}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The problem asks for a unique increasing geometric sequence of 5 2-digit positive integers. The common ratio of a geometric sequence must be the same for all terms. Let's denote the first term as $a$ and the common ratio as $r$. The sequence will look like this: $a, ar, ar^2, ar^3, ar^4$. All these terms should be 2-digit positive integers.

Now we need to find $a$ and $r$. Since all terms are 2-digit positive integers and the sequence is increasing, $a$ must be 10 (the smallest 2-digit integer) and $r$ must be 2 (the smallest integer greater than 1 that will produce all 2-digit terms). So our sequence is: 10, 20, 40, 80, 160.

Finally, we need to find the sum of these terms. We can use the formula for the sum of a geometric sequence: $S = \frac{a(r^n - 1)}{r - 1}$, where $S$ is the sum, $a$ is the first term, $r$ is the common ratio, and $n$ is the number of terms. In our case, $a = 10$, $r = 2$, and $n = 5$. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

$S = \frac{10(2^5 - 1)}{2 - 1} = \frac{10(32 - 1)}{1} = \frac{10 \cdot 31}{1} = 310$.

So the sum of the sequence is 310. The answer is: $310$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We need to find a geometric sequence of five 2-digit positive integers. A geometric sequence is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a fixed, non-zero number called the ratio.

2. The sequence should be increasing and contain only 2-digit positive integers. Let's denote the first term as $a$, the common ratio as $r$, and the number of terms as $n$. So we have $a$, $ar$, $ar^2$, $ar^3$, and $ar^4$.

3. The first term $a$ should be a 2-digit positive integer, and the common ratio $r$ should be a positive integer.

4. To find the values of $a$ and $r$, we need to find a pair of values that satisfy these conditions. By trial and error, we find that $a=2$ and $r=3$ work. So the sequence is $2$, $6$, $18$, $54$, $162$.

5. To find the sum of these five terms, we simply add them up: $2 + 6 + 18 + 54 + 162 = 242$.

So the sum of the five terms in the sequence is $242$. The answer is: $242$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, we need to find a unique increasing geometric sequence of five 2-digit positive integers.
2. The common ratio of the geometric sequence should be a positive integer.
3. Let's start with the first term a and the common ratio r. Since we want 2-digit integers, we can start with a=16 and r=2. So the sequence is: 16, 32, 64, 128, 256.
4. To find the sum of this sequence, we can use the formula for the sum of a geometric sequence: S = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r), where n is the number of terms.
5. Plugging in the values, we get S = 16 * (1 - 2^5) / (1 - 2) = 16 * (1 - 32) / (-1) = 16 * (-31) / (-1) = 496.

Now let's write the Python script to calculate the sum:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solve

def sum_of_geometric_sequence():
    # Define the first term and common ratio
    a = 16
    r = 2
    n = 5

    # Calculate the sum of the sequence
    S = a * (1 - r**n) / (1 - r)

    return S

result = sum_of_geometric_sequence()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 496.0

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output

```
The sum of the unique increasing geometric sequence of five 2-digit positive integers is 496.
The answer is: $496$

 The unique increasing geometric sequence of five 2-digit positive integers with a common ratio of 2 is: 16, 32, 64, 128, 256.

To find the sum of these numbers, we can use the formula for the sum of a geometric series:

$$S = a \frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r}$$

where $a$ is the first term, $r$ is the common ratio, and $n$ is the number of terms.

In this case, $a = 16$, $r = 2$, and $n = 5$. Plugging these values into the formula gives:

$$S = 16 \frac{1 - 2^5}{1 - 2} = 16 \frac{1 - 32}{-1} = 16 \cdot 31 = 496$$

So the sum of the sequence is 496.
The answer is: $496$

 A geometric sequence is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a fixed, non-zero number called the ratio. If a is the first term of the sequence, and r is the common ratio, then the nth term of the sequence is given by $a \cdot r^{(n-1)}$.

We are given that we have a sequence of 5 2-digit positive integers, and it is increasing and geometric. This means that the ratio r must be a positive integer. Also, since the first term is a 2-digit number, a must be a 2-digit number.

The smallest 2-digit number is 10, so we can start with a = 10. The common ratio r must be such that all the terms of the sequence are 2-digit numbers. 

By trial and error, we find that r = 2 satisfies this condition, as the terms of the sequence are 10, 20, 40, 80, and 160. All of these are 2-digit numbers.

Now, we can find the sum of these numbers: 10 + 20 + 40 + 80 + 160 = 310.

So, the sum of the five numbers is 310. The answer is: $310$

 To find the sum of the five 2-digit positive integers in an increasing geometric sequence, we first need to find the common ratio of the sequence. Let's denote the first term as $a$ and the common ratio as $r$. Then the five terms of the sequence are $a$, $ar$, $ar^2$, $ar^3$, and $ar^4$. Since they are all 2-digit positive integers, we can start by trying values for $a$ and $r$.

For example, let's try $a = 27$ (a 2-digit number) and $r = 2$ (to make the sequence increasing and geometric). Then the five terms are $27$, $54$, $108$, $216$, and $432$. All of these are 2-digit positive integers. So we have found a sequence that meets the conditions.

Now, we can find the sum of these five terms: $27 + 54 + 108 + 216 + 432 = 837$. So the sum of the five 2-digit positive integers in an increasing geometric sequence is $837$.

Here is a Python code to compute the sum:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def geometric_sequence_sum():
    a = 27
    r = 2
    terms = [a * r**i for i in range(5)]
    return sum(terms)

result = geometric_sequence_sum()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 837

The sum of the five 2-digit positive integers in an increasing geometric sequence is $837$. The answer is: $837$

 To solve this problem, we can use Python to calculate the sum of the unique increasing geometric sequence of five 2-digit positive integers.

The sequence starts with the smallest 2-digit positive integer, which is 10. Since it's an increasing geometric sequence, each term is multiplied by a common ratio to get the next term. Let's denote the common ratio as r. Then the sequence will be: 10, 10r, 10r^2, 10r^3, 10r^4. All these terms are 2-digit positive integers, so we have the following inequalities: 10 <= 10r <= 100, 10 <= 10r^2 <= 100, 10 <= 10r^3 <= 100, and 10 <= 10r^4 <= 100. From these inequalities, we can deduce that 1 <= r <= 10. By trial and error, we find that the only value of r that satisfies all the inequalities is r = 2. So the sequence becomes: 10, 20, 40, 80, 160. The sum of these numbers is:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def sum_sequence():
    sequence = [10, 20, 40, 80, 160]
    return sum(sequence)

result = sum_sequence()
print(result)
```

The sum of the unique increasing geometric sequence of five 2-digit positive integers is 310. The answer is: $310$
