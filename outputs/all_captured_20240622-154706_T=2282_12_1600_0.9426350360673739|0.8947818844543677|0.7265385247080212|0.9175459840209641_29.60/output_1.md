 To solve this problem, we can use the concept of triangular numbers. A triangular number is the number of dots that can be arranged in an equilateral triangle. The nth triangular number is given by the formula: T(n) = n*(n+1)/2.

The problem states that the sum of any two yellow numbers must be a blue number. This means that the sum of all the yellow numbers must be half of the sum of all the numbers from 111 to 999. The sum of all the numbers from 111 to 999 can be calculated as: (111 + 999) * 9 * 10 / 2 = 45000. So, the sum of all the yellow numbers must be 45000 / 2 = 22500.

Now, we want to find the maximum number of yellow numbers. This is achieved when the sum of any two yellow numbers is as small as possible. The smallest possible sum of two numbers is achieved when both numbers are as small as possible. The smallest yellow number is 111. So, we want to find the largest number of 111's that add up to 22500.

To find this, we divide 22500 by 111, which gives approximately 202.7. Since we can't have a fraction of a number, we take the integer part of this, which is 202.

So, the maximum possible number of yellow numbers is 202.
The answer is: $202$.

"Each of the three-digits numbers $111$ to $999$ is coloured blue or yellow in such a way that the sum of any two (not necessarily different) yellow numbers is equal to a blue number. What is the maximum possible number of yellow numbers there can be?"

 This problem is a classic example of a problem that can be solved using the Pigeonhole Principle. The Pigeonhole Principle states that if there are $n$ pigeonholes and $n+1$ pigeons, then at least one pigeonhole must contain more than one pigeon.

In this case, the "pigeonholes" are the blue numbers, and the "pigeons" are the yellow numbers. Each yellow number is added to another yellow number to get a blue number. So if we have more yellow numbers than blue numbers, by the Pigeonhole Principle, there must be at least one blue number that is the sum of two yellow numbers, which contradicts the problem statement.

Therefore, the number of yellow numbers cannot exceed the number of blue numbers. The number of three-digit numbers from 111 to 999 is 891 (999 - 111 + 1), so the number of blue numbers is 891. Therefore, the maximum possible number of yellow numbers is 891.

However, this solution assumes that all blue numbers are the sum of two distinct yellow numbers. In fact, this is not possible, as the minimum blue number is 112 (111 + 1), and the maximum yellow number is 999 - 111 = 888. The sum of the two smallest yellow numbers (111 and 112) is 223, which is less than the minimum blue number 112. This means that there must be some blue numbers that are the sum of the same yellow number twice.

To find the maximum number of yellow numbers, we need to consider the distribution of the blue numbers. The blue numbers range from 112 to 198, with a step of 1, for a total of 87. The blue numbers range from 200 to 297, with a step of 1, for a total of 98. The blue numbers range from 300 to 399, with a step of 1, for a total of 100. The blue numbers range from 400 to 499, with a step of 1, for a total of 100. The blue numbers range from 500 to 599, with a step of 1, for a total of 100. The blue numbers range from 600 to 699, with a step of 1, for a total of 100. The blue numbers range from 700 to 799, with a step of 1, for a total of 100. The blue numbers range from 800 to 899, with a step of 1, for a total of 100. The blue numbers 900 and 999 each have only one occurrence.

Therefore, the total number of blue numbers is 87 + 98 + 100 + 100 + 100 + 100 + 100 + 100 + 2 = 897. This means that the maximum number of yellow numbers is 897.

Therefore, the maximum possible number of yellow numbers there can be is 897. The answer is: $897$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. Let's denote the maximum possible number of yellow numbers as $y$. The total number of three-digit numbers from 111 to 999 is $999 - 111 + 1 = 899$.
2. According to the problem, the sum of any two yellow numbers should be a blue number. This means that the sum of any two yellow numbers should be less than or equal to the total number of blue numbers, which is $899 - y$.
3. To maximize the number of yellow numbers, we should choose the smallest possible blue numbers for the sum of two yellow numbers. The smallest blue number is 111.
4. The maximum possible sum of two yellow numbers is $2 * 999 = 1998$.
5. Therefore, we have the inequality $2 * 111 \leq 1998 - y$, which simplifies to $222 \leq 1998 - y$.
6. Solving this inequality for $y$ gives $y \leq 1998 - 222 = 1776$.
7. However, we need to find the maximum integer value of $y$ that satisfies this inequality. So, we have $y = \lfloor 1776 \rfloor = 1776$.
8. Therefore, the maximum possible number of yellow numbers is 1776. However, this is not possible because there are only 899 numbers in total.
9. We made a mistake in step 2. The sum of any two yellow numbers should be less than or equal to the maximum blue number, which is 999. So, we should use the inequality $2 * 111 \leq 999 - y$.
10. Solving this inequality for $y$ gives $y \leq 999 - 222 = 777$.
11. Again, we need to find the maximum integer value of $y$ that satisfies this inequality. So, we have $y = \lfloor 777 \rfloor = 777$.
12. Therefore, the maximum possible number of yellow numbers is 777.

Now, let's write a Python script to verify our solution:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import floor

def max_yellow_numbers():
    # The smallest blue number is 111
    smallest_blue = 111

    # The maximum blue number is 999
    max_blue = 999

    # The maximum possible sum of two yellow numbers is 2 * max_blue
    max_sum_yellow = 2 * max_blue

    # The maximum possible number of yellow numbers is the maximum integer y that satisfies the inequality 2 * smallest_blue <= max_sum_yellow - y
    y = floor(max_sum_yellow - 2 * smallest_blue)

    return y

result = max_yellow_numbers()
print(result)
```

The calculation seems to be incorrect. Let's re-examine our steps.

1. The total number of three-digit numbers from 111 to 999 is $999 - 111 + 1 = 899$.
2. According to the problem, the sum of any two yellow numbers should be a blue number. This means that the sum of any two yellow numbers should be less than or equal to the maximum blue number, which is 999.
3. To maximize the number of yellow numbers, we should choose the smallest possible blue numbers for the sum of two yellow numbers. The smallest blue number is 111.
4. The maximum possible sum of two yellow numbers is $2 * 999 = 1998$.
5. Therefore, we have the inequality $2 * 111 \leq 1998 - y$, which simplifies to $222 \leq 1998 - y$.
6. Solving this inequality for $y$ gives $y \leq 1998 - 222 = 1776$.
7. However, we made a mistake in step 5. The inequality should be $2 * 111 \leq 999 - y$, which simplifies to $222 \leq 999 - y$.
8. Solving this inequality for $y$ gives $y \leq 999 - 222 = 777$.
9. Again, we need to find the maximum integer value of $y$ that satisfies this inequality. So, we have $y = \lfloor 777 \rfloor = 777$.
10. Therefore, the maximum possible number of yellow numbers is 777.

Now, let's write a Python script to verify our solution:

```python

    smallest_blue = 111

    # The maximum blue number is 999

    # The maximum possible sum of two yellow numbers is 2 * max_blue
    max_sum_yellow = 2 * max_blue

    # The maximum possible number of yellow numbers is the maximum integer y that satisfies the inequality 2 * smallest_blue <= max_sum_yellow - y
    y = floor(max_sum_yellow - 2 * smallest_blue)

    return y

result = max_yellow_numbers()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 1776

INTERMEDIATE OUT :

The calculation still seems incorrect. Let's re-examine our steps again.

1. The total number of three-digit numbers from 111 to 999 is $999 - 111 + 1 = 899$.
2. According to the problem, the sum of any two yellow numbers should be a blue number. This means that the sum of any two yellow numbers should be less than or equal to the maximum blue number, which is 999.
3. To maximize the number of yellow numbers, we should choose the smallest possible blue numbers for the sum of two yellow numbers. The smallest blue number is 111.

6. Solving this inequality for $y$ gives $y \leq 999 - 222 = 777$.
7. Again, we need to find the maximum integer value of $y$ that satisfies this inequality. So, we have $y = \lfloor 777 \rfloor = 777$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. Let's denote the number of yellow numbers as $y$ and the number of blue numbers as $b$. According to the problem, every sum of two yellow numbers should be a blue number. This implies that the total sum of all the yellow numbers, which is $y * \frac{y - 1}{2}$ (this is the formula for the sum of the first $y$ numbers), plus the total sum of all the blue numbers, which is $b$, should be equal to the sum of all the three-digit numbers from $111$ to $999$.

2. The sum of all the three-digit numbers from $111$ to $999$ is equal to $111*(999-111)*\frac{999+111}{2} = 291600$.

3. Also, because every sum of two yellow numbers is a blue number, the total sum of all the blue numbers is equal to the total sum of all the possible sums of two yellow numbers. The number of all possible sums of two yellow numbers is $\frac{y * (y - 1)}{2}$, and the maximum value of each of these sums is $999 * (999 - 1) / 2 = 498500$.

4. Therefore, we have the equation $y * \frac{y - 1}{2} + b = 291600$, and $b = \frac{y * (y - 1)}{2} \leq 498500$.

5. To find the maximum number of yellow numbers, we can try to find the maximum value of $y$ that satisfies the equation $y * \frac{y - 1}{2} + y * \frac{y - 1}{2} = 291600$. This simplifies to $y^2 - y - 583200 = 0$.

6. Solving this quadratic equation, we get $y = \frac{1 + \sqrt{1 + 4 * 583200}}{2} \approx 738.5$. Since the number of yellow numbers must be an integer, we take the integer part of this value, which is $738$.

So the maximum number of yellow numbers is $738$. The answer is: $\boxed{738}$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. Since each of the three-digit numbers from 111 to 999 is colored blue or yellow such that the sum of any two yellow numbers equals a blue number, we can infer that the sum of any two yellow numbers must be a number between 222 and 998 inclusive.

2. This means that the maximum possible number of yellow numbers is achieved when we choose the middle number of each consecutive block of numbers (with the same number of digits) in this range as yellow numbers. 

3. Specifically, we choose the numbers 333, 444, ..., 888 as yellow numbers. This gives us a total of (888 - 333) / 111 + 1 = 5 yellow numbers.

So, the maximum possible number of yellow numbers there can be is 5. 

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{5}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Step 1: The maximum possible number of yellow numbers is half the total number of three-digit numbers from 111 to 999.

Step 2: The total number of three-digit numbers from 111 to 999 is 999 - 111 + 1 = 899.

Step 3: So, the maximum number of yellow numbers is 899 / 2 = 449.5. But the number of objects can't be fractional, so we must have made a mistake in our reasoning.

Step 4: The mistake was assuming that the sum of any two yellow numbers would always result in a blue number. This is not true. For example, if we have the yellow numbers 111 and 222, their sum is 333, which is also yellow. So, we need to find a different approach.

Step 5: Let's consider the property of triangular numbers. A triangular number is a number that can be arranged in the shape of an equilateral triangle. The nth triangular number is given by the formula T_n = n * (n + 1) / 2.

Step 6: The sum of any two triangular numbers is also a triangular number. This means that if we color the triangular numbers yellow and the rest blue, the condition in the problem will be satisfied.

Step 7: The largest triangular number less than 999 is T_40 = 40 * (40 + 1) / 2 = 820. So, the number of yellow numbers is 40.

Step 8: Let's verify that the condition in the problem is satisfied. Take any two yellow numbers, say T_n and T_m (where n and m are integers less than or equal to 40). Their sum is T_n + T_m = (n * (n + 1) / 2) + (m * (m + 1) / 2) = (n * (n + 1) + m * (m + 1)) / 2. This is the formula for a triangular number, specifically T_(n+m). So, the sum of any two yellow numbers is indeed a blue number.

So the maximum possible number of yellow numbers is 40. We can confirm this by running the python script below.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def max_yellow_numbers():
    # Calculate the largest triangular number less than 999
    n = 1
    while n * (n + 1) / 2 < 999:
        n += 1
    n -= 1

    # The number of yellow numbers is n
    return n

result = max_yellow_numbers()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 44

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
44
```
We made an error in our calculations. The largest triangular number less than 999 is T_44 = 990, not T_40 = 820. So the number of yellow numbers is 44.

Let's correct the python script:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def max_yellow_numbers():
    # Calculate the largest triangular number less than 999
    n = 1
    while n * (n + 1) / 2 < 999:

    n -= 1

    # The number of yellow numbers is n
    return n

result = max_yellow_numbers()

The maximum possible number of yellow numbers is 44. The answer is: $44$.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, we can notice that if we choose a number $n$ to be yellow, then $n + 1$ must be blue because the sum of two yellow numbers can only result in a blue number. 

2. Therefore, we can choose all the odd numbers from 111 to 999 to be yellow, and the even numbers will be blue. 

3. The odd numbers from 111 to 999 form an arithmetic sequence with the first term $a_1 = 111$, the last term $a_n = 999$, and the common difference $d = 2$.

4. We can find the number of terms in this sequence using the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence: $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$. We substitute the given values and solve for $n$:

$$999 = 111 + (n-1)2.$$

5. Simplify the equation:

$$888 = (n-1)2,$$

$$444 = n - 1,$$

$$445 = n.$$

6. Therefore, there are 445 odd numbers from 111 to 999, which means there are 445 yellow numbers.

Now, let's write the Python code to calculate this:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def max_yellow_numbers():
    # calculate the number of odd numbers from 111 to 999

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



This is a very interesting problem, but it seems that the constraints of the problem do not allow us to find a definitive solution. However, we can still try to find an upper bound for the number of yellow numbers.

Suppose we have $n$ yellow numbers, and we try to create a blue number by adding any two of them. Since there are $\binom{n}{2}$ ways to choose two numbers from $n$ numbers, we will have $\binom{n}{2}$ blue numbers. On the other hand, every blue number is the sum of two yellow numbers, so there are as many blue numbers as there are blue numbers. Therefore, we have:

$$\binom{n}{2} \leq \binom{9}{2} = 36.$$

The inequality $\binom{n}{2} \leq 36$ gives us $n(n-1) \leq 72$, and solving this quadratic inequality, we get $n \leq 9$.

However, we can easily find a set of 9 yellow numbers that satisfy the condition: take the numbers $111, 222, 333, ..., 999$. For any two of these numbers, their sum is a number with all digits the same, which is a blue number. Therefore, the maximum number of yellow numbers is 9.

Now, let's write the python code to confirm this result:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import binomial

def max_yellow_numbers():
    # Calculate the maximum number of yellow numbers
    n = 1
    while binomial(n, 2) <= binomial(9, 2):

    return n - 1

result = max_yellow_numbers()

The maximum possible number of yellow numbers is 9.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The sum of any two yellow numbers should be a blue number. This means that the set of all yellow numbers form an abelian group under addition modulo 1000.

2. By the structure theorem of finite abelian groups, the group of integers modulo 1000 is isomorphic to the direct product of cyclic groups of prime power order. The prime factorization of 1000 is $2^3 * 5^3$, so the group is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_8 \times \mathbb{Z}_{125}$.

3. The maximum number of elements in a subgroup of a direct product of groups is the product of the maximum number of elements in a subgroup of each group. The maximum number of elements in a subgroup of $\mathbb{Z}_8$ is 8, and the maximum number of elements in a subgroup of $\mathbb{Z}_{125}$ is 125. So the maximum number of yellow numbers is $8 * 125 = 1000$.

4. However, we are only considering three-digit numbers, so we are only interested in the subgroup of $\mathbb{Z}_{1000}$ that consists of numbers in the range 111 to 999. The number of such numbers is $999 - 111 + 1 = 889$.

5. To find the maximum number of yellow numbers in the range 111 to 999, we need to find the maximum number of elements in a subgroup of $\mathbb{Z}_{889}$. The prime factorization of 889 is $19 * 47$. The maximum number of elements in a subgroup of $\mathbb{Z}_{889}$ is the product of the maximum number of elements in a subgroup of $\mathbb{Z}_{19}$ and $\mathbb{Z}_{47}$, which is $19 * 47 = 889$.

6. However, this is not possible because the sum of any two yellow numbers should be a blue number, and if we have all 889 numbers as yellow, then the sum of any two yellow numbers will be a yellow number as well, which contradicts the given condition.

7. The correct approach is to find the number of elements in the cyclic subgroup generated by a generator of $\mathbb{Z}_{889}$ that has the largest order. The generator with the largest order in $\mathbb{Z}_{889}$ is the primitive root modulo 889. By trying out the primitive roots, we find that the primitive root with the largest order is 11, and its order is 88, which is the maximum number of elements in a subgroup of $\mathbb{Z}_{889}$.

8. Therefore, the maximum number of yellow numbers in the range 111 to 999 is 88.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"Each of the three-digits numbers $111$ to $999$ is coloured blue or yellow in such a way that the sum of any two (not necessarily different) yellow numbers is equal to a blue number. What is the maximum possible number of yellow numbers there can be?"

 This problem is related to the concept of Sidon sets in number theory. A Sidon set is a set of integers in which the sum of any two (not necessarily different) members is always different. The maximum possible number of members in a Sidon set of integers from 1 to $n$ is approximately $\frac{n}{\sqrt{2}}$.
In this case, we want to find the maximum possible number of yellow numbers in the range from 111 to 999. Since the numbers are three-digit numbers, we can assume $n = 999 - 111 + 1 = 899$.

Now we can calculate the maximum possible number of yellow numbers using the formula $\frac{n}{\sqrt{2}} \approx \frac{899}{\sqrt{2}} \approx 636.14$. Since the number of yellow numbers must be an integer, we take the integer part of the result, which is 636.

So the maximum possible number of yellow numbers is 636. The answer is: $636$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Let's denote $b$ as the number of blue numbers and $y$ as the number of yellow numbers. The sum of all the three-digit numbers from $111$ to $999$ is $\frac{(999+111) \times 9}{2} = 4995$. This sum must be equal to the sum of all blue numbers plus all yellow numbers.

Since the sum of any two yellow numbers is a blue number, the sum of all yellow numbers is the sum of all possible pairs of yellow numbers, which is $\frac{y \times (y-1)}{2}$.

Thus, we have the equation: $\frac{y \times (y-1)}{2} + b \times y = 4995$.

Also, the maximum number of yellow numbers occurs when $b$ is minimized, i.e., when all numbers are yellow. In this case, $b = 0$, and the sum of all yellow numbers is 4995, which is the sum of all three-digit numbers.

However, this would mean that any pair of yellow numbers would also sum to a blue number, which is a contradiction because the sum of two yellow numbers could not be a blue number in general.

So, we must have some blue numbers. The minimum number of blue numbers is when we choose one blue number for each possible pair of yellow numbers. There are $\frac{y \times (y-1)}{2}$ pairs of yellow numbers, so the minimum number of blue numbers is also $\frac{y \times (y-1)}{2}$.

Substituting $b = \frac{y \times (y-1)}{2}$ into the equation $\frac{y \times (y-1)}{2} + b \times y = 4995$, we get:

$\frac{y \times (y-1)}{2} + \frac{y \times (y-1)}{2} \times y = 4995$.

Simplifying, we get: $y^2 - y + y^2 - y = 9990$.

Combining like terms, we get: $2y^2 - 2y = 9990$.

Dividing by 2, we get: $y^2 - y = 4995$.

Rearranging, we get: $y^2 - y - 4995 = 0$.

Now we can use the quadratic formula to solve for $y$: $y = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 4 \times 4995}}{2} = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{19981}}{2}$.

Since $y$ must be a positive integer, we discard the negative solution and take the positive root: $y = \frac{1 + \sqrt{19981}}{2} \approx 70.53$.

But $y$ must be an integer, so we must have made a mistake. Let's go back and check our work.

We found that the number of blue numbers is equal to the number of pairs of yellow numbers, i.e., $b = \frac{y \times (y-1)}{2}$.

Substituting this into the equation $\frac{y \times (y-1)}{2} + b \times y = 4995$, we get:

$\frac{y \times (y-1)}{2} + \frac{y \times (y-1)}{2} \times y = 4995$.

Simplifying, we get: $y^2 - y + y^2 - y = 9990$.

Combining like terms, we get: $2y^2 - 2y = 9990$.

Dividing by 2, we get: $y^2 - y = 4995$.

Rearranging, we get: $y^2 - y - 4995 = 0$.

Now we can use the quadratic formula to solve for $y$: $y = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 4 \times 4995}}{2} = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{19981}}{2}$.

Since $y$ must be a positive integer, we discard the negative solution and take the positive root: $y = \frac{1 + \sqrt{19981}}{2} \approx 70.53$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The problem is asking for the maximum possible number of yellow numbers in a set of three-digit numbers from 111 to 999 such that the sum of any two (not necessarily different) yellow numbers is a blue number.

This problem can be solved using the Pigeonhole Principle, which states that if n items are put into m containers with n > m, then at least one container must contain more than one item.

Let's consider the set of all possible sums of two yellow numbers. The minimum possible sum is 222 (111 + 111) and the maximum is 1998 (999 + 999). So, there are (1998 - 222 + 1) = 1777 possible sums.

Now, let's consider the set of all three-digit numbers from 111 to 999. There are (999 - 111 + 1) = 899 such numbers.

According to the Pigeonhole Principle, if we try to distribute these 899 numbers into 1777 "pigeonholes" (the possible sums), at least one of the "pigeonholes" must contain more than one number. This means that there must be at least one blue number (a sum of two yellow numbers) that can be obtained in more than one way by adding two yellow numbers.

However, we want to maximize the number of yellow numbers, so we should aim to distribute the yellow numbers such that each blue number can be obtained by adding two yellow numbers in exactly one way. This can be achieved by choosing the set of yellow numbers to be the set of all numbers from 111 to 999 that are divisible by 3. There are (999 - 111) / 3 + 1 = 299 such numbers.

Therefore, the maximum possible number of yellow numbers is 299.

The answer is: $299$
