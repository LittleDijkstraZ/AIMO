0_**Problem:** 

"Find the number of ordered pairs $(x,y)$ of real numbers that satisfy $ (x + y)^2 = (x + 1)(y - 1)$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:
Let $a = x + 1$ and $b = y - 1.$  Then the equation becomes
\[(a + b)^2 = ab.\]This simplifies to $a^2 + ab + b^2 = 0.$  Completing the square in $a,$ we get
\[\left( a + \frac{b}{2} \right)^2 + \frac{3b^2}{4} = 0,\]which forces $a = b = 0.$  Then $(x,y) = (-1,1),$ so there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Problem:** 

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


The expression equals zero if either the first set of absolute value expressions equals zero, or the second set of absolute value expressions equals zero. This means either $|x + y| - 10 = 0$, $|x - y| - 10 = 0$, $|x| - 8 = 0$, or $|y| - 8 = 0$.

Solving these equations gives us:
1. $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ implies $|x + y| = 10$, which breaks down to $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
2. $|x - y| - 10 = 0$ implies $|x - y| = 10$, which breaks down to $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
3. $|x| - 8 = 0$ implies $|x| = 8$, which breaks down to $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
4. $|y| - 8 = 0$ implies $|y| = 8$, which breaks down to $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

These equations describe a square with side length 20. The vertices of the square are $(-8, -8), (-8, 8), (8, 8),$ and $(8, -8)$. Therefore, the area of the square is $20^2 = 400$. The answer is $\boxed{400}$.

1_**Problem:** 

"Find the number of ordered pairs $(x,y)$ of real numbers that satisfy $ (x + y)^2 = (x + 1)(y - 1)$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:
Let $a = x + 1$ and $b = y - 1.$  Then the equation becomes
\[(a + b)^2 = ab.\]This simplifies to $a^2 + ab + b^2 = 0.$  Completing the square in $a,$ we get
\[\left( a + \frac{b}{2} \right)^2 + \frac{3b^2}{4} = 0,\]which forces $a = b = 0.$  Then $(x,y) = (-1,1),$ so there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Problem:** 

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:



The expression $A \cdot B = 0$ is equivalent to either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to the union of the following four equations:

1) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$,
2) $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$,
3) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$,
4) $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

These four equations are equivalent to the following four sets of points:

1) $|x + y| = 10$,
2) $|x - y| = 10$,
3) $|x| = 8$,
4) $|y| = 8$.

The first two equations describe lines, while the second two describe squares. The intersection of these four figures is a square, with side length 6 (subtracting twice the distance of 4 from each side of the enclosing square of side length 8).

Therefore, the area of this square is $6^2 = 36$. The answer is: $36$.

"Find the number of ordered pairs $(x,y)$ of real numbers that satisfy $ (x + y)^2 = (x + 1)(y - 1)$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:
Let $a = x + 1$ and $b = y - 1.$  Then the equation becomes
\[(a + b)^2 = ab.\]This simplifies to $a^2 + ab + b^2 = 0.$  Completing the square in $a,$ we get
\[\left( a + \frac{b}{2} \right)^2 + \frac{3b^2}{4} = 0,\]which forces $a = b = 0.$  Then $(x,y) = (-1,1),$ so there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Problem:** 

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:



First, we know that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the given equation is satisfied if and only if either of the following two conditions is met:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first condition to be met, we need both $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points must lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$. These lines intersect at four points: $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, and $(-5,-5)$.

For the second condition to be met, we need both $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that the points must lie on the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$ or $x = -8$ and $y = -8$. These lines intersect at four points: $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

Therefore, the points that satisfy the given equation are the eight points $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, $(-5,-5)$, $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$. These points enclose a square with side length $10$. The area of this square is $10 \times 10 = 100$. So the area of the convex polygon is $100$. The answer is: $100$

3_**Problem:** 

"Find the number of ordered pairs $(x,y)$ of real numbers that satisfy $ (x + y)^2 = (x + 1)(y - 1)$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:
Let $a = x + 1$ and $b = y - 1.$  Then the equation becomes
\[(a + b)^2 = ab.\]This simplifies to $a^2 + ab + b^2 = 0.$  Completing the square in $a,$ we get
\[\left( a + \frac{b}{2} \right)^2 + \frac{3b^2}{4} = 0,\]which forces $a = b = 0.$  Then $(x,y) = (-1,1),$ so there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Problem:** 

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So the equation is satisfied if at least one of the following two conditions holds:

1. $(|x + y| - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(|x| - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(|x - y| - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(|y| - 8)^2 = 0$.

The first condition means $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x| = 8$, which implies that the points must lie on the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x = 8$, and $x = -8$. The second condition means $|x - y| = 10$ and $|y| = 8$, which implies that the points must lie on the lines $x - y = 10$, $x - y = -10$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(8, 2)$, $(8, -18)$, $(-2, -18)$, and $(-2, 2)$. The length of the rectangle is $20$ and the width is $16$, so the area of the rectangle is $20 \times 16 = 320$. So the area of the convex polygon is 320. The answer is: $320$.

"Find the number of ordered pairs $(x,y)$ of real numbers that satisfy $ (x + y)^2 = (x + 1)(y - 1)$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:
Let $a = x + 1$ and $b = y - 1.$  Then the equation becomes
\[(a + b)^2 = ab.\]This simplifies to $a^2 + ab + b^2 = 0.$  Completing the square in $a,$ we get
\[\left( a + \frac{b}{2} \right)^2 + \frac{3b^2}{4} = 0,\]which forces $a = b = 0.$  Then $(x,y) = (-1,1),$ so there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Problem:** 

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


The given equation is satisfied if either of the following two conditions are met:
1) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
2) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
For the first condition, the points $(x,y)$ lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$, as well as the lines $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length 10.
For the second condition, the points $(x,y)$ lie on the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$, as well as the lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length 16.
The union of these two squares forms the convex polygon in question.
The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side, so the area of the smaller square is $10^2 = 100$, and the area of the larger square is $16^2 = 256$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares, which is $100 + 256 = 356$. The answer is $\boxed{356}$.

"Find the number of ordered pairs $(x,y)$ of real numbers that satisfy $ (x + y)^2 = (x + 1)(y - 1)$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:
Let $a = x + 1$ and $b = y - 1.$  Then the equation becomes
\[(a + b)^2 = ab.\]This simplifies to $a^2 + ab + b^2 = 0.$  Completing the square in $a,$ we get
\[\left( a + \frac{b}{2} \right)^2 + \frac{3b^2}{4} = 0,\]which forces $a = b = 0.$  Then $(x,y) = (-1,1),$ so there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Problem:** 

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


The only way the product of two numbers can be zero is if at least one of them is zero. Thus, one of the following two equations must be true:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$$
or
$$((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$
If the first equation is true, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the distance between $(x, y)$ and $(-y, x)$ is 10, and the distance between $(x, y)$ and $(y, -x)$ is 10. This defines a square with side length 10, so the area is $10^2 = 100$.
If the second equation is true, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x$ is between $-8$ and $8$, and $y$ is between $-8$ and $8$. This defines a square with side length 16, so the area is $16^2 = 256$.
The intersection of these two regions is the square with side length 10, so the area of the convex polygon is the area of this square, which is 100.
The answer is: $100$

6_**Problem:** 

"Find the number of ordered pairs $(x,y)$ of real numbers that satisfy $ (x + y)^2 = (x + 1)(y - 1)$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:
Let $a = x + 1$ and $b = y - 1.$  Then the equation becomes
\[(a + b)^2 = ab.\]This simplifies to $a^2 + ab + b^2 = 0.$  Completing the square in $a,$ we get
\[\left( a + \frac{b}{2} \right)^2 + \frac{3b^2}{4} = 0,\]which forces $a = b = 0.$  Then $(x,y) = (-1,1),$ so there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Problem:** 

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:



The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So the given equation is equal to zero if and only if either 

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, or 
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, or
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For each of these equations to be zero, we have:

1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$,
2. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$,
3. $\vert x \vert = 8$,
4. $\vert y \vert = 8$.

These equations represent the equations of lines in the plane. The solutions to these equations are the points that satisfy at least one of these conditions.

The lines $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ form a cross shape centered at the origin. The lines $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ form a square with side length 16 centered at the origin. 

The intersection of these shapes is a square with side length 16, which is the convex polygon we are looking for. 

The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So the area of the convex polygon is 256.

The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied only when both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This happens only when $|x + y| = 10$, $|x - y| = 10$, $|x| = 8$, and $|y| = 8$.
The first two equations simplify to $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. The last two equations simplify to $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
These equations define the vertices of a rectangle with side lengths $20$ and $16$.
The area of this rectangle is $20 \times 16 = 320$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{320}$. The answer is $\boxed{320}$.

"Find the number of ordered pairs $(x,y)$ of real numbers that satisfy $ (x + y)^2 = (x + 1)(y - 1)$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:
Let $a = x + 1$ and $b = y - 1.$  Then the equation becomes
\[(a + b)^2 = ab.\]This simplifies to $a^2 + ab + b^2 = 0.$  Completing the square in $a,$ we get
\[\left( a + \frac{b}{2} \right)^2 + \frac{3b^2}{4} = 0,\]which forces $a = b = 0.$  Then $(x,y) = (-1,1),$ so there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Problem:** 

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:



The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is equal to zero if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. 

For the first equation to be true, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the square as $(0,10)$, $(0,-10)$, $(10,0)$, and $(-10,0)$.

For the second equation to be true, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the square as $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

The two squares intersect at the origin $(0,0)$, so their union forms a larger square with side length $10+8=18$. The area of this square is $(18)^2 = 324$. 

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $324$.
The answer is: $324$

**Problem:** 

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:



The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.

The equation $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.

The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.

The equation $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

So the points $(x, y)$ satisfying the given equation are those that lie on the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, $x - y = -10$, $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. 

These lines enclose a convex polygon, which is a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. So the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is $\boxed{100}$.

"Find the number of ordered pairs $(x,y)$ of real numbers that satisfy $ (x + y)^2 = (x + 1)(y - 1)$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:
Let $a = x + 1$ and $b = y - 1.$  Then the equation becomes
\[(a + b)^2 = ab.\]This simplifies to $a^2 + ab + b^2 = 0.$  Completing the square in $a,$ we get
\[\left( a + \frac{b}{2} \right)^2 + \frac{3b^2}{4} = 0,\]which forces $a = b = 0.$  Then $(x,y) = (-1,1),$ so there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Problem:** 

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(0,10), (0,-10), (10,0), (-10,0)$.
If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Adding these points to the list of vertices gives us $(8,8), (8,-8), (-8,8), (-8,-8)$.
The convex polygon formed by these points is a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $\boxed{100}$
