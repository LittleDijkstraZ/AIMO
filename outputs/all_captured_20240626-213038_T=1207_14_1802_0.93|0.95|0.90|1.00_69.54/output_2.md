0_**Problem:** 

"For how many values of $c$ in the interval $[0, 1000]$ does the equation \[7 \lfloor x \rfloor + 2 \lceil x \rceil = c\]have a solution for $x$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:
We try to solve the equation for a general value of $c.$ If $x$ is an integer, then $\lfloor x\rfloor = \lceil x \rceil = x,$ and so we get the equation \[ 7x + 2x = c,\]so $x = \frac{c}{9}.$ Since $x$ is an integer in this case, this solution is valid if and only if $c$ is a multiple of $9.$

If $x$ is not an integer, then $\lceil x \rceil = \lfloor x\rfloor + 1,$ so we get the equation
\[7 \lfloor x\rfloor + 2 (\lfloor x \rfloor + 1) = c,\]so $\lfloor x\rfloor = \frac{c-2}{9}.$ Since $\lfloor x\rfloor$ must be an integer, this produces valid solutions for $x$ if and only if $c-2$ is a multiple of $9.$

Putting everything together, we see that in the interval $[0, 1000],$ there are $112$ multiples of $9$ and $111$ integers which are $2$ more than a multiple of $9,$ for a total of $112 + 111 = \boxed{223}$ possible values of $c.$ The answer is $\boxed{223}$

**Problem:** 

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


The equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $0$ and $2$, i.e., $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. This gives us $0 < m < 200$. Thus, the number of possible values for $m$ is equal to the number of positive integers from $1$ to $199$. This is simply $199$. The answer is $\boxed{199}$.

**Problem:** 

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


We see that the number of solutions equals $4$ if and only if the graph of $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ intersects the line $y = \frac{m}{100}$ exactly $4$ times. This line moves up as $m$ increases, so we want to know for how many values of $m$ does the line $y = \frac{m}{100}$ intersect the graph exactly $4$ times.
The graph of $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a "french curve" (a shape made up of two "V"s joined together), with the minimum value of $0$ at $x = 1 \pm 2$ (or $x = -1$ and $x = 3$). The maximum value is $2$, and the graph is symmetric around $x = 1$.
We want the line $y = \frac{m}{100}$ to intersect the graph $4$ times. This means the maximum value of $y = \frac{m}{100}$ should be less than $2$, and the minimum value should be greater than $0$. This means $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, or $0 < m < 200$. The number of integers in this range is $199$.
The answer is $\boxed{199}$.

"For how many values of $c$ in the interval $[0, 1000]$ does the equation \[7 \lfloor x \rfloor + 2 \lceil x \rceil = c\]have a solution for $x$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:
We try to solve the equation for a general value of $c.$ If $x$ is an integer, then $\lfloor x\rfloor = \lceil x \rceil = x,$ and so we get the equation \[ 7x + 2x = c,\]so $x = \frac{c}{9}.$ Since $x$ is an integer in this case, this solution is valid if and only if $c$ is a multiple of $9.$

If $x$ is not an integer, then $\lceil x \rceil = \lfloor x\rfloor + 1,$ so we get the equation
\[7 \lfloor x\rfloor + 2 (\lfloor x \rfloor + 1) = c,\]so $\lfloor x\rfloor = \frac{c-2}{9}.$ Since $\lfloor x\rfloor$ must be an integer, this produces valid solutions for $x$ if and only if $c-2$ is a multiple of $9.$

Putting everything together, we see that in the interval $[0, 1000],$ there are $112$ multiples of $9$ and $111$ integers which are $2$ more than a multiple of $9,$ for a total of $112 + 111 = \boxed{223}$ possible values of $c.$ The answer is $\boxed{223}$

**Problem:** 

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2 - \frac{k}{100}$ for some positive integer $k$. 

This gives us $m = 200 - k$. 

Since $m$ and $k$ are positive integers, $k$ must be less than or equal to $200$. 

Therefore, the possible values of $k$ are the positive integers from $1$ to $200$. 

However, we must remember that the value inside the absolute value of the left side of the equation, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, must be non-negative. 

This means $\vert x-1 \vert \geq 2$, or $x-1 \geq 2$ or $x-1 \leq -2$, or $x \geq 3$ or $x \leq -1$. 

So the solutions of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ are the $x$ that satisfy either of the following:

1. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, if $x \geq 3$ or $x \leq -1$.
2. $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = \frac{m}{100}$, if $-1 < x < 3$.

But for $x$ in the interval $(-1,3)$, $-\vert x-1 \vert +2$ is always positive, while $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is always non-negative but can be zero. So the only solutions for $x$ in the interval $(-1,3)$ are the ones where $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = -\vert x-1 \vert +2 = \frac{m}{100}$. 

This simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. But this has no solutions for $x$ in the interval $(-1,3)$, because $\vert x-1 \vert$ would then be negative, while $2 - \frac{m}{100}$ is positive.

So we only need to consider the solutions of the equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, for $x \geq 3$ or $x \leq -1$. This simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.

This equation has solutions if and only if $2 + \frac{m}{100} \geq 0$, or $m \leq 200$.

Therefore, the possible values of $k$ (and hence of $m$) are the positive integers from $1$ to $200$. So there are $200$ possible values of $m$. The answer is $\boxed{200}$.

"For how many values of $c$ in the interval $[0, 1000]$ does the equation \[7 \lfloor x \rfloor + 2 \lceil x \rceil = c\]have a solution for $x$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:
We try to solve the equation for a general value of $c.$ If $x$ is an integer, then $\lfloor x\rfloor = \lceil x \rceil = x,$ and so we get the equation \[ 7x + 2x = c,\]so $x = \frac{c}{9}.$ Since $x$ is an integer in this case, this solution is valid if and only if $c$ is a multiple of $9.$

If $x$ is not an integer, then $\lceil x \rceil = \lfloor x\rfloor + 1,$ so we get the equation
\[7 \lfloor x\rfloor + 2 (\lfloor x \rfloor + 1) = c,\]so $\lfloor x\rfloor = \frac{c-2}{9}.$ Since $\lfloor x\rfloor$ must be an integer, this produces valid solutions for $x$ if and only if $c-2$ is a multiple of $9.$

Putting everything together, we see that in the interval $[0, 1000],$ there are $112$ multiples of $9$ and $111$ integers which are $2$ more than a multiple of $9,$ for a total of $112 + 111 = \boxed{223}$ possible values of $c.$ The answer is $\boxed{223}$

**Problem:** 

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $0$ and $3$.
This means $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 3$, or equivalently, $0 < m < 300$.
The number of positive integers $m$ in this range is $299$.
Therefore, there are $299$ positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions. The answer is $\boxed{299}$.

**Problem:** 

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2 - \frac{a}{100}$ for some positive integer $a$. This is because the expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ can take on the value of $2 - \frac{a}{100}$ four times, once when $x$ is less than $1$, once when $x$ is between $1$ and $3$, once when $x$ is greater than $3$, and once when $x$ is between $3$ and $5$. So we have the equation $m = 200 - a$, and $a$ must be a positive integer less than or equal to $200$.
The number of possible values of $a$ is $200$. So the number of possible values of $m$ is also $200$. The answer is $\boxed{200}$.

Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:
We try to solve the equation for a general value of $c.$ If $x$ is an integer, then $\lfloor x\rfloor = \lceil x \rceil = x,$ and so we get the equation \[ 7x + 2x = c,\]so $x = \frac{c}{9}.$ Since $x$ is an integer in this case, this solution is valid if and only if $c$ is a multiple of $9.$

If $x$ is not an integer, then $\lceil x \rceil = \lfloor x\rfloor + 1,$ so we get the equation

Putting everything together, we see that in the interval $[0, 1000],$ there are $112$ multiples of $9$ and $111$ integers which are $2$ more than a multiple of $9,$ for a total of $112 + 111 = \boxed{223}$ possible values of $c.$ The answer is $\boxed{223}$

**Problem:** 

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $2$. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ oscillates between $1$ and $2$ as $x$ varies over the real numbers. Therefore, the equation will have $4$ distinct solutions when the right hand side $\frac{m}{100}$ falls strictly between $1$ and $2$. 

Multiplying through by $100$ gives us $1 < m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ in this range are $2$ to $199$. However, we must exclude the value $m=100$, because in this case the right hand side equals $1$ or $2$ and the equation does not have $4$ distinct solutions. 

So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $199 - 100 + 1 = 99 + 1 = 100$. 

The value of $m$ that corresponds to $\frac{m}{100} = 1$ is $100$.
The value of $m$ that corresponds to $\frac{m}{100} = 2$ is $200$.

The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$, not the number of values of $\frac{m}{100}$. Therefore, the correct answer is that there are $100$ positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions. The answer is: $100$.

"For how many values of $c$ in the interval $[0, 1000]$ does the equation \[7 \lfloor x \rfloor + 2 \lceil x \rceil = c\]have a solution for $x$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:
We try to solve the equation for a general value of $c.$ If $x$ is an integer, then $\lfloor x\rfloor = \lceil x \rceil = x,$ and so we get the equation \[ 7x + 2x = c,\]so $x = \frac{c}{9}.$ Since $x$ is an integer in this case, this solution is valid if and only if $c$ is a multiple of $9.$

If $x$ is not an integer, then $\lceil x \rceil = \lfloor x\rfloor + 1,$ so we get the equation
\[7 \lfloor x\rfloor + 2 (\lfloor x \rfloor + 1) = c,\]so $\lfloor x\rfloor = \frac{c-2}{9}.$ Since $\lfloor x\rfloor$ must be an integer, this produces valid solutions for $x$ if and only if $c-2$ is a multiple of $9.$

Putting everything together, we see that in the interval $[0, 1000],$ there are $112$ multiples of $9$ and $111$ integers which are $2$ more than a multiple of $9,$ for a total of $112 + 111 = \boxed{223}$ possible values of $c.$ The answer is $\boxed{223}$

**Problem:** 

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2 - \frac{k}{100}$ for some integer $k$ such that $0 \leq k \leq 100$. This is because the expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ oscillates between $0$ and $4$, and equals $2$ exactly $4$ times. 

If we multiply both sides of the equation by $100$, we get $m = 200 - k$. Since $0 \leq k \leq 100$, we have $100 \leq m \leq 200$. 

Also, $m$ must be an integer, so there are exactly $101$ possible values of $m$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is $101$.
The answer is: $\boxed{101}$

"For how many values of $c$ in the interval $[0, 1000]$ does the equation \[7 \lfloor x \rfloor + 2 \lceil x \rceil = c\]have a solution for $x$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:
We try to solve the equation for a general value of $c.$ If $x$ is an integer, then $\lfloor x\rfloor = \lceil x \rceil = x,$ and so we get the equation \[ 7x + 2x = c,\]so $x = \frac{c}{9}.$ Since $x$ is an integer in this case, this solution is valid if and only if $c$ is a multiple of $9.$

If $x$ is not an integer, then $\lceil x \rceil = \lfloor x\rfloor + 1,$ so we get the equation
\[7 \lfloor x\rfloor + 2 (\lfloor x \rfloor + 1) = c,\]so $\lfloor x\rfloor = \frac{c-2}{9}.$ Since $\lfloor x\rfloor$ must be an integer, this produces valid solutions for $x$ if and only if $c-2$ is a multiple of $9.$

Putting everything together, we see that in the interval $[0, 1000],$ there are $112$ multiples of $9$ and $111$ integers which are $2$ more than a multiple of $9,$ for a total of $112 + 111 = \boxed{223}$ possible values of $c.$ The answer is $\boxed{223}$

**Problem:** 

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


The equation $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. This is because $| |x-1| - 2 |$ is a quantity that takes on the value of $2$ four times, once when $|x-1| - 2 = 2$, once when $|x-1| - 2 = -2$, and twice when $||x-1| - 2| = 0$. 

So we have $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, which implies $m = 200$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is $1$. The answer is $\boxed{1}$.

Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:
We try to solve the equation for a general value of $c.$ If $x$ is an integer, then $\lfloor x\rfloor = \lceil x \rceil = x,$ and so we get the equation \[ 7x + 2x = c,\]so $x = \frac{c}{9}.$ Since $x$ is an integer in this case, this solution is valid if and only if $c$ is a multiple of $9.$

If $x$ is not an integer, then $\lceil x \rceil = \lfloor x\rfloor + 1,$ so we get the equation
\[7 \lfloor x\rfloor + 2 (\lfloor x \rfloor + 1) = c,\]so $\lfloor x\rfloor = \frac{c-2}{9}.$ Since $\lfloor x\rfloor$ must be an integer, this produces valid solutions for $x$ if and only if $c-2$ is a multiple of $9.$

Putting everything together, we see that in the interval $[0, 1000],$ there are $112$ multiples of $9$ and $111$ integers which are $2$ more than a multiple of $9,$ for a total of $112 + 111 = \boxed{223}$ possible values of $c.$ The answer is $\boxed{223}$

**Problem:** 

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


For the equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ to have $4$ distinct solutions, the right side must be a positive number. Thus, $\frac{m}{100} > 0$ which implies $m > 0$. So $m$ is a positive integer.

The graph of $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ consists of two "hockey stick" graphs, each with "width" $2\frac{m}{100}$ and shifting up $2$ units from the graph of $|x-1|=\frac{m}{100}$. The graph of $|x-1|=\frac{m}{100}$ consists of two "v-shaped" graphs, each with "width" $\frac{m}{100}$ and shifting right $1$ unit from the graph of $|x|=\frac{m}{100}$. The graph of $|x|=\frac{m}{100}$ consists of two "V" graphs, each with "width" $\frac{m}{100}$, centered at the $x$-axis.

Therefore, the equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions when the "width" of the "hockey stick" graphs is greater than the distance between the two "v-shaped" graphs, which is $2$. Thus, $\frac{m}{100} > 2$, which implies $m > 200$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this condition are $m=201, 202, \ldots$. However, the problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation has $4$ distinct solutions, not a list of the possible values of $m$.

The number of positive integers $m$ such that $m > 200$ and $m \leq 1000$ is $1000 - 200 + 1 = 801$. However, this counts the possibility where the "width" of the "hockey stick" graphs is exactly equal to the distance between the two "v-shaped" graphs. When this happens, the "hockey stick" graphs only have $3$ distinct solutions.

We need to subtract the number of such cases where "width" is exactly equal to the distance between the two "v-shaped" graphs. This happens when $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, which implies $m = 200$. So we need to subtract $1$ from our previous count of $801$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $801 - 1 = 800$.
The answer is: $800$

11_**Problem:** 

"For how many values of $c$ in the interval $[0, 1000]$ does the equation \[7 \lfloor x \rfloor + 2 \lceil x \rceil = c\]have a solution for $x$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:
We try to solve the equation for a general value of $c.$ If $x$ is an integer, then $\lfloor x\rfloor = \lceil x \rceil = x,$ and so we get the equation \[ 7x + 2x = c,\]so $x = \frac{c}{9}.$ Since $x$ is an integer in this case, this solution is valid if and only if $c$ is a multiple of $9.$

If $x$ is not an integer, then $\lceil x \rceil = \lfloor x\rfloor + 1,$ so we get the equation
\[7 \lfloor x\rfloor + 2 (\lfloor x \rfloor + 1) = c,\]so $\lfloor x\rfloor = \frac{c-2}{9}.$ Since $\lfloor x\rfloor$ must be an integer, this produces valid solutions for $x$ if and only if $c-2$ is a multiple of $9.$

Putting everything together, we see that in the interval $[0, 1000],$ there are $112$ multiples of $9$ and $111$ integers which are $2$ more than a multiple of $9,$ for a total of $112 + 111 = \boxed{223}$ possible values of $c.$ The answer is $\boxed{223}$

**Problem:** 

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


The equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$ or $\frac{m}{100} = 1$. This is because the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, can be 2 or 1, and it cannot be greater than 2 or less than 0.

If $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, then $m = 200$.
If $\frac{m}{100} = 1$, then $m = 100$.

Therefore, the only two values of $m$ that make the equation have four distinct solutions are 100 and 200. Hence, there are 2 such values of $m$. The answer is: $2$.

**Problem:** 

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2,$ or $\frac{m}{100} = 1.$ If $\frac{m}{100} = 2,$ then $m = 200.$ If $\frac{m}{100} = 1,$ then $m=100.$ Therefore, the equation has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $m=100$ or $m=200.$ Thus, there are $\boxed{2}$ such values of $m.$ The answer is $\boxed{2}$.

13_**Problem:** 

"For how many values of $c$ in the interval $[0, 1000]$ does the equation \[7 \lfloor x \rfloor + 2 \lceil x \rceil = c\]have a solution for $x$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:
We try to solve the equation for a general value of $c.$ If $x$ is an integer, then $\lfloor x\rfloor = \lceil x \rceil = x,$ and so we get the equation \[ 7x + 2x = c,\]so $x = \frac{c}{9}.$ Since $x$ is an integer in this case, this solution is valid if and only if $c$ is a multiple of $9.$

If $x$ is not an integer, then $\lceil x \rceil = \lfloor x\rfloor + 1,$ so we get the equation
\[7 \lfloor x\rfloor + 2 (\lfloor x \rfloor + 1) = c,\]so $\lfloor x\rfloor = \frac{c-2}{9}.$ Since $\lfloor x\rfloor$ must be an integer, this produces valid solutions for $x$ if and only if $c-2$ is a multiple of $9.$

Putting everything together, we see that in the interval $[0, 1000],$ there are $112$ multiples of $9$ and $111$ integers which are $2$ more than a multiple of $9,$ for a total of $112 + 111 = \boxed{223}$ possible values of $c.$ The answer is $\boxed{223}$

**Problem:** 

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions, which means that the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, must be equal to $\frac{m}{100}$, $-\frac{m}{100}$, $2+\frac{m}{100}$, or $-2-\frac{m}{100}$.

So we have four equations to solve:
1. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$
2. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$
3. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 2+\frac{m}{100}$
4. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -2-\frac{m}{100}$

For each of these equations, we can solve for $x$ in terms of $m$.

For equation 1: $\vert x-1 \vert = 2+\frac{m}{100}$, which gives two solutions: $x = 1 + 2+\frac{m}{100} = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = 1 - (2+\frac{m}{100}) = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

For equation 2: $\vert x-1 \vert = 2-\frac{m}{100}$, which gives two solutions: $x = 1 + 2-\frac{m}{100} = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = 1 - (2-\frac{m}{100}) = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

For equation 3: $\vert x-1 \vert = 4+\frac{m}{100}$, which gives two solutions: $x = 1 + 4+\frac{m}{100} = 5 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = 1 - (4+\frac{m}{100}) = -3 - \frac{m}{100}$.

For equation 4: $\vert x-1 \vert = -2+\frac{m}{100}$, but the absolute value is always non-negative, so this equation has no solutions.

For each value of $m$, we need to check if the four solutions are distinct. We can see that the solutions for equation 1 and equation 2 are not distinct, and the solutions for equation 3 are not distinct either. So we only need to consider the number of distinct solutions for equation 4.

For equation 4 to have distinct solutions, $4+\frac{m}{100}$ and $-3 - \frac{m}{100}$ must be distinct, which means $7+\frac{m}{100} > 0$. So $m > -700$.

Also, $-2+\frac{m}{100}$ must be non-negative, so $\frac{m}{100} > 2$, which means $m > 200$.

Therefore, the possible values of $m$ are the positive integers greater than $200$ and less than or equal to $700$. The number of such positive integers is $700 - 200 + 1 = 501$.

But we cannot have $m > 700$, because in that case, the absolute value in the original equation would be negative, which is not allowed. So we need to exclude the cases when $m > 700$.

For $m > 700$, the solutions for equation 1 and equation 2 become negative, so the number of distinct solutions is not 4.

Therefore, the only possible values of $m$ are the positive integers greater than $200$ and less than or equal to $700$, which is $501$.

So the number of positive integers $m$ that make the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have $4$ distinct solutions is 501.
The answer is: $501$
