0_**Problem:** 

"Let $x,$ $y,$ and $z$ be positive real numbers such that $xyz = 2.$  Find the minimum value of
\[x^4 + 4y^2 + 4z^4.\]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:
By AM-GM,
\begin{align*}
x^4 + 4y^2 + 4z^4 &= x^4 + 2y^2 + 2y^2 + 4z^4 \\
&\ge 4 \sqrt[4]{(x^4)(2y^2)(2y^2)(4z^4)} \\
&= 8xyz \\
&= 16.
\end{align*}Equality occurs when $x^4 = 2y^2 = 4z^2.$  Using the condition $xyz = 2,$ we can solve to get $x = y = \sqrt{2}$ and $z = 1,$ so the minimum value is $\boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

**Problem:** 

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


First, we simplify the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.

We can rewrite $|x-2y| + |y-2x|$ as $|-(2x-y) + (2y-x)| = |-(2x-y) - (2x-y)| = 2|2x-y|$.

So the condition is $2|2x-y| = 40$ which simplifies to $|2x-y| = 20$.

This implies that $2x-y = 20$ or $2x-y = -20$.

Now let's solve the problem. We want to minimize $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite this as $5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x-y)^2 + 2xy] - 8xy = 5(x-y)^2 + 3xy$.

We know that $(x-y)^2 \ge 0$ and $xy \ge 0$, so $5(x-y)^2 + 3xy \ge 0$.

Now let's find the relationship between $x$ and $y$ from the condition.

If $2x-y = 20$, then $y = 2x - 20$. Substituting this into the expression we want to minimize gives $5(x - (2x - 20))^2 + 3x(2x - 20) = 5(x - 2x + 20)^2 + 6x^2 - 60x = 5(-x + 20)^2 + 6x^2 - 60x$.

Taking the derivative with respect to $x$ and setting it to zero gives $-10(-x + 20) + 12x - 60 = 0$, which simplifies to $10x - 200 + 12x - 60 = 0$, and further simplifies to $22x = 260$, so $x = 12$. Substituting this back into $y = 2x - 20$ gives $y = -4$.

Substituting $x = 12$ and $y = -4$ into the expression we want to minimize gives $5(12 - (-4))^2 + 3(12)(-4) = 5(16)^2 - 144 = 1280 - 144 = 1136$.

If $2x-y = -20$, we can do the same process and get the same result.

So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $1136$. The answer is $\boxed{1136}$

1_**Problem:** 

"Let $x,$ $y,$ and $z$ be positive real numbers such that $xyz = 2.$  Find the minimum value of
\[x^4 + 4y^2 + 4z^4.\]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:
By AM-GM,
\begin{align*}
x^4 + 4y^2 + 4z^4 &= x^4 + 2y^2 + 2y^2 + 4z^4 \\
&\ge 4 \sqrt[4]{(x^4)(2y^2)(2y^2)(4z^4)} \\
&= 8xyz \\
&= 16.
\end{align*}Equality occurs when $x^4 = 2y^2 = 4z^2.$  Using the condition $xyz = 2,$ we can solve to get $x = y = \sqrt{2}$ and $z = 1,$ so the minimum value is $\boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

**Problem:** 

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


Notice that $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = (x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2.$ We are given that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40.$ 
By the triangle inequality, $|x-2y| + |y-2x| \ge |(x-2y) - (y-2x)| = |x-2y-y+2x| = |x-3y+2x| = |3x-3y| = 3|x-y|.$
So we have $3|x-y| = 40 \implies |x-y| = \frac{40}{3}.$
Now let's go back to the expression we want to minimize: $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = (x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2 = (x-y)^2 + (x-2y)^2 = \left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{3200}{9}.$
Therefore, the minimum value is $\frac{3200}{9}$. The answer is: $\boxed{\frac{3200}{9}}$

&= 8xyz \\
&= 16.
\end{align*}Equality occurs when $x^4 = 2y^2 = 4z^2.$  Using the condition $xyz = 2,$ we can solve to get $x = y = \sqrt{2}$ and $z = 1,$ so the minimum value is $\boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

**Problem:** 

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


We can rewrite the given equation as $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. 
Using the property $|a| + |b| = |a+b| + |a-b|$, we can rewrite the left-hand side as $|x-2y + y-2x| + |x-2y - (y-2x)| = |0| + |-x+3y| = |-x+3y| = 40$.
Now, let's find a relationship between $x$ and $y$ from this equation. We have $-x+3y = \pm 40$.
Case 1: If $-x+3y = 40$, we can rewrite it as $x-3y = -40$.
Case 2: If $-x+3y = -40$, we can rewrite it as $x-3y = 40$.
In both cases, we have $x-3y = \pm 40$.
Now, let's substitute this into the expression we want to minimize: $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.
We can rewrite it as $5(x^2 + y^2 - \frac{8}{5}xy) = 5[(x-3y)^2 + \frac{4}{5}xy]$.
Using the fact that $(x-3y)^2 \ge 0$, we know that $(x-3y)^2 + \frac{4}{5}xy \ge \frac{4}{5}xy$.
Now, let's substitute $x-3y = \pm 40$ into this inequality: $\frac{4}{5}xy \ge \frac{4}{5} \cdot 40^2 = 1280$.
Therefore, $5[(x-3y)^2 + \frac{4}{5}xy] \ge 5 \cdot 1280 = 6400$.
Equality occurs when $x = 20$ and $y = \frac{20}{3}$, so the minimum value is $\boxed{6400}$. The answer is $\boxed{6400}$

\[x^4 + 4y^2 + 4z^4.\]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**

\begin{align*}

**Problem:** 

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


We first rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $(x-2y)^2+(y-2x)^2$.

Then we have $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.

By the triangle inequality, we have $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |(x-2y) - (y-2x)| = |x-2y - y + 2x| = |3x - 3y| = 3|x - y| = 40$.

So $|x - y| = \frac{40}{3}$.

Then we have $(x-2y)^2+(y-2x)^2 = (x-y)^2 + 4(x-y)^2 = 5(x-y)^2 = 5 \left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{8000}{9}$.

So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\frac{8000}{9}$.
The answer is $\boxed{\frac{8000}{9}}$.

**Problem:** 

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


First, we need to simplify the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite it as $5(x^2+y^2)-8xy$. 
Now, let's use the formula $(a-b)^2=a^2-2ab+b^2$ to rewrite $x^2+y^2$ as $\left(\frac{x-y}{2}\right)^2 + 2xy$.
So, $5(x^2+y^2)-8xy = 5\left(\left(\frac{x-y}{2}\right)^2 + 2xy\right)-8xy = 5\left(\frac{x-y}{2}\right)^2 + 10xy - 8xy = 5\left(\frac{x-y}{2}\right)^2 + 2xy$.
Now, let's substitute $u = x - 2y$ and $v = y - 2x$. Then, $x = \frac{u+2v}{3}$ and $y = \frac{2u-v}{3}$. We can substitute these into $2xy$ to get $2xy = 2\left(\frac{u+2v}{3}\right)\left(\frac{2u-v}{3}\right) = \frac{4u^2 - uv + 4v^2}{9}$.
So, $5\left(\frac{x-y}{2}\right)^2 + 2xy = 5\left(\frac{u}{2}\right)^2 + \frac{4u^2 - uv + 4v^2}{9} = \frac{25u^2 + 4u^2 - uv + 4v^2}{9} = \frac{29u^2 - uv + 4v^2}{9}$.
Now, we are given that $|u| + |v| = 40$. We want to minimize $\frac{29u^2 - uv + 4v^2}{9}$. By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have $(1+4)(u^2+v^2) \ge (u+2v)^2 = (3x)^2 = 9x^2$, so $5(u^2+v^2) \ge 9x^2$. Since $5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy = \frac{29u^2 - uv + 4v^2}{9}$, we want to minimize $29u^2 - uv + 4v^2$. By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have $(29+1)(u^2+v^2) \ge (29u+v)^2 = (u+29v)^2 = (3y)^2 = 9y^2$, so $30(u^2+v^2) \ge 9y^2$. Since $5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy = \frac{29u^2 - uv + 4v^2}{9}$, we want to minimize $29u^2 - uv + 4v^2$. By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have $(29+1)(u^2+v^2) \ge (29u+v)^2 = (u+29v)^2 = (3y)^2 = 9y^2$, so $30(u^2+v^2) \ge 9y^2$.

Since $5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy = \frac{29u^2 - uv + 4v^2}{9}$, we want to minimize $29u^2 - uv + 4v^2$.
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have $(29+1)(u^2+v^2) \ge (29u+v)^2 = (u+29v)^2 = (3y)^2 = 9y^2$, so $30(u^2+v^2) \ge 9y^2$.

Since $5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy = \frac{29u^2 - uv + 4v^2}{9}$, we want to minimize $29u^2 - uv + 4v^2$.
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have $(29+1)(u^2+v^2) \ge (29u+v)^2 = (u+29v)^2 = (3y)^2 = 9y^2$, so $30(u^2+v^2) \ge 9y^2$.

**Problem:** 

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


First, notice that $|x-2y| + |y-2x|$ can be rewritten as $|2x-y| + |y-2x|$ by the property of absolute value $|a|=|-a|$.

Now, apply the triangular inequality, we get $|2x-y| + |y-2x| \geq |(2x-y) - (y-2x)| = |2x-y-y+2x| = |4x-2y| = 2|x-y| \geq 0$.

The equality holds when $(2x-y)(y-2x) \geq 0$, which gives $y^2 - 4xy + 4x^2 \geq 0$, or $(y-2x)^2 \geq 0$. This is always true.

So the equality $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is possible.

Now, let's find the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.

This expression can be rewritten as $(5x^2 - 8xy + 5y^2) = (5x^2 - 10xy + 5y^2) + 2xy = (5x-5y)^2 + 2xy$.

We know that $(5x-5y)^2 \geq 0$, so the minimum value of $(5x-5y)^2 + 2xy$ is achieved when $(5x-5y)^2 = 0$ and $2xy = 0$. This happens when $x = y$.

Now, substitute $x = y$ into the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we get $|x-2x| + |x-2x| = 40$, or $2|x-2x| = 40$, which gives $0 = 40$, a contradiction. So we must have made a mistake in our reasoning.

Let's go back and check our steps. The mistake is in assuming that the equality in the triangular inequality implies $y^2 - 4xy + 4x^2 \geq 0$. The correct implication should be $(2x-y)(y-2x) = 0$, which gives two possibilities: either $2x = y$ or $y = 2x$.

Now we try both possibilities:
- If $2x = y$, then $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |x-4x| + |2x-4x| = 3|3x| = 3*40 = 120$, which is not what we want.
- If $y = 2x$, then $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |x-4x| + |4x-2x| = 3|3x| = 3*40 = 120$, which is also not what we want.

So we must have made another mistake in our reasoning.

Let's try to express the given expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ in a different way.

Notice that $(5x^2 - 8xy + 5y^2) = (5x^2 - 10xy + 5y^2) + 2xy = (5x-5y)^2 + 2xy = (5(x-y))^2 + 2xy$.

Now let $u = x - y$, then $x = u + y$. Substitute this into the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we get $|u| + |u - y| = 40$.

This equation represents a straight line in the $u$-$y$ plane, and the minimum of the expression $(5(x-y))^2 + 2xy = (5u)^2 + 2(u+y)y = 25u^2 + 2uy + 2y^2$ occurs at the point on the line $|u| + |u - y| = 40$ that is closest to the origin.

This point is the intersection of the line and the line segment from the origin to the point $(40, 0)$, which is $(20, 20)$.

So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is achieved when $x - y = 20$ and $x + y = 40$, which gives $x = 30$ and $y = 10$.

Substitute these values into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get $5*30^2 + 5*10^2 - 8*30*10 = 4500 + 500 - 2400 = 2600$.

So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $2600$.
The answer is $\boxed{2600}$.

**Problem:** 

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


First, we rewrite the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$. By the definition of absolute value, we have $|a| = |-a|$, so this equation is equivalent to $|x-2y| + |- (x-2y)| = 40$, which simplifies to $2|x-2y| = 40$. Therefore, $|x-2y| = 20$.
Now, let's denote $a = x - 2y$ and $b = y - 2x$. From the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we have $|a| + |-b| = 40$, which simplifies to $|a| + |b| = 40$. Since $|a| = 20$, we substitute and get $20 + |b| = 40$, so $|b| = 20$. Thus, $|y-2x| = 20$.
Now, let's consider the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite this as $\frac{1}{2}((5x^2-8xy+5y^2)+(5x^2+8xy+5y^2)) = \frac{1}{2}((5x-4y)^2+(3x+4y)^2)$. By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have $(5x-4y)^2+(3x+4y)^2 \geq (5\cdot 3 - 4\cdot 4)^2 = 1^2 = 1$, so $\frac{1}{2}((5x-4y)^2+(3x+4y)^2) \geq \frac{1}{2}$. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\frac{1}{2}$. The answer is: $\frac{1}{2}$

7_**Problem:** 

"Let $x,$ $y,$ and $z$ be positive real numbers such that $xyz = 2.$  Find the minimum value of
\[x^4 + 4y^2 + 4z^4.\]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:
By AM-GM,
\begin{align*}
x^4 + 4y^2 + 4z^4 &= x^4 + 2y^2 + 2y^2 + 4z^4 \\
&\ge 4 \sqrt[4]{(x^4)(2y^2)(2y^2)(4z^4)} \\
&= 8xyz \\
&= 16.
\end{align*}Equality occurs when $x^4 = 2y^2 = 4z^2.$  Using the condition $xyz = 2,$ we can solve to get $x = y = \sqrt{2}$ and $z = 1,$ so the minimum value is $\boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

**Problem:** 

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:



First, observe that the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is equivalent to $|x-2y| = |2x-y|$, which implies that $x-2y = 2x-y$ or $x-2y = -(2x-y)$.

If $x-2y = 2x-y$, then $x=3y$, and substituting into $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we get $|3y-2y| + |y-6y| = 40$, which simplifies to $|y| + |-5y| = 40$, or $6|y|=40$, so $|y|= \frac{20}{3}$.

If $x-2y = -(2x-y)$, then $x-2y = -2x+y$, which simplifies to $3x=3y$, or $x=y$. Substituting into $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we get $|x-2x| + |x-2x| = 40$, or $|-x| + |-x| = 40$, which simplifies to $2|x|=40$, so $|x|=20$.

Thus, the solutions to the condition are $(x,y) = \left(\frac{20}{3}, \frac{20}{3}\right)$ and $(x,y) = (20,20)$.

Now, let's find the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ for each of these solutions:

If $(x,y) = \left(\frac{20}{3}, \frac{20}{3}\right)$, we have
\begin{align*}
5x^2+5y^2-8xy &= 5\left(\frac{20}{3}\right)^2+5\left(\frac{20}{3}\right)^2-8\left(\frac{20}{3}\right)\left(\frac{20}{3}\right) \\
&= 5\cdot\frac{400}{9} + 5\cdot\frac{400}{9} - \frac{3200}{9} \\
&= \frac{2000}{9}.
\end{align*}

If $(x,y) = (20,20)$, we have
\begin{align*}
5x^2+5y^2-8xy &= 5(20)^2+5(20)^2-8(20)(20) \\
&= 5\cdot 400 + 5\cdot 400 - 3200 \\
&= 2000.
\end{align*}

Thus, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\frac{2000}{9}$. However, this is not an integer, and it seems to be a mistake.

Let's re-examine our steps. We found that the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ simplifies to either $|x-2y| = |2x-y|$ or $x=y$. The first condition implies that $x=3y$, and substituting into $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we get $|3y-2y| + |y-6y| = 40$, which simplifies to $|y| + |-5y| = 40$, or $6|y|=40$, so $|y|= \frac{20}{3}$. But substituting $x=3y$ into $|x-2y| = |2x-y|$ gives $|3y-2y| = |6y-y|$, which simplifies to $|y| = |5y|$, and this condition is only true when $y=0$, but this would make $x=0$ as well, and $(0,0)$ does not satisfy the original condition. 

So, the mistake was in assuming that $|x-2y| = |2x-y|$ implies that $x-2y = 2x-y$ or $x-2y = -(2x-y)$. It turns out that this assumption was incorrect. The correct approach is to note that $|a| = |b|$ is equivalent to $a = b$ or $a = -b$. So, $|x-2y| = |2x-y|$ implies that $(x-2y) = (2x-y)$ or $(x-2y) = -(2x-y)$, which simplifies to $x=3y$ or $x=y$. But we've already considered the case $x=3y$ and it doesn't lead to a valid solution, so we must have $x=y$.

So, the valid solutions to the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ are $(x,y) = (20,20)$.

Now, let's find the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ for this solution:

If $(x,y) = (20,20)$, we have
\begin{align*}
5x^2+5y^2-8xy &= 5(20)^2+5(20)^2-8(20)(20) \\
&= 5\cdot 400 + 5\cdot 400 - 3200 \\
&= 2000.
\end{align*}

So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $2000$.

The mistake was in misinterpreting the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. The correct approach is to note that $|a| = |b|$ is equivalent to $a = b$ or $a = -b$. So, $|x-2y| = |2x-y|$ implies that $(x-2y) = (2x-y)$ or $(x-2y) = -(2x-y)$, which simplifies to $x=3y$ or $x=y$. But we've already considered the case $x=3y$ and it doesn't lead to a valid solution, so we must have $x=y$. This gives us the valid solution $(x,y) = (20,20)$.

Substituting $(x,y) = (20,20)$ into $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ gives $2000$, so the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $2000$.
The answer is: $2000$

**Problem:** 

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:



The given condition is $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. We can simplify it as follows:

First, note that $|a| = |-a|$ for all $a$, so $|x-2y| = |-(x-2y)| = |2y-x|$. Thus, we have:
\[|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40.\]

Next, we use the property of absolute value $|a+b| \leq |a| + |b|$ for all real numbers $a$ and $b$. Applying this to the left-hand side of the equation, we have:
\[|x-2y+2y-x| \leq |x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40.\]

Simplifying the left-hand side gives $|0| = 0 \leq 40$, which is true. Therefore, the given condition is always true.

Now, let's consider the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite it as follows:
\[5x^2+5y^2-8xy = \frac{1}{2}((5x^2-8xy+5y^2) + (5x^2-8xy+5y^2)) = \frac{1}{2}(5(x-y)^2 + 5(x+y)^2).\]

Since $(x-y)^2 \geq 0$ and $(x+y)^2 \geq 0$, we have $5(x-y)^2 \geq 0$ and $5(x+y)^2 \geq 0$. Therefore, the minimum value of the expression $\frac{1}{2}(5(x-y)^2 + 5(x+y)^2)$ is $0$, which occurs when $x-y = 0$ and $x+y = 0$. Solving these equations gives $x=y=0$.

However, plugging $x=y=0$ into the given condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ gives $0 + 0 = 0 \neq 40$, which is a contradiction. So, we need to find a way to minimize the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ without violating the given condition.

Notice that the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ can be rewritten as $\frac{1}{2}(5(x-y)^2 + 5(x+y)^2)$ and we have already minimized each term in the parentheses. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ occurs when $x-y = 0$ and $x+y = 0$, which implies $x=y=0$.

Plugging $x=y=0$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ gives $5 \cdot 0^2 + 5 \cdot 0^2 - 8 \cdot 0 \cdot 0 = 0$. So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the given condition is $0$. The answer is $\boxed{0}$

\end{align*}Equality occurs when $x^4 = 2y^2 = 4z^2.$  Using the condition $xyz = 2,$ we can solve to get $x = y = \sqrt{2}$ and $z = 1,$ so the minimum value is $\boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

**Problem:** 

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


First, note that $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = (x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2$.
Then, we have $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, we have $|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |(x-2y) - (y-2x)| = |x-y|$.
So, $|x-y| = 40$.
Now, let $u = x-y$, then $y = x-u$.
Substituting this into $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we have $5x^2+5(x-u)^2-8x(x-u)$.
Expanding and simplifying, we get $5x^2+5(x^2-2ux+u^2)-8x^2+8ux = -3x^2+5u^2+10ux$.
By completing the square, we have $-3(x^2- \frac{10u}{3}x) + 5u^2 = -3(x-\frac{5u}{3})^2 + \frac{5u^2 \cdot 9}{3}$.
So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is achieved when $x = \frac{5u}{3}$ and is equal to $\frac{5u^2 \cdot 9}{3} - 3(\frac{5u}{3})^2 = 15u^2 - \frac{25u^2}{3} = \frac{45u^2 - 25u^2}{3} = \frac{20u^2}{3}$.
Now, we need to find the value of $u$ that minimizes $\frac{20u^2}{3}$.
Since $|x-y| = 40$, we have $|u| = 40$, so $u^2 = 1600$.
Then, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\frac{20 \cdot 1600}{3} = \frac{32000}{3}$.
The answer is $\boxed{\frac{32000}{3}}$.

**Problem:** 

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


First, we can simplify the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
By the property of absolute value, we have
$|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |x-2y| + |2y-x| = |x-2y| - |x-2y| = 0$.
This is a contradiction because $0$ is not equal to $40$.
Therefore, we must have made a mistake in our simplification.
Let's correct the mistake.
We have $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |x-2y| + |-1*(y-2x)| = |x-2y| + |2x-y| = 40$.
Now we can solve the problem.
Let $A = x-2y$ and $B = 2x-y$. Then the equation becomes $|A| + |B| = 40$.
We know that $|A| + |B| \geq |A+B|$ by the triangle inequality.
So $|A+B| \leq 40$.
Now let's calculate $A+B$:
$A+B = (x-2y) + (2x-y) = 3x - 3y = 3(x-y)$.
So $|3(x-y)| \leq 40$.
This gives $|x-y| \leq \frac{40}{3}$.
Now let's substitute this back into the original expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
$5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x-y)^2 + 2xy] - 8xy$.
We know that $(x-y)^2 \geq 0$, so $(x-y)^2 + 2xy \geq 2xy$.
Then $5[(x-y)^2 + 2xy] - 8xy \geq 5*2xy - 8xy = 2xy$.
Since $|x-y| \leq \frac{40}{3}$, we know that $xy \leq \left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{1600}{9}$.
So $2xy \leq 2*\frac{1600}{9} = \frac{3200}{9}$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\frac{3200}{9}$.
The answer is:
$\boxed{\frac{3200}{9}}$.

**Problem:** 

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:



We are given the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. This equation is symmetric in $x$ and $y$, so without loss of generality, we can assume that $x \ge y$. Then the equation becomes $x - 2y + 2x - y = 40$, which simplifies to $3x - 3y = 40$, or $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$.

Now we can substitute $y = x - \frac{40}{3}$ into the expression we want to minimize, $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$:
\begin{align*}
5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy &= 5x^2 + 5\left(x - \frac{40}{3}\right)^2 - 8x\left(x - \frac{40}{3}\right) \\
&= 5x^2 + 5\left(x^2 - \frac{80x}{3} + \frac{1600}{9}\right) - 8x^2 + \frac{320x}{3} \\
&= 5x^2 + 5x^2 - \frac{400x}{3} + \frac{1600}{9} - 8x^2 + \frac{320x}{3} \\
&= -3x^2 + \frac{40x}{3} + \frac{1600}{9}.
\end{align*}

Now we can find the minimum of this expression by taking the derivative and setting it equal to zero:
\begin{align*}
-6x + \frac{40}{3} &= 0 \\
-6x &= -\frac{40}{3} \\
x &= \frac{20}{9}.
\end{align*}
Substituting this value of $x$ back into $y = x - \frac{40}{3}$, we find
\begin{align*}
y &= \frac{20}{9} - \frac{40}{3} = -\frac{20}{3}.
\end{align*}
Finally, we substitute these values of $x$ and $y$ back into the expression we want to minimize:
\begin{align*}
-3x^2 + \frac{40x}{3} + \frac{1600}{9} &= -3\left(\frac{20}{9}\right)^2 + \frac{40}{3} \cdot \frac{20}{9} + \frac{1600}{9} \\
&= -\frac{400}{27} + \frac{800}{27} + \frac{1600}{9} \\
&= \frac{1600}{9}.
\end{align*}

So the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is $\frac{1600}{9}$.
The answer is: $\boxed{\frac{1600}{9}}$

**Problem:** 

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:



First, we simplify the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. We can rewrite it as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$.

By the absolute value property, $|a| + |b| = |a+b|$, so we have $|x-2y + 2y-x| = 40$, which simplifies to $|0| = 40$.

However, $|0|$ is always 0, not 40. This means we must have made an error in our reasoning. Let's go back and check our steps.

In the absolute value equation, we can't just add the absolute values as we did. Instead, we need to consider the different cases for the absolute values to be minimized.

The expression $|x-2y| + |y-2x|$ can be minimized by considering the following cases:

1. If $x-2y \geq 0$ and $y-2x \geq 0$, then $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = (x-2y) + (y-2x) = x - 2y + y - 2x = -x - y$.
2. If $x-2y \geq 0$ and $y-2x < 0$, then $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = (x-2y) - (y-2x) = x - 2y - y + 2x = x - 3y + 2x = 3x - 3y = 3(x - y)$.
3. If $x-2y < 0$ and $y-2x \geq 0$, then $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = -(x-2y) + (y-2x) = -x + 2y + y - 2x = -3x + 3y = 3(y - x)$.
4. If $x-2y < 0$ and $y-2x < 0$, then $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = -(x-2y) - (y-2x) = -x + 2y - y + 2x = x + y$.

Now, we need to find the conditions for each case to be minimized to 40:

1. $-x - y = 40 \Rightarrow x + y = -40$.
2. $3(x - y) = 40 \Rightarrow x - y = \frac{40}{3}$.
3. $3(y - x) = 40 \Rightarrow y - x = \frac{40}{3}$.
4. $x + y = 40$.

From cases 2 and 3, we can see that $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$. Adding this to the equation from case 1, we get $x + y = -40$ and $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$. Solving this system of equations, we find $x = -\frac{20}{3}$ and $y = -\frac{60}{3} = -20$.

Now that we have the values of $x$ and $y$, we can find the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. Substituting the values of $x$ and $y$, we get:

\begin{align*}
5x^2+5y^2-8xy &= 5\left(-\frac{20}{3}\right)^2 + 5(-20)^2 - 8\left(-\frac{20}{3}\right)(-20) \\
&= 5\cdot \frac{400}{9} + 5\cdot 400 - 8\cdot \frac{400}{3} \\
&= \frac{2000}{9} + 2000 - \frac{3200}{3} \\
&= \frac{2000}{9} + \frac{18000}{9} - \frac{28800}{9} \\
&= \frac{-8800}{9}.
\end{align*}However, this is not possible, as the expression is a sum of squares and a negative value would not make sense in this context. 

Let's try the value from case 4 instead. Substituting $x + y = 40$ into the equation $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$, we get $x = 26.67$ and $y = 13.33$.

Now, we can find the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ using these values of $x$ and $y$:

\begin{align*}
5x^2+5y^2-8xy &= 5(26.67)^2 + 5(13.33)^2 - 8(26.67)(13.33) \\
&= 5\cdot 710.89 + 5\cdot 177.78 - 8\cdot 355.56 \\
&= 3554.45 + 888.9 - 2844.48 \\
&= 3988.87 - 2844.48 \\
&= 1144.39.
\end{align*}This also does not make sense, as we would expect the value of the expression to be minimized.

Let's try another approach. We can rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy$. Now, let's consider the expression $x^2+y^2$. By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have

\[(1+1)(x^2+y^2) \geq (x+y)^2.\]Substituting $x+y=40$, we get

\[2(x^2+y^2) \geq 40^2 = 1600,\]so $x^2+y^2 \geq 800$.

Now, let's substitute this into the expression $5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy$:

\[5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy \geq 5(800) - 8xy = 4000 - 8xy.\]To minimize this expression, we need to maximize the value of $8xy$. By AM-GM, we have

\[8xy \leq 8\left(\frac{x+y}{2}\right)^2 = 8\left(\frac{40}{2}\right)^2 = 8(20)^2 = 3200.\]Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is achieved when $8xy = 3200$. This means $xy = 400$. Substituting this back into the expression, we get

\[5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy = 5(800) - 8(400) = 4000 - 3200 = 800.\]Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 800. The answer is: 800

## QUESTION 1 - 13 
- TIME_SPENT : 346 secs

13_**Problem:** 

"Let $x,$ $y,$ and $z$ be positive real numbers such that $xyz = 2.$  Find the minimum value of
\[x^4 + 4y^2 + 4z^4.\]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:
By AM-GM,
\begin{align*}
x^4 + 4y^2 + 4z^4 &= x^4 + 2y^2 + 2y^2 + 4z^4 \\
&\ge 4 \sqrt[4]{(x^4)(2y^2)(2y^2)(4z^4)} \\
&= 8xyz \\
&= 16.
\end{align*}Equality occurs when $x^4 = 2y^2 = 4z^2.$  Using the condition $xyz = 2,$ we can solve to get $x = y = \sqrt{2}$ and $z = 1,$ so the minimum value is $\boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

**Problem:** 

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:



We start by expressing the given condition in a more convenient form:
\[|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40.\]
Using the property $|a| + |b| = |a + b| + |a - b|$, we can rewrite the left-hand side as:
\[|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = |(x - 2y) + (y - 2x)| + |(x - 2y) - (y - 2x)| = |-x - y| + |x - 3y| = 40.\]
Now, we use the fact that $|a - b| \ge 0$ for all $a$ and $b$, so we have:
\[|-x - y| \ge 0 \quad \text{and} \quad |x - 3y| \ge 0.\]
Adding these two inequalities, we get:
\[|-x - y| + |x - 3y| \ge 0.\]
Since we know that $|-x - y| + |x - 3y| = 40$, we must have $|-x - y| = |x - 3y| = 20$. This gives us two cases:

Case 1: $-x - y = x - 3y$. Solving this equation gives $y = 0$.
Case 2: $-x - y = -(x - 3y)$. Solving this equation gives $x = y$.

Now, we substitute these cases back into the original condition:

Case 1: $y = 0$. Substituting $y = 0$ into the condition gives $x = \pm 20$.
Case 2: $x = y$. Substituting $x = y$ into the condition gives $2x - x = 40$, so $x = 40$. However, this solution does not satisfy the condition, so we discard it.

Therefore, the only valid solution is $x = 20$ and $y = 0$. Substituting these values into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ gives:
\[5(20)^2 + 5(0)^2 - 8(20)(0) = 2000.\]

So the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is $2000$. The answer is: $2000$
