Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero, which means either one of the expressions must be zero for the product to be zero. Thus, we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

In the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us four lines in the coordinate plane: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle with side lengths of 20 units.

In the second case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us four more lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length of 16 units.

The intersection of these two sets of lines is a square with side length 8 units. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of this square, which is $8^2 = 64$ square units. The answer is: $64$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The problem is asking for the area of a convex polygon formed by the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the given equation.

The equation is: $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

For the product of two numbers to be zero, either one of the numbers must be zero. So we have two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From case 1, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This forms a square with side length 10.

From case 2, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This forms a square with side length 8.

The larger square encloses the smaller square, so the convex polygon is the area of the larger square minus the area of the smaller square.

The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of the larger square is $10^2 = 100$, and the area of the smaller square is $8^2 = 64$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $100 - 64 = 36$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    # Area of the larger square
    larger_square_area = 10**2

    # Area of the smaller square
    smaller_square_area = 8**2

    # Area of the convex polygon
    polygon_area = larger_square_area - smaller_square_area

    return polygon_area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 36

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output

The area of the convex polygon is $36$. The answer is: $36$.

The problem statement seems to have a mistake. The equation should be equal to zero but it is not. I think the correct equation should be:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$$

The solutions to this equation are the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The solutions to $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ are the points on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$. These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(0, 10)$, $(10, 0)$, $(0, -10)$, and $(-10, 0)$.

The solutions to $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ are the points on the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$. These lines form a square with vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The intersection of the two sets of solutions is the square with vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 64 square units. The answer is: $64$

The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, which means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

For the first term to be zero, we have $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these equations are all the points $(x, y)$ such that the distance from the origin to $(x, y)$ is 10, i.e., $x^2 + y^2 = 10^2 = 100$.

For the second term to be zero, we have $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are all the points $(x, y)$ such that the distance from $(x, y)$ to the origin is 8, i.e., $x^2 + y^2 = 8^2 = 64$.

Therefore, the points that satisfy the given equation are all the points that lie on a circle of radius 10 centered at the origin and the points that lie on a circle of radius 8 centered at the origin. The intersection of these two circles is a square with side length 16 (since the distance between the centers of the two circles is 2, and the difference of the radii is also 2).

The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So, the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points satisfying the given equation is 256.

Here is a Python code that calculates the area:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_square():
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

area = area_of_square()
print(area)

The area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:



First, let's analyze the equation:

$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$

This equation equals to zero if and only if at least one of the factors equals to zero. That is, either
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$$
or
$$((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$

The second equation can only be true if both $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means the points are within a square with side length $16$.

The first equation can be true if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means the points lie on a square with side length $20$.

Therefore, the points that satisfy the equation are the intersection of the square with side length $16$ and the square with side length $20$. This intersection is a square with side length $16$.

The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is $256$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of this convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:


The equation given is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

For this equation to be true, either the first term $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$ or the second term $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

If the first term is zero, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines enclose a square with side length 10.

If the second term is zero, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines also enclose a square with side length 16.

Therefore, the convex polygon formed by the points satisfying the given equation is the union of two squares: one with side length 10 and the other with side length 16.

The area of a square with side length $s$ is $s^2$. So, the area of the square with side length 10 is $10^2 = 100$ and the area of the square with side length 16 is $16^2 = 256$.

The area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of these two squares, which is $100 + 256 = 356$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 356 square units. The answer is: $356$

The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. Therefore, either the first expression is zero, or the second expression is zero, or both are zero.

The first expression is zero when $|\pm x \pm y| - 10 = 0$, which simplifies to $|\pm x \pm y| = 10$. This represents a square with side length $20$ and diagonals of length $20\sqrt{2}$.

The second expression is zero when $|\pm x| - 8 = 0$ or $|\pm y| - 8 = 0$, which simplifies to $|x| = 8$ or $|y| = 8$. This represents a square with side length $16$ and diagonals of length $16\sqrt{2}$.

The intersection of these two squares forms a smaller square with side length $20 - 16 = 4$ and diagonals of length $4\sqrt{2}$.

The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side. Therefore, the area of the smaller square is $4^2 = 16$.
The answer is: $16$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. 

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$ and the second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$.

Setting each expression to zero gives:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ which implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ which implies $\vert y \vert = 8$.

From 3. and 4., we get the points $(x, y)$ are within a square with side length 16 centered at the origin. From 1. and 2., we get the points $(x, y)$ are within a square with side length 20 centered at the origin.

The intersection of these two squares is the region where all the points $(x, y)$ lie. This intersection is a square with side length 10 (the smaller of the two squares' side lengths).

The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. So, the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units.

The Python code to calculate the area is as follows:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""

    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = polygon_area()

The area of the convex polygon is $100$ square units.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The equation $AB = 0$ implies that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the given equation is satisfied if either of the following two conditions hold:
1. $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$, or
2. $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

For the first condition to hold, we need both $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, or $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$.

For the second condition to hold, we need both $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$, or $y = 8$ and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length $16$.

The area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of these two squares. The area of a square with side length $a$ is $a^2$, so the area of the first square is $(10\sqrt{2})^2 = 200$, and the area of the second square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the total area of the convex polygon is $200 + 256 = 456$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $456$. The answer is: $456$

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, which means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

The first term is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. This term is zero if and only if both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These two equations represent a square with side length 20.

The second term is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. This term is zero if and only if both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These two equations represent a square with side length 16.

The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon formed by the points satisfying the given equation. The area of the convex polygon is the area of the square with side length 16. 

The area of a square with side length $s$ is $s^2$. So the area of the convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$.
