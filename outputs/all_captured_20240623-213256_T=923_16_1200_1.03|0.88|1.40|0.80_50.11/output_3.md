This problem involves the concept of absolute value and zero product property in algebra. The equation given in the problem, $ ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$, is equal to zero if either of the two factors is zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0)$.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$.

Therefore, the polygon is a square with side length 10 units. The area of the square is side length squared, which is $10^2 = 100$ square units. So the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units. The answer is: $100$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ will be true if either of the two factors is zero.

2. For the first factor to be zero, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

3. For the second factor to be zero, either $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

4. Combining these results, we find that the points $(x, y)$ must lie on the square with vertices at $(\pm 8, 8), (\pm 8, -8), (8, \pm 8), (-8, \pm 8)$.

5. The side length of this square is $16$, so its area is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $256$.

In python, the solution would look something like this:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    # Side length of the square
    side_length = 16
    # Area of the square
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The expression is equal to zero when either the first term or the second term is equal to zero.
2. The first term is zero when $|x+y|=10$ or $|x-y|=10$.
3. The second term is zero when $|x|=8$ or $|y|=8$.
4. The solutions to $|x+y|=10$ are a square with side length 10.
5. The solutions to $|x-y|=10$ are also a square with side length 10.
6. The solutions to $|x|=8$ are a square with side length 16.
7. The solutions to $|y|=8$ are also a square with side length 16.
8. The area of the convex polygon is the union of these four squares.

To calculate the area of the convex polygon, we can simply add the areas of the four squares. The area of a square with side length $s$ is $s^2$. Therefore, the area of the square with side length 10 is $10^2=100$, and the area of the square with side length 16 is $16^2=256$.

The area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of these four squares, which is $100+100+256+256=712$.

The answer is: $712$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The equation $AB=0$ implies that either $A=0$ or $B=0$. Therefore, the given equation is satisfied if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The first equation implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which can only happen if $x = 0$ and $y = 0$.
The second equation implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which can only happen if $-8 \leq x \leq 8$ and $-8 \leq y \leq 8$.
Therefore, the points $\left(x, y\right)$ that satisfy the given equation are those in the square with vertices at $\left(-8, -8\right)$, $\left(-8, 8\right)$, $\left(8, 8\right)$, and $\left(8, -8\right)$.
The side length of this square is $16$, so its area is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The equation is satisfied only when both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. These conditions are met only when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ must satisfy $x + y = \pm 10$, $x - y = \pm 10$, $x = \pm 8$, and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives the vertices of the polygon as: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(2, 8)$, $(-2, 8)$, $(2, -8)$, and $(-2, -8)$.

To find the area of the polygon, we can draw it on a coordinate plane and use the formula for the area of a polygon given its vertices. The polygon is a square with side length 16. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. So the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$
