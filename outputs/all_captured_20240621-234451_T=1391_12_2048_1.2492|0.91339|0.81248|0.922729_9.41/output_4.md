Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Step 1: First, let's use the second condition to find the value of $f(100)$, assuming that we know the value of $f(50)$.

Step 2: According to the second condition, $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. So, we can express $f(100)$ as follows:
$f(100)=2f(50)+1$.

Step 3: However, we cannot directly calculate the value of $f(100)$ because we don't know the value of $f(50)$. But we can continue this approach to express $f(50)$ in terms of something that we might be able to calculate.

Step 4: Using the second condition again, $f(50)=2f(25)+1$.

Step 5: But again, we don't know the value of $f(25)$. So, let's express $f(25)$ in terms of something we might be able to calculate.

Step 6: Continuing the approach, $f(25)=2f(12.5)+1$. But we only work with integers, so we stop here.

Step 7: Now, let's try to use the first condition to find the value of $f(12.5)$. However, the first condition involves $f(f(f(n)))$, and we cannot directly calculate $f(12.5)$ with it.

Step 8: Instead, let's guess and check some values to see if we can find a pattern. Let's test $n=1$ in the first condition:

$f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1$.

Since $f(f(f(1)))=1$, we know that $f(1)=1$.

Step 9: Now, let's go back to finding $f(25)$. We can substitute $n=12.5$ into $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to get:

$f(25)=2f(12.5)+1$. But we know $f(1)=1$, so let's substitute $n=6$ into the second condition:

$f(12)=2f(6)+1$. Solving for $f(6)$, we get $f(6)=\frac{f(12)-1}{2}=\frac{12-1}{2}=5.5$.

Step 10: Again, we only work with integers, so $f(6)$ is not an integer. This implies that our initial guess of $f(1)=1$ was incorrect.

Step 11: Let's try another guess and check $f(1)=2$. If $f(1)=2$, then $f(2)=5$ using the second condition, $f(4)=11$, and $f(8)=23$. When we calculate $f(f(f(8)))$, we get:

$f(f(f(8)))=f(f(23))=f(46)=92-7=85$.

But this does not match the given value of $8*8-7=55$, so our guess of $f(1)=2$ is incorrect.

Step 12: Let's try another guess and check $f(1)=3$. If $f(1)=3$, then $f(3)=7$, $f(6)=15$, $f(12)=31$, and $f(24)=63$. Then, $f(f(f(24)))=f(f(63))=f(126)=252-7=245$. But this does not match the given value of $8*24-7=185$, so our guess of $f(1)=3$ is incorrect.

Step 13: Finally, let's try $f(1)=4$. If $f(1)=4$, then $f(4)=9$, $f(8)=19$, $f(16)=39$, and $f(32)=79$. When we calculate $f(f(f(32)))$, we get:

$f(f(f(32)))=f(f(79))=f(158)=316-7=309$. This does not match the given value of $8*32-7=251$, so our guess of $f(1)=4$ is incorrect.

Step 14: At this point, we might realize that our initial guess of $f(1)=1$ was incorrect. Let's try $f(1)=5$. If $f(1)=5$, then $f(5)=11$, $f(10)=23$, $f(20)=47$, and $f(40)=95$. When we calculate $f(f(f(40)))$, we get:

$f(f(f(40)))=f(f(95))=f(190)=380-7=373$. This matches the given value of $8*40-7=317$, so our guess of $f(1)=5$ appears to be correct.

Step 15: Now that we have $f(1)=5$, we can go back and find the value of $f(100)$. Using the second condition repeatedly:

$f(50)=2f(25)+1=2(2f(12.5)+1)+1=4f(6)+3$.

And

$f(100)=2f(50)+1=2(4f(6)+3)+1=8f(6)+7$.

But we know $f(6)=15$ (from $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$), so:

$f(100)=8(15)+7=127$.

So, the value of $f(100)$ is $127$. The answer is: 127

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 To find the value of $f(100)$, we need to evaluate the function $f$ at 100 using the given conditions. We don't have a direct formula for $f(n)$, so we need to use the given conditions to find $f(100)$ step by step.

Firstly, let's find the value of $f(f(f(100)))$ using the given condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. So we have $f(f(f(100)))=8*100-7=793$. 

Now, let's set $n=100$ in the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we have $f(200)=2f(100)+1$. But we know that $f(f(f(100)))=793$, and from the first condition we know that $f(f(f(100)))=200f(100)-7$, so we have $200f(100)-7=793$, solving this equation gives us $f(100)=\frac{793+7}{200}=4$.

So the value of $f(100)$ is 4. The final answer is $\boxed{4}$.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We are given two equations: $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. The first equation is the most challenging one to solve.
2. In order to find $f(100)$, we can use the second equation to relate $f(100)$ with $f(50)$ and eventually $f(25)$. 
3. By repeatedly applying the second equation, we eventually obtain $f(100)$ in terms of $f(25)$. 
4. Now, we need to find $f(25)$. To do this, we can apply the first equation with $n=25$ to get $f(f(f(25)))=8*25-7=193$.
5. From the first equation, we can deduce that $f(25)$ must be a number such that $f(f(f(25)))=193$. So, we need to find a number $x$ such that $f(f(x))=193$. 
6. After trying different numbers, we find that if we set $f(25)=50$, then $f(f(50))=f(50+25)=f(75)$, and from the second equation, $f(75)=2f(37.5)+1=2(2f(18.75)+1)+1=2(2(2f(9.375)+1)+1)+1=2(2(2(2f(4.6875)+1)+1)+1)+1=2(2(2(2(2f(2.34375)+1)+1)+1)+1)+1=2(2(2(2(2(2f(1.171875)+1)+1)+1)+1)+1)+1$.
7. As $f(n)$ is a function from natural numbers to natural numbers, $f(1.171875)$ cannot be a natural number. This implies that our initial assumption $f(25)=50$ is incorrect.
8. We can keep trying different numbers until we find the correct one. By trial and error, we find that if we set $f(25)=25$, then $f(f(25))=f(50)$ and from the second equation, $f(50)=2f(25)+1=2(25)+1=51$, and $f(f(50))=f(51)$, and again from the second equation, $f(51)=2f(25.5)+1=2(2(2f(12.75)+1)+1)+1=2(2(2(2f(6.375)+1)+1)+1)+1=2(2(2(2(2f(3.1875)+1)+1)+1)+1)+1$.
9. We continue to apply the second equation until we get to a number that matches with the first equation. After several steps, we find that $f(125)=193$. 
10. Now, we can use the second equation to relate $f(100)$ with $f(50)$ and eventually $f(25)$. From the second equation, $f(100)=2f(50)+1=2(51)+1=103$. 

After all this analysis, we can conclude that $f(100)=103$. The numerical answer is $103$.
The answer is: $103$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Using the second equation for the function, $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, let's find what $f(1)$ might be. We see that $2f(1) + 1 = f(2)$, so if we substitute $n = 1$, we get:

\[ f(2) = 2f(1) + 1. \]
Now, by the first equation, $f(f(f(1))) = 8 \cdot 1 - 7 = -1$, so $f(f(1)) = -1$. Now, substitute $n = f(1)$ in the first equation and we get:

\[ f(f(f(f(1)))) = f(-1) = 8 \cdot f(1) - 7 = -1. \]

Now from here it's not easy to proceed directly, so we'll try a different approach. Let's find the value of $f(f(f(2)))$:

\[ f(f(f(2))) = f(f(2f(1) + 1)) = f(f(3)) = f(5) = 8 \cdot 2 - 7 = 9. \]
Now, substitute $n = 2$ into the first equation and we get:

\[ f(f(f(2))) = f(9) = 8 \cdot 2 - 7 = 9. \]

Now, we can deduce that $f(3) = 5$ and $f(5) = 9$ because:

\[ f(f(f(3))) = f(f(5)) = 9 \]
and if $f(3) = a$ and $f(5) = b$, then $f(a) = b$, i.e., $f(3) = 5$ and $f(5) = 9$.

Now that we have $f(3)$ and $f(5)$, we can find $f(1)$:

\[ f(2f(1) + 1) = f(3) \implies f(3) = 2f(1) + 1 \implies 5 = 2f(1) + 1 \implies f(1) = 2. \]

Now we know that $f(1) = 2$, and by substituting this into $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$ we find that $f(2) = 5$. Then we also get $f(3) = 5$ and $f(5) = 9$.

So by substitution, we find that $f(100) = 8 \cdot 100 - 7 = 793$. Now let's check if our function $f$ indeed satisfies all the conditions:

For $n = 100$, $f(f(f(100))) = f(f(793)) = f(8 \cdot 100 - 7) = f(793) = 8 \cdot 100 - 7 = 793$.

And $f(2 \cdot 100) = f(200) = 2f(100) + 1 = 2 \cdot 793 + 1 = 1587$.

For $n = 200$, $f(f(f(200))) = f(f(1587)) = f(8 \cdot 200 - 7) = f(1587) = 8 \cdot 200 - 7 = 1587$.

And $f(2 \cdot 200) = f(400) = 2f(200) + 1 = 2 \cdot 1587 + 1 = 3175$.

As we see that $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$ and $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ for all positive integers $n$, we can conclude that our function $f(n) = 8n - 7$ satisfies all the conditions. 
So, $f(100) = 793$.
The answer is: $\boxed{793}$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. For $n=1$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we have $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$. From this, we can know that $f(1)$ is a number such that $f(f(f(1)))=1$.

2. Use the second equation, $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we know that $f(2)=2f(1)+1$. Let's substitute $f(1)$ from the first equation, then we have $f(2)=2*1+1=3$.

3. Now we have $f(1)$ and $f(2)$, let's calculate $f(3)$ using the second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Substituting $n=2$, we have $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2*3+1=7$.

4. But from the first equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we substitute $n=1$, we have $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$, which means $f(f(f(1)))=f(1)=1$, so $f(1)=1$.

5. From steps 2 and 4, we can deduce that $f(2)=3$ and $f(1)=1$.

6. Now we can start computing $f(n)$ for higher $n$:
   - $f(3)=f(2f(1)+1)=2f(f(1))+1=2f(1)+1=2*1+1=3$,
   - $f(4)=f(2f(2)+1)=2f(f(2))+1=2f(3)+1=2*3+1=7$,
   - $f(5)=f(2f(3)+1)=2f(f(3))+1=2f(4)+1=2*7+1=15$,
   - And so on...

From this step by step, we can find that $f(n)$ is increasing. Now let's see when $f(n)$ will exceed 100. Using a loop, we can see that $f(25)=101$. 

Finally, to calculate $f(100)$, we just need to apply the second equation repeatedly. From $f(25)=101$, we have:

- $f(50)=2f(25)-1=2*101-1=201$,
- $f(100)=2f(50)-1=2*201-1=401$.

Therefore, the value of $f(100)$ is $401$.

Oops, something went wrong. Let's retrace our steps and look for an alternative method to solve this problem.

As we know, we are given two equations: 
1. $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, and 
2. $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.

If we substitute $n=1$ into the first equation, we can find that $f(f(f(1)))=1$, which implies that $f(1)=1$.

Then substitute $n=2$ into the second equation, we get $f(4)=2f(2)+1$. We can't solve this equation directly since we don't know $f(2)$ yet. 

Let's use the first equation to find the value of $f(2)$. 

Substitute $n=1$ into the first equation, we have $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$, which implies that $f(f(1))=1$, since $f(1)=1$. 

Substitute $f(1)=1$ into the equation $f(f(1))=1$, we have $f(1)=1$.

Therefore, $f(2)=3$.

Substitute $n=2$ and $f(2)=3$ into the second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can find $f(4)=2*3+1=7$.

Then substitute $n=3$ into the second equation, we get $f(6)=2f(3)+1$. We can't solve this equation directly since we don't know $f(3)$ yet.

Now we have $f(1)=1$, $f(2)=3$, $f(3)=3$, $f(4)=7$, $f(5)=15$, $f(6)=15$, and so on. 

We can find that $f(25)=101$, and continue to apply the second equation to find the value of $f(100)$:

$f(50)=2f(25)-1=2*101-1=201$,

$f(100)=2f(50)-1=2*201-1=401$.

So, the value of $f(100)$ is $401$.

Oops, something went wrong again. Let's review our approach.

The correct approach is to use the first equation to find the value of $f(2)$, then use the second equation to find the value of $f(4)$. We can see that $f(2)=3$ and $f(4)=7$.

Now we can apply the second equation to find the value of $f(n)$ for $n=5,6,\cdots,25$. We can find that $f(25)=101$.

Finally, we can continue to apply the second equation to find the value of $f(100)$:

$f(50)=2f(25)-1=2*101-1=201$,

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



From the second condition, if $n = 1$, then $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$, so $f(1)$ can be expressed in terms of $f(2)$.
If we substitute $n = f(1)$ into the first condition, we have $f(f(f(f(1)))) = f(f(2)) = 8*1 - 7 = -5$, so $f(f(2)) = -5$. Substituting $f(1)$ into the equation for $f(2)$ gives us $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = -5$, so we have a linear equation $2f(1) + 1 = -5$ and solving this equation gives us $f(1) = -3$.

If we substitute $f(1) = -3$ into the equation for $f(2)$, we get $f(2) = 2*(-3) + 1 = -5$, which is consistent with the result above.

Now we need to find $f(100)$. Let's use the second condition again. We have $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$. Now let's substitute $n = 100$ into the first condition, we get $f(f(f(100))) = 8*100 - 7 = 793$. So $f(f(f(100))) = 793$, or $f(f(100)) = 793$. 

Again using the second condition, we have $f(200) = f(f(100)) = 793$, so $2f(100) + 1 = 793$. Solving this equation gives us $f(100) = 396$.

Therefore, $f(100) = 396$. To obtain the numerical answer, we just print the integer value of $f(100)$:

```python

def calculate_f_100():

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



From the first equation, we know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. There is no direct way to find the function $f$ itself. However, from the second equation, we know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Let's substitute $n=f(n)$ in this equation:

\[f(2f(n))=2f(f(n))+1=2(8n-7)+1=16n-14+1=16n-13.\]

Now, we substitute $n=f(n)$ in the first equation again:

\[f(f(f(f(n))))=f(f(8n-7))=8f(8n-7)-7.\]

Comparing this with the result of $f(2f(n))$ above, we have:

\[8f(8n-7)-7=16n-13.\]

Rearrange this equation and get:

\[f(8n-7)=\frac{16n-6}{8}=\frac{2n-0.75}{1}=2n-0.75.\]

Unfortunately, we got an equation involving a non-integer. Let's go back and check our work. 

After revisiting the problem, we realize that we made an error in our substitution. The correct substitution should be $n=\frac{f(n)+1}{2}$. Let's perform the correct substitution again:

\[f(2 \cdot \frac{f(n)+1}{2})=f(f(n)+1)=2f(\frac{f(n)+1}{2})+1.\]

Now, substitute $n=f(n)$ into the first equation again:

\[f(f(f(n)+1))=8f(n)-7.\]

Comparing this with the result of $f(f(n)+1)$ above, we have:

\[8f(n)-7=2f(\frac{f(n)+1}{2})+1.\]

Rearrange this equation and get:

\[f(\frac{f(n)+1}{2})=4f(n)-4.\]

Now we know that $f(n)$ is an increasing function, so we can replace $n$ with a positive integer, say $n=1$:

\[f(\frac{f(1)+1}{2})=4f(1)-4.\]

Because $f(1)$ is a positive integer, let's set $f(1)=1$. Then we get:

\[f(\frac{1+1}{2})=4*1-4 \Rightarrow f(1)=0,\]

which contradicts our setting $f(1)=1$. So, let's try another value for $f(1)$. If we set $f(1)=2$, we get:

\[f(\frac{2+1}{2})=4*2-4 \Rightarrow f(1.5)=4.\]

Because $f(n)$ is an increasing function, $f(1.5)$ must be between $f(1)$ and $f(2)$. Since we know $f(1)=2$, we can conclude that $f(2)=4$. Now, we can substitute $n=2$ into the first equation to verify our result:

\[f(f(f(2)))=f(f(4))=f(8)=8*2-7=9.\]

This result agrees with the first equation. Therefore, our final result is $f(1)=2$. Finally, we are asked to find $f(100)$. To do this, we can use the second equation:

\[f(2 \cdot 100)=f(200)=2f(100)+1=2f(100)+1=2*2+1=5.\]

Then substitute $f(100)=5$ into the first equation to check our result:

\[f(f(f(100)))=f(f(5))=f(13)=8*100-7=793.\]

This does not agree with the first equation. We made an error somewhere. After checking our work again, we realize that the second equation should be:

\[f(2n)=2f(n)-1,\]

not $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. So, let's perform the correct substitution again:

\[f(2 \cdot \frac{f(n)+1}{2})=f(f(n)+1)=2f(\frac{f(n)+1}{2})-1.\]

Now, substitute $n=f(n)$ into the first equation again:

\[f(f(f(n)+1))=8f(n)-7.\]

Comparing this with the result of $f(f(n)+1)$ above, we have:

\[8f(n)-7=2f(\frac{f(n)+1}{2})-1.\]

Rearrange this equation and get:

\[f(\frac{f(n)+1}{2})=4f(n)-3.\]

Now we know that $f(n)$ is an increasing function, so we can replace $n$ with a positive integer, say $n=1$:

\[f(\frac{f(1)+1}{2})=4*1-3 \Rightarrow f(1)=2.\]

Now we can substitute $n=100$ into the second equation to find $f(100)$:

\[f(2 \cdot 100)=f(200)=2f(100)-1.\]

Set this equal to $5$ and solve for $f(100)$:

\[2f(100)-1=5 \Rightarrow 2f(100)=6 \Rightarrow f(100)=3.\]

To verify our result, we substitute $f(100)=3$ into the first equation:

\[f(f(f(100)))=f(f(3))=f(9)=8*100-7=793.\]

This agrees with the first equation. Therefore, the function $f(n)$ is defined as:

\[f(n)=\left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
2 & \mbox{if } n=1 \\
3 & \mbox{if } n=100
\end{array}
\right.\]

However, this doesn't match the form given in the problem. Let's try another approach.

From the first equation, we know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. We can set $n=1$, we get:

\[f(f(f(1)))=f(f(8-7))=f(f(1))=7.\]

We know that $f(1)=2$, so we get:

\[f(f(2))=f(4)=7.\]

From this equation, we can set $n=2$ in the first equation, we get:

\[f(f(f(2)))=f(f(4))=8*2-7=9.\]

We know that $f(f(2))=f(4)=7$, so we get:

\[f(7)=9.\]

Now, let's set $n=7$ in the first equation, we get:

\[f(f(f(7)))=f(f(57))=8*7-7=56.\]

We know that $f(7)=9$, so we get:

\[f(9)=56.\]

Now, we can find the value of $f(100)$:

\[f(100)=\frac{f(9)+7}{2}=\frac{56+7}{2}=31.5.\]

But this doesn't match the form given in the problem. Let's try another approach.

From the first equation, we know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. We can set $n=1$, we get:

\[f(f(f(1)))=f(f(8-7))=f(f(1))=7.\]

We know that $f(1)=2$, so we get:

\[f(f(2))=f(4)=7.\]

From this equation, we can set $n=2$ in the first equation, we get:

\[f(f(f(2)))=f(f(4))=8*2-7=9.\]

We know that $f(f(2))=f(4)=7$, so we get:

\[f(7)=9.\]

Now, let's set $n=7$ in the first equation, we get:

\[f(f(f(7)))=f(f(57))=8*7-7=56.\]

We know that $f(7)=9$, so we get:

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:


1. We can't start by computing $f(100)$ directly because we don't have enough information about the function $f$. However, we can use the second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. By setting $n=50$, we get $f(100)=2f(50)+1$.
2. Again, we don't know the value of $f(50)$. But we can use the first equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. By setting $n=25$, we get $f(f(f(25)))=8*25-7=193$. Since $f(f(f(25)))=193$, we have $f(25)=f^{-1}(193)$. Now we can substitute $n=25$ into the second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to get $f(50)=2f(25)+1$.
3. Similarly, we can substitute $n=12.5$ (not a valid input for a function on integers) into the first equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to get $f(f(f(12.5)))=8*12.5-7=93$. So we have $f(12.5)=f^{-1}(93)$. Now we can substitute $n=12.5$ into the second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to get $f(25)=2f(12.5)+1$.
4. By continuing this process, we can express $f(50)$ and $f(100)$ in terms of $f(12.5)$ and $f(25)$. Eventually, we will be able to find the numerical value of $f(12.5)$ and $f(25)$.

This process might seem tedious, but once we find the numerical values of $f(12.5)$ and $f(25)$, we can easily compute $f(50)$ and $f(100)$. However, implementing this process in sympy is not straightforward because the inverse of the function $f$ cannot be easily expressed symbolically. But, in many cases like this one, you might want to consider other ways to approach the problem.

In this case, it seems like the functional equations are suggesting some form of iteration. We know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, and $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. The first equation suggests that $f$ is an iterate of doubling and adding 1. The second equation further iterates this operation three times. This hints that the function might be some sort of iterated operation.

Exploring this idea, let's define a function that doubles and adds one:

\[g(n) = 2n + 1\]

We can then apply this function repeatedly:

\[f(n) = g(g(g(n)))\]

So, we can implement this in sympy as follows:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols

def f(n):
    n = symbols('n')
    g = 2*n + 1
    return g.subs(n, g.subs(n, g))

result = f(100)
print(result)
```

INTERMEDIATE OUT :

Oops, something went wrong! The problem here is that we are defining the function $g(n) = 2n + 1$ directly in sympy, but sympy doesn't like this as we are trying to mix sympy objects with integers (like 1 in $2n + 1$). A better way to do this is to use a lambda function or a custom function. Let's redefine the function $g(n)$ as follows:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def g(n):
    return 2*n + 1

def f(n):
    return g(g(g(n)))

result = f(100)
print(result)
```

INTERMEDIATE OUT :

```
Great! We have successfully found that $f(100) = 807$. So the positive integer value of $f(100)$ is $\boxed{807}$.

Remember, implementing the function $f$ directly in sympy was a bit tricky because of the limitations in how we define functions in sympy. By redefining the function $f$ in terms of the simpler function $g$, we were able to solve the problem more easily. This shows that it's often useful to simplify complex problems into simpler components before trying to solve them with sympy.In this case, the problem was simplified into a problem about iterative function application, which could be solved easily using custom functions rather than trying to use sympy's built-in capabilities for symbolic computations.The answer is: $807$.

Assistant:

 The given functions are $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. To find $f(100)$, we need to use these functions to compute $f(100)$ step by step.

First, let's compute $f(f(f(100)))$ using the first function:
$f(f(f(100))) = 8*100 - 7 = 793$.

Now, we know that $f(f(f(100))) = 793$, so we can set $n = f(100)$ in the first function and get:
$f(f(f(f(100)))) = 8f(100) - 7$.
Since we know that $f(f(f(100))) = 793$, we can substitute this into the equation:
$793 = 8f(100) - 7$.
Solving this equation for $f(100)$, we get:
$8f(100) = 793 + 7 = 800$,
$f(100) = 800 / 8 = 100$.

So, $f(100) = 100$. Therefore, the value of $f(100)$ is 100.
The answer is $\boxed{100}$.

Assistant:

 This problem involves a recursive function, and solving it directly can be quite challenging. However, we can use a little trick to simplify the problem. We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, so if we set $n=f(n)$, we get $f(f(n))=8f(n)-7$. If we set $n=f(n)$ again, we get $f(n)=8f(f(n))-7$. Substituting $f(f(n))=8f(n)-7$ into the equation gives $f(n)=8(8f(n)-7)-7$, which simplifies to $f(n)=64f(n)-56-7=64f(n)-63$. Rearranging terms gives $63f(n)=63$, so $f(n)=1$. 

Now we can use the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to find $f(100)$. Since $f(n)=1$, we have $f(2*50)=2f(50)+1$. So $f(100)=2f(50)+1$. Again since $f(n)=1$, $f(50)=1$, so $f(100)=2*1+1=3$. So $f(100)=3$.

Therefore, the value of $f(100)$ is 3. The answer is: $\boxed{3}$.

 This problem does not have a straightforward direct solution, and it is not a simple coding exercise. It involves logical deduction and solving for $f(100)$ from a set of equations. However, by substituting $n=1$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we can find $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1$. Since $f(f(f(1)))=1$, and $f(f(1))=f(2)$, from the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, when $n=1$, we get $f(2)=2f(1)+1$. Thus, $f(2)=f(f(1))=f(1)=f(1)$. So we have $f(1)=1$. From the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, when $n=2$, we get $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2f(1)+2+1=2*1+3=5$. Now from the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, when $n=2$, we get $f(f(f(2)))=8(2)-7=9$, so $f(f(5))=9$. Now using the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, when $n=5$, we get $f(10)=2f(5)+1=2*9-7=11$, and so $f(f(10))=9$. Using the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, when $n=10$, we get $f(f(f(10)))=8(10)-7=73$. So we have $f(10)=73$. Now since $100=10*10$, by applying the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ iteratively 9 times (since we have already calculated $f(10)$), we get:
```python

However, the number $37887$ does not satisfy the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ when $n=100$. The problem might be solved if the function $f$ is non-linear, or if additional constraints are added. 

Unfortunately, this is beyond the scope of a simple programming task. To solve this problem correctly and accurately, one would need to use more advanced mathematical techniques and skills.

If you have any thoughts or ideas, please feel free to share them.
The final numerical answer for $f(100)$ is $\boxed{19}$. However, it's important to note that the function described in the problem might not be unique, and other conditions or constraints might lead to a different answer.

 To find the value of $f(100)$, we can start by using the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We can iterate this condition to express $f(100)$ in terms of $f(50)$ and $f(25)$.

Then we can use the second condition again to express $f(50)$ and $f(25)$ in terms of $f(25)$. 

Finally, we can use the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to find $f(25)$, and then use the second condition to find $f(50)$ and $f(100)$.
