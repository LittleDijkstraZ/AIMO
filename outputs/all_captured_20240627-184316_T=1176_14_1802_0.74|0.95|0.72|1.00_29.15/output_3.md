**Problem:** 
"How many square units are in the area of the triangle whose vertices are the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the curve $y = (x-3)^2 (x+2)$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we need to find where this curve intersects the $x$ and $y$ axes.  If $y=0$, then $(x-3)^2(x+2)=0$, which has solutions of $x=3$ and $x=-2$.  If $x=0$, then $y=(-3)^2(2)=18$.  So, the curve has two $x$-intercepts and one $y$-intercept.  The length of the base along the $x$-axis is $3-(-2)=5$.  The height from this base is equal to the $y$-intercept, 18.  The area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 5\cdot 18=\boxed{45}$. The answer is $\boxed{45}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


This problem involves understanding the properties of absolute value and modulus functions. The equation given is a product of two terms equal to zero, which means either of the terms must be zero for the entire expression to be zero. This gives us two separate conditions to consider.

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From the first condition, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$. Similarly, from the second condition, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$.

The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 10 (from $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$) and another square with side length 8 (from $x = 8$ and $y = 8$). The area of the square with side length 10 is $10^2 = 100$, and the area of the square with side length 8 is $8^2 = 64$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of these two squares, which is $100 + 64 = 164$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 164 square units. The answer is: $\boxed{164}$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"An ellipse is defined parametrically by
\[(x,y) = \left( \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t}, \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t} \right).\]Then the equation of the ellipse can be written in the form
\[Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0,\]where $A,$ $B,$ $C,$ $D,$ $E,$ and $F$ are integers, and $\gcd(|A|,|B|,|C|,|D|,|E|,|F|) = 1.$  Find $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F|.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
In the equation $y = \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\cos t$ to get
\[\cos t = \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3}.\]In the equation $x = \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\sin t$ to get
\[\sin t = \frac{1}{2} x (2 - \cos t) + 1 = \frac{1}{2} x \left( 2 - \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right) + 1 = 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)}.\]Since $\cos^2 t + \sin^2 t = 1,$
\[\left( \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right)^2 + \left( 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)} \right)^2 = 1.\]Multiplying both sides by $(2(y + 3))^2$ and expanding, it will simplify to
\[81x^2 - 36xy + 16y^2 - 108x + 240y + 900 = 0.\]Therefore, $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F| = 81 + 36 + 16 + 108 + 240 + 900 = \boxed{1381}.$ The answer is $\boxed{1381}$

**Solution:** 



The problem requires us to find the area of a polygon that is enclosed by the points that satisfy a given equation. The equation is:

$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$

This equation is satisfied if either of the two factors is zero. The first factor is zero if either $|x+y| = 10$ or $|x-y| = 10$. The second factor is zero if either $|x| = 8$ or $|y| = 8$.

These conditions describe four lines in the plane. The lines $|x+y| = 10$, $|x-y| = 10$, $|x| = 8$, and $|y| = 8$ form a rectangle with side lengths 16 and 20. The area of this rectangle is $16 \times 20 = 320$.

So the area of the polygon is 320. The answer is: $320$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Find the number of 10-tuples $(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{10})$ of real numbers such that
\[(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2 = \frac{1}{11}.\]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,
\begin{align*}
&[(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + \dots + 1^2 + 1^2)][(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2] \\
&\ge [(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + (x_2 - x_3) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10}]^2 = 1.
\end{align*}From the given condition, we have equality, so by the equality condition for Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[\frac{1 - x_1}{1} = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{1} = \frac{x_2 - x_3}{1} = \dots = \frac{x_9 - x_{10}}{1} = \frac{x_{10}}{1}.\]Let
\[d = 1 - x_1 = x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_3 = \dots = x_9 - x_{10} = x_{10}.\]Then
\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so
\[(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_{10}) = \left( \frac{10}{11}, \frac{9}{11}, \frac{8}{11}, \dots, \frac{1}{11} \right).\]In particular, there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Solution:** 


The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. The area of this convex polygon can be found by finding the area of the individual rectangles that make up the polygon and summing them up.

The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied when either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. The first equation is satisfied when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which forms a rectangle with sides of length 20. The second equation is satisfied when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which forms a square with side length 16.

The convex polygon is the union of these two shapes, so its area is the sum of the areas of the rectangle and the square. The area of a rectangle is length times width, and the area of a square is side length squared. Thus, the area of the rectangle is $20 \times 20 = 400$, and the area of the square is $16 \times 16 = 256$. Adding these two areas together, the total area of the convex polygon is $400 + 256 = 656$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{656}$.
The answer is: $656$

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. This gives us four conditions to consider:
1. $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x - y| - 10 = 0$
2. $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x| - 8 = 0$
3. $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ and $|y| - 8 = 0$
4. $|x - y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x| - 8 = 0$
5. $|x - y| - 10 = 0$ and $|y| - 8 = 0$
6. $|x| - 8 = 0$ and $|y| - 8 = 0$

The first four conditions imply that $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$, which means $x = \pm y$. The second and third conditions imply that $|x| = 8$ and the fourth and fifth conditions imply that $|y| = 8$. Combining these results, we find that the points that satisfy the conditions are $(8, 0), (-8, 0), (0, 8),$ and $(0, -8)$. These four points form a square with side length 16, so its area is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: 256

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we first need to understand the equation and the conditions under which it equals zero. The equation is given as:
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]
This equation equals zero if either of the two factors equals zero. This gives us two conditions:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first condition to be true, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, and $(0, -10)$.

For the second condition to be true, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The intersection of the two regions defined by these conditions is the convex polygon formed by the intersection of the rectangle and the square. The area of this polygon is the area of the rectangle minus the area of the square. The area of the rectangle is $20 * 20 = 400$, and the area of the square is $16 * 16 = 256$. So the area of the convex polygon is $400 - 256 = 144$.

The answer is: $\boxed{144}$.

**Solution:** 



First, let's understand the problem. We are given a set of points $\left(x, y\right)$ that satisfy a certain equation and we are asked to find the area of the polygon enclosed by these points. 

The equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

This equation is equal to zero if and only if either of the two factors is equal to zero. 

The first factor is equal to zero when either $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. This means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two lines in the plane, and the region enclosed by these lines is a square with side length 20.

The second factor is equal to zero when either $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. This means $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two lines in the plane, and the region enclosed by these lines is a square with side length 16.

The intersection of the two squares is a smaller square with side length 8. The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 64 square units.

The answer is: $64$.

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we first need to understand the properties of absolute values and how they affect the expression. 

The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ equals to 0 if and only if both of the factors equal to 0.

The factor $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle.

Similarly, the factor $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square.

The intersection of the rectangle and the square is the convex polygon we are looking for. The area of the square is $8^2 = 64$, and the area of the rectangle is $20 \times 20 = 400$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of the intersection, which is the area of the square.

The answer is: $64$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many square units are in the area of the triangle whose vertices are the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the curve $y = (x-3)^2 (x+2)$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we need to find where this curve intersects the $x$ and $y$ axes.  If $y=0$, then $(x-3)^2(x+2)=0$, which has solutions of $x=3$ and $x=-2$.  If $x=0$, then $y=(-3)^2(2)=18$.  So, the curve has two $x$-intercepts and one $y$-intercept.  The length of the base along the $x$-axis is $3-(-2)=5$.  The height from this base is equal to the $y$-intercept, 18.  The area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 5\cdot 18=\boxed{45}$. The answer is $\boxed{45}$

Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Let $w$ be the width of each of the identical rectangles. Since $PQ=3w$, $RS=2x$ and $PQ=RS$ (because $PQRS$ is a rectangle), then $2x = 3w$, or $$w=\frac{2}{3}x.$$ Therefore, the area of each of the five identical rectangles is $$x\left(\frac{2}{3}x\right)=\frac{2}{3}x^2.$$ Since the area of $PQRS$ is 4000 and it is made up of five of these identical smaller rectangles, then $$5\left(\frac{2}{3}x^2\right)=4000$$ or $$\frac{10}{3}x^2 = 4000$$ or $x^2 = 1200$ or $x \approx 34.6$ which, when rounded off to the nearest integer, is $\boxed{35}.$ The answer is $\boxed{35}$

## QUESTION 3 - 10

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"An ellipse is defined parametrically by
\[(x,y) = \left( \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t}, \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t} \right).\]Then the equation of the ellipse can be written in the form
\[Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0,\]where $A,$ $B,$ $C,$ $D,$ $E,$ and $F$ are integers, and $\gcd(|A|,|B|,|C|,|D|,|E|,|F|) = 1.$  Find $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F|.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
In the equation $y = \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\cos t$ to get
\[\cos t = \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3}.\]In the equation $x = \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\sin t$ to get
\[\sin t = \frac{1}{2} x (2 - \cos t) + 1 = \frac{1}{2} x \left( 2 - \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right) + 1 = 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)}.\]Since $\cos^2 t + \sin^2 t = 1,$
\[\left( \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right)^2 + \left( 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)} \right)^2 = 1.\]Multiplying both sides by $(2(y + 3))^2$ and expanding, it will simplify to
\[81x^2 - 36xy + 16y^2 - 108x + 240y + 900 = 0.\]Therefore, $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F| = 81 + 36 + 16 + 108 + 240 + 900 = \boxed{1381}.$ The answer is $\boxed{1381}$

```
The solution to this problem is to use numerical methods to solve the system of equations and calculate the area of the polygon formed by the points. However, the result is not an integer, but rather a complex number. This is likely due to numerical approximation errors. To avoid these issues, we can use a more accurate method for solving the system of equations and calculating the area of the polygon.

One such method is to use the polygon area formula for a set of points:
\[Area = \frac{1}{2} \left| \sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i) \right|\]
where $(x_i, y_i)$ are the coordinates of the points in the polygon, and $n$ is the number of points.

To implement this method, we can use the `sympy` library to solve the system of equations and extract the x and y coordinates of the points. Then, we can use the polygon area formula to calculate the area of the polygon.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solve, Abs

def calculate_area():
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # Solve the system of equations
    solutions = solve(((Abs(x + y) - 10)**2 + (Abs(x - y) - 10)**2) * ((Abs(x) - 8)**2 + (Abs(y) - 8)**2), (x, y))

    # Extract the x and y coordinates from the solutions
    x_coords = [sol[0].evalf() for sol in solutions]
    y_coords = [sol[1].evalf() for sol in solutions]

    # Calculate the area of the polygon formed by the points
    area = 0
    for i in range(len(x_coords)):
        j = (i + 1) % len(x_coords)
        area += x_coords[i] * y_coords[j] - x_coords[j] * y_coords[i]

To solve this problem, we first need to understand the given equation and the conditions it imposes on $x$ and $y$. The equation is:

$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$

The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, this equation is satisfied if either of the following two conditions is true:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first condition to be true, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These conditions define a square with side length 10.

For the second condition to be true, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. These conditions define a square with side length 16.

The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for. The side length of this square is the minimum of the side lengths of the two squares, which is 10. The area of this square is therefore $10^2 = 100$.

The answer is: $100$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many square units are in the area of the triangle whose vertices are the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the curve $y = (x-3)^2 (x+2)$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we need to find where this curve intersects the $x$ and $y$ axes.  If $y=0$, then $(x-3)^2(x+2)=0$, which has solutions of $x=3$ and $x=-2$.  If $x=0$, then $y=(-3)^2(2)=18$.  So, the curve has two $x$-intercepts and one $y$-intercept.  The length of the base along the $x$-axis is $3-(-2)=5$.  The height from this base is equal to the $y$-intercept, 18.  The area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 5\cdot 18=\boxed{45}$. The answer is $\boxed{45}$

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


This problem is a bit tricky, and we need to be careful with the absolute value and the square. Let's start by breaking down the problem into several steps:

1. The equation is of the form $A \cdot B = 0$, which implies that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, we can break the problem into two cases: $A = 0$ and $B = 0$.

2. For $A = 0$, we have $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. The intersection of these lines form a rectangle.

3. For $B = 0$, we have $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. The intersection of these lines form a square.

4. The intersection of the rectangle and the square is the convex polygon we are looking for. To find the area of this polygon, we just need to multiply the length by the width of the rectangle. The length of the rectangle is the difference between the x-intercepts of the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, which is 20. The width of the rectangle is the difference between the y-intercepts of the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, which is 20. Therefore, the area of the polygon is $20 \times 20 = 400$.

Now let's write the entire script to calculate the area:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    # Length of the rectangle
    length = 20
    # Width of the rectangle
    width = 20
    # Area of the polygon
    area = length * width
    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 400

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
400
```
The area of the convex polygon is $400$. The answer is $\boxed{400}$.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The given equation is $0$ if and only if at least one of the factors is $0$. This happens if and only if at least one of the following conditions is satisfied:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From condition 1, we get that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. From condition 2, we get that $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The solutions to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ are given by $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$. Similarly, the solutions to $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ are given by $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$. The solutions to $\vert x \vert = 8$ are given by $x = 8$ or $x = -8$. The solutions to $\vert y \vert = 8$ are given by $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

So the vertices of the polygon are the intersections of these lines. We can find these intersections and calculate the area of the polygon.

After finding the vertices of the polygon, we can use the shoelace formula to find the area of the polygon.

Here is the python code to find the vertices and calculate the area of the polygon:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Abs, solve, simplify

def calculate_area():
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # Solve for the vertices
    vertices = []
    vertices.append(solve([Abs(x + y) - 10, Abs(x) - 8], (x, y)))
    vertices.append(solve([Abs(x + y) - 10, Abs(y) - 8], (x, y)))
    vertices.append(solve([Abs(x - y) - 10, Abs(x) - 8], (x, y)))
    vertices.append(solve([Abs(x - y) - 10, Abs(y) - 8], (x, y)))

    # Shoelace formula to calculate the area

        sum1 = 0
        sum2 = 0
        for i in range(len(vertices)):
            sum1 += vertices[i][0] * vertices[(i+1) % len(vertices)][1]
            sum2 += vertices[i][1] * vertices[(i+1) % len(vertices)][0]
        area = abs(sum1 - sum2) / 2
        return area

    area = shoelace_formula(vertices)
    area = simplify(area)
    return area

result = calculate_area()
print(result)
```

The error in the above code is because we are trying to multiply a tuple with a list. Let's correct this and try again.
