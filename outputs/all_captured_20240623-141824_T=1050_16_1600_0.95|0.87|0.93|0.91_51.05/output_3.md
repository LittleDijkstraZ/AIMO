Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The points $(x, y)$ satisfying the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ encloses a convex polygon. This means that either one of the two terms in the product must be zero for any point $(x, y)$ inside the polygon.

2. Let's solve the equation step by step:

   a. If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = \pm 10$. These are two lines in the plane.

   b. If $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x - y = \pm 10$. These are also two lines in the plane.

   c. If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$, which implies $x = \pm 8$. These are two lines in the plane.

   d. If $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $y = \pm 8$. These are two lines in the plane.

3. The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 10, because the distance between $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$ is 20, and the distance from the center of the square to each side is 5 (half of the distance between the parallel lines). The same reasoning applies to the other pairs of parallel lines.

4. The area of this square is side length squared, which is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units.
The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation given in the problem is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. For the product of two factors to be zero, either the first factor is zero or the second factor is zero. Thus, we have two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these two equations are all points $(x, y)$ that are at a distance of 10 from the origin (0,0) in the x-y plane. This gives us a square with side length 20 and area $400$.

2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these two equations are all points $(x, y)$ that are at a distance of 8 from the origin (0,0) in the x-y plane. This gives us a square with side length 16 and area $256$.

However, since the first case (a square with side length 20 and area $400$) includes the second case (a square with side length 16 and area $256$) as a subset, the area of the convex polygon is simply the area of the first case, which is $400$.

So the area of the convex polygon is $400$. The answer is: $400$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



We are given a mathematical expression and asked to find the area of the polygon enclosed by the points that satisfy this expression.

The expression is: $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

A product of two terms equals zero if and only if at least one of the terms is zero. Therefore, either $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$ or $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

If $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations we get that the points $(x, y)$ are in one of the four lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, or $x - y = -10$.

If $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations we get that the points $(x, y)$ are in one of the four lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, or $y = -8$.

The intersection of these four lines is a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points that satisfy the given expression is 256.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    # The side length of the square is 16
    side_length = 16
    # The area of the square is side_length^2
    area = side_length**2
    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is $\boxed{256}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We have two absolute value functions and two quadratic equations. The product of two numbers equals zero if and only if at least one of the numbers equals zero. This gives us two possibilities:

   a) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
   b) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

2. For $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on a square with side length 20.

3. For $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on a square with side length 16.

4. The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for. The area of the convex polygon is the area of the smaller square, which is $16^2 = 256$.

5. Since we already calculated the area, we can output it as our final result.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$.

We are given the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So, we have two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the first polygon as $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, and $(-5,-5)$.

For the second case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the second polygon as $(8,0)$, $(0,8)$, $(-8,0)$, and $(0,-8)$.

The convex polygon enclosed by the points satisfying the equation is the intersection of the two polygons. This intersection is a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $AB = 0$ implies that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Hence the points that satisfy the equation are the union of the points that satisfy $A = 0$ and the points that satisfy $B = 0$.

The points that satisfy $A = (\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ are precisely the points such that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives the vertices of a square with side length 20.

The points that satisfy $B = (\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ are precisely the points such that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives the vertices of a square with side length 16.

Hence, the points that satisfy the original equation are the union of the points that satisfy $A = 0$ and the points that satisfy $B = 0$. This means that the points that satisfy the original equation are the points that lie in the union of the two squares.

The area of the square with side length 20 is $20^2 = 400$, and the area of the square with side length 16 is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $400 + 256 = 656$.

To confirm, we can check that this answer is a positive integer, which it is. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 656. The answer is: $656$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The problem statement gives us the equation:
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]

2. The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Thus, the equation is satisfied if either:
   \[(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad (\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0.\]

3. Each of these equations implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of four lines in the plane. The solutions of these equations form a square with side length 16.

4. To find the area of the square, we simply square the length of one of its sides. The length of a side is 16, so the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units.

Since 256 is a positive integer, the answer is correct. The answer is: $256$.
