**Problem:** 
"For certain ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ of real numbers, the system of equations
\[\begin{aligned} ax+by&=1 \\ x^2 + y^2 &= 50  \end{aligned}\]has at least one solution, and each solution is an ordered pair $(x,y)\,$ of integers. How many such ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ are there?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The graph of $ax+by=1$ is a line, while the graph of $x^2+y^2=50$ is a circle centered at the origin. Therefore, $(a, b)$ satisfies the conditions if and only if the line and circle intersect at least once, and they intersect only at lattice points (points with integer coordinates).

Knowing this, it makes sense to look for lattice points on the circle whose equation is $x^2+y^2=50$. Testing cases, we find that there are twelve lattice points on the circle: $(\pm 1, \pm 7)$, $(\pm 7, \pm 1)$, and $(\pm 5, \pm 5)$ (where the two $\pm$ signs in each pair are independent of each other).

There are $\tbinom{12}{2} = 66$ pairs of these points, and each pair determines a line. However, the graph of $ax+by=1$ can never pass through the origin $(0, 0)$, since if $x=y=0$, then $ax+by=0 \neq 1$. Therefore, the six pairs which consist of diametrically opposed points are invalid, since the line through them passes through the origin. This corrects our count to $66 - 6 = 60$.

In addition, for each of the twelve points, there is a line tangent to the circle at that point, so that the only solution to the system is that one point. This brings the final total to $60 + 12 = \boxed{72}$. The answer is $\boxed{72}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solve, Eq, Abs

def count_solutions():
    """For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"""
    x = symbols('x')
    m = symbols('m', integer=True)

    # List to store the values of m for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions
    values_of_m = []

    # Loop through possible values of m
    for m_value in range(1, 101):
        # Check if the equation | |x - 1| - 2| = m/100 has 4 distinct solutions
        equation = Eq(Abs(Abs(x - 1) - 2), m_value / 100)
        solutions = solve(equation, x)
        if len(solutions) == 4:
            values_of_m.append(m_value)

    return len(values_of_m)

result = count_solutions()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 100

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
100
```
The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions is 100. Thus, the answer is $\boxed{100}$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many integers are solutions to the equation $$(x-2)^{(25-x^2)}=1?$$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
We need some basic facts from number theory: $a^0 = 1$ for any $a,$ $1^b = 1$ for any $b,$ and $(-1)^c = 1$ if $c$ is an even integer. Unless the base is a complex number (which is excluded since we are looking for integer solutions), there are no other ways to get an RHS of $1.$ Thus, either the exponent is zero $($giving the equation $25 - x^2 = 0),$ the base is $1$ $($giving $x -2 = 1),$ or the base is $-1$ and the exponent is even $($giving the simultaneous equations $x - 2 = -1$ and $25 - x^2 = 2n$ for some integer $n).$ Solving the first equation gives $x = \pm 5,$ and solving the second gives $x = 3.$ The third equation implies that $x = 1,$ in which case $25 - x^2 = 24$ is indeed even, so $x = 1$ is a valid solution. In all, there are $\boxed{4}$ integer solutions. The answer is $\boxed{4}$

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we will first define a function that calculates the number of distinct solutions for a given value of $m$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Abs, solveset, S

def num_solutions(m):
    x = symbols('x')
    equation = Abs(Abs(x - 1) - 2) - m / 100
    solutions = solveset(equation, x, domain=S.Reals)
    return len(solutions)

m_values = [i for i in range(1, 101)]
num_solutions_count = [num_solutions(m) for m in m_values]

result = [i for i, count in enumerate(num_solutions_count, start=1) if count == 4]
print(result)
```

```

The list `result` contains all the values of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions. The problem asks for the number of such values of $m$.

To find the number of such values, we can simply count the elements in the list `result`.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

number_of_solutions = len(result)
print(number_of_solutions)
```

CODE RESULTS 100

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
100
```

The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 100. The answer is $\boxed{100}$.
