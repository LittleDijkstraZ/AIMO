Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has $4$ distinct solutions means that $\frac{m}{100}$ is the "distance" that the graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ moves from its original position.

The graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ consists of two "V"s placed side by side, each of which has its lowest point at $(1, 2)$. The distance between the two "V"s is $4$ (from $2 - \frac{m}{100}$ to $2 + \frac{m}{100}$).

For $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ to have $4$ distinct solutions, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be strictly less than $2$ (otherwise it would only have $2$ solutions at the lowest point of the "V"), and $\frac{m}{100}$ must be strictly greater than $0$ (otherwise the left hand side of the equation would always be positive, and there would be no negative values, thus only $2$ solutions). Therefore, $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$.

Multiplying all sides of the inequalities by $100$, we get $0 < m < 200$. The positive integers that satisfy this inequality are the integers from $1$ to $199$. However, the question asks for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation has $4$ distinct solutions, i.e., the integers from $1$ to $199$ excluding $0$ and $200$, since $\frac{m}{100}$ cannot be equal to $0$ or $200$.

There are $199 - 1 = 198$ positive integers from $1$ to $199$ excluding $0$ and $200$. 

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the equation is $198$. The answer is: $198$.

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions means that $\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal to 2. This is because the function $||\cdot|-\cdot|$ will only give 4 distinct solutions when the right hand side is equal to 2. Therefore, we must have $\frac{m}{100}=2$ which gives $m=200$.
So the only value of $m$ that works is $200$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition is 1.
The value of the unknown variable $m$ is 200.
The value of $m$ is $\boxed{200}$. The answer is: $1$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To solve this problem, we need to first understand how the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have 4 distinct solutions. 

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is equivalent to two cases: 

1. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ or 
2. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$. 

Solving these two equations gives us the solutions of the original equation. 

For the first equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, adding 2 to both sides gives $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. 

This equation will have 2 solutions if $2 + \frac{m}{100} > 0$. 

Similarly, for the second equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$, adding 2 to both sides gives $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. 

This equation will have 2 solutions if $2 - \frac{m}{100} > 0$. 

Therefore, the original equation will have 4 distinct solutions if the conditions $2 + \frac{m}{100} > 0$ and $2 - \frac{m}{100} > 0$ are both satisfied, which simplifies to $0 < m < 200$.

The positive integers $m$ satisfying this condition are the integers from 1 to 199. However, $m$ cannot be 0 or any integer greater than 200 because then the equations $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$ would not have solutions.

So the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition is the number of integers from 1 to 199, which is 199. However, we are asked to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. We have found that this happens for all positive integers $m$ from 1 to 199. 

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 199. The answer is: $199$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To solve the problem, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions.
First, let's consider the inside of the absolute value $| |x-1| - 2 |$. This expression will equal $\frac{m}{100}$ for four distinct values of $x$ if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is between $0$ and $2$. This is because the function $| |x-1| - 2 |$ is a piecewise function with three segments, each of which is a shifted and scaled absolute value function. Therefore, it will equal a given value for two values of $x$ in each segment. Hence, the interval $(0, 2)$ corresponds to four distinct solutions. This gives us the inequality $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$.
Simplifying this inequality, we get $0 < m < 200$.
Since $m$ is a positive integer, the possible values of $m$ are the integers from $1$ to $199$.
Now we need to count the number of these integers. The integers from $1$ to $199$ inclusive is an arithmetic sequence with first term $1$, last term $199$, and common difference $1$. The number of terms in an arithmetic sequence is given by the formula $n = \frac{l - a}{d} + 1$, where $a$ is the first term, $l$ is the last term, and $d$ is the common difference. Substituting the given values into this formula, we get $n = \frac{199 - 1}{1} + 1 = 199$.
Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions is $199$. The answer is: $199$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



In the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$, the right-hand side, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be positive. That means $m$ must be a positive integer. 

The equation has 4 distinct solutions, which means there must be a value of $m$ such that the expression $| |x - 1| - 2|$ takes on that value of $\frac{m}{100}$ four times. 

To make $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ equal to 4 distinct values, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be greater than 2. That's because $| |x - 1| - 2|$ is always between 0 and 4, and if $\frac{m}{100}$ is less than 2, it wouldn't be able to accommodate four distinct values.

So, $m > 200$.

However, $m$ must also be less than 600, because that's when $| |x - 1| - 2|$ would only equal $\frac{m}{100}$ once. (For example, if $m = 600$, then $| |x - 1| - 2| = 6$, which would only occur once for $x = 7$, or once for $x = -5$. But we want four distinct solutions.)

So, $200 < m < 600$.

The only positive integer in this range that makes $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ equal to 4 distinct values is $m = 400$.

Therefore, there is only one such value of $m$, and the answer is 1. The answer is: $1$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$.

This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ oscillates between 0 and 4, and only when $\frac{m}{100} = 2$ does it have exactly 4 distinct solutions.

So, we solve the equation $\frac{m}{100} = 2$ to find the value of $m$.

Multiplying both sides of the equation by 100 gives $m = 200$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 1, since $m = 200$ is the only solution. The answer is: $1$.
