Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, let's look at the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.

This equation can be simplified using the property $|a-b| = |b-a|$. We can rewrite the equation as:

$|x-2y| + |2x-y| = 40$.

Now, let's consider the two cases:

Case 1: $x - 2y \geq 0$ and $2x - y \geq 0$. This gives us the equation $x - 2y + 2x - y = 40$, or $3x - 3y = 40$, which simplifies to $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$.

Case 2: $x - 2y < 0$ and $2x - y < 0$. This gives us the equation $-(x - 2y) - (2x - y) = 40$, or $-x + 2y - 2x + y = 40$, which simplifies to $-3x + 3y = 40$, or $x - y = -\frac{40}{3}$.

However, both cases result in the same equation $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$. 

Now, let's substitute $y = x - \frac{40}{3}$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:

$5x^2 + 5\left(x - \frac{40}{3}\right)^2 - 8x\left(x - \frac{40}{3}\right)$.

Simplify the expression:

$5x^2 + 5\left(x^2 - \frac{80}{3}x + \frac{1600}{9}\right) - 8x^2 + \frac{320}{3}x$.

$= 5x^2 + 5x^2 - \frac{400}{3}x + \frac{1600}{9} - 8x^2 + \frac{320}{3}x$.

$= -3x^2 + \frac{40}{3}x + \frac{1600}{9}$.

Let $f(x) = -3x^2 + \frac{40}{3}x + \frac{1600}{9}$. We want to find the minimum value of $f(x)$.

To find the minimum of $f(x)$, we can find its derivative and set it equal to zero. The derivative of $f(x)$ is $f'(x) = -6x + \frac{40}{3}$. Setting this equal to zero gives $-6x + \frac{40}{3} = 0$, or $x = \frac{20}{9}$.

Substitute $x = \frac{20}{9}$ into $y = x - \frac{40}{3}$ to get $y = \frac{20}{9} - \frac{40}{3} = -\frac{20}{9}$.

Finally, substitute $x = \frac{20}{9}$ and $y = -\frac{20}{9}$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to get:

$5\left(\frac{20}{9}\right)^2 + 5\left(-\frac{20}{9}\right)^2 - 8\left(\frac{20}{9}\right)\left(-\frac{20}{9}\right)$.

$= \frac{200}{9} + \frac{200}{9} + \frac{3200}{81}$.

$= \frac{400}{9} + \frac{3200}{81}$.

$= \frac{400 \cdot 9 + 3200}{81}$.

$= \frac{3600 + 3200}{81}$.

$= \frac{6800}{81}$.

So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\frac{6800}{81}$. The answer is: $\boxed{\frac{6800}{81}}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's consider the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, we know that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |(x-2y) - (y-2x)| = |x-2y-y+2x| = |3x-3y| = 3|x-y| = 40$.
So $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$.
Now let's consider the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.
We can rewrite it as $5(x^2+y^2)-8xy$.
By the identity $(x-y)^2 = x^2 - 2xy + y^2$, we have $x^2 + y^2 - 2xy = (x-y)^2$.
So $5(x^2+y^2)-8xy = 5[(x-y)^2 + 2xy] - 8xy = 5(x-y)^2 + 2xy = 5\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 + 2xy$.
To minimize this expression, we need to minimize the value of $xy$.
By the AM-GM inequality, we know that $2xy \geq -2\left(\frac{x-y}{2}\right)^2 = -\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2$.
Equality occurs when $x=y$, so the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $5\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{1600}{3}$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\frac{1600}{3}$.
The answer is: $\frac{1600}{3}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, we notice that the expression we want to minimize is a quadratic form, and we can complete the square to make it easier to find the minimum value. 

The given expression can be rewritten as $5(x^2-y^2)-8xy=5[(x-y)(x+y)]-8xy$. Let $u=x-y$ and $v=x+y$, then the expression becomes $5uv-8\frac{u^2+v^2}{2}=5uv-4(u^2+v^2)$. 

To minimize this expression, we can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, which states that for any real numbers $a_1, a_2, b_1, b_2$, we have $(a_1^2 + a_2^2)(b_1^2 + b_2^2) \geq (a_1b_1 + a_2b_2)^2$. 

Applying the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to the terms $u^2$ and $v^2$, we get $(u^2 + v^2)(1^2 + 1^2) \geq (u*1 + v*1)^2 = (u + v)^2$. Simplifying, we get $2(u^2 + v^2) \geq (u + v)^2$.

Therefore, $5uv - 4(u^2 + v^2) \leq 5uv - 2(u + v)^2$. 

Now, we need to minimize $5uv - 2(u + v)^2$. 

Setting the derivative of this expression with respect to $u$ and $v$ to zero, we find that the minimum occurs when $u = v$. 

Substituting $u = v = x - y = x + y$, we get $2x = 2y$, so $x = y$. 

Then, we can substitute $x = y$ into the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we get $|x-2x| + |x-2x| = 40$, which simplifies to $|-x| + |-x| = 40$, and further simplifies to $2|x| = 40$. Solving for $x$, we get $|x| = 20$, so $x = \pm 20$. 

Taking $x = 20$, we find $y = 20$ as well, and the minimum value of the expression is $5(20)(20) - 8(20)(20) = 2000 - 3200 = -1200$. 

However, this is not the minimum value of the expression over all real numbers $x$ and $y$. Taking $x = -20$ and $y = -20$, we find that the minimum value of the expression is also $-1200$. 

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $-1200$. The answer is: $-1200$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To begin with, let's denote $a=x-2y$ and $b=y-2x$. The given condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is equivalent to $|a| + |b| = 40$. We can rewrite $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $\frac{1}{2}(9(x-2y)^2 + 9(y-2x)^2) - \frac{1}{2}( (x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2)$. Denote $A = (x-2y)^2$ and $B = (y-2x)^2$, we can rewrite this as $\frac{1}{2}(9A+9B) - \frac{1}{2}(A+B) = 4A+4B$.
Now, we know that $|a| + |b| = 40$ is equivalent to $\sqrt{A} + \sqrt{B} = 40$.
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have $(\sqrt{A} + \sqrt{B})^2 \leq 2(A+B)$, so $40^2 \leq 2(A+B)$, which implies $A+B \geq 400$. Therefore, $4A+4B \geq 4*400 = 1600$. The minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $1600/2 = 800$. The answer is: $800$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, let's consider the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
This can be rewritten as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$, and then $|x-2y| - |2y-x| = 0$.
By the triangle inequality, $|a|-|b| \leq |a-b|$, so equality occurs when $a$ and $b$ have the same sign.
Therefore, $x-2y$ and $2y-x$ must have the same sign.
This means that either $x-2y$ and $2y-x$ are both nonnegative or both nonpositive.
If $x-2y$ and $2y-x$ are both nonnegative, then $x-2y = 2y-x$, so $x=2y$.
If $x-2y$ and $2y-x$ are both nonpositive, then $-(x-2y) = -(2y-x)$, so $x=2y$.
In both cases, we have $x=2y$.
Now we substitute $x=2y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
\begin{align*}
5x^2+5y^2-8xy &= 5(2y)^2 + 5y^2 - 8(2y)y \\
&= 20y^2 + 5y^2 - 16y^2 \\
&= 9y^2.
\end{align*}
Now we need to find the minimum value of $9y^2$ subject to the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
Substituting $x=2y$, we have $|2y-2y| + |y-4y| = 40$, which simplifies to $|0| + |-3y| = 40$.
This gives $|3y| = 40$, so $3|y| = 40$, and $|y| = \frac{40}{3}$.
Since we want the minimum value of $9y^2$, we want to minimize $y^2$.
The minimum value of $y^2$ occurs when $y = -\frac{40}{3}$ or $y = \frac{40}{3}$,
and in either case, $y^2 = \left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{1600}{9}$.
Finally, we substitute $y^2 = \frac{1600}{9}$ into $9y^2$ to get $9\left(\frac{1600}{9}\right) = 1600$.
Thus, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $1600$. The answer is: $1600$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we observe that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be simplified to $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$,
which further simplifies to $|x-2y| + |- (x-2y)| = 40$.
This is equivalent to $|x-2y| + |x-2y| = 40$, or $2|x-2y| = 40$.
So $|x-2y| = 20$.
Next, we consider the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.
We can rewrite this as $(5x^2-8xy+5y^2)$.
Notice that we can factor this expression as $(5x^2-10xy+5y^2) + (-2xy)$,
or $(5(x^2-2xy+y^2)) - 2xy$,
or $5(x-y)^2 - 2xy$.
Now, we want to find the minimum value of this expression.
Using the inequality $(x-y)^2 \geq 0$, we have $5(x-y)^2 \geq 0$.
So the minimum value of $5(x-y)^2$ is 0.
To find the minimum value of $-2xy$, we need to find the maximum value of $xy$.
Using the condition $|x-2y| = 20$, we have $(x-2y)^2 = 400$, or $x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2 = 400$.
Also, $x^2 + 2xy + y^2 = (x+y)^2$.
So $(x+y)^2 - 6xy = 400$.
We want to maximize $xy$.
Notice that $(x+y)^2 \geq 0$, so $6xy \leq 400$, or $xy \leq \frac{400}{6} = \frac{200}{3}$.
Therefore, the maximum value of $xy$ is $\frac{200}{3}$.
So the minimum value of $-2xy$ is $-2\cdot \frac{200}{3} = -\frac{400}{3}$.
Finally, combining the results, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $5 \cdot 0 - \frac{400}{3} = -\frac{400}{3}$.
The answer is: $-\frac{400}{3}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, we simplify the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as follows:
$$5x^2+5y^2-8xy = \frac{1}{2}((5x^2-8xy+8y^2) + (5y^2-8xy+5x^2))$$
$$ = \frac{1}{2}((5x^2-8xy+8y^2) + (5y^2-8yx+5x^2))$$
$$ = \frac{1}{2}((5x^2-8xy+8y^2) + (5x^2-8xy+5y^2))$$
$$ = \frac{1}{2}(10x^2-16xy+13y^2)$$
$$ = 5x^2-8xy+\frac{13}{2}y^2.$$

Now, let's consider the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. We can rewrite it as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$. By the triangle inequality, we know that $|a| + |b| \ge |a+b|$, so
$$|x-2y| + |2y-x| \ge |(x-2y) + (2y-x)| = |0| = 0.$$
Since the left side of the equation is greater than or equal to 0, the right side must also be greater than or equal to 0. This means that $40 \ge 0$, which is true. Therefore, the equation is always true for all real numbers $x$ and $y$.

Now, let's use the AM-GM inequality (Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean inequality) on the expression $5x^2-8xy+\frac{13}{2}y^2$. The AM-GM inequality states that for non-negative real numbers $a$ and $b$, $(a+b)/2 \ge \sqrt{ab}$. Applying the AM-GM inequality to $5x^2-8xy+\frac{13}{2}y^2$, we have:
$$\frac{1}{2}(10x^2-16xy+13y^2) \ge \sqrt{(10x^2-16xy+13y^2) \cdot 1 \cdot 1}$$
$$ = \sqrt{10x^2-16xy+13y^2}.$$
Taking the square of both sides, we get:
$$5x^2-8xy+\frac{13}{2}y^2 \ge 10x^2-16xy+13y^2.$$
Equality holds when $5x^2-8xy+\frac{13}{2}y^2 = 10x^2-16xy+13y^2$, or when $5x^2-8xy+\frac{13}{2}y^2 - (10x^2-16xy+13y^2) = 0$. Simplifying the left side, we get:
$$5x^2-8xy+\frac{13}{2}y^2 - 10x^2+16xy-13y^2 = 0$$
$$-5x^2+8xy-\frac{1}{2}y^2 = 0$$
$$-5(x^2-1.6xy+0.1y^2) = 0$$
$$-5(x-0.8y)^2 = 0$$
From this, we can see that equality holds when $x = 0.8y$. Now, substituting $x = 0.8y$ into the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we get:
$$|0.8y-2y| + |y-2(0.8y)| = 40$$
$$|-1.2y| + |-0.6y| = 40$$
$$1.2y + 0.6y = 40$$
$$1.8y = 40$$
$$y = \frac{40}{1.8} = \frac{200}{9}.$$
Substituting $y = \frac{200}{9}$ back into $x = 0.8y$, we get:
$$x = 0.8 \cdot \frac{200}{9} = \frac{160}{9}.$$
So, the minimum value of $5x^2-8xy+\frac{13}{2}y^2$ is achieved when $x = \frac{160}{9}$ and $y = \frac{200}{9}$. Substituting these values into $5x^2-8xy+\frac{13}{2}y^2$, we get:
$$5 \left(\frac{160}{9}\right)^2 - 8 \cdot \frac{160}{9} \cdot \frac{200}{9} + \frac{13}{2} \left(\frac{200}{9}\right)^2$$
$$ = \frac{128000}{81} - \frac{256000}{81} + \frac{260000}{81}$$
$$ = \frac{-128000 + 256000 + 260000}{81}$$
$$ = \frac{408000}{81}$$
$$ = 5040 \div 9$$
$$ = 560.$$
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2-8xy+\frac{13}{2}y^2$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 560. The answer is: 560.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's rewrite the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
Using the property $|a| + |b| = |a+b| + |a-b|$, we can simplify the equation to $|x-2y-y+2x| + |x-2y+y-2x| = 40$, which further simplifies to $|3x-3y| + |-x-y| = 40$.
This simplifies further to $3|x-y| + |x+y| = 40$.
Now, let's consider the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = (5x^2 - 8xy + 5y^2) = (5(x^2 - 2xy + y^2)) + (-8xy + 10xy) = (5(x-y)^2) + 2xy$.
We want to minimize this expression.
From the equation $3|x-y| + |x+y| = 40$, we can see that $3|x-y| \le 40$, so $|x-y| \le \frac{40}{3}$.
This means that $(x-y)^2 \le \frac{1600}{9}$.
Since $|x+y| \le 40$, we have $-40 \le x+y \le 40$.
Multiplying through by $2$, we get $-80 \le 2xy \le 80$.
Therefore, $5(x-y)^2 + 2xy \ge 5 \cdot 0 + (-80) = -80$.
Thus, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is $-80$.
The answer is: $-80$
