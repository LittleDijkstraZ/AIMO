Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.
The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, so $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
Solving the system of equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(8,8), (8,-8), (-8,8), (-8,-8)$.
This forms a square with side length 16. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units.
The answer is: $256$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $A \cdot B = 0$ implies that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This means that both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, so $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us four lines: $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This means that both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, so $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us four lines: $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

The intersection points of these lines are the vertices of the polygon. By plotting these lines on a coordinate plane, we find that the polygon is a square with side length 16. The area of the square is therefore $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The expression $A \cdot B = 0$ for two nonnegative expressions A and B implies either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore the given equation is equivalent to the following system of four equations:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies $|x+y| = 10$, or $x+y = 10$ or $x+y = -10$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies $|x-y| = 10$, or $x-y = 10$ or $x-y = -10$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies $|x| = 8$, or $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies $|y| = 8$, or $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

Plotting these 8 lines in the coordinate plane, we find that they form a rectangle with opposite corners at $(8,8)$ and $(-8,-8)$, and sides parallel to the axes.

Thus, the area of this rectangle is the product of its side lengths, or $(8 - (-8)) \times (8 - (-8)) = 16 \times 16 = \boxed{256}$.
The answer is: $256$
