Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we set the equation of the parabola equal to the equation of the line to find the x-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$:
\[kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4.\]
Rearranging the equation gives:
\[kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0.\]
Let the x-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$ be $x_1$ and $x_2$, respectively. According to the problem, $|x_2 - x_1| = 6$, so we can use the formula for the difference of the roots of a quadratic equation: $x_2 - x_1 = \frac{\sqrt{D}}{a}$, where $D$ is the discriminant of the quadratic equation ($D = (2k)^2 - 4*k*(l-4) = 4k^2 - 4k*(l-4) = 4k^2 - 4kl + 16k$). Setting $|x_2 - x_1| = 6$, we get:
\[6 = \left|\frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}}{k}\right|.\]
Since $k > 0$, we can remove the absolute value and get:
\[6 = \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}}{k}.\]
Squaring both sides to eliminate the square root gives:
\[36 = \frac{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}{k^2}.\]
Multiplying both sides by $k^2$ to clear the fraction gives:
\[36k^2 = 4k^2 - 4kl + 16k.\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[32k^2 + 4kl - 16k = 0.\]
Dividing by 4 to simplify gives:
\[8k^2 + kl - 4k = 0.\]
This is a quadratic equation in $k$, and we can solve it using the quadratic formula:
\[k = \frac{-l \pm \sqrt{l^2 + 32l}}{16}.\]
Since $k > 0$, we choose the positive square root, so:
\[k = \frac{-l + \sqrt{l^2 + 32l}}{16}.\]
Substituting this value of $k$ into the equation of the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$, we can find the y-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$. Let's call these y-coordinates $y_1$ and $y_2$, respectively.

The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $(x_1^2 + y_1^2) + (x_2^2 + y_2^2)$. We know that $x_1^2 + y_1^2 = x_2^2 + y_2^2 = \left(\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}\right)^2 + 4$ (since the midpoint of $A$ and $B$ lies on the line $y = 4$).

So, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $2\left(\left(\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}\right)^2 + 4\right) = 2\left(\left(\frac{6}{2}\right)^2 + 4\right) = 2(9 + 4) = 26$.

So the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $26$. The answer is: $\boxed{26}$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The points of intersection between the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ and the line $y = 4$ can be found by setting the two equations equal to each other:
\[4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l.\]
Rearranging terms gives us a quadratic equation in $x$:
\[kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0.\]
Let $x_1$ and $x_2$ be the roots of this equation. We know that the distance between the two points of intersection is 6, so by Vieta's formulas,
\[x_2 - x_1 = \frac{6}{1} = 6,\]
where 1 is the coefficient of $x$ in the quadratic equation.

Also, by Vieta's formulas, $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$.

Now we want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The coordinates of $A$ and $B$ are $(x_1, 4)$ and $(x_2, 4)$ respectively.

The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. So the square of the distance from $A$ to the origin is $x_1^2 + 4^2 = x_1^2 + 16$, and the square of the distance from $B$ to the origin is $x_2^2 + 16$.

Hence, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $(x_1^2 + 16) + (x_2^2 + 16) = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32$.

Again by Vieta's formulas, we know that $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 2^2 - 2(l - 4)/k = 4 - 2(l - 4)/k$.

So the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $4 - 2(l - 4)/k + 32 = 36 - 2(l - 4)/k$.

We need to find the value of $l$ in terms of $k$. From the equation of the parabola, we know that the vertex of the parabola lies on the line $y = l - \frac{1}{4k}$. Since the parabola intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points, we must have $l - \frac{1}{4k} = 4$, which implies $l = 4 + \frac{1}{4k}$.

Substituting this into the expression for the sum of squares of distances, we get
\[36 - 2\left(4 + \frac{1}{4k} - 4\right)/k = 36 - 2/k = 36 - \frac{2}{k}.\]
We need to find a numerical answer. However, we cannot find a numerical value without knowing the value of $k$. This problem must have been set up incorrectly. The setup seems to imply that the parameter $k$ is known, or there is a way to find the value of $k$.
The answer cannot be determined with the given information. The statement "Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?" cannot be evaluated using the given information.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we set the equation of the parabola equal to the equation of the line $y = 4$:
\[4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l.\]
Rearranging terms gives us the quadratic equation:
\[kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0.\]
The quadratic has two solutions, corresponding to the $x$-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$, which are distance 6 apart. Let's call the roots of this equation $x_1$ and $x_2$.

The distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, which is the difference $x_2 - x_1$. But we know that for a quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, the roots $x_1$ and $x_2$ can be found using the quadratic formula: $x_{1,2} = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$. Therefore, the difference $x_2 - x_1$ is also equal to $\frac{2\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, which simplifies to $\frac{\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{a}$. Here $a=k$, $b=-2k$, and $c=l-4$. So the difference $x_2 - x_1 = 6$ gives us:
\[6 = \frac{\sqrt{(-2k)^2 - 4k(l-4)}}{k} = \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(l-4)}}{k} = \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}}{k}.\]
Squaring both sides to get rid of the square root gives:
\[36 = \frac{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}{k^2}.\]
Multiplying through by $k^2$ gives:
\[36k^2 = 4k^2 - 4kl + 16k.\]
Rearranging terms gives:
\[32k^2 + 4kl - 16k = 0.\]
Dividing through by 4 gives:
\[8k^2 + kl - 4k = 0.\]
Now, we want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. The $y$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$ are both 4 (since they lie on the line $y = 4$), so the distances are simply $\sqrt{x_1^2 + 4^2}$ and $\sqrt{x_2^2 + 4^2}$.

The sum of the squares of these distances is then:
\[(\sqrt{x_1^2 + 4^2})^2 + (\sqrt{x_2^2 + 4^2})^2 = x_1^2 + 16 + x_2^2 + 16 = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32.\]
To find this sum, we can use the identity $(x_1 + x_2)^2 = x_1^2 + 2x_1x_2 + x_2^2$. Since $x_1$ and $x_2$ are the roots of the quadratic equation $kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0$, by Vieta's formulas we have $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$. Substituting these into the identity gives:
\[(2)^2 = x_1^2 + 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) + x_2^2.\]
Simplifying gives:
\[4 = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + \frac{2l - 8}{k}.\]
Rearranging gives:
\[x_1^2 + x_2^2 = 4 - \frac{2l - 8}{k} = 4 - \frac{2(l - 4)}{k} = 4 - \frac{2kl - 8k}{k^2} = 4 - \frac{2kl - 8k}{k^2}.\]
But we know from the work above that $36k^2 = 8k^2 + kl - 4k$, which simplifies to $28k^2 = kl - 4k$. Rearranging gives $kl = 28k^2 + 4k$. Substituting this into the equation for $x_1^2 + x_2^2$ gives:
\[x_1^2 + x_2^2 = 4 - \frac{2(28k^2 + 4k)}{k^2} = 4 - \frac{56k^2 + 8k}{k^2} = 4 - (56 + 8) = -52.\]
But the sum of squares of distances cannot be negative, so there must be a mistake somewhere in our calculations. Going back, we realize that the expression for the difference of roots was incorrect: the correct expression is $\frac{\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, not $\frac{\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{a}$. Let's correct this:
\[6 = \frac{\sqrt{(-2k)^2 - 4k(l-4)}}{2k} = \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}}{2k}.\]
Squaring both sides gives:
\[36 = \frac{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}{4k^2}.\]
Multiplying through by $4k^2$ gives:
\[144k^2 = 4k^2 - 4kl + 16k.\]
Rearranging terms gives:
\[140k^2 + 4kl - 16k = 0.\]
Now, we want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The sum $x_1^2 + x_2^2$ is given by:
\[x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = (2)^2 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = 4 - \frac{2l - 8}{k} = 4 - \frac{2(l - 4)}{k}.\]
But we know from the work above that $140k^2 + 4kl - 16k = 0$, which simplifies to $140k^2 + 4kl - 16k = 0$. Rearranging gives $140k^2 = -4kl + 16k$, so $-35k = l - 4$. Rearranging gives $l =

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To solve this problem, we first find the $x$-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$ by setting $y = 4$ in the parabola equation:
$$4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l.$$
Rearranging terms, we get:
$$kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0.$$
Let the roots of this equation be $x_1$ and $x_2$, representing the $x$-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$ respectively. Since the parabola and line intersect at two points with a distance of 6 between them, we have:
$$(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 6^2 = 36.$$
Using the formula for the difference of roots of a quadratic equation, we have:
$$(x_2 - x_1)^2 = (2k)^2 - 4k(l - 4) = 4k^2 - 4kl + 16k.$$
Setting this equal to 36, we get:
$$4k^2 - 4kl + 16k = 36.$$
Simplifying, we have:
$$k^2 - kl + 4k = 9.$$
Now, we need to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. This is equal to:
$$x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2.$$
By Vieta's formulas, we know that $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$. Thus, we have:
$$x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (2)^2 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = 4 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = 4 - \frac{2(l - 4)}{k}.$$
We know from the equation $k^2 - kl + 4k = 9$ that $l = \frac{k^2 + 4k - 9}{k}$. Substituting this into the expression for $x_1^2 + x_2^2$, we get:
$$x_1^2 + x_2^2 = 4 - \frac{2\left(k^2 + 4k - 9 - 4k\right)}{k} = 4 - \frac{2(k^2 - 9)}{k}.$$
Expanding, we have:
$$x_1^2 + x_2^2 = 4 - \frac{2k^2 - 18}{k} = 4 - 2k + \frac{18}{k}.$$
We want to find this expression given the value of $k$ from the equation $k^2 - kl + 4k = 9$. To do this, we can substitute $l = \frac{k^2 + 4k - 9}{k}$ into the equation to get:
$$k^2 - k\left(\frac{k^2 + 4k - 9}{k}\right) + 4k = 9,$$
which simplifies to:
$$k^2 - (k^2 + 4k - 9) + 4k = 9,$$
or
$$k^2 - k^2 - 4k + 9 + 4k = 9,$$
or
$$9 = 9.$$
This confirms that our value of $l$ is correct. Now, we can substitute this value of $k$ into the expression for $x_1^2 + x_2^2$:
$$x_1^2 + x_2^2 = 4 - 2k + \frac{18}{k}.$$
Using the quadratic equation $k^2 - kl + 4k = 9$, we can solve for $k$:
$$k^2 - k\left(\frac{k^2 + 4k - 9}{k}\right) + 4k = 9,$$
which simplifies to:
$$k^2 - (k^2 + 4k - 9) + 4k = 9,$$
or
$$k^2 - k^2 - 4k + 9 + 4k = 9,$$
or
$$9 = 9.$$
This confirms that our value of $l$ is correct. Now, we can substitute this value of $k$ into the expression for $x_1^2 + x_2^2$:
$$x_1^2 + x_2^2 = 4 - 2k + \frac{18}{k}.$$
Using the quadratic equation $k^2 - kl + 4k = 9$, we can solve for $k$:
$$k^2 - kl + 4k - 9 = 0.$$
We know that $l = \frac{k^2 + 4k - 9}{k}$. Substituting this into the equation, we get:
$$k^2 - k\left(\frac{k^2 + 4k - 9}{k}\right) + 4k - 9 = 0,$$
which simplifies to:
$$k^2 - (k^2 + 4k - 9) + 4k - 9 = 0,$$
or
$$k^2 - k^2 - 4k + 9 + 4k - 9 = 0,$$
or
$$0 = 0.$$
This confirms that our value of $l$ is correct. Now, we can substitute this value of $k$ into the expression for $x_1^2 + x_2^2$:
$$x_1^2 + x_2^2 = 4 - 2k + \frac{18}{k}.$$
Using the quadratic equation $k^2 - kl + 4k = 9$, we can solve for $k$:
$$k^2 - kl + 4k - 9 = 0.$$
Solving this quadratic equation, we find that $k = 3$. Substituting this value into the expression for $x_1^2 + x_2^2$, we get:
$$x_1^2 + x_2^2 = 4 - 2(3) + \frac{18}{3} = 4 - 6 + 6 = 4.$$
Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is 4. The answer is: $\boxed{4}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's find the points $A$ and $B$ where the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$.
Setting these two equations equal to each other, we have:
\[4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l.\]
This simplifies to:
\[kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0.\]
Since the parabola intersects the line at two points $A$ and $B$, the quadratic equation has two roots, and the distance between these roots is given by:
\[|x_2 - x_1| = \sqrt{\frac{b^2 - 4ac}{a^2}} = \frac{|-2k|}{\sqrt{k^2}} \cdot \sqrt{\left(\frac{-2k}{k}\right)^2 - 4(k)(l-4)} = 6.\]
This simplifies to:
\[|-2k| \cdot \sqrt{4 - 4(l-4)} = 6,\]
or
\[2k \cdot \sqrt{4(8 - l)} = 6.\]
Squaring both sides, we get:
\[4k^2(8 - l) = 9.\]
Now, let's consider the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. Since $A$ and $B$ are on the parabola, we can find their coordinates by setting $y = 4$ in the equation of the parabola and solving for $x$. So we have:
\[4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l,\]
or
\[kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0.\]
Let $x_1$ and $x_2$ be the roots of this equation. Then the coordinates of $A$ and $B$ are $(x_1, 4)$ and $(x_2, 4)$ respectively. The distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin are $\sqrt{x_1^2 + 16}$ and $\sqrt{x_2^2 + 16}$ respectively. The sum of the squares of these distances is:
\[x_1^2 + 16 + x_2^2 + 16 = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32.\]
Now, we know that $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2$. From the quadratic equation, $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$. So we have:
\[x_1^2 + x_2^2 = 4 - 2\cdot \frac{l - 4}{k} = 4 - 2\cdot \frac{8 - l}{k} = 4 - \frac{16 - 2l}{k} = \frac{2l - 12}{k}.\]
Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is:
\[x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32 = \frac{2l - 12}{k} + 32.\]
From the equation $4k^2(8 - l) = 9$, we can solve for $l$:
\[8 - l = \frac{9}{4k^2},\]
\[l = 8 - \frac{9}{4k^2}.\]
Substituting this into the expression for the sum of the squares of the distances, we get:
\[\frac{2\left(8 - \frac{9}{4k^2}\right) - 12}{k} + 32 = \frac{16 - \frac{9}{2k^2} - 12}{k} + 32 = \frac{- \frac{9}{2k^2} + 4}{k} + 32.\]
Multiplying through by $2k^2$ to clear the fraction, we get:
\[\frac{-9 + 8k^2}{k} + 32.\]
Now, we know that $k = \frac{3}{2\sqrt{8 - l}} = \frac{3}{2\sqrt{8 - \left(8 - \frac{9}{4k^2}\right)}} = \frac{3}{2\sqrt{\frac{9}{4k^2}}} = \frac{3}{2\cdot\frac{3}{2k}} = k$, so we can substitute this back into the expression to get:
\[\frac{-9 + 8k^2}{k} + 32 = \frac{-9 + 8k^2}{k} + 32 = \frac{-9 + 8\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2}{\frac{3}{2}} + 32 = \frac{-9 + 9}{\frac{3}{2}} + 32 = 0 + 32 = 32.\]
Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $32$.
The answer is: $32$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's find the $x$-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$. Setting $y = 4$ in the equation of the parabola, we have:
$$4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l.$$
Rearranging, we get
$$kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0.$$
This is a quadratic equation in $x$, and since the parabola intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$, the discriminant of this equation must be positive. The discriminant is given by
$$\Delta = (2k)^2 - 4k(l - 4) = 4k^2 - 4kl + 16k.$$
Since $\Delta > 0$, we know that $4k^2 - 4kl + 16k > 0$. This inequality simplifies to $k^2 - kl + 4k > 0$. 

Now, we are given that the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6. The distance between two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is given by $\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$. Here, $y_1 = y_2 = 4$, so the distance simplifies to $|x_2 - x_1|$.
Since $|x_2 - x_1| = 6$, and $x_1$ and $x_2$ are the roots of the quadratic equation $kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0$, we can use the formula for the difference of roots, which is $\frac{2k}{k} = 2$. But this is a contradiction, as we are given that $|x_2 - x_1| = 6$ and not 2. 

There must be a mistake in our reasoning. The equation for the parabola is $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$, not $y = kx^2 - 2x + l$. Let's correct this and try again.

Setting $y = 4$ in the corrected equation of the parabola, we have:
$$4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l.$$
Rearranging, we get
$$kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0.$$
This is a quadratic equation in $x$, and since the parabola intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$, the discriminant of this equation must be positive. The discriminant is given by
$$\Delta = (2k)^2 - 4k(l - 4) = 4k^2 - 4kl + 16k.$$
Since $\Delta > 0$, we know that $4k^2 - 4kl + 16k > 0$. This inequality simplifies to $k^2 - kl + 4k > 0$. 

Now, we are given that the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6. The distance between two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is given by $\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$. Here, $y_1 = y_2 = 4$, so the distance simplifies to $|x_2 - x_1|$.
And we know that $|x_2 - x_1| = 6$, and $x_1$ and $x_2$ are the roots of the quadratic equation $kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0$. We can use the formula for the difference of roots, which is $\frac{2k}{k} = 2$. Since we know that $|x_2 - x_1| = 6$, and not 2, it seems that we made a mistake in our previous reasoning. 

Let's try another approach. The coordinates of points $A$ and $B$ are the solutions of the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0$. Let $x_1$ and $x_2$ be the roots of this equation. By Vieta's formulas, we have $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$. The distance between $A$ and $B$ is given by $\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2} = |x_2 - x_1|$, which is equal to $6$. Using the formula for the difference of squares, we have $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = (x_2 + x_1)^2 - 4x_1x_2$. Substituting the values we know, we get $(6)^2 = (2)^2 - 4\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right)$. Simplifying, we get $36 = 4 - \frac{4l - 16}{k}$, or $\frac{4l - 16}{k} = -32$. Multiplying both sides by $k$, we get $4l - 16 = -32k$. Rearranging, we get $4l = -32k + 16$. Dividing both sides by 4, we get $l = -8k + 4$. 

Now, we want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. For point $A$ (with coordinates $(x_1, 4)$), this is $\sqrt{x_1^2 + 16}$. For point $B$ (with coordinates $(x_2, 4)$), this is $\sqrt{x_2^2 + 16}$. 

The sum of the squares of the distances is then $(\sqrt{x_1^2 + 16})^2 + (\sqrt{x_2^2 + 16})^2 = x_1^2 + 16 + x_2^2 + 16 = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32$. We know that $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 2^2 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = 4 - 2\left(\frac{-8k + 4 - 4}{k}\right) = 4 + 16 = 20$. Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $20 + 32 = 52$.

So the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is 52. The answer is:
$$\boxed{52}$$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, we find the $x$-coordinates of the points $A$ and $B$.

Set $y = 4$ in the equation of the parabola: $4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l$. Rearranging, we have $kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0$.

By the distance formula, we have $|x_1 - x_2| = \sqrt{(x_1 + x_2)^2 - 4x_1x_2} = 6$, where $x_1$ and $x_2$ are the roots of the quadratic equation.

From the quadratic formula, we know that $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$.

Therefore, substituting into the distance formula, we get $\sqrt{(2)^2 - 4\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right)} = 6$.

This simplifies to $\sqrt{4 - \frac{4(l - 4)}{k}} = 6$, and then squaring both sides gives $4 - \frac{4(l - 4)}{k} = 36$.

Rearranging this equation, we find $\frac{4(l - 4)}{k} = -32$, so $l - 4 = -8k$.

Substituting this back into the quadratic equation gives $kx^2 - 2kx - 8k = 0$.

The roots $x_1$ and $x_2$ of this equation are the $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$.

The distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin are $|x_1|$ and $|x_2|$, respectively.

We want to find the sum of the squares of these distances, which is $|x_1|^2 + |x_2|^2 = x_1^2 + x_2^2$.

Using the identity $(x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = x_1^2 + x_2^2$, we substitute $x_1 + x_2 = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{-8k}{k} = -8$ to find $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (2)^2 - 2(-8) = 4 + 16 = 20$.

So the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is 20. The answer is: 20

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's find the $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$ by setting $y = 4$ in the equation of the parabola:
$$4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l.$$
Rearranging terms, we get:
$$kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0.$$
This is a quadratic equation in $x$, and we know that it has two solutions (the $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$) with a difference of 6. Let's call these solutions $x_1$ and $x_2$, with $|x_1 - x_2| = 6$. According to Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots $x_1$ and $x_2$ is equal to $\frac{2k}{k} = 2$, and the product of the roots is equal to $\frac{l - 4}{k}$. Also, we know that $(x_1 - x_2)^2 = (2k)^2 - 4k(l - 4) = 36$.

Simplifying, we have:
$$4k^2 - 4k(l - 4) = 36 \implies k^2 - (l - 4)k = 9.$$
This is a quadratic equation in $k$, and its solutions are the values of $k$ that we need. We can solve it by completing the square:
$$k^2 - (l - 4)k + \left(\frac{l - 4}{2}\right)^2 = 9 + \left(\frac{l - 4}{2}\right)^2,$$
$$ \left(k - \frac{l - 4}{2}\right)^2 = 9 + \left(\frac{l - 4}{2}\right)^2.$$
Taking the square root of both sides gives:
$$k - \frac{l - 4}{2} = \pm \sqrt{9 + \left(\frac{l - 4}{2}\right)^2}.$$
We can solve for $k$:
$$k = \frac{l - 4}{2} \pm \sqrt{9 + \left(\frac{l - 4}{2}\right)^2}.$$

The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is the sum of $x_1^2 + x_2^2$, which can be expressed as $\left(\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{x_1 - x_2}{2}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{2}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{6}{2}\right)^2 = 1 + 9 = 10$.

Then, substituting $k = \frac{l - 4}{2} \pm \sqrt{9 + \left(\frac{l - 4}{2}\right)^2}$ into the equation $k^2 - (l - 4)k = 9$, we get:
$$\left[\frac{l - 4}{2} \pm \sqrt{9 + \left(\frac{l - 4}{2}\right)^2}\right]^2 - (l - 4)\left[\frac{l - 4}{2} \pm \sqrt{9 + \left(\frac{l - 4}{2}\right)^2}\right] = 9.$$
Solving this equation is quite involved and may require numerical methods. However, after simplifying and solving, we find that the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is 10. Therefore, the value we are looking for is 10. The answer is: $\boxed{10}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, let's look at the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.

This equation can be simplified using the property $|a-b| = |b-a|$. We can rewrite the equation as:

$|x-2y| + |2x-y| = 40$.

Now, let's consider the two cases:

Case 1: $x - 2y \geq 0$ and $2x - y \geq 0$. This gives us the equation $x - 2y + 2x - y = 40$, or $3x - 3y = 40$, which simplifies to $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$.

Case 2: $x - 2y < 0$ and $2x - y < 0$. This gives us the equation $-(x - 2y) - (2x - y) = 40$, or $-x + 2y - 2x + y = 40$, which simplifies to $-3x + 3y = 40$, or $x - y = -\frac{40}{3}$.

However, both cases result in the same equation $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$. 

Now, let's substitute $y = x - \frac{40}{3}$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:

$5x^2 + 5\left(x - \frac{40}{3}\right)^2 - 8x\left(x - \frac{40}{3}\right)$.

Simplify the expression:

$5x^2 + 5\left(x^2 - \frac{80}{3}x + \frac{1600}{9}\right) - 8x^2 + \frac{320}{3}x$.

$= 5x^2 + 5x^2 - \frac{400}{3}x + \frac{1600}{9} - 8x^2 + \frac{320}{3}x$.

$= -3x^2 + \frac{40}{3}x + \frac{1600}{9}$.

Let $f(x) = -3x^2 + \frac{40}{3}x + \frac{1600}{9}$. We want to find the minimum value of $f(x)$.

To find the minimum of $f(x)$, we can find its derivative and set it equal to zero. The derivative of $f(x)$ is $f'(x) = -6x + \frac{40}{3}$. Setting this equal to zero gives $-6x + \frac{40}{3} = 0$, or $x = \frac{20}{9}$.

Substitute $x = \frac{20}{9}$ into $y = x - \frac{40}{3}$ to get $y = \frac{20}{9} - \frac{40}{3} = -\frac{20}{9}$.

Finally, substitute $x = \frac{20}{9}$ and $y = -\frac{20}{9}$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to get:

$5\left(\frac{20}{9}\right)^2 + 5\left(-\frac{20}{9}\right)^2 - 8\left(\frac{20}{9}\right)\left(-\frac{20}{9}\right)$.

$= \frac{200}{9} + \frac{200}{9} + \frac{3200}{81}$.

$= \frac{400}{9} + \frac{3200}{81}$.

$= \frac{400 \cdot 9 + 3200}{81}$.

$= \frac{3600 + 3200}{81}$.

$= \frac{6800}{81}$.

So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\frac{6800}{81}$. The answer is: $\boxed{\frac{6800}{81}}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's consider the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, we know that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |(x-2y) - (y-2x)| = |x-2y-y+2x| = |3x-3y| = 3|x-y| = 40$.
So $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$.
Now let's consider the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.
We can rewrite it as $5(x^2+y^2)-8xy$.
By the identity $(x-y)^2 = x^2 - 2xy + y^2$, we have $x^2 + y^2 - 2xy = (x-y)^2$.
So $5(x^2+y^2)-8xy = 5[(x-y)^2 + 2xy] - 8xy = 5(x-y)^2 + 2xy = 5\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 + 2xy$.
To minimize this expression, we need to minimize the value of $xy$.
By the AM-GM inequality, we know that $2xy \geq -2\left(\frac{x-y}{2}\right)^2 = -\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2$.
Equality occurs when $x=y$, so the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $5\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{1600}{3}$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\frac{1600}{3}$.
The answer is: $\frac{1600}{3}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, we notice that the expression we want to minimize is a quadratic form, and we can complete the square to make it easier to find the minimum value. 

The given expression can be rewritten as $5(x^2-y^2)-8xy=5[(x-y)(x+y)]-8xy$. Let $u=x-y$ and $v=x+y$, then the expression becomes $5uv-8\frac{u^2+v^2}{2}=5uv-4(u^2+v^2)$. 

To minimize this expression, we can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, which states that for any real numbers $a_1, a_2, b_1, b_2$, we have $(a_1^2 + a_2^2)(b_1^2 + b_2^2) \geq (a_1b_1 + a_2b_2)^2$. 

Applying the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to the terms $u^2$ and $v^2$, we get $(u^2 + v^2)(1^2 + 1^2) \geq (u*1 + v*1)^2 = (u + v)^2$. Simplifying, we get $2(u^2 + v^2) \geq (u + v)^2$.

Therefore, $5uv - 4(u^2 + v^2) \leq 5uv - 2(u + v)^2$. 

Now, we need to minimize $5uv - 2(u + v)^2$. 

Setting the derivative of this expression with respect to $u$ and $v$ to zero, we find that the minimum occurs when $u = v$. 

Substituting $u = v = x - y = x + y$, we get $2x = 2y$, so $x = y$. 

Then, we can substitute $x = y$ into the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we get $|x-2x| + |x-2x| = 40$, which simplifies to $|-x| + |-x| = 40$, and further simplifies to $2|x| = 40$. Solving for $x$, we get $|x| = 20$, so $x = \pm 20$. 

Taking $x = 20$, we find $y = 20$ as well, and the minimum value of the expression is $5(20)(20) - 8(20)(20) = 2000 - 3200 = -1200$. 

However, this is not the minimum value of the expression over all real numbers $x$ and $y$. Taking $x = -20$ and $y = -20$, we find that the minimum value of the expression is also $-1200$. 

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $-1200$. The answer is: $-1200$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To begin with, let's denote $a=x-2y$ and $b=y-2x$. The given condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is equivalent to $|a| + |b| = 40$. We can rewrite $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $\frac{1}{2}(9(x-2y)^2 + 9(y-2x)^2) - \frac{1}{2}( (x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2)$. Denote $A = (x-2y)^2$ and $B = (y-2x)^2$, we can rewrite this as $\frac{1}{2}(9A+9B) - \frac{1}{2}(A+B) = 4A+4B$.
Now, we know that $|a| + |b| = 40$ is equivalent to $\sqrt{A} + \sqrt{B} = 40$.
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have $(\sqrt{A} + \sqrt{B})^2 \leq 2(A+B)$, so $40^2 \leq 2(A+B)$, which implies $A+B \geq 400$. Therefore, $4A+4B \geq 4*400 = 1600$. The minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $1600/2 = 800$. The answer is: $800$.

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, let's consider the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
This can be rewritten as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$, and then $|x-2y| - |2y-x| = 0$.
By the triangle inequality, $|a|-|b| \leq |a-b|$, so equality occurs when $a$ and $b$ have the same sign.
Therefore, $x-2y$ and $2y-x$ must have the same sign.
This means that either $x-2y$ and $2y-x$ are both nonnegative or both nonpositive.
If $x-2y$ and $2y-x$ are both nonnegative, then $x-2y = 2y-x$, so $x=2y$.
If $x-2y$ and $2y-x$ are both nonpositive, then $-(x-2y) = -(2y-x)$, so $x=2y$.
In both cases, we have $x=2y$.
Now we substitute $x=2y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
\begin{align*}
5x^2+5y^2-8xy &= 5(2y)^2 + 5y^2 - 8(2y)y \\
&= 20y^2 + 5y^2 - 16y^2 \\
&= 9y^2.
\end{align*}
Now we need to find the minimum value of $9y^2$ subject to the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
Substituting $x=2y$, we have $|2y-2y| + |y-4y| = 40$, which simplifies to $|0| + |-3y| = 40$.
This gives $|3y| = 40$, so $3|y| = 40$, and $|y| = \frac{40}{3}$.
Since we want the minimum value of $9y^2$, we want to minimize $y^2$.
The minimum value of $y^2$ occurs when $y = -\frac{40}{3}$ or $y = \frac{40}{3}$,
and in either case, $y^2 = \left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{1600}{9}$.
Finally, we substitute $y^2 = \frac{1600}{9}$ into $9y^2$ to get $9\left(\frac{1600}{9}\right) = 1600$.
Thus, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $1600$. The answer is: $1600$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we observe that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be simplified to $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$,
which further simplifies to $|x-2y| + |- (x-2y)| = 40$.
This is equivalent to $|x-2y| + |x-2y| = 40$, or $2|x-2y| = 40$.
So $|x-2y| = 20$.
Next, we consider the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.
We can rewrite this as $(5x^2-8xy+5y^2)$.
Notice that we can factor this expression as $(5x^2-10xy+5y^2) + (-2xy)$,
or $(5(x^2-2xy+y^2)) - 2xy$,
or $5(x-y)^2 - 2xy$.
Now, we want to find the minimum value of this expression.
Using the inequality $(x-y)^2 \geq 0$, we have $5(x-y)^2 \geq 0$.
So the minimum value of $5(x-y)^2$ is 0.
To find the minimum value of $-2xy$, we need to find the maximum value of $xy$.
Using the condition $|x-2y| = 20$, we have $(x-2y)^2 = 400$, or $x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2 = 400$.
Also, $x^2 + 2xy + y^2 = (x+y)^2$.
So $(x+y)^2 - 6xy = 400$.
We want to maximize $xy$.
Notice that $(x+y)^2 \geq 0$, so $6xy \leq 400$, or $xy \leq \frac{400}{6} = \frac{200}{3}$.
Therefore, the maximum value of $xy$ is $\frac{200}{3}$.
So the minimum value of $-2xy$ is $-2\cdot \frac{200}{3} = -\frac{400}{3}$.
Finally, combining the results, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $5 \cdot 0 - \frac{400}{3} = -\frac{400}{3}$.
The answer is: $-\frac{400}{3}$

Step-by-step Solution:



First, we simplify the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as follows:
$$5x^2+5y^2-8xy = \frac{1}{2}((5x^2-8xy+8y^2) + (5y^2-8xy+5x^2))$$
$$ = \frac{1}{2}((5x^2-8xy+8y^2) + (5y^2-8yx+5x^2))$$
$$ = \frac{1}{2}((5x^2-8xy+8y^2) + (5x^2-8xy+5y^2))$$
$$ = \frac{1}{2}(10x^2-16xy+13y^2)$$
$$ = 5x^2-8xy+\frac{13}{2}y^2.$$

Now, let's consider the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. We can rewrite it as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$. By the triangle inequality, we know that $|a| + |b| \ge |a+b|$, so
$$|x-2y| + |2y-x| \ge |(x-2y) + (2y-x)| = |0| = 0.$$
Since the left side of the equation is greater than or equal to 0, the right side must also be greater than or equal to 0. This means that $40 \ge 0$, which is true. Therefore, the equation is always true for all real numbers $x$ and $y$.

Now, let's use the AM-GM inequality (Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean inequality) on the expression $5x^2-8xy+\frac{13}{2}y^2$. The AM-GM inequality states that for non-negative real numbers $a$ and $b$, $(a+b)/2 \ge \sqrt{ab}$. Applying the AM-GM inequality to $5x^2-8xy+\frac{13}{2}y^2$, we have:
$$\frac{1}{2}(10x^2-16xy+13y^2) \ge \sqrt{(10x^2-16xy+13y^2) \cdot 1 \cdot 1}$$
$$ = \sqrt{10x^2-16xy+13y^2}.$$
Taking the square of both sides, we get:
$$5x^2-8xy+\frac{13}{2}y^2 \ge 10x^2-16xy+13y^2.$$
Equality holds when $5x^2-8xy+\frac{13}{2}y^2 = 10x^2-16xy+13y^2$, or when $5x^2-8xy+\frac{13}{2}y^2 - (10x^2-16xy+13y^2) = 0$. Simplifying the left side, we get:
$$5x^2-8xy+\frac{13}{2}y^2 - 10x^2+16xy-13y^2 = 0$$
$$-5x^2+8xy-\frac{1}{2}y^2 = 0$$
$$-5(x^2-1.6xy+0.1y^2) = 0$$
$$-5(x-0.8y)^2 = 0$$
From this, we can see that equality holds when $x = 0.8y$. Now, substituting $x = 0.8y$ into the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we get:
$$|0.8y-2y| + |y-2(0.8y)| = 40$$
$$|-1.2y| + |-0.6y| = 40$$
$$1.2y + 0.6y = 40$$
$$1.8y = 40$$
$$y = \frac{40}{1.8} = \frac{200}{9}.$$
Substituting $y = \frac{200}{9}$ back into $x = 0.8y$, we get:
$$x = 0.8 \cdot \frac{200}{9} = \frac{160}{9}.$$
So, the minimum value of $5x^2-8xy+\frac{13}{2}y^2$ is achieved when $x = \frac{160}{9}$ and $y = \frac{200}{9}$. Substituting these values into $5x^2-8xy+\frac{13}{2}y^2$, we get:
$$5 \left(\frac{160}{9}\right)^2 - 8 \cdot \frac{160}{9} \cdot \frac{200}{9} + \frac{13}{2} \left(\frac{200}{9}\right)^2$$
$$ = \frac{128000}{81} - \frac{256000}{81} + \frac{260000}{81}$$
$$ = \frac{-128000 + 256000 + 260000}{81}$$
$$ = \frac{408000}{81}$$
$$ = 5040 \div 9$$
$$ = 560.$$
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2-8xy+\frac{13}{2}y^2$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 560. The answer is: 560.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's rewrite the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
Using the property $|a| + |b| = |a+b| + |a-b|$, we can simplify the equation to $|x-2y-y+2x| + |x-2y+y-2x| = 40$, which further simplifies to $|3x-3y| + |-x-y| = 40$.
This simplifies further to $3|x-y| + |x+y| = 40$.
Now, let's consider the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = (5x^2 - 8xy + 5y^2) = (5(x^2 - 2xy + y^2)) + (-8xy + 10xy) = (5(x-y)^2) + 2xy$.
We want to minimize this expression.
From the equation $3|x-y| + |x+y| = 40$, we can see that $3|x-y| \le 40$, so $|x-y| \le \frac{40}{3}$.
This means that $(x-y)^2 \le \frac{1600}{9}$.
Since $|x+y| \le 40$, we have $-40 \le x+y \le 40$.
Multiplying through by $2$, we get $-80 \le 2xy \le 80$.
Therefore, $5(x-y)^2 + 2xy \ge 5 \cdot 0 + (-80) = -80$.
Thus, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is $-80$.
The answer is: $-80$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has $4$ distinct solutions means that $\frac{m}{100}$ is the "distance" that the graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ moves from its original position.

The graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ consists of two "V"s placed side by side, each of which has its lowest point at $(1, 2)$. The distance between the two "V"s is $4$ (from $2 - \frac{m}{100}$ to $2 + \frac{m}{100}$).

For $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ to have $4$ distinct solutions, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be strictly less than $2$ (otherwise it would only have $2$ solutions at the lowest point of the "V"), and $\frac{m}{100}$ must be strictly greater than $0$ (otherwise the left hand side of the equation would always be positive, and there would be no negative values, thus only $2$ solutions). Therefore, $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$.

Multiplying all sides of the inequalities by $100$, we get $0 < m < 200$. The positive integers that satisfy this inequality are the integers from $1$ to $199$. However, the question asks for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation has $4$ distinct solutions, i.e., the integers from $1$ to $199$ excluding $0$ and $200$, since $\frac{m}{100}$ cannot be equal to $0$ or $200$.

There are $199 - 1 = 198$ positive integers from $1$ to $199$ excluding $0$ and $200$. 

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the equation is $198$. The answer is: $198$.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions means that $\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal to 2. This is because the function $||\cdot|-\cdot|$ will only give 4 distinct solutions when the right hand side is equal to 2. Therefore, we must have $\frac{m}{100}=2$ which gives $m=200$.
So the only value of $m$ that works is $200$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition is 1.
The value of the unknown variable $m$ is 200.
The value of $m$ is $\boxed{200}$. The answer is: $1$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To solve this problem, we need to first understand how the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have 4 distinct solutions. 

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is equivalent to two cases: 

1. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ or 
2. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$. 

Solving these two equations gives us the solutions of the original equation. 

For the first equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, adding 2 to both sides gives $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. 

This equation will have 2 solutions if $2 + \frac{m}{100} > 0$. 

Similarly, for the second equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$, adding 2 to both sides gives $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. 

This equation will have 2 solutions if $2 - \frac{m}{100} > 0$. 

Therefore, the original equation will have 4 distinct solutions if the conditions $2 + \frac{m}{100} > 0$ and $2 - \frac{m}{100} > 0$ are both satisfied, which simplifies to $0 < m < 200$.

The positive integers $m$ satisfying this condition are the integers from 1 to 199. However, $m$ cannot be 0 or any integer greater than 200 because then the equations $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$ would not have solutions.

So the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition is the number of integers from 1 to 199, which is 199. However, we are asked to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. We have found that this happens for all positive integers $m$ from 1 to 199. 

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 199. The answer is: $199$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To solve the problem, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions.
First, let's consider the inside of the absolute value $| |x-1| - 2 |$. This expression will equal $\frac{m}{100}$ for four distinct values of $x$ if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is between $0$ and $2$. This is because the function $| |x-1| - 2 |$ is a piecewise function with three segments, each of which is a shifted and scaled absolute value function. Therefore, it will equal a given value for two values of $x$ in each segment. Hence, the interval $(0, 2)$ corresponds to four distinct solutions. This gives us the inequality $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$.
Simplifying this inequality, we get $0 < m < 200$.
Since $m$ is a positive integer, the possible values of $m$ are the integers from $1$ to $199$.
Now we need to count the number of these integers. The integers from $1$ to $199$ inclusive is an arithmetic sequence with first term $1$, last term $199$, and common difference $1$. The number of terms in an arithmetic sequence is given by the formula $n = \frac{l - a}{d} + 1$, where $a$ is the first term, $l$ is the last term, and $d$ is the common difference. Substituting the given values into this formula, we get $n = \frac{199 - 1}{1} + 1 = 199$.
Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions is $199$. The answer is: $199$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



In the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$, the right-hand side, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be positive. That means $m$ must be a positive integer. 

The equation has 4 distinct solutions, which means there must be a value of $m$ such that the expression $| |x - 1| - 2|$ takes on that value of $\frac{m}{100}$ four times. 

To make $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ equal to 4 distinct values, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be greater than 2. That's because $| |x - 1| - 2|$ is always between 0 and 4, and if $\frac{m}{100}$ is less than 2, it wouldn't be able to accommodate four distinct values.

So, $m > 200$.

However, $m$ must also be less than 600, because that's when $| |x - 1| - 2|$ would only equal $\frac{m}{100}$ once. (For example, if $m = 600$, then $| |x - 1| - 2| = 6$, which would only occur once for $x = 7$, or once for $x = -5$. But we want four distinct solutions.)

So, $200 < m < 600$.

The only positive integer in this range that makes $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ equal to 4 distinct values is $m = 400$.

Therefore, there is only one such value of $m$, and the answer is 1. The answer is: $1$

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$.

This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ oscillates between 0 and 4, and only when $\frac{m}{100} = 2$ does it have exactly 4 distinct solutions.

So, we solve the equation $\frac{m}{100} = 2$ to find the value of $m$.

Multiplying both sides of the equation by 100 gives $m = 200$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 1, since $m = 200$ is the only solution. The answer is: $1$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.
The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, so $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
Solving the system of equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(8,8), (8,-8), (-8,8), (-8,-8)$.
This forms a square with side length 16. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units.
The answer is: $256$

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $A \cdot B = 0$ implies that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This means that both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, so $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us four lines: $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This means that both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, so $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us four lines: $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

The intersection points of these lines are the vertices of the polygon. By plotting these lines on a coordinate plane, we find that the polygon is a square with side length 16. The area of the square is therefore $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The expression $A \cdot B = 0$ for two nonnegative expressions A and B implies either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore the given equation is equivalent to the following system of four equations:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies $|x+y| = 10$, or $x+y = 10$ or $x+y = -10$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies $|x-y| = 10$, or $x-y = 10$ or $x-y = -10$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies $|x| = 8$, or $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies $|y| = 8$, or $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

Plotting these 8 lines in the coordinate plane, we find that they form a rectangle with opposite corners at $(8,8)$ and $(-8,-8)$, and sides parallel to the axes.

Thus, the area of this rectangle is the product of its side lengths, or $(8 - (-8)) \times (8 - (-8)) = 16 \times 16 = \boxed{256}$.
The answer is: $256$

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To calculate $f(100)$, we need to first understand the function $f$.
We are given that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$.
We also know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.

Let's start with $n=1$. From the second equation, we have $f(2)=2f(1)+1$.
But from the first equation, we know that $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1$.
So, $f(f(f(1)))=1$ implies that $f(f(1))=1$.
Since we know $f(2)=2f(1)+1$, and $f(f(1))=1$, we can substitute this into the second equation to get $2f(1)+1=1$, which implies that $f(1)=0$.

Now we can use the second equation again to find $f(2)=2f(1)+1=2(0)+1=1$.

Now we can find $f(f(2))=f(1)=0$.
And using the first equation $f(f(f(2)))=8(2)-7=9$, but we know $f(f(2))=0$, contradiction.
So, the second equation must be wrong. We should use the first equation instead. 

Let's start from $n=1$ again and set $n=f(1)=0$, then from the first equation, we have $f(f(f(0)))=8(0)-7=-7$.
But we know $f(f(f(0)))=f(f(1))=f(1)=0$. So, $-7=0$, contradiction.
So, the first equation must also be wrong. 

Actually, both equations seem to be incorrect.
Let's check the conditions again.
The first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ is incorrect because when $n=1$, we have $f(f(f(1)))=1$, but from the first equation, we get $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1$, which means the first equation holds for $n=1$.

However, the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ is incorrect because when $n=1$, we have $f(2)=f(2)$, which should be $2f(1)+1=2(0)+1=1$, so the second equation holds for $n=1$.

After careful examination, we find that the mistake is in the second condition.
Actually, the second equation should be $f(2n)=2f(n)$ because the $f(1)=0$ and $f(2)=1$ make the second equation consistent with the first equation.

So, the correct function $f$ is $f(n)=0$ for $n$ even, and $f(n)=1$ for $n$ odd.

Finally, we calculate $f(100)$. Since $100$ is even, we have $f(100)=0$. The solution is $\boxed{0}$.
The answer is: $0$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



Firstly, let's try to find $f(1)$. Using the second equation, we have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. And applying the first equation to $f(2)$, we get $f(f(2)) = 8(2) - 7 = 9$. Since $f(f(f(1))) = 9$, we have $f(f(1)) = 8(1) - 7 = 1$ and then $f(1) = 1$.

Now let's try to find $f(2)$. Using the second equation, we have $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$. And applying the first equation to $f(4)$, we get $f(f(4)) = 8(4) - 7 = 25$. Since $f(f(f(2))) = 25$, we have $f(f(2)) = 8(2) - 7 = 9$ and then $f(2) = 3$.

We can continue this process to find $f(3)$. Using the second equation, we have $f(6) = 2f(3) + 1$. And applying the first equation to $f(6)$, we get $f(f(6)) = 8(6) - 7 = 41$. Since $f(f(f(3))) = 41$, we have $f(f(3)) = 8(3) - 7 = 17$ and then $f(3) = 5$.

We can see a pattern here. It seems that $f(n) = 2n - 1$ for all positive integers $n$. Let's check if this pattern satisfies the two conditions of the problem.

For the first condition, $f(f(f(n))) = f(f(2n - 1)) = f(4n - 3) = 8(4n - 3) - 7 = 32n - 29$. And $8n - 7$. So we need to show that $32n - 29 = 8n - 7$. This simplifies to $32n - 8n = 22$, which is true. So the pattern holds for the first condition.

For the second condition, $f(2n) = f(4n - 2) = 8(4n - 2) - 7 = 32n - 17$, and $2f(n) + 1 = 2(2n - 1) + 1 = 4n - 1$. So we need to show that $32n - 17 = 4n - 1$. This simplifies to $32n - 4n = 16$, which is true. So the pattern holds for the second condition.

Therefore, the pattern $f(n) = 2n - 1$ holds for all positive integers $n$, and $f(100) = 2(100) - 1 = 199$. So the answer is $f(100) = \boxed{199}$.
The answer is: $199$

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



We are given that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We want to find the value of $f(100)$.

Since we are asked to find $f(100)$, and we have a relation that involves $f(2n)$, it might be helpful to consider $200$ first, because $100$ is half of $200$. From the second relation, we have $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$.

Now, we want to find $f(200)$, so we can use the first relation: $f(f(f(200))) = 8*200 - 7 = 1593$.

Since $f(f(f(200))) = f(f(2f(100)+1)) = f(2f(2f(100))+1)$, we can use the second relation again to get:

$f(2f(2f(100))+1) = 2f(f(2f(100))+1) + 1 = 1593$.

Let $x = f(100)$, then the equation becomes $f(2(2x+1)+1) = 1593$, or $f(4x+3) = 1593$.

However, we cannot directly find $f(100)$ from this equation, because it involves $f(4x+3)$.

Notice that if we take $n=1$ in the first relation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we get $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7 = 1$. This means $f(f(1)) = 1$, because the function $f$ takes the number 1 to 1.

And if we take $n=1$ in the second relation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we get $f(2)=2f(1)+1 = 2*1+1 = 3$. This means $f(2) = 3$, because the function $f$ takes the number 2 to 3.

Now we try $n=3$ in the second relation, we get $f(6)=2f(3)+1$. From the equation above, we know $f(6)=f(2*3)=f(2)*2+1 = 3*2+1 = 7$. So $f(6) = 7$.

If we take $n=7$ in the first relation, we get $f(f(f(7)))=8*7-7 = 56-7 = 49$. This means $f(f(7)) = 49$, because the function $f$ takes the number 7 to 49.

If we take $n=7$ in the second relation, we get $f(14)=2f(7)+1 = 2*49+1 = 99$. This means $f(14) = 99$.

We found $f(1)=1$, $f(2)=3$, $f(3)=5$, $f(6)=7$, $f(7)=49$, $f(14)=99$. Then we can use these to find $f(4x+3)$:

$f(4x+3) = f(4*1+3) = f(7) = 49$, for $x=1$.

$f(4x+3) = f(4*2+3) = f(11)$, but from the second relation, we know $f(11) = 2f(5.5)$ which does not help us.

$f(4x+3) = f(4*3+3) = f(15)$, but from the second relation, we know $f(15) = 2f(7.5)$ which does not help us.

$f(4x+3) = f(4*7+3) = f(31)$, but from the second relation, we know $f(31) = 2f(15.5)$ which does not help us.

However, we can use the fact that $f(14) = 99$ to find $f(31)$: from the second relation, we have $f(31) = 2f(15.5) = 2(f(14)*2+1) = 2(99*2+1) = 2*199 = 398$. So $f(31) = 398$.

Thus, $f(4x+3) = 398$ for $x=7$.

We found $f(4x+3) = 398$ for $x=7$, so we can write $f(4*7+3) = 398$. This means $f(31) = 398$.

Therefore, we have $f(2f(100)+1) = 1593$, which gives us $f(2x+1) = 1593/2 = 796.5$.

However, we know that $f(2x+1)$ must be an integer, so there must be a mistake in our reasoning.

Let's start again with a different approach. We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, so if we take $n=1$, we get $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$, so $f(f(1))=1$.

Then if we take $n=2$, we get $f(f(f(2)))=8*2-7=9$.

From $f(f(1))=1$, we can see that $f(1)=1$.

Now if we substitute $n=1$ into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we get $f(2)=2f(1)+1=3$. So $f(2)=3$.

Then if we substitute $n=2$ into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we get $f(4)=2f(2)+1=7$. So $f(4)=7$.

Now if we substitute $n=7$ into the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we get $f(f(f(7)))=8*7-7=56-7=49$. So $f(f(7))=49$.

Since we know that $f(7)=49$, we have $f(f(7))=49$.

Now if we substitute $n=14$ into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we get $f(28)=

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find $f(100)$, we first need to use the second equation of the function $f$. We know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. 

Let's apply this equation to find $f(100)$. We can write $100 = 2 \cdot 50$, so
\[f(100) = 2f(50) + 1.\]

Now we need to find $f(50)$. Using the same equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can write $50 = 2 \cdot 25$, so
\[f(50) = 2f(25) + 1.\]

We need to continue this process until we reach a value of $n$ for which we know the value of $f(n)$.

Let's continue this process:
\[f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1.\]

But we know that $f$ is only defined for natural numbers (positive integers), and $12.5$ is not a natural number. So, we must have made a mistake somewhere. 

Let's go back and look at the first equation of the function $f$: $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. 

We can try to use this equation to find the value of $f(100)$. If we let $n=1$, we get
\[f(f(f(1)))=8 \cdot 1 - 7 = -1.\]
But a function value cannot be negative. So, we must have made a mistake in our previous steps. Let's go back and revise our steps.

Let's start over:
\[f(100) = 2f(50) + 1.\]
We can use the second equation again to find $f(50)$:
\[f(50) = 2f(25) + 1.\]
And we can use the second equation again to find $f(25)$:
\[f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1.\]
But this time, let's use the first equation of the function $f$: $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. 

If we let $n=12.5$, we get
\[f(f(f(12.5)))=8 \cdot 12.5 - 7 = 80 - 7 = 73.\]
But we also know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, so
\[f(f(f(12.5))) = 8 \cdot 12.5 - 7 = 73.\]
Setting these two equal to each other, we get
\[f(f(f(12.5))) = f(f(f(12.5))) = 73.\]
This means that we must have made an error somewhere in our previous steps. Let's go back and revise our steps again.

Let's start over again and try a different approach.

If we look at the second equation of the function $f$: $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can see that it involves doubling $f(n)$ and adding 1. This suggests that $f(n)$ might be odd for odd values of $n$. Let's test this by looking at the first equation of the function $f$: $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. 

If we let $n=1$, we get
\[f(f(f(1)))=8 \cdot 1 - 7 = -1.\]
But we know that $f(f(f(1)))$ must be a positive number (since $f$ is defined for positive integers), so our initial assumption that $f(n)$ is odd for odd values of $n$ is correct.

Now, let's try to find a pattern in the function $f$. From the second equation, we can see that if $n$ is even, then $f(n)$ is also even. And if $n$ is odd, then $f(n)$ is odd.

Let's try to apply this pattern to find $f(100)$. Since $100$ is even, we know that $f(100)$ must be even. The only even value that we haven't used yet is $2f(50) + 1$. If $f(50)$ is odd, then $2f(50) + 1$ will be odd, which is not possible because $f(100)$ must be even. So, we must have made a mistake in our previous steps.

Let's go back and revise our steps once more.

If we look at the first equation of the function $f$: $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we can see that it involves subtracting 7 from $8n$. This suggests that $f(n)$ might be one less than a multiple of 8 for certain values of $n$. Let's test this by looking at the second equation of the function $f$: $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.

If we let $n=1$, we get
\[f(2 \cdot 1) = 2f(1) + 1 \Rightarrow f(2) = 2f(1) + 1.\]
This means that if $f(1)$ is one less than a multiple of 8, then $f(2)$ will also be one less than a multiple of 8. Let's test this for $n=2$:
\[f(f(f(2)))=8 \cdot 2 - 7 = 9.\]
If $f(2)$ is one less than a multiple of 8, then $f(f(f(2)))$ should also be one less than a multiple of 8. Since $9$ is one less than $10$, this suggests that our assumption is correct.

Now, let's try to apply this pattern to find $f(100)$. Since $100$ is a multiple of $4$, we know that $f(100)$ must be one less than a multiple of $8$. The only such value that we haven't used yet is $8k - 1$, where $k$ is a positive integer. So, we can write
\[f(100) = 8k - 1.\]
Now, let's try to find the value of $k$. Since $100 = 2 \cdot 50$, we can use the second equation of the function $f$: $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to find $f(100)$:
\[f(100) = 2f(50) + 1.\]
We can use the second equation again to find $f(50)$:
\[f(50) = 2f(25) + 1.\]
And we can use the second equation again to find $f(

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find $f(100)$, we need to find the function $f$ defined by the two conditions $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.

First, let's use the second condition to find $f(100)$. We want to express 100 as $2n$ for some positive integer $n$. We can see that $100 = 2 \cdot 50$. So we can use the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to find $f(100)$:
$$f(100) = f(2 \cdot 50) = 2f(50) + 1.$$

Now we need to find $f(50)$. Again, we can express 50 as $2 \cdot 25$, and apply the second condition:
$$f(50) = f(2 \cdot 25) = 2f(25) + 1.$$

Next, we need to find $f(25)$. Expressing 25 as $2 \cdot 12.5$ would not help us, because 12.5 is not an integer. However, we notice that $25 = f(12)$, because $f(f(f(12)))=8 \cdot 12 - 7 = 95$ and $f(2 \cdot 12) = 2f(12) + 1$, so $f(24) = 2f(12) + 1$. And we know that $f(f(f(12)))=95$, so $f(24) = 95$. Therefore, $f(25) = f(13)$, because $f(2 \cdot 13) = 2f(13) + 1$, so $f(26) = 2f(13) + 1$.

Next, we can use the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to find $f(12)$, $f(13)$, and $f(26)$:
$$f(12) = 1, \quad f(13) = 5, \quad f(26) = 9.$$

Now we can substitute these values back into the previous equations to find $f(50)$ and $f(100)$:
$$f(50) = 2f(25) + 1 = 2f(13) + 1 = 2 \cdot 5 + 1 = 11,$$
$$f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2 \cdot 11 + 1 = 23.$$

So the value of $f(100)$ is 23. The answer is: $23$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To solve this problem, we need to apply the given conditions step by step.
First, let's use the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to find $f(100)$.
Since $100 = 2 \times 50$, we can apply the second condition to get $f(100) = 2f(50)+1$.

Now, we need to find $f(50)$. Since $50 = 2 \times 25$, we can apply the second condition again to get $f(50) = 2f(25)+1$.

Continuing this process, we need to find $f(25)$. Since $25 = 5 \times 5$, we can apply the second condition once more to get $f(25) = 2f(5)+1$.

Next, we need to find $f(5)$. Since $5$ is a prime number, we cannot apply the second condition directly. However, we can use the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ with $n=5$. We get $f(f(f(5)))=8 \times 5 - 7 = 33$.

Now, let's find $f(f(5))$ by setting $n=5$ in the second condition. We get $f(10)=2f(5)+1$.

Similarly, let's find $f(10)$ by setting $n=5$ in the second condition again. We get $f(20)=2f(10)+1$.

Now, let's find $f(20)$ using the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. We get $f(f(f(5)))=8 \times 5 - 7 = 33$.

Now, we have a system of three equations:
1. $f(f(f(5)))=33$.
2. $f(10)=2f(5)+1$.
3. $f(20)=2f(10)+1$.

We can substitute the second equation into the third to get $f(20)=2(2f(5)+1)+1=4f(5)+3$. Now, we can substitute this into the first equation to get $f(f(f(5)))=33 \Rightarrow f(4f(5)+3)=33$.

We can solve this equation by trying different values for $f(5)$ and see if it gives us a solution that makes sense. After trying a few values, we find that $f(5)=3$ gives us $f(4f(5)+3)=f(15)=33$.

Now, we can substitute $f(5)=3$ into the second equation to get $f(10)=2f(5)+1=2(3)+1=7$.

Finally, we substitute $f(10)=7$ into the third equation to get $f(20)=2f(10)+1=2(7)+1=15$.

Now, we can substitute $f(20)=15$ into the first condition $f(f(f(5)))=8n-7$ to get $f(f(f(5)))=8 \times 5 - 7 = 33$. This gives us $f(f(15))=33$.

Since $f(15)=33$, we have $f(f(15))=33$. This confirms our previous solution.

So, we have found $f(5)=3$, $f(10)=7$, and $f(20)=15$.

Now, we can substitute these values back into the second condition to find $f(50)$, $f(100)$, etc.

$f(50)=2f(25)+1=2f(5 \times 5)+1=2(2f(5)+1)+1=2(2(3)+1)+1=2(7)+1=15$.

$f(100)=2f(50)+1=2(15)+1=31$.

Therefore, $f(100)=31$.

The answer is: $31$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We can start by substituting $n = 1$ into the first equation, which gives $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1$. Since $f(f(f(1)))=1$, this means $f(1)$ is a number such that $f(f(f(1)))=1$. By trial and error, we can find that $f(1) = 1$, because if we substitute $f(1) = 1$ into the equation $f(f(f(1)))=1$, we get $f(1) = 1$, which is true.

Next, we substitute $n = 2$ into the second equation, which gives $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$. We can use this equation to express $f(2)$ in terms of $f(4)$.

Then, substitute $f(2)$ into the first equation to get
\[f(f(f(2)))=8(2)-7=9.\]
Since $f(f(f(2)))=9$, we know $f(2)$ is a number such that $f(f(f(2)))=9$. By trial and error, we can find that $f(2) = 3$, because if we substitute $f(2) = 3$ into the equation $f(f(f(2)))=9$, we get $f(2) = 3$, which is true.

Next, substitute $f(2) = 3$ into the second equation to get $f(4) = 2(3) + 1 = 7$.

We can continue this process to find $f(3)$, $f(6)$, $f(12)$, etc., until we find a pattern. After some trials, we can find that $f(n) = 2n - 1$ for all positive integers $n$.

Now we can check if this pattern satisfies the original conditions:

1. For the first equation, $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, if $f(n) = 2n - 1$, then $f(f(f(n)))=f(f(2n-1))=f(4n-3)=8n-7$. So the first equation holds true for this pattern.

2. For the second equation, $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, if $f(n) = 2n - 1$, then $f(2n)=2(2n-1)+1=4n-1=2f(n)+1$. So the second equation also holds true for this pattern.

Therefore, we have found a solution that satisfies both conditions: $f(n) = 2n - 1$. Now we can calculate $f(100)$:
\[f(100) = 2(100) - 1 = 200 - 1 = 199.\]
So, $f(100) = 199$. The answer is: $199$

## QUESTION 4 - 7

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's find $f(1)$. We plug in $n=1$ into the second condition: $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. From the first condition, we know that $f(f(f(1))) = 8(1) - 7 = -1$. Since $f(f(f(1))) = f(f(1))$ (by the second condition for $n=f(1)$), and $f(f(1)) = f(1)$ (by the second condition for $n=1$), we have $f(1) = -1$. Then, we plug $n=1$ into the second condition to get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2(-1) + 1 = -1$. Again, by the second condition for $n=2$, we have $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2(-1) + 1 = -1$. Continuing this pattern, we see that $f(n) = -1$ for all positive integers $n$. Indeed, this function satisfies both conditions. Thus, $f(100) = -1$. The answer is: $\boxed{-1}$.
