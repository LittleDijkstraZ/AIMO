Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 To solve this problem, we can first understand the equation and the properties of the points that satisfy it. The equation is a product of two terms which are each squares, so both terms must be zero for the equation to be satisfied. This gives us four conditions:

1. $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
2. $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
3. $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
4. $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

The points that satisfy these conditions form a rectangle with diagonals of length 20. The length of the rectangle is the maximum and minimum value of $x$ or $y$ plus or minus 10, which is 20. The width of the rectangle is the maximum and minimum of $x + y$ or $x - y$ plus or minus 10, which is also 20. So the area of the rectangle is $20 \times 20 = 400$.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The equation is satisfied only when one of the factors is zero. This gives us four conditions:

1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
2. $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

For each of these conditions, we can find the range of points $(x, y)$ that satisfy them. Then, we can find the intersection of these ranges to get the boundary of the polygon.

The boundary consists of 8 line segments, each of which is part of a coordinate axis or is parallel to one. Therefore, the polygon is a regular octagon.

By symmetry, the distance from the origin $(0, 0)$ to each vertex of the octagon is 8 (when $x$ or $y$ equals 8). Using the distance formula for a line with slope 1 or -1 passing through the origin, we find that the sides of the octagon have length $\sqrt{8^2 + 8^2} = 8\sqrt{2}$.

Therefore, the area of the octagon is $8 \times \frac{1}{4} \times 8^2 = \boxed{128}$ square units.
