Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 ```python
from sympy import symbols, solve, Eq

def num_solutions():
    """
    This function finds the number of positive integers m for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions.
    Returns: the number of such integers.
    """
    x, m = symbols('x m')
    equation = Eq(abs(abs(x - 1) - 2), m / 100)
    solutions = solve(equation, x)
    count = 0
    for m_value in range(1, 101):  # m is a positive integer and less than or equal to 100
        solutions_m = [sol.subs(m, m_value) for sol in solutions]
        count += 4 == len(set(solutions_m))  # Check if there are 4 distinct solutions
    return count

result = num_solutions()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 100

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
100
```
The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $\boxed{100}$.
