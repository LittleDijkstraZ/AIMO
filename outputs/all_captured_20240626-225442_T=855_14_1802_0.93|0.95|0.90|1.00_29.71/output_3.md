**Problem:** 

"Let $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_ 2= (-16,2).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that
\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as
\[\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1.\]Find $h + k + a + b.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

Now, below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within oxed{}.

**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


The equation is satisfied if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The first two conditions are equivalent to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, respectively.
The last two conditions are equivalent to $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, respectively.
Solving these equations, we find that the points that satisfy the equation are the vertices of a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

Here is the entire script to solve this problem:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Abs, solve

def area_of_polygon():
    x, y = symbols('x y')
    # Equations
    eq1 = Abs(x + y) - 10
    eq2 = Abs(x - y) - 10
    eq3 = Abs(x) - 8
    eq4 = Abs(y) - 8

    # Solve for the vertices
    vertices = [(x, y) for x in solve(eq3) for y in solve(eq4)] + [(x, y) for x in solve(eq1) for y in solve(eq2)]
    # The vertices form a square
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    
    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

Now, below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step.

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within oxed{}.

**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:



First, we need to understand the equation: $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$

This equation equals zero if and only if at least one of the factors equals zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This forms a square with side length 20.

For the second case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This forms a square with side length 16.

The total area of the polygon is the sum of the areas of these two squares. The area of a square is given by side length squared, so the area of the first square is $20^2 = 400$ and the area of the second square is $16^2 = 256$. Adding these together, the total area is $400 + 256 = 656$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 656. The answer is: $\boxed{656}$

**Example**

**Problem:** 

"How many square units are in the area of the triangle whose vertices are the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the curve $y = (x-3)^2 (x+2)$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:
First, we need to find where this curve intersects the $x$ and $y$ axes.  If $y=0$, then $(x-3)^2(x+2)=0$, which has solutions of $x=3$ and $x=-2$.  If $x=0$, then $y=(-3)^2(2)=18$.  So, the curve has two $x$-intercepts and one $y$-intercept.  The length of the base along the $x$-axis is $3-(-2)=5$.  The height from this base is equal to the $y$-intercept, 18.  The area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 5\cdot 18=\boxed{45}$. The answer is $\boxed{45}$

Now, below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step.

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within oxed{}.

**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:



The equation $A \cdot B = 0$ is equivalent to $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. So the given equation is equivalent to $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The first equation implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations we get the vertices of the square as $(5,5), (5,-5), (-5,5), (-5,-5)$.
The second equation implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these four equations we get the vertices of the square as $(8,0), (0,8), (-8,0), (0,-8)$.
So the points satisfying the given equation are the vertices of two squares.
The side length of the first square is 10 (from $5$ to $5$ or $-5$ to $-5$ along the $x$ or $y$ axis).
The side length of the second square is 16 (from $8$ to $8$ or $-8$ to $-8$ along the $x$ or $y$ axis).
The area of the first square is $10^2 = 100$.
The area of the second square is $16^2 = 256$.
The total area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares, which is $100 + 256 = 356$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import *

# Calculation of the area of the convex polygon
area = 100 + 256
print(area)
```

The area of the convex polygon is 356 square units. The answer is $\boxed{356}$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 

"Five identical rectangles are arranged to form a larger rectangle $PQRS$, as shown.  The area of $PQRS$ is $4000$.  What is the length, $x$, rounded off to the nearest integer? [asy]
real x = 1; real w = 2/3;

// Draw outer square and labels
pair s = (0, 0); pair r = (2 * x, 0); pair q = (3 * w, x + w); pair p = (0, x + w);
draw(s--r--q--p--cycle);
label("$S$", s, SW); label("$R$", r, SE); label("$Q$", q, NE); label("$P$", p, NW);

// Draw other segments
draw((x, 0)--(x, w));
draw((0, w)--(2 * x, w));
draw((w, x + w)--(w, w)); draw((2 * w, x + w)--(2 * w, w));

// length labels
pair upper = (-0.1, x + w);
pair lower = (-0.1, w);
draw(lower--upper);
draw((-0.1 - 0.03, x + w)--(-0.1 + 0.03, x + w));
draw((-0.1 - 0.03, w)--(-0.1 + 0.03, w));
label("$x$", midpoint((-0.1, w)--(-0.1, x + w)), W);

pair left = (0, -0.1); pair right = (x, -0.1);
draw((0, -0.1 + 0.03)--(0, -0.1 - 0.03));
draw((x, -0.1 - 0.03)--(x, -0.1 + 0.03));
draw(left--right);
label("$x$", (x/2, -0.1), S);

[/asy]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:
Let $w$ be the width of each of the identical rectangles. Since $PQ=3w$, $RS=2x$ and $PQ=RS$ (because $PQRS$ is a rectangle), then $2x = 3w$, or $$w=\frac{2}{3}x.$$ Therefore, the area of each of the five identical rectangles is $$x\left(\frac{2}{3}x\right)=\frac{2}{3}x^2.$$ Since the area of $PQRS$ is 4000 and it is made up of five of these identical smaller rectangles, then $$5\left(\frac{2}{3}x^2\right)=4000$$ or $$\frac{10}{3}x^2 = 4000$$ or $x^2 = 1200$ or $x \approx 34.6$ which, when rounded off to the nearest integer, is $\boxed{35}.$ The answer is $\boxed{35}$

Now, below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within oxed{}.

**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


The expression $0^0$ is undefined, so in order for the product to be zero, one of the factors must be zero. This translates to the following four conditions:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

Each of these equations is satisfied if and only if the absolute value expressions are equal to zero, which means the expressions inside the absolute value brackets must be zero. Let's solve each equation:

1. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0 \implies \vert x + y \vert = 10 \implies x + y = 10 \text{ or } x + y = -10$
2. $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0 \implies \vert x - y \vert = 10 \implies x - y = 10 \text{ or } x - y = -10$
3. $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0 \implies \vert x \vert = 8 \implies x = 8 \text{ or } x = -8$
4. $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0 \implies \vert y \vert = 8 \implies y = 8 \text{ or } y = -8$

The solution to these four equations are the coordinates of the vertices of a square with side length 20. The area of the square is side length squared, so the area is $20^2 = 400$.
The answer is $\boxed{400}$.

"How many square units are in the area of the triangle whose vertices are the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the curve $y = (x-3)^2 (x+2)$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:
First, we need to find where this curve intersects the $x$ and $y$ axes.  If $y=0$, then $(x-3)^2(x+2)=0$, which has solutions of $x=3$ and $x=-2$.  If $x=0$, then $y=(-3)^2(2)=18$.  So, the curve has two $x$-intercepts and one $y$-intercept.  The length of the base along the $x$-axis is $3-(-2)=5$.  The height from this base is equal to the $y$-intercept, 18.  The area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 5\cdot 18=\boxed{45}$. The answer is $\boxed{45}$

Now, below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within oxed{}.

**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:



Step 1: The equation is satisfied only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that the points must lie on the squares of the following four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, $x - y = -10$, $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, $y = -8$.

Step 2: Plotting these eight lines on the coordinate plane, we find that they enclose a rectangular region with vertices at $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$. 

Step 3: The dimensions of the rectangle are 16 units by 16 units. 

Step 4: The area of the rectangle is therefore $16 \times 16 = 256$.

So, the area of the polygon is $\boxed{256}$.
```python
