**Problem:** 

"How many distinct solutions are there to the equation $|x-7| = |x+1|$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:
If $|x-7| = |x+1|$, then either $x-7 = x+1$ or $x-7 = -(x+1)$.  Simplifying $x-7=x+1$ gives $0=8$, which has no solutions, so no values of $x$ satisfy $x-7 = x+1$.  If $x-7 = -(x+1)$, then $x-7 = -x-1$, so $2x = 6$, which gives $x=3$.  So, there is $\boxed{1}$ solution.

Challenge: See if you can find a quick solution to this problem by simply thinking about the graphs of $y=|x-7|$ and $y=|x+1|$. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

Now, below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within oxed{}.

**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 1 and 2. In other words, $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which implies $100 < m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from 101 to 199, inclusive. To find out how many such integers there are, we can subtract the smallest possible value of $m$ from the largest possible value of $m$, and then add 1. So the number of positive integers $m$ is $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$.

However, we have to consider one more condition. If $m$ is not an integer, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ would not have an integer solution for $x$. Therefore, we need to remove the non-integer values of $m$ from our count. The non-integer values of $m$ in the range 101 to 199 are those that end with .01, .02, ..., .99 (in decimal notation). There are 99 such values. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy all the conditions is $99 - 99 = 0$. However, this is not possible because we know that the equation has 4 distinct solutions for some values of $m$.

The problem with the above reasoning is that we are assuming that the number of solutions is a continuous function of $m$. However, this is not the case. The number of solutions changes abruptly as $m$ passes through certain values. In particular, the number of solutions changes when $m$ equals a multiple of 100. Therefore, we need to check the values of $m$ that are multiples of 100.

For $m=100$, the equation becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=1$, which has 4 distinct solutions. For $m=200$, the equation becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=2$, which has 8 distinct solutions. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is the number of multiples of 100 between 100 and 200, inclusive. There are 2 such multiples: 100 and 200.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 2.

The python script to calculate the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is as follows:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def count_m():
    count = 0
    for m in range(101, 200):
        if m % 100 == 0:
            count += 1
    return count

result = count_m()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 0

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
0
```
The above code does not give the correct result because it does not account for the abrupt changes in the number of solutions as $m$ passes through multiples of 100. The correct way to solve this problem is to manually count the number of multiples of 100 in the range 101 to 199, inclusive. There are only 2 such multiples: 100 and 200. So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 2.
The answer is: $2$

**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:



1. If the equation has 4 distinct solutions, there must be two distances from 1 such that the difference between them is equal to m/100.

2. The distances from 1 are 1-2=-1 and 1+2=3, so the difference between them is 3-(-1)=4.

3. Setting this equal to m/100, we have 4=m/100, so m=400.

So the number of positive integer m that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions is 1.
The answer is: $\boxed{1}$

**Problem:** 

"How many solutions does the equation \[\frac{(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)\dotsm(x-100)}{(x-1^2)(x-2^2)(x-3^2)\dotsm(x-100^2)} = 0\]have for $x$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:
Any solution to this equation must make the numerator of the left-hand side zero, while keeping the denominator non-zero. The numerator is zero when $x$ is one of the numbers $1, 2, 3, \dots, 100.$ However, for any value in this list that is a perfect square, the denominator will also be zero, so that value of $x$ will not be a root. Therefore, we want to find the number of integers in the list $1, 2, \dots, 100$ which are not perfect squares. The perfect squares in the list are $1^2, 2^2, \dots, 10^2,$ so there are $10$ perfect squares, and \[100 - 10 = \boxed{90}\]integers which are not perfect squares. The answer is $\boxed{90}$

**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:



The equation $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions. We know that the expression $|x-1| - 2$ will be zero or change its sign twice as $x$ goes from $-\infty$ to $\infty$. This is because $|x-1| - 2$ equals to $-|x-1| + 2$ when $|x-1| - 2$ is negative, so it will have a sign change at $|x-1| = 2$, which gives $x = 1 \pm 2$, or $x = -1$ and $x = 3$. 

This means the right hand side $\frac{m}{100}$ must be in the interval $(0, 2)$ so that the equation has four distinct solutions. Thus, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be in the interval $(0, 2)$, which gives $0 < m < 200$. The number of integer solutions for $m$ in this interval is $199$.

However, we must eliminate the cases where the equation $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has fewer than four distinct solutions. 

If $m = 0$, the equation becomes $| |x-1| - 2 | = 0$, which simplifies to $|x-1| = 2$. The solutions are $x = -1$ and $x = 3$, so there are only two distinct solutions.

If $m = 200$, the equation becomes $| |x-1| - 2 | = 2$, which simplifies to $|x-1| = 4$. The solutions are $x = -3$ and $x = 5$, so there are only two distinct solutions.

Therefore, we need to eliminate the cases $m = 0$ and $m = 200$. So the number of positive integer solutions for $m$ is $199 - 2 = 197$.

The final answer is: $197$.

The answer is: $197$

If $|x-7| = |x+1|$, then either $x-7 = x+1$ or $x-7 = -(x+1)$.  Simplifying $x-7=x+1$ gives $0=8$, which has no solutions, so no values of $x$ satisfy $x-7 = x+1$.  If $x-7 = -(x+1)$, then $x-7 = -x-1$, so $2x = 6$, which gives $x=3$.  So, there is $\boxed{1}$ solution.

**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:



First, we need to understand that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ reaches its maximum value of 2, and it will have 4 distinct solutions exactly when it equals this maximum value.

Setting $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, we can solve for $m$ to find $m = 200$.

So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 1, because 200 is the only positive integer that makes the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have 4 distinct solutions.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ is 1. The answer is: 1

**Problem:** 

"How many integers are solutions to the equation $$(x-2)^{(25-x^2)}=1?$$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:
We need some basic facts from number theory: $a^0 = 1$ for any $a,$ $1^b = 1$ for any $b,$ and $(-1)^c = 1$ if $c$ is an even integer. Unless the base is a complex number (which is excluded since we are looking for integer solutions), there are no other ways to get an RHS of $1.$ Thus, either the exponent is zero $($giving the equation $25 - x^2 = 0),$ the base is $1$ $($giving $x -2 = 1),$ or the base is $-1$ and the exponent is even $($giving the simultaneous equations $x - 2 = -1$ and $25 - x^2 = 2n$ for some integer $n).$ Solving the first equation gives $x = \pm 5,$ and solving the second gives $x = 3.$ The third equation implies that $x = 1,$ in which case $25 - x^2 = 24$ is indeed even, so $x = 1$ is a valid solution. In all, there are $\boxed{4}$ integer solutions. The answer is $\boxed{4}$

**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:



We want to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has $4$ distinct solutions. This equation has a piecewise form, and we can break it down into several cases to solve it. 

1. When $0 \leq \frac{m}{100} \leq 2$, the equation becomes $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, which can be further broken down into two cases:
   a. When $0 \leq \frac{m}{100} \leq 1$, the equation becomes $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which gives us two solutions: $x = 1 + 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = 1 - 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.
   b. When $1 \leq \frac{m}{100} \leq 2$, the equation becomes $\vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100} + 2$, which gives us two solutions: $x = 1 + \frac{m}{100} + 2$ and $x = 1 - \frac{m}{100} - 2$.

2. When $2 < \frac{m}{100} \leq 4$, the equation becomes $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which can be further broken down into two cases:
   a. When $2 < \frac{m}{100} < 3$, the equation becomes $\vert x-1 \vert = 4 - \frac{m}{100}$, which gives us two solutions: $x = 1 + 4 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = 1 - 4 + \frac{m}{100}$.
   b. When $3 \leq \frac{m}{100} \leq 4$, the equation becomes $\vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100} - 2$, which gives us two solutions: $x = 1 + \frac{m}{100} - 2$ and $x = 1 - \frac{m}{100} + 2$.

So, for each value of $m$, there are $4$ distinct solutions. Therefore, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $0 \leq \frac{m}{100} \leq 4$. This means $0 \leq m \leq 400$, and the number of positive integers in this range is $401$.

However, we need to exclude the case when $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, because in this case, the equation becomes $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 2$, which simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = 4$, and only gives $2$ solutions, not $4$. There is only one value of $m$ that makes this happen, which is $m = 200$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has $4$ distinct solutions is $401 - 1 = 400$.

But we have made a mistake. The correct answer is actually $399$, not $400$. We apologize for the confusion. The mistake came from us assuming that only one value of $m$ would make $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, when in fact, any value of $m$ in the range $100 < m \leq 200$ would result in $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. So we should have subtracted $2$ instead of $1$ from $401$.

So, the correct number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has $4$ distinct solutions is $401 - 2 = 399$.

But we made another mistake. The correct answer is actually $398$, not $399$. The mistake came from us assuming that only one value of $m$ would make $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, when in fact, any value of $m$ in the range $100 < m \leq 200$ would result in $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. However, when $\frac{m}{100} = 3$, the equation becomes $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 1$, which simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = 3$, and only gives $2$ solutions, not $4$. There is only one value of $m$ that makes this happen, which is $m = 300$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has $4$ distinct solutions is $401 - 3 = 398$.

The correct answer is $398$.
The answer is: $\boxed{398}$

**Example**

**Problem:** 

"For certain ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ of real numbers, the system of equations
\[\begin{aligned} ax+by&=1 \\ x^2 + y^2 &= 50  \end{aligned}\]has at least one solution, and each solution is an ordered pair $(x,y)\,$ of integers. How many such ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ are there?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:
The graph of $ax+by=1$ is a line, while the graph of $x^2+y^2=50$ is a circle centered at the origin. Therefore, $(a, b)$ satisfies the conditions if and only if the line and circle intersect at least once, and they intersect only at lattice points (points with integer coordinates).

Knowing this, it makes sense to look for lattice points on the circle whose equation is $x^2+y^2=50$. Testing cases, we find that there are twelve lattice points on the circle: $(\pm 1, \pm 7)$, $(\pm 7, \pm 1)$, and $(\pm 5, \pm 5)$ (where the two $\pm$ signs in each pair are independent of each other).

There are $\tbinom{12}{2} = 66$ pairs of these points, and each pair determines a line. However, the graph of $ax+by=1$ can never pass through the origin $(0, 0)$, since if $x=y=0$, then $ax+by=0 \neq 1$. Therefore, the six pairs which consist of diametrically opposed points are invalid, since the line through them passes through the origin. This corrects our count to $66 - 6 = 60$.

In addition, for each of the twelve points, there is a line tangent to the circle at that point, so that the only solution to the system is that one point. This brings the final total to $60 + 12 = \boxed{72}$. The answer is $\boxed{72}$

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within oxed{}.

**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:



First, we can simplify the equation to \[|x-3| = \frac{m}{100} + |x-1| + 2.\]
The absolute value function makes the equation piecewise-defined, so we break into cases:

If $x \leq 1$, then the equation becomes \[3-x = \frac{m}{100} + 1 - x + 2.\]Simplifying gives $m = 100(3 - 1 - 2) = 0$, which is not possible.

If $1 < x \leq 3$, then the equation becomes \[3 - x = \frac{m}{100} + x - 1 + 2.\]Simplifying gives \[m = 100(3 - x - (x - 1)) = 200 - 200x.\]

If $x > 3$, then the equation becomes \[x - 3 = \frac{m}{100} + x - 1 + 2.\]Simplifying gives $m = 100(x - 3 - (x - 1)) = -200,$ which is not possible.

So the equation simplifies to $m = 200 - 200x$ for $1 < x \leq 3$. The number of solutions to the equation is the number of intersections of the line $y = \frac{m}{100}$ with the graph of $y = |x-3| + |x-1| - 2$.

The graph of $y = |x-3| + |x-1| - 2$ is a "V" shape with vertices at $(1, -2)$ and $(3, -2)$. The line $y = \frac{m}{100}$ is a horizontal line that moves upwards as $m$ increases.

The line $y = \frac{m}{100}$ intersects the "V" shape at $4$ points when $-200 < m < 0$. Thus, the number of positive integer solutions $m$ is the number of positive integers from $1$ to $200$. The number of such integers is $200$. The answer is: $200$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 

"How many distinct solutions are there to the equation $|x-7| = |x+1|$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:
If $|x-7| = |x+1|$, then either $x-7 = x+1$ or $x-7 = -(x+1)$.  Simplifying $x-7=x+1$ gives $0=8$, which has no solutions, so no values of $x$ satisfy $x-7 = x+1$.  If $x-7 = -(x+1)$, then $x-7 = -x-1$, so $2x = 6$, which gives $x=3$.  So, there is $\boxed{1}$ solution.

Challenge: See if you can find a quick solution to this problem by simply thinking about the graphs of $y=|x-7|$ and $y=|x+1|$. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

Now, below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within oxed{}.

**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:



1. The equation $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$.
2. Solving the equation $\frac{m}{100} = 2$ for $m$ gives $m = 200$.

So, the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 200. The answer is: $200$.
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def number_of_solutions():
    # The equation | |x-1| - 2 | = m/100 has 4 distinct solutions if and only if m/100 = 2.
    # Solving the equation m/100 = 2 for m gives m = 200.
    m = 200

    return m

result = number_of_solutions()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 200

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
200
```
The only positive integer $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 200. The answer is $\boxed{200}$.
