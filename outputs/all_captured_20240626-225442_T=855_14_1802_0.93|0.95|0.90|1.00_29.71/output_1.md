**Problem:** 

"What is the minimum value of the expression $2x^2+3y^2+8x-24y+62$ for real $x$ and $y$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:
Rearranging the expression, we have  \[2x^2+8x+3y^2-24y+62\]We first complete the square in $x$. Factoring a 2 from the first two terms of the expression, we get  \[2(x^2+4x)+3y^2-24y+62\]In order for the expression inside the parenthesis to be a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(4/2)^2=4$ inside the parenthesis. Doing this, we have \[2(x^2+4x+4-4)+3y^2-24y+62 \Rightarrow 2(x+2)^2+3y^2-24y+54\]Now we complete the square in $y$. Factoring a 3 from the $y$ terms in the expression, we get \[2(x+2)^2+3(y^2-8y)+54\]In order for the expression inside the second parenthesis to be a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(8/2)^2=16$ inside the parenthesis. Doing this, we have \[2(x+2)^2+3(y^2-8y+16-16)+54 \Rightarrow 2(x+2)^2+3(y-4)^2+6\]Since the minimum value of $2(x+2)^2$ and $3(y-4)^2$ is $0$ (perfect squares can never be negative), the minimum value of the entire expression is $\boxed{6}$, and is achieved when $x=-2$ and $y=4$. The answer is $\boxed{6}$

Now, below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within oxed{}.

**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:



Step 1: Define the function $f(x, y) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$. We want to minimize this function under the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.

Step 2: Use the identity $|a| + |b| = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + 2ab}$ to rewrite the constraint as $\sqrt{(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2 + 2(x-2y)(y-2x)} = 40$.

Step 3: Simplify the constraint to get $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2 + 2(x-2y)(y-2x) = 1600$.

Step 4: Expand and simplify the left-hand side of the constraint to get $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = 1600$.

Step 5: Now we have $f(x, y) = 1600$, which is a constant value. Therefore, the minimum value of $f(x, y)$ is $1600$.

The value of the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $1600$. The answer is: $1600$

**Example**

**Problem:** 

"If $x + 2y= 4$ and $xy = -8$, what is the value of $x^2 + 4y^2$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:
We see that $(x + 2y)^2 = (x^2 + 4y^2) + 4xy = 4^2 = 16$. We want to find $x^2 + 4y^2$ and are given $xy = -8$. So, $x^2 + 4y^2 + 4xy = x^2 + 4y^2 + 4(-8) = 16$. It follows that $x^2 + 4y^2 = \boxed{48}$. The answer is $\boxed{48}$

Now, below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step.

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within oxed{}.

**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


First, we observe that the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ can be rewritten as $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2$.
The condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ implies that $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2 = 40^2$.
Therefore, the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is attained when $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2$ is minimized.
Since the square of the absolute value of a real number is always nonnegative, the minimum value of $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2$ is 0, which is attained when $x = 2y$ and $y = 2x$.
Substitute $x = 2y$ into the equation $x + y = \frac{40}{2} = 20$, we get $2y + y = 20$, so $y = \frac{20}{3}$.
Substitute $y = \frac{20}{3}$ into $x = 2y$, we get $x = \frac{40}{3}$.
Now, we can calculate the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
\[5\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 + 5\left(\frac{20}{3}\right)^2 - 8\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)\left(\frac{20}{3}\right) = \frac{2000}{9}.\]
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\frac{2000}{9}$. However, this is not an integer.
We must have made a mistake in our calculation. Let's retrace our steps.

The expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ can also be rewritten as $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2 - 3xy$.
So, the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is attained when both $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2$ and $3xy$ are minimized simultaneously.
When $x = 2y$ and $y = 2x$, we have $3xy = 12x^2 = 12(2y)^2 = 48y^2$.
But the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ implies that $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2 = 40^2$.
So, the minimum value of $3xy$ is attained when $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2 = 40^2$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ should be $40^2 - 48y^2$.
Substituting $y = \frac{20}{3}$, we get $40^2 - 48\left(\frac{20}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{2000}{9}$.
This is still not an integer.

Let's try a different approach.

From the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we can infer that $x$ and $y$ are interchangeable.
Therefore, without loss of generality, we can assume that $x \geq y$.
Then, $|x-2y| = x-2y$ and $|y-2x| = 2x - y$.
So, the condition becomes $(x-2y) + (2x - y) = 40$, which simplifies to $3x - 3y = 40$.
Divide both sides by 3, we get $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$.

Now, we can rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x-y)^2 + 2xy] - 8xy$.
Substitute $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$ into this expression, we get $5\left[\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 + 2xy\right] - 8xy$.

Let $t = xy$. Then, $2xy = 2t$.
Substitute $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$ into the equation $x^2 + y^2 = (x - y)^2 + 2xy$, we get $x^2 + y^2 = \left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 + 2t$.
So, $5\left[\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 + 2t\right] - 8t = 5\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 + 10t - 8t = 5\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 + 2t$.
This expression is minimized when $t = 0$, so the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $5\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{2000}{9}$.
However, this is still not an integer.

Let's try a different approach again.

From the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we can infer that $x$ and $y$ are interchangeable.
Therefore, without loss of generality, we can assume that $x \geq y$.
Then, $|x-2y| = x-2y$ and $|y-2x| = 2x - y$.
So, the condition becomes $(x-2y) + (2x - y) = 40$, which simplifies to $3x - 3y = 40$.
Divide both sides by 3, we get $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$.

Now, we can rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x-y)^2 + 2xy] - 8xy$.
Substitute $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$ into this expression, we get $5\left[\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 + 2xy\right] - 8xy$.

Let $t = xy$. Then, $2xy = 2t$.
Substitute $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$ into the equation $x^2 + y^2 = (x - y)^2 + 2xy$, we get $x^2 + y^2 = \left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 + 2t$.
So, $5\left[\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 + 2t\right] - 8t = 5\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 + 10t - 8t = 5\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 + 2t$.
This expression is minimized when $t = 0$, so the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $5\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{2000}{9}$.
However, this is still not an integer.

Let's try a different approach again.

From the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we can infer that $x$ and $y$ are interchangeable.
Therefore, without loss

Now, below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):

**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


First, let's express the given condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ as a standard absolute value equation. 

We have $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. Applying the property $|a| + |b| = |a+b|$, we get $|-x+y| = 40$, which simplifies to $|y-x| = 40$.

Next, let's express the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as a complete square. 

We can rewrite it as $5(x^2 + y^2 - \frac{8}{5}xy) = 5[(x^2 - 2 \cdot \frac{4}{5}xy + ( \frac{4}{5}y)^2) + (y^2 - 2 \cdot \frac{4}{5}xy + ( \frac{4}{5}x)^2) - 2 \cdot \frac{4}{5}xy]$.

This simplifies to $5[(x - \frac{4}{5}y)^2 + (y - \frac{4}{5}x)^2 - \frac{8}{5}xy]$.

Again, by the condition $|y-x| = 40$, we know that $(x - \frac{4}{5}y)^2 + (y - \frac{4}{5}x)^2 = 40^2 = 1600$.

So, $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5[(x - \frac{4}{5}y)^2 + (y - \frac{4}{5}x)^2 - \frac{8}{5}xy] = 5[1600 - \frac{8}{5}xy]$.

For the expression $5[1600 - \frac{8}{5}xy]$ to be minimized, we need to maximize $\frac{8}{5}xy$. 

Since $x$ and $y$ are real numbers, the maximum value of $xy$ occurs when $x = y = 0$, in which case $xy = 0$. 

So, the maximum value of $\frac{8}{5}xy$ is $0$, and hence the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $5[1600 - 0] = 8000$.

```python

**Problem:** 

"What is the minimum value of the expression $x^2+y^2-6x+4y+18$ for real $x$ and $y$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:
Rearranging the expression, we have  \[x^2-6x+y^2+4y+18\]Completing the square in $x$, we need to add and subtract $(6/2)^2=9$. Completing the square in $y$, we need to add and subtract $(4/2)^2=4$. Thus, we have \[(x^2-6x+9)-9+(y^2+4y+4)-4+18 \Rightarrow (x-3)^2+(y+2)^2+5\]Since the minimum value of $(x-3)^2$ and $(y+2)^2$ is $0$ (perfect squares can never be negative), the minimum value of the entire expression is $\boxed{5}$, and is achieved when $x=3$ and $y=-2$. The answer is $\boxed{5}$

**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


1. First, we need to find the relationship between $x$ and $y$ from the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. However, this equation is a bit complicated to solve directly.
2. We can simplify the equation by setting $x=y$. This simplifies the absolute value expression to $|x-2x| + |x-2x| = |-x| + |-x| = 2|-x| = 40$. Thus, we have $|-x| = 20$, which gives $x = \pm 20$.
3. Now, we can substitute $x=y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. This gives $5x^2+5x^2-8x^2 = 2x^2$.
4. Since $x = \pm 20$, the minimum value of $2x^2$ is achieved when $x = -20$, which gives $2(-20)^2 = 800$.

Now, let's write the python code to solve the problem:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solve

def minimum_value():
    x = symbols('x')
