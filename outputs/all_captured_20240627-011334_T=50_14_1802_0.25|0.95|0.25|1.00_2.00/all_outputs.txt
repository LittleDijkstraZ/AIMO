**Problem:** 
"The smallest distance between the origin and a point on the parabola $y=x^2-5$ can be expressed as $\sqrt{a}/b$, where $a$ and $b$ are positive integers, and $a$ is not divisible by the square of any prime.  Find $a+b$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the distance formula, we are trying to minimize $\sqrt{x^2+y^2}=\sqrt{x^2+x^4-10x^2+25}$. In general minimization problems like this require calculus, but one elementary optimization method that sometimes works is completing the square.  We have $$\sqrt{x^2+x^4-10x^2+25}=\sqrt{(x^2-9/2)^2+(25-81/4)}.$$This expression is minimized when the square equals $0$, i.e. when $x=\pm 3/\sqrt{2}.$ For this value of $x$, the distance is $$\sqrt{25-\frac{81}{4}}=\frac{\sqrt{19}}{2}.$$Hence the desired answer is $\boxed{21}$. The answer is $\boxed{21}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve, sqrt

def calculate_distances():
    # Define the variables
    x, k, l = symbols('x k l')

    # Define the equation of the parabola
    parabola = k*x**2 - 2*k*x + l

    # Define the equation of the line
    line = 4

    # Solve the system of equations to find the points of intersection
    intersection_points = solve([Eq(parabola, line), parabola.diff(x) == 0], (x, k, l))

    # Calculate the distance between the points of intersection
    distance = 6
    distance_squared = distance**2

    # Calculate the sum of the squares of the distances from A and B to the origin
    sum_of_squares = 0
    for point in intersection_points:
        distance_to_origin_squared = point[0]**2 + point[1]**2
        sum_of_squares += distance_to_origin_squared

    return sum_of_squares

result = calculate_distances()
print(result)
```

The above code is incorrect because it does not take into account the condition that the points of intersection are distance 6 apart. We need to modify the code to find the values of $k$ and $l$ that satisfy this condition.

The above code still gives 0 as the result, which is incorrect. This is because the code does not correctly calculate the sum of the squares of the distances from A and B to the origin. We need to modify the code to calculate the distance from each point of intersection to the origin and then sum the squares of these distances.
