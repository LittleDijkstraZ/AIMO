"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step.

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Approach:


The equation is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. The only way this equation can be equal to zero is if either of the two terms is equal to zero. This gives us two systems of equations to solve:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
For the first system, $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8, \vert y \vert = 8$. This implies $-8 \leq x, y \leq 8$ and $x + y = \pm 10$. The solutions to this system are the vertices of a square with side length 8.
For the second system, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8, \vert y \vert = 8$. This implies $-8 \leq x, y \leq 8$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. The solutions to this system are the same vertices of the square.
Therefore, the points satisfying the equation form a square with side length 8. The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$. The answer is: $64$

QUESTION 3 - 1 - TIME_SPENT : 602 secs
1_User: Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Approach:


The problem involves solving an equation and then finding the area of the polygon formed by the solutions.

1. First, we need to solve the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

2. This equation is equal to zero if either of the two factors is equal to zero. So we have two cases to consider:

   a. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
   b. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

3. For case (a), both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ must be equal to 0. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(2, 8)$, $(2, -8)$, $(-2, 8)$, $(-2, -8)$, $(10, 0)$, and $(0, 10)$.

4. For case (b), both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2$ must be equal to 0. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. Solving these equations gives us the same vertices: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(2, 8)$, $(2, -8)$, $(-2, 8)$, $(-2, -8)$, $(10, 0)$, and $(0, 10)$.

5. Now we need to find the area of the polygon formed by these vertices. The polygon is a square with side length 10. The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of this polygon is $10^2 = 100$.

The answer is: $100$

2_User: Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.



The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term or the second term must be zero.
The first term, $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, being zero means that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.
The second term, $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$, being zero means that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.
The intersection points of these lines are the vertices of the polygon. By calculating these intersection points, we find that the polygon is a square with side length 16.
The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256.
The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.



The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So, in the given equation, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
For the first equation to be zero, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the four vertices of the square: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$.
For the second equation to be zero, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. But this is already taken care of by the first equation.
So the points that satisfy the equation are the vertices of the square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:


The given equation is of the form $f(x, y) \cdot g(x, y) = 0$. For the product of two expressions to be zero, one of the expressions must be zero. This gives us two conditions:

1. $f(x, y) = 0$.
2. $g(x, y) = 0$.

We can solve each condition separately and then find the intersection of the solutions to get the vertices of the polygon. The area of the polygon can then be found using the shoelace formula.

```python

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.



The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, which means that either of the terms must be zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two squares with side length 10, centered at the origin.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two squares with side length 16, centered at the origin.

The intersection of these squares forms a regular octagon with side length 8. The area of a regular octagon with side length $a$ is $\frac{2a^2(1 + \sqrt{2})}{1}$. Substituting $a = 8$ into this formula gives the area of the octagon as $\frac{2 \cdot 8^2(1 + \sqrt{2})}{1} = 128(1 + \sqrt{2})$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $128(1 + \sqrt{2})$.

```python

    area = 2 * a**2 * (1 + sqrt(2))

The area of the convex polygon is $128(1 + \sqrt{2})$. However, it seems that there is a mistake in the calculation. The correct area of the regular octagon with side length 8 is $\frac{2a^2(1 + \sqrt{2})}{1}$ = $\frac{2 \cdot 8^2(1 + \sqrt{2})}{1}$ = $128(1 + \sqrt{2})$, but this expression simplifies to $128 + 128\sqrt{2}$, not $128 + 128 \cdot 2$. The correct calculation is $\frac{2 \cdot 8^2(1 + \sqrt{2})}{1}$ = $128(1 + \sqrt{2})$, which simplifies to $128 + 128\sqrt{2}$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $128 + 128\sqrt{2}$.

QUESTION 3 - 6 - TIME_SPENT : 602 secs
6_User: Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.



The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if either of the following equations is satisfied:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From equation 1., we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$. These lines intersect at $(5, 5)$.

From equation 2., we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$. These lines form a square with vertices at $(8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, $(-8, 0)$, and $(0, -8)$.

The convex polygon is a square with side length $10$. To find its area, we simply square the length of its side: $10^2 = 100$. The area of the convex polygon is $100$.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Approach:


1. The equation $AB=0$ holds if and only if either $A=0$ or $B=0$.
2. Therefore, we can break the given equation into two separate equations: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
3. The solution to $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ is $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which gives us two lines: $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.
4. The solution to $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ is $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.
5. The points that satisfy both equations are the intersections of these lines.
6. By plotting these lines, we find that they enclose a square with side length 16.
7. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

Here's a Python script to calculate the area of the square:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def square_area():
    side_length = 16
