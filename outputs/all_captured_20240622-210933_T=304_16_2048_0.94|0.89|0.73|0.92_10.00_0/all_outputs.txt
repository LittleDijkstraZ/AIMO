Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, we can notice that the expression will be equal to zero if either of the terms is zero. This means that we have four cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
4. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

Now, let's consider each case:

1. From $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us the vertices of the rectangle with sides parallel to the axes and vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

2. From $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us the vertices of the square with side length 10 and vertices at $(5, 5)$, $(5, -5)$, $(-5, 5)$, and $(-5, -5)$.

3. From $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us the vertices of the rectangle with sides parallel to the axes and vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$, which is the same as in case 1.

4. From $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and either $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us the vertices of the square with side length 10 and vertices at $(5, 5)$, $(5, -5)$, $(-5, 5)$, and $(-5, -5)$, which is the same as in case 2.

Therefore, all four cases lead to the same polygon, which is a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The problem statement is an equation that equals zero. The only way an equation equals zero is if one of its factors equals zero. Therefore, we can split the problem into two separate sets of equations:

$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$$
$$((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$

2. Each of these equations represents a circle in the coordinate plane. The first equation represents a circle centered at $(0, 0)$ with radius $10$. The second equation represents a circle centered at $(0, 0)$ with radius $8$.

3. The intersection of these two circles is the set of points that satisfy the original equation. The intersection of the two circles is a square with side length $8\sqrt{2}$.

4. To find the area of the square, we simply square the length of one side:

$$Area = (8\sqrt{2})^2 = 128$$

Since $128$ is a positive integer, we have found the area of the convex polygon.
The answer is: $128$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $f(x, y) = 0$ where $f(x, y) = ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ defines a set of points that enclose a convex polygon. To find the area of this polygon, we can simply evaluate this expression and find the area.

Step 1: Identify the sympy functions required for each step.

We will use the `abs` function from the `sympy` library to calculate the absolute values of $x+y$, $x-y$, $x$, and $y$. We will use the `Piecewise` function to create the absolute value expressions.

Step 2: Implement these functions step-by-step, commenting each line for clarity.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Piecewise, simplify

def calculate_area():
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # Define the absolute value expressions
    abs_x_plus_y = Piecewise((x + y, x + y >= 0), -(x + y), x + y < 0)
    abs_x_minus_y = Piecewise((x - y, x - y >= 0), -(x - y), x - y < 0)
    abs_x = Piecewise((x, x >= 0), -(x), x < 0)
    abs_y = Piecewise((y, y >= 0), -(y), y < 0)

    # Define the function f(x, y)
    f = ((abs_x_plus_y - 10)**2 + (abs_x_minus_y - 10)**2) * ((abs_x - 8)**2 + (abs_y - 8)**2)

    # Simplify the function
    f = simplify(f)

    return f

f = calculate_area()
print(f)
```

It seems like we have a problem here. The function `calculate_area()` is not working as expected. The issue is that we are trying to use the `Piecewise` function to create absolute value expressions, but the `Piecewise` function is not designed to handle expressions like `abs_x_plus_y - 10`.

Instead, we should use the `Abs` function from the `sympy` library to create the absolute value expressions. Let's modify the function accordingly:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Abs, simplify

def calculate_area():
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # Define the absolute value expressions
    abs_x_plus_y = Abs(x + y)
    abs_x_minus_y = Abs(x - y)
    abs_x = Abs(x)
    abs_y = Abs(y)

    # Define the function f(x, y)
    f = ((abs_x_plus_y - 10)**2 + (abs_x_minus_y - 10)**2) * ((abs_x - 8)**2 + (abs_y - 8)**2)

    # Simplify the function
    f = simplify(f)

    return f

f = calculate_area()
print(f)
```

CODE RESULTS ((Abs(x) - 8)**2 + (Abs(y) - 8)**2)*((Abs(x - y) - 10)**2 + (Abs(x + y) - 10)**2)

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
((Abs(x) - 8)**2 + (Abs(y) - 8)**2)*((Abs(x - y) - 10)**2 + (Abs(x + y) - 10)**2)
```
The output is correct, but it's not equal to zero. The expression $f(x, y) = 0$ defines a set of points that enclose a convex polygon, but the area of this polygon cannot be directly calculated from the expression $f(x, y) = ((Abs(x) - 8)**2 + (Abs(y) - 8)**2)*((Abs(x - y) - 10)**2 + (Abs(x + y) - 10)**2)$.

However, if we analyze the expression $f(x, y) = 0$, we can see that it is equal to zero if and only if both $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$ and $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. The first equation is satisfied if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies that $x = y = 5$ or $x = -y = 5$. The second equation is satisfied if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that $x = 8$ or $x = -8$ and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

Therefore, the set of points that satisfy $f(x, y) = 0$ are the points $(5, 5)$, $(-5, -5)$, $(8, 0)$, $(-8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, and $(0, -8)$. These points form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

Step 3: Calculate the final answer and verify it's a positive integer.

The area of the convex polygon is 100, which is a positive integer.

Step 4: Output the result within the required format.

The area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: 100

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to the following system of equations:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From equation 1, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$.
From equation 2, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
From equation 3, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$.
From equation 4, we have $\vert y \vert = 8$.

Now, we can analyze the solutions to these equations.

For equations 3 and 4, the solutions are straightforward: $x = 8$ or $x = -8$, and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

For equations 1 and 2, we have the absolute values equaling 10. The absolute value function $\vert a \vert = b$ has two solutions: $a = b$ and $a = -b$. So we have four cases for each equation:

1. $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$
2. $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$

Now we can solve these equations for $x$ and $y$. For example, from equation 1a, we have $y = 10 - x$. Substituting this into equation 2a gives $x - (10 - x) = 10$, which simplifies to $2x = 20$ and $x = 10$. Then, $y = 10 - 10 = 0$. So one solution is $(x, y) = (10, 0)$.

Similarly, we can find all the solutions:

1. $x + y = 10$ gives $(x, y) = (10, 0)$
2. $x + y = -10$ gives $(x, y) = (-10, -20)$, which is not within the range of absolute value, so we discard it.
3. $x - y = 10$ gives $(x, y) = (15, 5)$
4. $x - y = -10$ gives $(x, y) = (-5, -15)$, which is not within the range of absolute value, so we discard it.

So the solutions are $(10, 0)$ and $(15, 5)$. These points form a rectangle with vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$, and sides parallel to the axes. The length of the rectangle is $15 - (-8) = 23$ and the width is $8 - 0 = 8$. The area of the rectangle is $23 \times 8 = 184$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 184. The answer is: $184$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:


The expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ can only be zero if both $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These conditions imply that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us four pairs of $(x, y)$: $(5, 5)$, $(-5, -5)$, $(5, -5)$, and $(-5, 5)$.
Similarly, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us four more pairs: $(8, 0)$, $(-8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, and $(0, -8)$.
The intersection of these two sets of points is just the four corner points of the square with vertices at $(5, 5)$, $(-5, -5)$, $(5, -5)$, and $(-5, 5)$. The side length of this square is $10$, so its area is $10^2 = 100$. Thus, the area of the convex polygon is $100$.
The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, which implies that each term must be zero. So we have two systems of equations:
   (a) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
   (b) $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$

2. From system (a), we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are:
   (i) For $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, we get $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.
   (ii) For $\vert x \vert = 8$, we get $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.
   (iii) For $\vert y \vert = 8$, we get $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

3. From system (b), we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to this equation are the same as for $\vert x + y \vert = 10$.

4. Now we need to find the intersections of these solutions to get the vertices of the polygon. We can do this by solving the systems of equations formed by the combinations of the solutions from step 2.

5. Finally, we can find the area of the polygon by using the coordinates of the vertices and a formula for the area of a polygon.

Now let's use sympy to find the area:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solve, Abs

def polygon_area():
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # Find the vertices of the polygon

        for y_val in [8, -8]:
            if Abs(x_val + y_val) == 10 and Abs(x_val - y_val) == 10:
                vertices.append((x_val, y_val))

    # Calculate the area of the polygon
    area = 0
    for i in range(len(vertices)):
        j = (i + 1) % len(vertices)
        area += vertices[i][0]*vertices[j][1] - vertices[j][0]*vertices[i][1]

    return Abs(area / 2)

result = polygon_area()
print(result)

This result seems incorrect. Let's try a different approach.

The points that satisfy the given equation are the intersections of the four circles:
1. $(x+y)^2 = 100$,
2. $(x-y)^2 = 100$,
3. $x^2 = 64$, and
4. $y^2 = 64$.

The first two circles have centers at $(0, 10)$ and $(0, -10)$ with radius 10, and the last two circles have centers at $(8, 0)$ and $(-8, 0)$ with radius 8.

The polygon is a square with side length 16 (twice the distance from the origin to either of the points $(8, 8)$ or $(-8, -8)$). So, its area is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256.
The answer is: $256$.
