Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

1. First, we need to find the points of intersection of the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ and the line $y = 4$. To do this, we set the two equations equal to each other and solve for $x$:

$$4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l.$$

Rearranging terms, we get:

$$kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0.$$

This is a quadratic equation, and we know that it has two solutions (the points of intersection), which we'll call $x_1$ and $x_2$. The distance between these two points is given as 6, so we have:

$$|x_2 - x_1| = 6.$$

From the quadratic formula, we know that the solutions to the equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ are given by:

$$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}.$$

In our case, $a = k$, $b = -2k$, and $c = l - 4$. So we have:

$$x = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{(-2k)^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k} = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k} = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}}{2k}.$$

The distance between the two solutions is:

$$|x_2 - x_1| = \frac{|\sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}|}{k} = 6.$$

Squaring both sides, we get:

$$\frac{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}{k^2} = 36.$$

Simplifying, we have:

$$4k - 4l + 16 = 36k.$$

Rearranging terms, we get:

$$32k = 4l + 16,$$

or

$$8k = l + 4.$$

2. Now, we need to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The coordinates of $A$ and $B$ are $(x_1, 4)$ and $(x_2, 4)$, respectively. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is given by $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. So the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin are $\sqrt{x_1^2 + 4^2}$ and $\sqrt{x_2^2 + 4^2}$, respectively. The sum of the squares of these distances is:

$$(\sqrt{x_1^2 + 4^2})^2 + (\sqrt{x_2^2 + 4^2})^2 = x_1^2 + 16 + x_2^2 + 16 = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32.$$

3. We know that $(x_1 + x_2)^2 - 4x_1x_2 = (x_2 - x_1)^2$, so we can substitute the value of $x_2 - x_1 = 6$:

$$(x_1 + x_2)^2 - 4x_1x_2 = 36.$$

From the quadratic formula, we know that $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{-b}{a} = \frac{2k}{-k} = -2$. So we have:

$$(-2)^2 - 4x_1x_2 = 36,$$

or

$$4 - 4x_1x_2 = 36,$$

or

$$4x_1x_2 = -32.$$

Since $x_1x_2 = \frac{c}{a} = \frac{l - 4}{k}$, we have:

$$4\frac{l - 4}{k} = -32,$$

or

$$l - 4 = -8k.$$

Substituting $l = 8k - 4$ into the equation $8k = l + 4$, we get:

$$8k = (8k - 4) + 4,$$

or

$$8k = 8k,$$

which is true. So the values of $l$ and $k$ are consistent.

4. Now we can find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin:

$$x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32.$$

We know that $(x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = (x_1^2 + x_2^2)$, so we can substitute the values of $x_1 + x_2 = -2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k} = \frac{4k - 4}{k} = 4 - 4 = 0$:

$$(-2)^2 - 2*0 = 4,$$

so $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = 4$. Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is:

$$4 + 32 = 36.$$

So the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is 36. The answer is: $36$
