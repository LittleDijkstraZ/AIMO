Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The expression $A \cdot B = 0$ implies that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the given equation is satisfied if either of the following two conditions is true:

1. $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$
2. $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$

For the first condition to be true, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ and their reflections in the axes. These lines form a square with side length 10.

For the second condition to be true, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$ and their reflections in the axes. Similarly, it gives us the lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$ and their reflections in the axes. These lines form a square with side length 16.

The points that satisfy either condition lie within the larger square. Therefore, the convex polygon formed by the intersection of these squares is also a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

 The problem statement asks for the area of a convex polygon enclosed by the points that satisfy the given equation.

The equation is: $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

The only way for the product of two numbers to be zero is if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which is only possible when $x = 0$ and $y = 0$.

The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which is only possible when $-8 \leq x \leq 8$ and $-8 \leq y \leq 8$.

So, the points that satisfy the equation are all the points in a square with side length 16 centered at the origin. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The equation given in the problem, $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$, is true if and only if at least one of the factors is zero. This happens if and only if either $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The equations $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$ represent four squares on the coordinate plane. The square formed by $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ has side length 20, the square formed by $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ has side length 20, the square formed by $\vert x \vert = 8$ has side length 16, and the square formed by $\vert y \vert = 8$ has side length 16.

The intersection of these squares is the convex polygon we are interested in. This polygon is a square with side length 8, since the square formed by $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and the square formed by $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ both contain the square formed by $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 64.

Here's a Python function that calculates the area of the convex polygon:

```python

    side_length = 8
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = polygon_area()

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 This problem is asking for the area of a convex polygon enclosed by the points that satisfy a given equation. The equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

If the product of two numbers is zero, then at least one of the numbers must be zero. So, we have two cases:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first case, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two lines that form a rectangle.

For the second case, either $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This means $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two more lines that form a rectangle.

The intersection of these two rectangles is the convex polygon we are looking for. The area of this polygon is the product of the lengths of its sides. The sides of the first rectangle have length 20 (from $-10$ to $10$ along the $x+y$ and $x-y$ axes), and the sides of the second rectangle have length 16 (from $-8$ to $8$ along the $x$ and $y$ axes). Therefore, the area of the polygon is $20 \times 16 = 320$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 320. The answer is: $320$

The given equation is of the form $AB = 0$, where $A$ and $B$ are two expressions. This implies that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$.
So, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(20, 0)$, and $(-20, 0)$.
If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square $(8, 0)$, $(-8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, and $(0, -8)$.
Combining these two squares, we find that the area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares, which is $2(8 \times 8) = 128$.

To solve this problem, we first need to understand the given equation and the conditions it imposes on $x$ and $y$.

The equation is of the form $(A)(B) = 0$, which implies that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. 

So we have two sets of conditions:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, or $x + y = \pm 10$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, or $x - y = \pm 10$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $x = \pm 8$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert y \vert = 8$, or $y = \pm 8$.

The solutions to these conditions form a rectangle with vertices at $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$. The sides of this rectangle have lengths $16$ and $16$, so the area of this rectangle is $16 \times 16 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon formed by the solutions is $256$. The answer is: $256$

 The expression $A \cdot B = 0$ is true if and only if either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$. Similarly, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ implies $x - y = \pm 10$. Also, $\vert x \vert = 8$ implies $x = \pm 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$ implies $y = \pm 8$.

The four lines $x + y = \pm 10$, $x - y = \pm 10$, $x = \pm 8$, and $y = \pm 8$ form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

 The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.
The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, which equals zero only when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two lines in the coordinate plane, forming a square with side length 20.
The second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$, which equals zero only when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two more lines in the coordinate plane, forming a square with side length 16.
The area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points satisfying the original equation is the sum of the areas of the two squares.
The area of a square with side length $s$ is $s^2$, so the area of the larger square is $20^2 = 400$, and the area of the smaller square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the total area is $400 + 256 = 656$. The answer is: $656$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 This problem seems to be a bit tricky to solve directly. Let's think about the properties of absolute value functions and how they relate to this problem.

Firstly, for a product to be zero, at least one of the factors must be zero. So, we have two cases to consider:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, or $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle with side lengths 20 in the x and y directions.

For the second case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, or $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length 16.

The intersection of these two sets of lines is the convex polygon enclosed by the points $(x, y)$ satisfying the original equation. This polygon is a smaller square that is contained within the rectangle.

To find the side length of the smaller square, we need to find the distance between the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ (or equivalently, the distance between the lines $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$), or the distance between the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$ (or equivalently, the distance between the lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$).

The distance between the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ can be found by observing that the line $x = y$ bisects the angle between these two lines. The intersection of the line $x = y$ with the line $x + y = 10$ is the point $(5, 5)$, and the intersection of the line $x = y$ with the line $x - y = 10$ is the point $(5, -5)$. The distance between these two points is $\sqrt{(5 - (-5))^2 + (5 - 5)^2} = \sqrt{10^2} = 10$. Therefore, the side length of the smaller square is 10 - 8 = 2.

Finally, the area of the smaller square is $2^2 = 4$. So, the area of the convex polygon is 4 square units.

The solution is:
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    # Side length of the smaller square
    side_length = 10 - 8

    # Area of the smaller square
    area = side_length ** 2

3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8$
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert y \vert = 8$

From 1 and 2, we have four lines: $x + y = \pm10$ and $x - y = \pm10$.
From 3 and 4, we have four more lines: $x = \pm8$ and $y = \pm8$.

The eight lines form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if either of the two factors is zero.
For the first factor to be zero, we need both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$, which are the equations of four lines.
For the second factor to be zero, we need both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$, which are the equations of four lines.
The intersection points of these lines are the vertices of the polygon.
By analyzing the intersections, we find that the polygon is a square with side length 16.
The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side, so the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256.
The answer is: 256
