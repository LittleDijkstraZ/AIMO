**Problem:** 
"If $x + 2y= 4$ and $xy = -8$, what is the value of $x^2 + 4y^2$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
We see that $(x + 2y)^2 = (x^2 + 4y^2) + 4xy = 4^2 = 16$. We want to find $x^2 + 4y^2$ and are given $xy = -8$. So, $x^2 + 4y^2 + 4xy = x^2 + 4y^2 + 4(-8) = 16$. It follows that $x^2 + 4y^2 = \boxed{48}$. The answer is $\boxed{48}$

**Problem:** 
"Find the minimum value of $2x^2 + 2y^2 + 5z^2 - 2xy - 4yz - 4x - 2z + 15$ over all real numbers $x,$ $y,$ $z.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
We can write the given expression as
\begin{align*}
&(x^2 - 4x + 4) + (x^2 - 2xy + y^2) + (y^2 - 4yz + 4z^2) + (z^2 - 2z + 1) + 10 \\
&= (x - 2)^2 + (x - y)^2 + (y - 2z)^2 + (z - 1)^2 + 10
\end{align*}The minimum value is then $\boxed{10},$ which occurs when $x = 2,$ $y = 2,$ and $z = 1.$ The answer is $\boxed{10}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):

**Problem**
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


This problem involves the use of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. The given expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ can be rewritten as $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2$. The condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ implies that $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2 = 40^2 = 1600$.

Now, we know that $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2 \geq 2(x-2y)(y-2x)$, by the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. Therefore, $1600 \geq 2(x-2y)(y-2x)$, or $(x-2y)(y-2x) \leq 800$.

On the other hand, $(x-2y)(y-2x) = - (x-2y)^2 + 4xy - 4y^2 = - (x-2y)^2 + 4(x^2 + y^2 - xy)$. Thus, we have $- (x-2y)^2 + 4(x^2 + y^2 - xy) \leq 800$.

Simplifying this inequality gives $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy \geq - (x-2y)^2 \geq -1600$. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is $-1600$.

However, this is not possible because the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is always non-negative. Let's re-examine our steps.

We know that $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2 = 1600$. By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2 \geq 2(x-2y)(y-2x)$, so $1600 \geq 2(x-2y)(y-2x)$, or $(x-2y)(y-2x) \leq 800$.

On the other hand, $(x-2y)(y-2x) = - (x-2y)^2 + 4xy - 4y^2 = - (x-2y)^2 + 4(x^2 + y^2 - xy)$. Thus, we have $- (x-2y)^2 + 4(x^2 + y^2 - xy) \leq 800$.

Simplifying this inequality gives $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy \geq - (x-2y)^2 \geq 0$. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is $0$.

This is achieved when $x = 2y$ or $y = 2x$. Substituting $x = 2y$ into the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ gives $0 + |y-4y| = 40$, or $|3y| = 40$, which has no solution for real $y$. Similarly, substituting $y = 2x$ into the condition gives $|x-4x| + 0 = 40$, or $|-3x| = 40$, which also has no solution for real $x$.

However, we made a mistake in our reasoning. The correct inequality from the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality is $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2 \geq \frac{1}{2} [(x-2y) + (y-2x)]^2 = \frac{1}{2} (0)^2 = 0$. Therefore, $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2 = 0$ if and only if $x-2y = 0$ and $y-2x = 0$, or $x = 2y$ and $y = 2x$. The only solution to these equations is $x = y = 0$.

Substituting $x = 2y$ and $y = 2x$ into the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ gives $0 + 0 = 40$, which is a contradiction. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is achieved when $x = 2y$ and $y = 2x$, which gives $x = y = 0$. Substituting these values into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ gives $0$. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is $0$.
The answer is: $0$
