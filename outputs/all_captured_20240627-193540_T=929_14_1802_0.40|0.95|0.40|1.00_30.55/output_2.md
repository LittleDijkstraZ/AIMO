**Problem:** 
"How many integers are solutions to the equation $$(x-2)^{(25-x^2)}=1?$$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
We need some basic facts from number theory: $a^0 = 1$ for any $a,$ $1^b = 1$ for any $b,$ and $(-1)^c = 1$ if $c$ is an even integer. Unless the base is a complex number (which is excluded since we are looking for integer solutions), there are no other ways to get an RHS of $1.$ Thus, either the exponent is zero $($giving the equation $25 - x^2 = 0),$ the base is $1$ $($giving $x -2 = 1),$ or the base is $-1$ and the exponent is even $($giving the simultaneous equations $x - 2 = -1$ and $25 - x^2 = 2n$ for some integer $n).$ Solving the first equation gives $x = \pm 5,$ and solving the second gives $x = 3.$ The third equation implies that $x = 1,$ in which case $25 - x^2 = 24$ is indeed even, so $x = 1$ is a valid solution. In all, there are $\boxed{4}$ integer solutions. The answer is $\boxed{4}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**



We will use the `sympy` library to solve this problem. The main steps are as follows:

1. For a given value of $m$, we need to solve the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ and count the number of distinct solutions.
2. We will iterate over the possible values of $m$ from $1$ to $100$ and count the number of distinct solutions for each $m$.
3. We will keep track of the values of $m$ for which the equation has exactly $4$ distinct solutions.

Here is the entire script:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Abs, solveset, S

def count_solutions():
    x = symbols('x')
    solutions_count = 0

    for m in range(1, 101):
        equation = Abs(Abs(x - 1) - 2) - m / 100
        solutions = solveset(equation, x, domain=S.Reals)
        num_solutions = len(solutions)

        if num_solutions == 4:
            solutions_count += 1

    return solutions_count

result = count_solutions()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 100

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
100
```
The value of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $100$.
However, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions.
Since we are only considering the range $1 \leq m \leq 100$, the only possible value of $m$ is $100$.
Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $1$. The answer is $\boxed{1}$.

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The number of distinct solutions to the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $4$ if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $2$, i.e., $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. This implies $100 < m < 200$. The only positive integer $m$ in this range is $101$. Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions. The answer is: $1$

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The problem is asking for how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $0$ and $3$. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ oscillates between $0$ and $3$.

So we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 3$. Multiplying all parts of the inequality by $100$ gives $0 < m < 300$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are $1, 2, \ldots, 299$, making a total of $299$ such integers.

However, we are asked for the number of positive integers $m$, not the number of values of $x$. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have $4$ distinct solutions for each value of $m$ in the range $1$ to $299$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is also $299$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $299$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def count_m():

    lower_bound = 1
    upper_bound = 300

    # The number of positive integers m is equal to the difference between the upper and lower bounds minus 1
    count = upper_bound - lower_bound - 1

    return count

result = count_m()
print(result)
```

```
The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $298$. However, this is a mistake. The problem statement asks for the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions, not the number of values of $x$. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have $4$ distinct solutions for each value of $m$ in the range $1$ to $299$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is also $299$.

The correct answer is $299$.

The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $299$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $299$.

## QUESTION 2 - 3 
- TIME_SPENT : 386 secs

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"For certain ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ of real numbers, the system of equations
\[\begin{aligned} ax+by&=1 \\ x^2 + y^2 &= 50  \end{aligned}\]has at least one solution, and each solution is an ordered pair $(x,y)\,$ of integers. How many such ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ are there?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The graph of $ax+by=1$ is a line, while the graph of $x^2+y^2=50$ is a circle centered at the origin. Therefore, $(a, b)$ satisfies the conditions if and only if the line and circle intersect at least once, and they intersect only at lattice points (points with integer coordinates).

Knowing this, it makes sense to look for lattice points on the circle whose equation is $x^2+y^2=50$. Testing cases, we find that there are twelve lattice points on the circle: $(\pm 1, \pm 7)$, $(\pm 7, \pm 1)$, and $(\pm 5, \pm 5)$ (where the two $\pm$ signs in each pair are independent of each other).

There are $\tbinom{12}{2} = 66$ pairs of these points, and each pair determines a line. However, the graph of $ax+by=1$ can never pass through the origin $(0, 0)$, since if $x=y=0$, then $ax+by=0 \neq 1$. Therefore, the six pairs which consist of diametrically opposed points are invalid, since the line through them passes through the origin. This corrects our count to $66 - 6 = 60$.

In addition, for each of the twelve points, there is a line tangent to the circle at that point, so that the only solution to the system is that one point. This brings the final total to $60 + 12 = \boxed{72}$. The answer is $\boxed{72}$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many distinct solutions are there to the equation $|x-7| = |x+1|$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
If $|x-7| = |x+1|$, then either $x-7 = x+1$ or $x-7 = -(x+1)$.  Simplifying $x-7=x+1$ gives $0=8$, which has no solutions, so no values of $x$ satisfy $x-7 = x+1$.  If $x-7 = -(x+1)$, then $x-7 = -x-1$, so $2x = 6$, which gives $x=3$.  So, there is $\boxed{1}$ solution.

Challenge: See if you can find a quick solution to this problem by simply thinking about the graphs of $y=|x-7|$ and $y=|x+1|$. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Solution:**



To solve this problem, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

We can start by considering the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. This equation is equivalent to the system of equations:

1. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$
2. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$

We can solve each of these equations separately. For the first equation, we have:

$\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$

This equation has two cases:

1.1. $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which gives $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.
1.2. $-(x-1) = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which gives $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Similarly, for the second equation, we have:

$\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$

This equation also has two cases:

2.1. $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which gives $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
2.2. $-(x-1) = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which gives $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Now, we need to find the values of $m$ for which these equations have 4 distinct solutions. This happens when the ranges of the solutions for the four cases do not overlap. 

By analyzing the solutions, we can see that the four cases have the following ranges:

1.1. $x \in \left(3, 3 + \frac{2}{100}\right)$
1.2. $x \in \left(-1 - \frac{2}{100}, -1\right)$
2.1. $x \in \left(3 - \frac{2}{100}, 3\right)$
2.2. $x \in \left(-1, -1 + \frac{2}{100}\right)$

The ranges do not overlap when $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which gives $0 < m < 200$. The positive integers in this range are the numbers from 1 to 199. So, there are 199 possible values for $m$. However, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has exactly 4 distinct solutions.

By analyzing the solutions, we can see that the equation has exactly 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100} = 1$, which gives $m = 100$. So, there is only one value of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 1. The answer is: $1$

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**



The problem asks for how many positive integers $m$ the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is a piecewise function with $4$ cases to consider:

1. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 > 0$, then the equation becomes $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$.
2. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0$, then the equation becomes $-( \vert x-1 \vert -2) = \frac{m}{100}$.
3. If $x-1 > 0$, then the equation becomes $x-1 -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, or $x = 1 + 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.
4. If $x-1 < 0$, then the equation becomes -(x-1 -2) = \frac{m}{100}$, or $x = 1 - 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if the solutions to the equations in cases $3$ and $4$ are distinct.

The solutions to the equations in cases $3$ and $4$ are $x = 1 + 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = 1 - 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, respectively. These simplify to $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

The solutions are distinct if and only if $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 + \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $4 \neq 0$. This is always true, so the solutions are always distinct.

Therefore, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions for all positive integers $m$.

However, we are asked for how many positive integers $m$ the equation has $4$ distinct solutions. Since this is true for all positive integers $m$, the number of such positive integers $m$ is the number of positive integers, which is infinite.

However, the problem asks for a natural number answer. Since there are infinitely many positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions, it is not possible to provide a natural number answer to this question.

The problem seems to be misstated or incomplete. If the problem had asked for how many positive integers $m$ in the range $1 \leq m \leq 100$ the equation has $4$ distinct solutions, we could have answered that question.

However, even in that case, the problem is still not well-defined. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions for all positive integers $m$ in the range $1 \leq m \leq 100$. Therefore, the number of such positive integers $m$ is $100$.

So, if we assume the problem meant to ask for the number of positive integers $m$ in the range $1 \leq m \leq 100$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions, the answer is $100$.

Let's think step by step:
The graph of $ax+by=1$ is a line, while the graph of $x^2+y^2=50$ is a circle centered at the origin. Therefore, $(a, b)$ satisfies the conditions if and only if the line and circle intersect at least once, and they intersect only at lattice points (points with integer coordinates).

Knowing this, it makes sense to look for lattice points on the circle whose equation is $x^2+y^2=50$. Testing cases, we find that there are twelve lattice points on the circle: $(\pm 1, \pm 7)$, $(\pm 7, \pm 1)$, and $(\pm 5, \pm 5)$ (where the two $\pm$ signs in each pair are independent of each other).

There are $\tbinom{12}{2} = 66$ pairs of these points, and each pair determines a line. However, the graph of $ax+by=1$ can never pass through the origin $(0, 0)$, since if $x=y=0$, then $ax+by=0 \neq 1$. Therefore, the six pairs which consist of diametrically opposed points are invalid, since the line through them passes through the origin. This corrects our count to $66 - 6 = 60$.

In addition, for each of the twelve points, there is a line tangent to the circle at that point, so that the only solution to the system is that one point. This brings the final total to $60 + 12 = \boxed{72}$. The answer is $\boxed{72}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solve

def count_solutions():
    """For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"""
    x = symbols('x')
    m_values = []

    for m in range(1, 101):
        # Solve the equation for each value of m
        solutions = solve(abs(abs(x - 1) - 2) - m/100, x)
        # Count the number of distinct solutions
        num_solutions = len(set(solutions))
        # If there are 4 distinct solutions, add the value of m to the list
        if num_solutions == 4:
            m_values.append(m)

    return len(m_values)

result = count_solutions()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 100

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
100
```
The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $100$. The answer is $\boxed{100}$.
