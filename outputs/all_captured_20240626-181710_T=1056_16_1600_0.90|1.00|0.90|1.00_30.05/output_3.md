0_**Problem:** 

"Let $P_0(x) = x^3 + 313x^2 - 77x - 8\,$ .  For integers $n \ge 1\,$ , define $P_n(x) = P_{n - 1}(x - n)\,$ .  What is the coefficient of $x\,$ in $P_{20}(x)\,$"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:
Notice that \begin{align*}P_{20}(x) &= P_{19}(x - 20)\\ &= P_{18}((x - 20) - 19)\\ &= P_{17}(((x - 20) - 19) - 18)\\ &= \cdots\\ &= P_0(x - (20 + 19 + 18 + \ldots + 2 + 1)).\end{align*}
Using the formula for the sum of the first $n$ numbers, $1 + 2 + \cdots + 20 = \frac{20(20+1)}{2} = 210$ . Therefore, \[P_{20}(x) = P_0(x - 210).\]
Substituting $x - 210$ into the function definition, we get $P_0(x-210) = (x - 210)^3 + 313(x - 210)^2 - 77(x - 210) - 8$ . We only need the coefficients of the linear terms, which we can find by the binomial theorem
Adding up the coefficients, we get $630 \cdot 210 - 626 \cdot 210 - 77 = \boxed{763}$ The answer is $\boxed{763}$

**Problem:** 

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:



The expression equals zero if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The first two equations are satisfied if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which describes a square with side length 10. The last two equations are satisfied if $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$, which describes a square with side length 16.

The intersection of these two squares is a smaller square of side length 8. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of the larger square minus the area of the smaller square, which is $10^2 - 8^2 = 100 - 64 = 36$. The answer is $\boxed{36}$.

1_**Problem:** 

"Let $P_0(x) = x^3 + 313x^2 - 77x - 8\,$ .  For integers $n \ge 1\,$ , define $P_n(x) = P_{n - 1}(x - n)\,$ .  What is the coefficient of $x\,$ in $P_{20}(x)\,$"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:
Notice that \begin{align*}P_{20}(x) &= P_{19}(x - 20)\\ &= P_{18}((x - 20) - 19)\\ &= P_{17}(((x - 20) - 19) - 18)\\ &= \cdots\\ &= P_0(x - (20 + 19 + 18 + \ldots + 2 + 1)).\end{align*}
Using the formula for the sum of the first $n$ numbers, $1 + 2 + \cdots + 20 = \frac{20(20+1)}{2} = 210$ . Therefore, \[P_{20}(x) = P_0(x - 210).\]
Substituting $x - 210$ into the function definition, we get $P_0(x-210) = (x - 210)^3 + 313(x - 210)^2 - 77(x - 210) - 8$ . We only need the coefficients of the linear terms, which we can find by the binomial theorem

Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:



First, we need to understand that if the product of two numbers is zero, then at least one of the numbers must be zero. Therefore, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first equation to be zero, both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only way this can be true is if $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$.

For the second equation to be zero, both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The only way this can be true is if $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

Therefore, the points that satisfy the equation are $(8, 8), (-8, 8), (8, -8),$ and $(-8, -8)$. These points form a square with side length 16. The area of the square is $16^2 = \boxed{256}$. The answer is $\boxed{256}$.

**Problem:** 

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:



The product of two numbers is zero only when either one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied when either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The first equation, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, can only be true when both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two lines: $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, and their intersection forms a square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$.

The second equation, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, can only be true when both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This is the equation of a square with side length $16$ centered at the origin.

The two squares intersect at the four points where $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$, which are $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$. These points form a larger square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$, which contains the smaller square with side length $16$.

The area of the smaller square is $16^2 = 256$ square units, and the area of the larger square is $(10\sqrt{2})^2 = 200$ square units. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon formed by the intersection of the two squares is the difference of these two areas, which is $200 - 256 = -56$.

However, the area of a polygon cannot be negative. This means that we have made a mistake in our calculations.

Let's try to find the point of intersection between the two squares. The points where $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ satisfy the system of equations $\begin{cases} x + y = 10 \\ x = \pm 8 \end{cases}$ or $\begin{cases} x + y = -10 \\ x = \pm 8 \end{cases}$. For the first system, solving for $y$ gives $y = 10 - x$, and substituting $x = 8$ gives $y = 2$, and substituting $x = -8$ gives $y = 18$. For the second system, solving for $y$ gives $y = -10 - x$, and substituting $x = 8$ gives $y = -18$, and substituting $x = -8$ gives $y = -2$. These points are $(8, 2)$, $(8, -18)$, $(-8, 18)$, and $(-8, -2)$. Only one of these points, $(8, 2)$, is inside the smaller square with side length $16$.

Therefore, we should calculate the area of the convex polygon formed by the intersection of the two squares as the area of the larger square minus twice the area of the smaller square. The area of the larger square is $200$ square units, and the area of the smaller square is $256$ square units. The area of the convex polygon is $200 - 2(256) = 200 - 512 = -312$. Again, this is not possible since the area of a polygon cannot be negative.

Let's re-examine the original equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. The first part of the equation, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, represents the square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$, and the second part of the equation, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, represents the square with side length $16$.

Since the product of the two equations equals zero, the only points that satisfy the equation are the points that satisfy either one of the equations. Therefore, the intersection of the two squares forms a convex polygon, which is the smaller square with side length $16$. The area of this square is $256$ square units.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points $\left(x, y\right)$ that satisfy $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is $256$ square units.

The answer is: $256$.

4_**Problem:** 

"Let $P_0(x) = x^3 + 313x^2 - 77x - 8\,$ .  For integers $n \ge 1\,$ , define $P_n(x) = P_{n - 1}(x - n)\,$ .  What is the coefficient of $x\,$ in $P_{20}(x)\,$"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:
Notice that \begin{align*}P_{20}(x) &= P_{19}(x - 20)\\ &= P_{18}((x - 20) - 19)\\ &= P_{17}(((x - 20) - 19) - 18)\\ &= \cdots\\ &= P_0(x - (20 + 19 + 18 + \ldots + 2 + 1)).\end{align*}
Using the formula for the sum of the first $n$ numbers, $1 + 2 + \cdots + 20 = \frac{20(20+1)}{2} = 210$ . Therefore, \[P_{20}(x) = P_0(x - 210).\]
Substituting $x - 210$ into the function definition, we get $P_0(x-210) = (x - 210)^3 + 313(x - 210)^2 - 77(x - 210) - 8$ . We only need the coefficients of the linear terms, which we can find by the binomial theorem

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


The only way that the product of two numbers can be 0 is if one or both of them are 0. So either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
For $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
For $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
For $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
For $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.
The points satisfying these conditions enclose a rectangle with vertices at $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.
The length of the rectangle is 16 and the width is 16, so the area of the rectangle is $16 \times 16 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

9_**Problem:** 

"Let $P_0(x) = x^3 + 313x^2 - 77x - 8\,$ .  For integers $n \ge 1\,$ , define $P_n(x) = P_{n - 1}(x - n)\,$ .  What is the coefficient of $x\,$ in $P_{20}(x)\,$"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:
Notice that \begin{align*}P_{20}(x) &= P_{19}(x - 20)\\ &= P_{18}((x - 20) - 19)\\ &= P_{17}(((x - 20) - 19) - 18)\\ &= \cdots\\ &= P_0(x - (20 + 19 + 18 + \ldots + 2 + 1)).\end{align*}
Using the formula for the sum of the first $n$ numbers, $1 + 2 + \cdots + 20 = \frac{20(20+1)}{2} = 210$ . Therefore, \[P_{20}(x) = P_0(x - 210).\]
Substituting $x - 210$ into the function definition, we get $P_0(x-210) = (x - 210)^3 + 313(x - 210)^2 - 77(x - 210) - 8$ . We only need the coefficients of the linear terms, which we can find by the binomial theorem
Adding up the coefficients, we get $630 \cdot 210 - 626 \cdot 210 - 77 = \boxed{763}$ The answer is $\boxed{763}$

**Problem:** 

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


The expression equals zero if either of the factors equals zero. Considering the first factor, we have two cases for each absolute value:

1. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0 \implies \vert x + y \vert = 10 \implies x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
2. $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0 \implies \vert x - y \vert = 10 \implies x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.

Considering the second factor, we have two cases for each absolute value:

1. $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0 \implies \vert x \vert = 8 \implies x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
2. $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0 \implies \vert y \vert = 8 \implies y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

We can combine these cases to get the vertices of the polygon:

1. $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$. These are the vertices of a square with side length $16$.
2. $(10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, $(-10, 0)$, and $(0, -10)$. These are the vertices of a square with side length $20$.
3. $(0, 0)$.

The area of the square with side length $16$ is $16^2 = 256$, and the area of the square with side length $20$ is $20^2 = 400$. Adding the area of the point at $(0, 0)$ has no area, so the total area of the polygon is $256 + 400 = 656$.
However, the problem statement specified that the enclosed region is a convex polygon. The point $(0, 0)$ lies inside the square with side length $16$, but it doesn't affect the area of the polygon. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is just the area of the square with side length $16$, which is $256$. The answer is $\boxed{256}$.
