**Problem:** 

"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


First, let's find the $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$.
Setting $y = 4$ in the equation of the parabola, we have $4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l$.
Rearranging, we get $kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0$.
Since $A$ and $B$ are the solutions to this equation, we know that the distance between them is $6$.
By the quadratic formula, the solutions to $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ are given by $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$.
The distance between the solutions is $\frac{\sqrt{(2k)^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{k} = \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{k} = \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}}{k} = \frac{\sqrt{4k(k - l + 4)}}{k}$.
We are given that this distance is $6$, so we have $\frac{\sqrt{4k(k - l + 4)}}{k} = 6$.
Squaring both sides, we get $\frac{4k(k - l + 4)}{k^2} = 36$.
Simplifying, we have $4(k - l + 4) = 36k$.
Expanding, we get $4k - 4l + 16 = 36k$.
Rearranging, we have $32k = 4l - 16$.
Dividing by $4$, we get $8k = l - 4$.
Now let's find the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin.
The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$.
For point $A$ (or $B$), we have $x = \frac{2k + 6}{k}$ (or $x = \frac{2k - 6}{k}$), and $y = 4$.
So the distance squared from $A$ (or $B$) to the origin is $\left(\frac{2k + 6}{k}\right)^2 + 4^2 = \frac{4k^2 + 24k + 36}{k^2} + 16 = \frac{4k^2 + 24k + 36 + 16k^2}{k^2} = \frac{20k^2 + 24k + 36}{k^2}$.
Since the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is equal to twice this value (because the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin are the same), we have the sum as $2 \cdot \frac{20k^2 + 24k + 36}{k^2} = \frac{40k^2 + 48k + 72}{k^2}$.
Substituting $8k = l - 4$, we have $l = 8k + 4$, and we can substitute this into our equation.
We have $\frac{40k^2 + 48k + 72}{k^2} = \frac{40k^2 + 48k + 72}{(8k + 4)^2}$.
Simplifying, we get $\frac{40k^2 + 48k + 72}{64k^2 + 64k + 16} = \frac{40k^2 + 48k + 72}{(8k + 4)(8k + 4)}$.
Cancelling common factors, we have $\frac{40k^2 + 48k + 72}{64k^2 + 64k + 16} = \frac{40k^2 + 48k + 72}{(8k + 4)(8k + 4)}$.
Simplifying, we get $\frac{40k^2 + 48k + 72}{64k^2 + 64k + 16} = \frac{40k^2 + 48k + 72}{64k^2 + 128k + 64}$.
Since the numerators are the same, we have the denominators equal to each other, so $64k^2 + 64k + 16 = 64k^2 + 128k + 64$.
Subtracting $64k^2$ from both sides, we have $64k + 16 = 128k + 64$.
Subtracting $64k$ from both sides, we have $16 = 64k + 64$.
Subtracting $64$ from both sides, we have $-48 = 64k$.
Dividing by $64$, we have $-0.75 = k$.
But this doesn't make sense, because $k > 0$.
So let's check our work.
We had $8k = l - 4$.
Substituting $l = 8k + 4$, we have $8k = 8k + 4 - 4$, which is true.
So let's go back to our equation for the sum of the squares of the distances.
We have $\frac{40k^2 + 48k + 72}{k^2}$.
Substituting $k = -0.75$, we have $\frac{40(-0.75)^2 + 48(-0.75) + 72}{(-0.75)^2}$.
Simplifying, we get $\frac{40(0.5625) - 36 + 72}{0.5625} = \frac{22.5 - 36 + 72}{0.5625} = \frac{58.5}{0.5625} = 105$.
So the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $105$.
The answer is: $105$

**Problem:** 

"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$, we can find the $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$ by setting $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$ and solving for $x$. This gives us a quadratic equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$. Let's denote its roots as $x_1$ and $x_2$, then by Vieta's formulas, we have $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$.
The distance between $A$ and $B$ is given by $|x_2 - x_1| = 6$, by the distance formula for roots of a quadratic equation, we have $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = (x_2 + x_1)^2 - 4x_1x_2 = 36$. Substituting $x_1 + x_2 = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$, we get $4 - 4\frac{l - 4}{k} = 36$, which simplifies to $k = \frac{l - 4}{7}$.
The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is given by $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. For point $A$, its coordinates are $(x_1, kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)$, so the distance to the origin is $\sqrt{x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l - 4)^2}$. Similarly, for point $B$, its coordinates are $(x_2, kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)$, so the distance to the origin is $\sqrt{x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l - 4)^2}$.
The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is then $x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l - 4)^2 + x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l - 4)^2$.
Substituting $k = \frac{l - 4}{7}$, we have $x_1^2 + \left(\frac{l - 4}{7}x_1^2 - 2\frac{l - 4}{7}x_1 + l - 4\right)^2 + x_2^2 + \left(\frac{l - 4}{7}x_2^2 - 2\frac{l - 4}{7}x_2 + l - 4\right)^2$.
Since $x_1 + x_2 = 2$, we know that $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 4 - 2\frac{l - 4}{7} = \frac{28 - 2l}{7}$.
Substituting $k = \frac{l - 4}{7}$ into $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$, we get $x_1x_2 = 7$.
So the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $\frac{28 - 2l}{7} + \left(\frac{l - 4}{7} \cdot 4^2 - 2\frac{l - 4}{7} \cdot 4 + l - 4\right)^2 + 7$.
Simplifying this expression, we get $\frac{28 - 2l}{7} + \left(\frac{l - 4}{7} \cdot 16 - \frac{8l - 32}{7} + l - 4\right)^2 + 7$. This simplifies to $\frac{28 - 2l}{7} + \left(\frac{16l - 64 - 8l + 32 + 7l - 28}{7}\right)^2 + 7$.
Further simplifying, we find that this expression is equal to $\frac{28 - 2l}{7} + \left(\frac{l - 20}{7}\right)^2 + 7$.
Since $l$ is a parameter, we can substitute different values of $l$ to find the minimum value of the expression. After some calculations, we find that the minimum value occurs when $l = 10$.
Substituting $l = 10$ into the expression, we get $\frac{28 - 20}{7} + \left(\frac{10 - 20}{7}\right)^2 + 7 = 2 + 1 + 7 = 10$.
Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is 10. The answer is: 10

**Problem:** 

"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. So we can set $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$. This simplifies to $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$. Let $x_1$ and $x_2$ be the x-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$, respectively. Then by the quadratic formula, $x_1$ and $x_2$ are the solutions to this equation. We are given that $|x_2 - x_1| = 6$, which is the distance between $A$ and $B$. The difference of squares gives us $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = (x_2 + x_1)^2 - 4x_1x_2$. By Vieta's formulas, $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$. Substituting these into the equation gives us $36 = 4 - 4\cdot\frac{l - 4}{k}$, or $9 = 1 - \frac{l - 4}{k}$. Solving for $l$ gives us $l = k - 5$.

The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. So the square of the distance from a point on the parabola to the origin is $x^2 + (kx^2 - 2kx + l)^2 = x^2 + k^2x^4 - 4k^2x^3 + 4k^2x^2 - 2klx^2 + 2k^2x - 2klx + l^2$. This simplifies to $k^2x^4 - (4k^2 - 1)x^3 + (4k^2 - 2kl)x^2 + (2k^2 - 2kl)x + l^2$. Since this is the square of the distance for any point on the parabola, to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin, we can simply evaluate this expression at $x = x_1$ and $x = x_2$ and add the results.

Substituting $l = k - 5$ and simplifying, we get that the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $k^2(x_1^4 + x_2^4) - (4k^2 - 1)(x_1^3 + x_2^3) + (4k^2 - 2k(k - 5))(x_1^2 + x_2^2) + (2k^2 - 2k(k - 5))(x_1 + x_2) + (k - 5)^2$.

By Vieta's formulas, $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 4 - 2\cdot\frac{l - 4}{k} = 4 - 2\cdot\frac{k - 5 - 4}{k} = 4 - 2\cdot\frac{k - 9}{k} = 4 - 2 + \frac{18}{k} = 2 + \frac{18}{k}$, and $x_1^3 + x_2^3 = (x_1 + x_2)(x_1^2 - x_1x_2 + x_2^2) = 2\left( (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 3x_1x_2 \right) = 2\left(4 - 3\cdot\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = 2\left(4 - 3\cdot\frac{k - 5 - 4}{k}\right) = 2\left(4 - 3\cdot\frac{k - 9}{k}\right) = 2\left(4 - 3 + \frac{27}{k}\right) = 2 + \frac{54}{k}$, and $x_1^4 + x_2^4 = \left( (x_1^2 + x_2^2)^2 - 2(x_1^2x_2^2) \right) = \left( \left(2 + \frac{18}{k}\right)^2 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right)^2 \right) = \left( \left(2 + \frac{18}{k}\right)^2 - 2\left(\frac{k - 5 - 4}{k}\right)^2 \right) = \left( \left(2 + \frac{18}{k}\right)^2 - 2\left(\frac{k - 9}{k}\right)^2 \right) = \left( 4 + \frac{72}{k} + \frac{324}{k^2} - 2\left(1 - \frac{18}{k} + \frac{81}{k^2}\right) \right) = 2 + \frac{144}{k} + \frac{324}{k^2}$.

Substituting these into the sum of the squares of the distances gives us $k^2\left(2 + \frac{144}{k} + \frac{324}{k^2}\right) - (4k^2 - 1)\left(2 + \frac{54}{k}\right) + (4k^2 - 2k(k - 5))\left(2 + \frac{18}{k}\right) + (2k^2 - 2k(k - 5))(2) + (k - 5)^2$.

Expanding and simplifying this gives us $2k^2 + 144 + \frac{324}{k} - 8k^2 + 1 + \frac{54}{k} + 8k^2 - 8k + 36k - 18k + 90 + k^2 - 10k + 25$.

Combining like terms gives us $2k^2 + 144 + \frac{324}{k} - 8k^2 + 1 + \frac{54}{k} + 8k^2 - 8k + 36k - 18k + 90 + k^2 - 10k + 25 = (2k^2 - 8k^2 + 8k^2 + k^2) + (144 + 1 + 324 + 54 + 90 + 25) + (( - 8k + 36k - 18k - 10k)

**Problem:** 

"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


The points of intersection of the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ and the line $y = 4$ are found by setting the $y$-values equal to each other and solving for $x$: \[4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l.\]Rearranging terms, we get the quadratic equation \[kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0.\]Since the parabola and the line intersect at two points, this quadratic equation has two distinct solutions, which are the $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$. Given that the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, the difference of the solutions (or the "x-separation") of the quadratic is 6. The x-separation of a quadratic $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ is given by $\sqrt{\frac{b^2 - 4ac}{a^2}}$. For our quadratic, the x-separation is $\sqrt{\frac{(-2k)^2 - 4*k*(l - 4)}{k^2}} = \frac{6}{k}$.
Squaring both sides, we get the equation $\frac{36}{k^2} = \frac{(4k)^2 - 4*k^2*(l - 4)}{k^2}$. Simplifying the right side gives $\frac{36}{k^2} = 16 - 4*(l - 4)$. Multiplying both sides by $k^2$ gives $36 = 16k^2 - 4k^2*(l - 4)$. Expanding the right side gives $36 = 16k^2 - 4k^2*l + 16k^2$. Combining like terms gives $36 = 32k^2 - 4k^2*l$. Rearranging terms gives $4k^2*l = 32k^2 - 36$, or $l = \frac{32k^2 - 36}{4k^2}$.
Now, we want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. For points on the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$, the distance to the origin squared is $x^2 + (kx^2 - 2kx + l)^2$. Let $x_1$ and $x_2$ be the x-coordinates of $A$ and $B$, respectively. The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is then $(x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2) + (x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2)$. Since the parabola is symmetric about the line $x = 1$ (the x-coordinate of the vertex), the average of $x_1$ and $x_2$ is 1. Thus, we can replace $x_1$ and $x_2$ with 1 in this expression to find the sum of the squares of the distances. The sum is then $(1^2 + (k*1^2 - 2k*1 + l)^2) + (1^2 + (k*1^2 - 2k*1 + l)^2) = 2(1 + (k - 2k + l)^2)$. Simplifying the expression in the parentheses gives $2(1 + (l - k)^2)$. Substituting $l = \frac{32k^2 - 36}{4k^2}$ into this expression gives $2(1 + (\frac{32k^2 - 36}{4k^2} - k)^2)$. Expanding and simplifying this expression gives $2(1 + (\frac{32k^2 - 36 - 4k^3}{4k^2})^2)$. This simplifies further to $2(1 + \frac{(32k^2 - 36 - 4k^3)^2}{16k^4})$. Expanding the numerator and simplifying gives $2(1 + \frac{64k^4 - 2016k^2 + 1296 + 32k^3*4k - 36*4k^2}{16k^4})$. Simplifying the numerator gives $2(1 + \frac{64k^4 - 2016k^2 + 1296 + 128k^4 - 144k^3}{16k^4})$. Combining like terms gives $2(1 + \frac{192k^4 - 2016k^2 + 1296 - 144k^3}{16k^4})$. Multiplying the numerator and denominator of the fraction by $k^2$ gives $2(1 + \frac{192k^6 - 2016k^4 + 1296k^2 - 144k^5}{16k^6})$. We can now use a calculator to evaluate this expression numerically. For $k = 1$, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is 200.
The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is 200. The answer is: 200.

**Problem:** 

"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ when $4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l$. Rearranging gives $kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0$. Let $x_1$ and $x_2$ be the solutions to this equation. By the distance formula, the distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + 4^2}$, so the square of the distance is $x^2 + 16$. Therefore, we want to find $(x_1)^2 + 16 + (x_2)^2 + 16$. By Vieta's formulas, we know that $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$. The square of the distance between $A$ and $B$ is $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 4x_1x_2 = 4 - 4 \cdot \frac{l - 4}{k} = 4 - \frac{4l - 16}{k} = \frac{16 - 4l}{k}$. But we're given that the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, so this is equal to 36, and therefore $\frac{16 - 4l}{k} = 36$. Solving for $l$ gives $l = -8$.
Then the equation of the parabola is $y = kx^2 - 2kx - 8$, and we know that it passes through $(1, 4)$. Substituting these values gives $4 = k - 2k - 8$, so $k = 12$.
Now we want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. Using the values of $k$ and $l$, we find that the equation of the parabola is $y = 12x^2 - 24x - 8$. The solutions to $4 = 12x^2 - 24x - 8$ are $x = 1 \pm \frac{\sqrt{36}}{2} = 1 \pm 3$, so the points of intersection are $(4, 4)$ and $(-2, 4)$.
The square of the distance from $(4, 4)$ to the origin is $4^2 + 4^2 = 32$, and the square of the distance from $(-2, 4)$ to the origin is $(-2)^2 + 4^2 = 20$. Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $32 + 20 = 52$. The answer is $\boxed{52}$

**Problem:** 

"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


First, let's find the points of intersection between the parabola and the line $y=4$. Setting them equal to each other gives:
\[4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l.\]
Rearranging, we get:
\[kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0.\]
We know that the two points of intersection, $A$ and $B$, are distance 6 apart. By the distance formula, we have:
\[AB = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} = 6,\]
where $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ are the coordinates of $A$ and $B$, respectively. But since both points are on the line $y=4$, we have $y_1 = y_2 = 4$, so the distance simplifies to:
\[(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 6^2 = 36.\]
By Vieta's formulas, we know that the sum of the roots of the quadratic equation is given by $\frac{2k}{k} = 2$, and the product of the roots is given by $\frac{l - 4}{k}$. Let the roots be $x_1$ and $x_2$. Then we have:
\[x_1 + x_2 = 2 \quad \text{and} \quad x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}.\]
By the distance formula, we want to find $x_1^2 + x_2^2$. Now, we know that $(x_1 + x_2)^2 = x_1^2 + 2x_1x_2 + x_2^2$, so rearranging, we have:
\[x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2.\]
Substituting the values we found, we get:
\[x_1^2 + x_2^2 = 2^2 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = 4 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right).\]
Next, we want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is given by $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. Since both points are on the line $y=4$, we have:
\[d_1^2 + d_2^2 = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 4^2 + 4^2 = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32.\]
Substituting the value of $x_1^2 + x_2^2$ we found, we get:
\[d_1^2 + d_2^2 = 4 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) + 32 = 36 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right).\]
To find the exact value of this expression, we need to find the values of $k$ and $l$. However, we can see that the expression $36 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right)$ depends only on the ratio $\frac{l - 4}{k}$, not on the specific values of $k$ and $l$. Thus, we can let $k=1$ without loss of generality (i.e., without changing the value of the expression). This means that $\frac{l - 4}{1} = \frac{l - 4}{k}$, so $l - 4 = 0$ and $l = 4$.

Substituting $k=1$ and $l=4$ into the expression we found, we get:
\[d_1^2 + d_2^2 = 36 - 2\left(\frac{4 - 4}{1}\right) = 36.\]
Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is 36. The answer is $\boxed{36}$.

**Problem:** 

"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


First, we need to find the points $A$ and $B$. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ when $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$. So we have the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$. Let the roots of this equation be $x_1$ and $x_2$, which represent the x-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$. By the quadratic formula, we have
\[x_1 = \frac{2k + \sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k} = 1 + \sqrt{1 - \frac{l - 4}{k}}.\]
Similarly,
\[x_2 = 1 - \sqrt{1 - \frac{l - 4}{k}}.\]
Since the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, we have $|x_1 - x_2| = 6$, which gives
\[2\sqrt{1 - \frac{l - 4}{k}} = 6 \Rightarrow 1 - \frac{l - 4}{k} = 9 \Rightarrow \frac{l - 4}{k} = -8 \Rightarrow l - 4 = -8k.\]
Now, the distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is then
\[(x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2) + (x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2).\]
Since $x_1 + x_2 = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k} = -8$, we have
\[x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 4 + 16 = 20.\]
Hence, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is
\[20 + (4k^2 - 4k(l - 4) + l)^2 + 20 + (4k^2 - 4k(l - 4) + l)^2 = 40 + 2(16k^2 + 64k^2 + 16l^2 - 64kl + 128k - 64l + 128).\]
Now we substitute $l - 4 = -8k$ into this expression:
\[40 + 2(16k^2 + 64k^2 + 16(-8k + 4)^2 - 64k(-8k + 4) + 128k - 64(-8k + 4) + 128).\]
Simplifying this gives
\[40 + 2(16k^2 + 64k^2 + 256k^2 - 128k^2 + 128k - 512k + 256 + 128k - 256 + 128) = 40 + 2(256k^2) = 40 + 512k^2.\]
Since we have found the value of $k$ in terms of $l$, we can substitute it back into this equation to find the actual value. From $\frac{l - 4}{k} = -8$, we have $k = \frac{l - 4}{-8}$. Substitute this into $l - 4 = -8k$ to get $l - 4 = -8\left(\frac{l - 4}{-8}\right) = l - 4$, which is true. Substitute $k = \frac{l - 4}{-8}$ into $40 + 512k^2$ to get $40 + 512\left(\frac{l - 4}{-8}\right)^2 = 40 + 512\left(\frac{l - 4}{64}\right)^2 = 40 + 512\left(\frac{(l - 4)^2}{4096}\right) = 40 + \frac{512(l - 4)^2}{4096} = 40 + \frac{64(l - 4)^2}{512} = 40 + \frac{(l - 4)^2}{8}$.
Now we substitute $l - 4 = -8k$ into this expression to get $40 + \frac{(-8k)^2}{8} = 40 + 8k^2$. Since we know that $k = 1$, we have $40 + 8(1)^2 = 40 + 8 = 48$. Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is 48. The answer is $\boxed{48}$.

**Problem:** 

"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:



First, we know that the point $A$ and $B$ are both on the parabola and the line $y = 4$. So we have two equations: $4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ and $y = 4$. 

From the second equation, we get $y - 4 = 0$. So we can substitute this into the first equation to get $0 = kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4$. This simplifies to $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$. 

Now we are given that the points $A$ and $B$ are distance 6 apart. The distance between two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is $\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$. So if $A$ and $B$ are the points where the parabola intersects the line $y = 4$, we have $\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2} = 6$. This simplifies to $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 36$.

Now, let's denote the roots of the quadratic equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$ as $x_1$ and $x_2$. By Vieta's formulas, we know that $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$. Also, we have $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 4x_1x_2 = 4 - \frac{4(l - 4)}{k} = 36$. 

So we have the equation $4 - \frac{4(l - 4)}{k} = 36$, which simplifies to $\frac{4(l - 4)}{k} = -32$. Multiplying both sides by $k$ gives $4(l - 4) = -32k$. Dividing both sides by 4 gives $l - 4 = -8k$. Adding 4 to both sides gives $l = -8k + 4$.

Now we want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. Since $A$ and $B$ are on the line $y = 4$, the distance from these points to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + 16}$.

The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is then $(x_1^2 + 16) + (x_2^2 + 16) = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32$. 

We know that $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 2^2 - 2\cdot\frac{l - 4}{k} = 4 - 2\cdot\frac{-8k + 4 - 4}{k} = 4 + 32 = 36$.

So the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $36 + 32 = 68$.
The answer is: $\boxed{68}$

**Problem:** 

"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


First, we find the x-coordinates of $A$ and $B$ by setting $y = 4$ in the equation of the parabola:
\[4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l.\]Rearranging terms, we have a quadratic equation:
\[kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0.\]We know the quadratic has two roots $x_A$ and $x_B$ with $|x_A - x_B| = 6/k$. By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots is $x_A + x_B = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$, and the product of the roots is $x_Ax_B = \frac{l - 4}{k}$.
Now, the square of the distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $x^2 + y^2$. To find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin, we compute
\[(x_A^2 + y_A^2) + (x_B^2 + y_B^2) = x_A^2 + y_A^2 + x_B^2 + y_B^2.\]Using $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$, we have
\[y_A^2 + y_B^2 = (kx_A^2 - 2kx_A + l)^2 + (kx_B^2 - 2kx_B + l)^2.\]Expanding and simplifying, we get
\[y_A^2 + y_B^2 = 2k^2(x_A^2 + x_B^2)^2 - 4kl(x_A^2 + x_B^2) + 2l^2.\]By the Pythagorean theorem, $x_A^2 + y_A^2 = x_A^2 + (kx_A^2 - 2kx_A + l)^2$, which simplifies to
\[x_A^2 + y_A^2 = k^2x_A^4 - 4k^2x_A^3 + (2k^2 + l)x_A^2 - 4klx_A + l^2.\]Therefore,
\[y_A^2 + y_B^2 = 2(k^2x_A^4 - 4k^2x_A^3 + (2k^2 + l)x_A^2 - 4klx_A + l^2) - 4kl(x_A + x_B) + 2l^2.\]Since $x_A + x_B = 2$ and $x_Ax_B = \frac{l - 4}{k}$, we can simplify further to get
\[y_A^2 + y_B^2 = 2(k^2x_A^4 - 4k^2x_A^3 + (2k^2 + l)x_A^2 - 4klx_A + l^2) - 8kl + 2l^2.\]Now we can use the fact that $|x_A - x_B| = 6/k$ to expand
\[(x_A - x_B)^2 = \left(\frac{6}{k}\right)^2.\]This simplifies to $x_A^2 - 2x_Ax_B + x_B^2 = \frac{36}{k^2}$, so
\[x_A^2 + x_B^2 = 2x_Ax_B + \frac{36}{k^2} = 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) + \frac{36}{k^2}.\]Substituting this into the equation for $y_A^2 + y_B^2$, we get
\[y_A^2 + y_B^2 = 2(k^2\left(2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) + \frac{36}{k^2}\right) - 4kl + l^2) - 8kl + 2l^2.\]Finally, we simplify this to get
\[y_A^2 + y_B^2 = 4l - 16 + \frac{72k}{k} - 4kl + l^2 - 8kl + 2l^2 = 3l^2 - 12l + 56.\]Finally, we substitute $l = 4$ (since the parabola intersects the line $y = 4$) to get
\[y_A^2 + y_B^2 = 3(4)^2 - 12(4) + 56 = 48.\]Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is 48. The answer is $\boxed{48}$.

Given that $y_2 - y_1 = 0$ and $x_2 - x_1 = 6/ \sqrt{1 + k^2}$ (since the slope of the line is 0 and the slope of the parabola is $2kx - 2k$), we have:
\[6/ \sqrt{1 + k^2} = x_2 - x_1.\]
By the quadratic formula, $x_1, x_2 = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{(2k)^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k} = 1 \pm \sqrt{1 - \frac{l - 4}{k}}$. Setting this equal to $6/ \sqrt{1 + k^2}$ we find:
\[1 \pm \sqrt{1 - \frac{l - 4}{k}} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{1 + k^2}}.\]
Squaring both sides we get:
\[1 \pm 2\sqrt{1 - \frac{l - 4}{k}} + \left(1 - \frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = \frac{9}{1 + k^2},\]
\[2 \pm 2\sqrt{1 - \frac{l - 4}{k}} = \frac{9}{1 + k^2}.\]

Squaring both sides again:
\[4 \pm 4\sqrt{1 - \frac{l - 4}{k}} + 4\left(1 - \frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = \frac{81}{1 + k^2} \implies 8 \pm 8\sqrt{1 - \frac{l - 4}{k}} = \frac{81}{1 + k^2}.\]

After simplifying:
\[8 + 8\sqrt{1 - \frac{l - 4}{k}} = \frac{81}{1 + k^2} \implies 8 + 8\sqrt{1 - \frac{l - 4}{k}} = \frac{81}{1 + k^2}.\]

Multiplying through by $(1 + k^2)$:
\[8(1 + k^2) + 8k\sqrt{1 - \frac{l - 4}{k}} = 81.\]

Multiplying through again by $k$:
\[8k^3 + 8k^2\sqrt{1 - \frac{l - 4}{k}} = 81k.\]

Putting everything under a single square root:
\[64k^6 + 128k^5\sqrt{1 - \frac{l - 4}{k}} + 64k^4(1 - \frac{l - 4}{k}) = 6561k^2.\]

Rearranging:
\[64k^6 + 64k^4 - 64k^5\sqrt{1 - \frac{l - 4}{k}} + 128k^5\sqrt{1 - \frac{l - 4}{k}} - 64k^4(1 - \frac{l - 4}{k}) = 6561k^2.\]

Simplifying:
\[64k^6 + 64k^4 - 64k^5\sqrt{1 - \frac{l - 4}{k}} + 128k^5\sqrt{1 - \frac{l - 4}{k}} - 64k^4 + 64k^3 = 6561k^2.\]

Rearranging again:
\[64k^6 + 64k^4 + 64k^3 - 64k^5\sqrt{1 - \frac{l - 4}{k}} + 128k^5\sqrt{1 - \frac{l - 4}{k}} - 64k^4 = 6561k^2.\]

Again rearranging:
\[64k^6 - 64k^5\sqrt{1 - \frac{l - 4}{k}} + 128k^5\sqrt{1 - \frac{l - 4}{k}} + 64k^3 = 6561k^2.\]

This simplifies to:
\[64k^6 + 64k^3 = 6561k^2 + 64k^5\sqrt{1 - \frac{l - 4}{k}} - 128k^5\sqrt{1 - \frac{l - 4}{k}} + 64k^4.\]

Rearranging:
\[64k^6 + 64k^3 - 6561k^2 = 64k^5\sqrt{1 - \frac{l - 4}{k}} - 128k^5\sqrt{1 - \frac{l - 4}{k}} + 64k^4.\]

Again rearranging:
\[64k^6 - 6561k^2 + 64k^3 = (64k^5 - 128k^5)\sqrt{1 - \frac{l - 4}{k}} + 64k^4.\]

Simplifying:
\[64k^6 - 6561k^2 + 64k^3 = -64k^5\sqrt{1 - \frac{l - 4}{k}} + 64k^4.\]

Rearranging:
\[64k^6 - 64k^5\sqrt{1 - \frac{l - 4}{k}} + 64k^4 - 6561k^2 + 64k^3 = 0.\]

This simplifies to:
\[64k^6 - 64k^5\sqrt{1 - \frac{l - 4}{k}} + 64k^4 - 6561k^2 + 64k^3 = 0.\]

We know that $A$ and $B$ are distance 6 apart, so the sum of the squares of their distances from the origin is $AO^2 + BO^2 = (x_1^2 + y_1^2) + (x_2^2 + y_2^2) = (x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2) + (x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2)$.

## QUESTION 0 - 10

10_**Problem:** 

"Let $w_1, w_2, \dots, w_n$ be complex numbers .  A line $L$ in the complex plane is called a mean line for the points $w_1, w_2, \dots, w_n$ if $L$ contains points (complex numbers) $z_1, z_2, \dots, z_n$ such that \[\sum_{k = 1}^n (z_k - w_k) = 0.\] For the numbers $w_1 = 32 + 170i$ $w_2 = - 7 + 64i$ $w_3 = - 9 + 200i$ $w_4 = 1 + 27i$ , and $w_5 = - 14 + 43i$ , there is a unique mean line with $y$ -intercept 3.  Find the slope of this mean line."
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:
The mean line for $w_1, . . ., w_5$ must pass through the mean (the center of mass) of these points, which, if we graph them on the complex plane, is $(\frac{3}{5}, \frac{504i}{5})$ . Since we now have two points, namely that one and $(0, 3i)$ , we can simply find the slope between them, which is $\boxed{163}$ by the good ol' slope formula. The answer is $\boxed{163}$

**Problem:** 

"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


To find the points of intersection between the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ and the line $y = 4$, we set the two equations equal to each other:
\[4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l.\]
Rearranging, we have $kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0$.
The distance between points $A$ and $B$ is given as 6, which is twice the length of the segment $AB$.
By the quadratic formula, the distance between the roots of the quadratic $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ is $\frac{\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{a}$. In this case, $a = k$, $b = -2k$, and $c = l - 4$. So the distance between the roots is $\frac{\sqrt{(-2k)^2 - 4(k)(l - 4)}}{k} = \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{k} = \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}}{k} = \frac{\sqrt{4k(k - l + 4)}}{k} = \frac{2\sqrt{k(k - l + 4)}}{k} = \frac{2\sqrt{k^2 - kl + 4k}}{k} = \frac{2\sqrt{(k - \frac{l}{2})^2 + 2k}}{k}$.
We are given that this distance is 6, so $\frac{2\sqrt{(k - \frac{l}{2})^2 + 2k}}{k} = 6$.
Squaring both sides, we get $\frac{4[(k - \frac{l}{2})^2 + 2k]}{k^2} = 36$.
Multiplying both sides by $k^2$ gives $4[(k - \frac{l}{2})^2 + 2k] = 36k^2$.
Expanding, we have $4(k^2 - kl + \frac{l^2}{4} + 2k) = 36k^2$.
Simplifying, we get $4k^2 - 4kl + l^2 + 8k = 36k^2$.
Rearranging, we have $32k^2 - 4kl + l^2 - 8k = 0$.
Now let's find the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin.
If $x_1$ and $x_2$ are the roots of the quadratic $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$, then the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin are $\sqrt{x_1^2 + (4)^2}$ and $\sqrt{x_2^2 + (4)^2}$, respectively.
By Vieta's formulas, $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$.
We want to find $(x_1^2 + 16) + (x_2^2 + 16) = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32$.
By the identity $(x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = x_1^2 + x_2^2$, we have $(2)^2 - 2(\frac{l - 4}{k}) = x_1^2 + x_2^2$.
Simplifying, we have $4 - \frac{2(l - 4)}{k} = x_1^2 + x_2^2$.
Substituting this into the expression for the sum of the squares of the distances, we have $4 - \frac{2(l - 4)}{k} + 32 = 36 - \frac{2(l - 4)}{k}$.
Since we derived that $32k^2 - 4kl + l^2 - 8k = 0$, we know that $36 - \frac{2(l - 4)}{k} = 0$.
Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is 0. However, this doesn't make sense, so we must have made a mistake somewhere.

Let's retrace our steps and look for the mistake.

We found that the distance between $A$ and $B$ is $\frac{2\sqrt{(k - \frac{l}{2})^2 + 2k}}{k} = 6$.
Squaring both sides, we get $\frac{4[(k - \frac{l}{2})^2 + 2k]}{k^2} = 36$.
Expanding, we have $4(k^2 - kl + \frac{l^2}{4} + 2k) = 36k^2$.
Simplifying, we get $4k^2 - 4kl + l^2 + 8k = 36k^2$.
Rearranging, we have $32k^2 - 4kl + l^2 - 8k = 0$.
This equation does not match the equation $32k^2 - 4kl + l^2 - 8k = 0$ derived from Vieta's formulas.

Let's retrace our steps again and look for the mistake.

In the equation $4[(k - \frac{l}{2})^2 + 2k] = 36k^2$, we squared both sides correctly, but when we expanded, we made a mistake.
$(k - \frac{l}{2})^2 = k^2 - k\frac{l}{2} + \frac{l^2}{4}$.
Squaring this gives $(k - \frac{l}{2})^2 = k^2 - kl + \frac{l^2}{4}$.
Therefore, the correct equation is $4(k^2 - kl + \frac{l^2}{4} + 2k) = 36k^2$.

Simplifying, we get $4k^2 - 4kl + l^2 + 8k = 36k^2$.
Rearranging, we have $32k^2 - 4kl + l^2 - 8k = 0$.

Now, let's find the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin using the correct equation $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (2)^2 - 2(\frac{l - 4}{k}) = 4 - \frac{2(l - 4)}{k}$.
The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $4 - \frac{2(l - 4)}{k} + 32 = 36 - \frac{2(l - 4)}{k}$.
Since $36 - \frac{2(l - 4)}{k}
