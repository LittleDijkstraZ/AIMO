0_**Problem:** 

"The data set $[6, 19, 33, 33, 39, 41, 41, 43, 51, 57]$ has median $Q_2 = 40$ , first quartile $Q_1 = 33$ , and third quartile $Q_3 = 43$ . An outlier in a data set is a value that is more than $1.5$ times the interquartile range below the first quartle ( $Q_1$ ) or more than $1.5$ times the interquartile range above the third quartile ( $Q_3$ ), where the interquartile range is defined as $Q_3 - Q_1$ . How many outliers does this data set have?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:
The interquartile range is defined as $Q3 - Q1$ , which is $43 - 33 = 10$ $1.5$ times this value is $15$ , so all values more than $15$ below $Q1$ $33 - 15 = 18$ is an outlier. The only one that fits this is $6$ . All values more than $15$ above $Q3 = 43 + 15 = 58$ are also outliers, of which there are none so there is only $\boxed{1}$ outlier in total. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Problem:** 

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


First, we can rewrite the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, we know that $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$ for all real numbers $a$ and $b$.
So, $|2y-x| + |2x-y| \geq |(2y-x) + (2x-y)| = |y| = |2y/2| = |y/1| = |y-0| = |y-0| = |y-0|$.
Therefore, $|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |y-0| = |y|$.
But we are given that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, so we must have $|y| = 40$.
This means that $y = 40$ or $y = -40$.
Now, let's substitute $y = 40$ into the given equation: $|x-2(40)| + |40-2x| = 40$.
Simplifying, we get $|x-80| + |40-2x| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality again, we know that $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$, so $|x-80| + |40-2x| \geq |(x-80) + (40-2x)| = |-40| = 40$.
Since the left side equals 40, we must have equality, which means that $(x-80)(40-2x) \geq 0$.
Solving this inequality, we get $x \leq 40$ or $x \geq 80$.
Now, let's substitute $y = -40$ into the given equation: $|x-2(-40)| + |-40-2x| = 40$.
Simplifying, we get $|x+80| + |-40-2x| = 40$.
Again, by the triangle inequality, we have $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$, so $|x+80| + |-40-2x| \geq |(x+80) + (-40-2x)| = |-40| = 40$.
Again, we must have equality, so $(x+80)(-40-2x) \geq 0$.
Solving this inequality, we get $x \leq -80$ or $x \geq -40$.
Now, let's substitute $y = 40$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
$5x^2+5(40)^2-8x(40) = 5x^2+8000-320x$.
And let's substitute $y = -40$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
$5x^2+5(-40)^2-8x(-40) = 5x^2+8000+320x$.
We want to find the minimum value of these two expressions.
Let's set each expression equal to $m$, the minimum value:
$5x^2+8000-320x = m$ and $5x^2+8000+320x = m$.
Adding these two equations, we get: $2(5x^2+8000) = 2m$.
Simplifying, we get: $10x^2+16000 = 2m$.
This means that $m = 5x^2+8000$.
Now, let's find the derivative of $5x^2+8000$ with respect to $x$: $10x$.
Setting this equal to 0, we find that the critical point is $x = 0$.
Substituting $x = 0$ into the equation $5x^2+8000$, we get $m = 8000$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 8000 when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
The minimum value is 8000. The answer is: $\boxed{8000}$

1_**Problem:** 

"The data set $[6, 19, 33, 33, 39, 41, 41, 43, 51, 57]$ has median $Q_2 = 40$ , first quartile $Q_1 = 33$ , and third quartile $Q_3 = 43$ . An outlier in a data set is a value that is more than $1.5$ times the interquartile range below the first quartle ( $Q_1$ ) or more than $1.5$ times the interquartile range above the third quartile ( $Q_3$ ), where the interquartile range is defined as $Q_3 - Q_1$ .

**Problem:** 

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


First, we can rewrite the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$.
Using the property $|a| + |b| = |a+b| + |a-b|$, we can simplify this to $|2y-x + (2x-y)| + |2y-x - (2x-y)| = 40$, which simplifies to $|y+x| + |-y+x| = 40$.
Since absolute value is always non-negative, we have $|y+x| + |-y+x| = 2|x+y| = 40$, so $|x+y| = 20$.
Now, let's substitute $a = x+y$ and $b = x-2y$ into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$.
We can rewrite $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ as $5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x+y)^2 - 2xy] - 8xy = 5[a^2 - 2(b/3)a] - 8(b/3)a = 5a^2 - (20/3)a^2 - (8/3)ab = (15/3)a^2 - (8/3)ab$.
Since $|x+y| = 20$, we have $a = 20$.
So the expression becomes $(15/3) * 20^2 - (8/3) * 20 * b = 1000 - (160/3)b$.
To minimize this expression, we need to maximize the value of $b$. From the equation $x+y = a$ and $x-2y = b$, we have $3x = a+b$ and $3y = a-b$.
So $x = (a+b)/3$ and $y = (a-b)/3$.
Substituting these into the equation $|x+y| = 20$, we get $20 = |(a+b)/3 + (a-b)/3| = |2a/3|$, so $|a| = 30$.
Since we want to maximize $b$, we assume $a = 30$ (the other case gives a smaller value of $b$).
Then $b = x - 2y = (a - 3b)/3$, so $4b = a$ and $b = 7.5$.
Substituting $a = 30$ and $b = 7.5$ into the expression $1000 - (160/3)b$, we get $1000 - (160/3) * 7.5 = 1000 - 400 = 600$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is $600$.
The answer is $\boxed{600}$.

An outlier in a data set is a value that is more than $1.5$ times the interquartile range below the first quartle ( $Q_1$ ) or more than $1.5$ times the interquartile range above the third quartile ( $Q_3$ ), where the interquartile range is defined as $Q_3 - Q_1$ .

**Problem:** 

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:



First, we can rewrite the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$ using the property $|a| = |-a|$.

The equation $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$ can be rewritten using the property $|a| + |b| = |a+b|$ as $|(2y-x)+(2x-y)| = 40$, which simplifies to $|y+x| = 40$.

Now, let's consider the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite this as $5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy$. 

We know that $(x-y)^2 = x^2 - 2xy + y^2 \ge 0$, so $x^2 + y^2 \ge 2xy$. 

Therefore, $5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy \ge 3(x^2 + y^2) = 3[(x-y)^2 + 2xy] \ge 3(2xy) = 6xy$. 

So, $5x^2+5y^2-8xy \ge 6xy$. 

Now, we know that $|y+x| = 40$, so $y+x = \pm 40$. 

We want to find the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, which is equivalent to finding the minimum value of $6xy$. 

When $y+x = 40$, $6xy = 6(40-x)x = 240x - 6x^2$. Completing the square, we get $6x^2 - 240x = - (6x^2 - 240x + 14400) + 14400 = -6(x-20)^2 + 14400$. The minimum value of this expression is achieved when $x = 20$, and the minimum value is $14400$. 

When $y+x = -40$, $6xy = 6(-40-x)x = -240x - 6x^2$. Completing the square, we get $-6x^2 - 240x = -(6x^2 + 240x + 14400) + 14400 = -6(x+20)^2 + 14400$. The minimum value of this expression is also achieved when $x = 20$, and the minimum value is $14400$. 

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $14400$. 
The answer is: $14400$

**Problem:** 

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:



The given equation is $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. We can rewrite this absolute value equation as a system of equations by considering the different cases for the absolute values.

If $x - 2y \geq 0$ and $y - 2x \geq 0$, then the equation becomes: $x - 2y + y - 2x = 40 \implies -x - y = 40$, which has no solution.

If $x - 2y \geq 0$ and $y - 2x < 0$, then the equation becomes: $x - 2y + 2x - y = 40 \implies 3x - 3y = 40 \implies x - y = \frac{40}{3}$.

If $x - 2y < 0$ and $y - 2x \geq 0$, then the equation becomes: $-x + 2y + y - 2x = 40 \implies -3x + 3y = 40 \implies y - x = \frac{40}{3}$.

If $x - 2y < 0$ and $y - 2x < 0$, then the equation becomes: $-x + 2y + 2x - y = 40 \implies x + y = 40$.

The cases $x - 2y \geq 0$ and $y - 2x < 0$, and $x - 2y < 0$ and $y - 2x \geq 0$, lead to the same equation $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$, which means we only need to consider two cases:

1) $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$ and $x + y = 40$
2) $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$ and $y - x = \frac{40}{3}$

For case 1), we can solve the system of equations:

$x - y = \frac{40}{3}$
$x + y = 40$

By adding the two equations, we get: $2x = \frac{40}{3} + 40 = \frac{160}{3}$, so $x = \frac{80}{3}$.
By subtracting the second equation from the first, we get: $-2y = \frac{40}{3} - 40 = -\frac{80}{3}$, so $y = \frac{40}{3}$.

For case 2), we already know from case 1) that $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$.

Now, we can substitute $x = \frac{80}{3}$ and $y = \frac{40}{3}$ into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$:
\[5\left(\frac{80}{3}\right)^2 + 5\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 - 8\left(\frac{80}{3}\right)\left(\frac{40}{3}\right) = \frac{6400}{9} + \frac{800}{9} - \frac{3200}{9} = \frac{3600}{9} = 400.\]

Therefore, the minimum value of the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ subject to the constraint $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$ is $\boxed{400}$. The answer is: $400$

4_**Problem:** 

"The data set $[6, 19, 33, 33, 39, 41, 41, 43, 51, 57]$ has median $Q_2 = 40$ , first quartile $Q_1 = 33$ , and third quartile $Q_3 = 43$ .

**Problem:** 

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


The given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is equivalent to $|x-2y| = |2x-y| = 20$ by the property of absolute values. This implies that $x-2y = \pm (2x-y)$ or $x-2y = \pm (y-2x)$. Solving these equations, we get two cases:
Case 1: $x-2y = 2x-y$. This simplifies to $y=x$.
Case 2: $x-2y = -(2x-y)$, which simplifies to $x=3y$.
Now we substitute these values back into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to find the minimum value.
If $y=x$, then we have $5x^2+5x^2-8x^2 = 2x^2$.
If $x=3y$, then we substitute $x=3y$ into the expression to get $5(3y)^2+5y^2-8(3y)y = 5*9y^2+5y^2-24y^2 = 20y^2$.
Now we need to minimize these two expressions.
For the expression $2x^2$, its minimum value is achieved when $x=0$, because the square of any real number is non-negative, and $2*0^2=0$.
For the expression $20y^2$, its minimum value is also achieved when $y=0$, because $20*0^2=0$.
So in both cases, the minimum value is $0$.
However, we need to check if the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ holds for $x=0$ and $y=0$.
If $x=0$, $y=0$, we have $|0-2*0| + |0-2*0| = 0$, which does not satisfy the equation.
So the minimum value can't be $0$.
Let's check the other cases.
If $y=x$, we have $|x-2x| + |x-2x| = 40$, which simplifies to $|-x| + |-x| = 40$. Since absolute value of any real number is non-negative, and the sum of two non-negative numbers is 40, both of them must be 20. So we have $-x=20$ or $x=-20$. The minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ in this case is $5(-20)^2+5(-20)^2-8(-20)*(-20) = 2000$.
If $x=3y$, we have $|3y-2*3y| + |3y-2*3y| = 40$, which simplifies to $|-3y| + |-3y| = 40$. So we have $|-3y| = 20$, which means $3y = \pm 20$. So $y = \pm \frac{20}{3}$. The minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ in this case is $5*(3*\frac{20}{3})^2+5(\frac{20}{3})^2-8*3*\frac{20}{3}*\frac{20}{3} = 0$.
Comparing these two cases, we find that the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $0$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $\boxed{0}$.
The answer is $\boxed{0}$.

**Problem:** 

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


First, we notice that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$.
By the Triangle Inequality, we have $|2y-x| + |2x-y| \ge |(2y-x) + (2x-y)| = |y| = |2y/2| \le 2|y|/2 = |y|$. So we must have $|y| = 20$.
Similarly, we can show that $|x| = 20$.
Now we want to minimize $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can write this as $5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x^2-2xy+y^2) + (x^2-6xy+y^2)] = 5[(x-y)^2 + (x-3y)^2]$.
Since $|x| = |y| = 20$, we have $(x-y)^2 + (x-3y)^2 = 40^2 + 40^2 = 3200$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $5 \cdot 3200 = 16000$. The answer is: $\boxed{16000}$

The only one that fits this is $6$ . All values more than $15$ above $Q3 = 43 + 15 = 58$ are also outliers, of which there are none so there is only $\boxed{1}$ outlier in total. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Problem:** 

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


First, we see that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is equivalent to $|x-2y| = 40 - |y-2x|$. This implies that $|x-2y|$ and $|y-2x|$ must have the same sign. However, since $|a| = -|a|$ if and only if $a=0$, we must have $|x-2y| = |y-2x|$, so $x-2y = y-2x$ or $x-2y = -(y-2x)$.
If $x-2y = y-2x$, we have $3x = 3y$, or $x=y$.
If $x-2y = -(y-2x)$, we have $x-2y = -y+2x$, which simplifies to $y=0$.

Then, we substitute $x=y$ into $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get $5x^2+5x^2-8x^2 = 2x^2$. This is a decreasing function for $x=y$, so the minimum value occurs when $x=y$ is the minimum value of $x$ or $y$.

Similarly, we substitute $y=0$ into $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get $5x^2+0-0 = 5x^2$. This is an increasing function for $y=0$, so the minimum value occurs when $y=0$ is the minimum value of $y$.

In conclusion, we need to compare the values of $2x^2$ when $x=y$ and the values of $5x^2$ when $y=0$.

When $x=y$, we have $2x^2$. The minimum value occurs when $x=0$, so the minimum value of $2x^2$ is $0$.

When $y=0$, we have $5x^2$. The minimum value occurs when $x=0$, so the minimum value of $5x^2$ is $0$.

Thus, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $0$. The answer is $\boxed{0}$.

**Problem:** 

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


First, note that $|x-2y| + |y-2x|$ can be expressed as $|-x+2y| + |-y+2x| = |2y-x| + |2x-y|$. This is equivalent to the sum of the distances from $(x, y)$ to the points $(2y, y)$ and $(x, 2x)$ on the coordinate plane. The set of all points that are a distance of 40 from both $(2y, y)$ and $(x, 2x)$ is the perpendicular bisector of the segment joining $(2y, y)$ and $(x, 2x)$, restricted to the points that are distance 40 from both.

Now consider the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = \frac{1}{2}((5x-4y)^2 + (4x-5y)^2)$. This is the sum of the squares of the distances from $(x, y)$ to the points $(4/5, 0)$ and $(0, 4/5)$.

The minimum value of the sum of squares of distances is achieved when the point $(x, y)$ lies on the perpendicular bisector of the segment joining $(2y, y)$ and $(x, 2x)$, because this is the locus of points equidistant from both $(2y, y)$ and $(x, 2x)$. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is achieved when $(x, y)$ lies on the perpendicular bisector of the segment joining $(2y, y)$ and $(x, 2x)$, restricted to the points that are distance 40 from both.

It can be shown that the perpendicular bisector of the segment joining $(2y, y)$ and $(x, 2x)$ is the line $x = y$. Therefore, the point $(x, y)$ lies on the line $x = y$.

Substitute $y = x$ into the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we get $|x-2x| + |x-2x| = 40$, which simplifies to $2|x-2x| = 40$, or $2|x-2x| = 40$, so $|x-2x| = 20$. This simplifies to $|x-2x| = 20$, or $|-x| = 20$, or $|x| = 20$. Therefore, the possible values of $x$ are $20$ and $-20$.

If $x = 20$, then $y = 20$, and the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is $\frac{1}{2}((5*20-4*20)^2 + (4*20-5*20)^2) = 0$.
If $x = -20$, then $y = -20$, and the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is also $\frac{1}{2}((5*-20-4*-20)^2 + (4*-20-5*-20)^2) = 0$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is 0, under the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. The answer is: $0$

**Problem:** 

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:



First, we can rewrite the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ by noting that $|a-b| = |b-a|$, so the equation is equivalent to $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$. Then, we can use the property $|a| + |b| = |a+b|$ if $a$ and $b$ have the same sign, or $|a| + |b| = |a-b|$ if $a$ and $b$ have opposite signs. So, the equation can be further simplified as $|x-2y+2y-x| = 40$, which simplifies to $|0| = 40$. This is a contradiction because $|0|$ is always 0, not 40. 

So, we made a mistake in our reasoning. Let's try a different approach.

The equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$. By the triangle inequality, $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$, so $|x-2y| + |2y-x| \geq |(x-2y) + (2y-x)| = |0| = 0$. But we know that $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$, which means that equality must hold in the triangle inequality. This only happens when $(x-2y)(2y-x) \geq 0$. After simplifying, we get $x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2 \geq 0$, which can be rewritten as $5y^2 - 5x^2 - 8xy \geq 0$.

Now, let's consider the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. From the inequality above, we know that this expression is always non-negative. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $0$.

So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $0$. The answer is: $0$
