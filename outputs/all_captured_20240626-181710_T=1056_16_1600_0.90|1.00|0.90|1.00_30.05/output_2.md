0_**Problem:** 

"Consider systems of three linear equations with unknowns $x$ $y$ , and $z$ \begin{align*} a_1 x + b_1 y + c_1 z & = 0 \\ a_2 x + b_2 y + c_2 z & = 0 \\ a_3 x + b_3 y + c_3 z & = 0 \end{align*} where each of the coefficients is either $0$ or $1$ and the system has a solution other than $x=y=z=0$ .
For example, one such system is \[\{ 1x + 1y + 0z = 0, 0x + 1y + 1z = 0, 0x + 0y + 0z = 0 \}\] with a nonzero solution of $\{x,y,z\} = \{1, -1, 1\}$ . How many such systems of equations are there?
(The equations in a system need not be distinct, and two systems containing the same equations in a
different order are considered different.)"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:
Denote vector $\overrightarrow{i} = \left( i_1, i_2, i_3 \right)^T$ for $i \in \left\{ a, b, c \right\}$ .
Thus, we need to count how many vector tuples $\left( \overrightarrow{a} , \overrightarrow{b} , \overrightarrow{c} \right)$ are linearly dependent.
We do complementary counting.
First, the total number of vector tuples $\left( \overrightarrow{a} , \overrightarrow{b} , \overrightarrow{c} \right)$ is $\left( 2^3 \right)^3 = 512$
Second, we count how many many vector tuples $\left( \overrightarrow{a} , \overrightarrow{b} , \overrightarrow{c} \right)$ are linearly independent.
To meet this condition, no vector can be a zero vector $\overrightarrow{0} = \left( 0, 0, 0 \right)^T$
Next, we do the casework analysis.
Case $1^c$ : Three vectors are all on axes.
In this case, the number of $\left( \overrightarrow{a} , \overrightarrow{b} , \overrightarrow{c} \right)$ is $3!$
Case $2^c$ : Two vectors are on axes and the third vector is not.
We construct such an instance in the following steps.
Step 1: We determine which two vectors lie on axes.
The number of ways is $3$
Step 2: For two vectors selected in Step 1, we determine which two axes they lie on.
The number of ways is $3 \cdot 2$
Step 3: For the third unselected vector, we determine its value.
To make three vectors linear independent, the third vector cannot be on the plane formed by the first two vectors.
So the number of ways is $3$
Following from the rule of product, the number of $\left( \overrightarrow{a} , \overrightarrow{b} , \overrightarrow{c} \right)$ in this case is $3 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 3$
Case $3^c$ : One vector is on an axis and the other two are not.
We construct such an instance in the following steps.
Step 1: We determine which vector lies on an axis.
The number of ways is $3$
Step 2: For the selected vector, we determine which axis it lies on.
The number of ways is $3$
Step 3: We determine the values of the two unselected vectors.
First, to be linearly independent, these two vectors are distinct.
Second, to be linearly independent, we cannot have one vector $(1,1,1)$ and another one that is a diagonal vector on the plane that is perpendicular to the first selected vector.
Thus, the number or ways in this step is $4 \cdot 3-2 = 10$
Following from the rule of product, the number of $\left( \overrightarrow{a} , \overrightarrow{b} , \overrightarrow{c} \right)$ in this case is $3 \cdot 3 \cdot 10$
Case $(4.4)^c$ : No vector is on any axis.
In this case, any three distinct vectors are linearly independent.
So the number of $\left( \overrightarrow{a} , \overrightarrow{b} , \overrightarrow{c} \right)$ in this case is $4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2$
Putting all cases together, the number of vector tuples $\left( \overrightarrow{a} , \overrightarrow{b} , \overrightarrow{c} \right)$ that are linearly independent is \[ 8^3 - 3!  - 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 - 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 10 - 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 = \boxed{338}. \] ~Steven Chen (Professor Chen Education Palace, www.professorchenedu.com) The answer is $\boxed{338}$

**Problem:** 

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


First, we need to understand that the equation $| |x-1|-2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is less than $2$. This is because $| |x-1|-2 |$ is equal to $2$ at exactly two points and reaches its maximum of $2$ in the middle. If $\frac{m}{100} > 2$, then the equation would have either three or two solutions. 

So, we have the inequality $\frac{m}{100} < 2$, which simplifies to $m < 200$.

Since $m$ is a positive integer, the possible values of $m$ are the integers from $1$ to $199$.

The question asks us for how many of these values the equation has four distinct solutions. From our earlier reasoning, the equation has four distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100} < 2$, or equivalently, when $m < 200$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is equal to the number of positive integers less than $200$. This is simply $199$.

The answer is: $\boxed{199}$

**Problem:** 

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}=1$. This is because the graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ consists of two "V"s that are symmetric about the line $x=1$, and each "V" has a width of $4$. Thus, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ equals $1$ exactly $4$ times.
So we have $\frac{m}{100}=1$, which gives $m=100$. However, we need to check if it is a valid solution. Substituting $m=100$ into the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, we have $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=1$. This equation has indeed $4$ solutions, so $m=100$ is a valid solution.
Therefore, there is $\boxed{1}$ positive integer $m$ that satisfies the condition. The answer is $\boxed{1}$.

2_**Problem:** 

"Consider systems of three linear equations with unknowns $x$ $y$ , and $z$ \begin{align*} a_1 x + b_1 y + c_1 z & = 0 \\ a_2 x + b_2 y + c_2 z & = 0 \\ a_3 x + b_3 y + c_3 z & = 0 \end{align*} where each of the coefficients is either $0$ or $1$ and the system has a solution other than $x=y=z=0$ .

**Problem:** 

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


The graph of $y=\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a "V" shape with the "tipping point" at $x=1$.
The graph of $y=\frac{m}{100}$ is a horizontal line at $y=\frac{m}{100}$.
For the two graphs to intersect at 4 distinct points, the line $y=\frac{m}{100}$ must lie strictly between the "valleys" of the "V" shape.
The "V" shape reaches its minimum value at $y=0$ and its maximum value at $y=4$.
Therefore, we must have $0<\frac{m}{100}<4$, or $0<m<400$.
Since $m$ is a positive integer, the possible values of $m$ are $1, 2, \dots, 399$, for a total of $399$ values.
The answer is $\boxed{399}$.

**Problem:** 

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ with 4 distinct solutions means that the equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = y$ ($|y| \leq \frac{m}{100}$) has two solutions in $x$ that are symmetric about the point $x=1$. This implies that the value of $y$ makes the graph of $\vert x-1 \vert -2$ intersect the line $y=\frac{m}{100}$ twice and the line $y=-\frac{m}{100}$ twice.

We analyze the graph of $\vert x-1 \vert -2$: When $x<1$, $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -(x-1) - 2 = -x - 1$. When $x \geq 1$, $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = x - 1 - 2 = x - 3$. The graph consists of two lines: $y=-x-1$ for $x<1$ and $y=x-3$ for $x \geq 1$.

We see that the graph intersects the line $y=\frac{m}{100}$ twice and the line $y=-\frac{m}{100}$ twice when $\frac{m}{100}=1$ or $\frac{m}{100}=2$. This gives $m=100$ or $m=200$. Therefore, there are 2 positive integers $m$ that satisfy the equation. The answer is: 2.

**Problem:** 

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

First, we note that the left side of the equation is always nonnegative, so $\frac{m}{100}$ must be positive. This implies that $m$ must be positive.

Now, let's consider the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. This equation will have $4$ distinct solutions if and only if the equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = k$ (where $k = \pm \frac{m}{100}$) has two solutions that differ in sign. This is because the equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = k$ can be split into two cases: $x-1 - 2 = k$ and $-(x-1) - 2 = k$, which simplifies to $x-3 = k$ and $1-x-2 = k$, or $x = k+3$ and $x = 1 - k - 2 = -k - 1$. The two solutions will differ in sign if and only if one is positive and one is negative.

So, we need to solve the equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$. This equation simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which further simplifies to two separate equations: $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $-(x-1) = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, or $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

We want the solutions to be distinct, so we require that $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 - \frac{m}{100}$, or $4 = \frac{2m}{100}$, or $2m = 400$, or $m = 200$.

So there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions, and that is $m = 200$.
The answer is: $\boxed{1}$

5_**Problem:** 

"Consider systems of three linear equations with unknowns $x$ $y$ , and $z$ \begin{align*} a_1 x + b_1 y + c_1 z & = 0 \\ a_2 x + b_2 y + c_2 z & = 0 \\ a_3 x + b_3 y + c_3 z & = 0 \end{align*} where each of the coefficients is either $0$ or $1$ and the system has a solution other than $x=y=z=0$ .
For example, one such system is \[\{ 1x + 1y + 0z = 0, 0x + 1y + 1z = 0, 0x + 0y + 0z = 0 \}\] with a nonzero solution of $\{x,y,z\} = \{1, -1, 1\}$ . How many such systems of equations are there?
(The equations in a system need not be distinct, and two systems containing the same equations in a
different order are considered different.)"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:
Denote vector $\overrightarrow{i} = \left( i_1, i_2, i_3 \right)^T$ for $i \in \left\{ a, b, c \right\}$ .
Thus, we need to count how many vector tuples $\left( \overrightarrow{a} , \overrightarrow{b} , \overrightarrow{c} \right)$ are linearly dependent.
We do complementary counting.
First, the total number of vector tuples $\left( \overrightarrow{a} , \overrightarrow{b} , \overrightarrow{c} \right)$ is $\left( 2^3 \right)^3 = 512$
Second, we count how many many vector tuples $\left( \overrightarrow{a} , \overrightarrow{b} , \overrightarrow{c} \right)$ are linearly independent.
To meet this condition, no vector can be a zero vector $\overrightarrow{0} = \left( 0, 0, 0 \right)^T$
Next, we do the casework analysis.
Case $1^c$ : Three vectors are all on axes.
In this case, the number of $\left( \overrightarrow{a} , \overrightarrow{b} , \overrightarrow{c} \right)$ is $3!$
Case $2^c$ : Two vectors are on axes and the third vector is not.
We construct such an instance in the following steps.
Step 1: We determine which two vectors lie on axes.
The number of ways is $3$
Step 2: For two vectors selected in Step 1, we determine which two axes they lie on.
The number of ways is $3 \cdot 2$
Step 3: For the third unselected vector, we determine its value.
To make three vectors linear independent, the third vector cannot be on the plane formed by the first two vectors.
So the number of ways is $3$
Following from the rule of product, the number of $\left( \overrightarrow{a} , \overrightarrow{b} , \overrightarrow{c} \right)$ in this case is $3 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 3$
Case $3^c$ : One vector is on an axis and the other two are not.
We construct such an instance in the following steps.
Step 1: We determine which vector lies on an axis.
The number of ways is $3$
Step 2: For the selected vector, we determine which axis it lies on.
The number of ways is $3$
Step 3: We determine the values of the two unselected vectors.
First, to be linearly independent, these two vectors are distinct.
Second, to be linearly independent, we cannot have one vector $(1,1,1)$ and another one that is a diagonal vector on the plane that is perpendicular to the first selected vector.
Thus, the number or ways in this step is $4 \cdot 3-2 = 10$
Following from the rule of product, the number of $\left( \overrightarrow{a} , \overrightarrow{b} , \overrightarrow{c} \right)$ in this case is $3 \cdot 3 \cdot 10$
Case $(4.4)^c$ : No vector is on any axis.
In this case, any three distinct vectors are linearly independent.
So the number of $\left( \overrightarrow{a} , \overrightarrow{b} , \overrightarrow{c} \right)$ in this case is $4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2$
Putting all cases together, the number of vector tuples $\left( \overrightarrow{a} , \overrightarrow{b} , \overrightarrow{c} \right)$ that are linearly independent is \[ 8^3 - 3!  - 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 - 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 10 - 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 = \boxed{338}. \] ~Steven Chen (Professor Chen Education Palace, www.professorchenedu.com) The answer is $\boxed{338}$

**Problem:** 

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is a piecewise continuous function, which has a V-shape graph. For the function to have 4 distinct solutions, the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be strictly between 1 and 2, i.e., $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. This implies that $100 < m < 200$.

The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are $101, 102, \ldots, 199$. The number of such positive integers is $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$.
The answer is $\boxed{99}$.

**Problem:** 

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


The equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if the number $\frac{m}{100}$ can be written in the form $|a - 2|$ in two ways, where $a$ is the distance from $x$ to $1$. This is because $| |x - 1| - 2 |$ represents the distance from $x$ to $1$, after subtracting $2$. 
The number $|a - 2|$ can take on two different values if and only if $2 - a$ and $a - 2$ are both positive.
This happens if and only if $a > 2$.
Therefore, $a = |x - 1|$ must be greater than $2$.
This means $x - 1 > 2$ or $1 - x > 2$.
The solutions to these inequalities are $x > 3$ or $x < -1$.
We want to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation has four distinct solutions.
This means we want to find the number of values of $m$ such that $\frac{m}{100}$ can be expressed in the form $|a - 2|$ in two ways, where $a$ is the distance from $x$ to $1$, and $x$ is either greater than $3$ or less than $-1$.
For $x > 3$, we have $a = x - 1 > 2$, so $|a - 2| = a - 2$.
For $x < -1$, we have $a = 1 - x > 2$, so $|a - 2| = 2 - a$.
To satisfy both cases, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $\frac{m}{100} = a - 2$ in one case and $\frac{m}{100} = 2 - a$ in the other case.
This means $\frac{m}{100} = a - 2$ in one case and $\frac{m}{100} = 4 - a$ in the other.
Adding these equations, we get $\frac{2m}{100} = 2$, so $m = 100$.
Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ that satisfies the condition, and that is $m = 100$. 
The answer is: $1$
The answer is $\boxed{1}$.

**Problem:** 

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


The equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions means that the expression $|x-1|-2$ goes through $\frac{m}{100}$ and $- \frac{m}{100}$ twice each. 
This implies that the expression $|x - 1| - 2$ must be equal to $\frac{m}{100}$ at two different $x$, and the expression $|x-1| - 2$ must be equal to $-\frac{m}{100}$ at two different $x$.
Let's think about the case $|x - 1| - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$ first.  The equation $|x - 1| = \frac{m}{100} + 2$ is equivalent to two equations: $x - 1 = \frac{m}{100} + 2$ or $x - 1 = -(\frac{m}{100} + 2)$. From the first equation we get $x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$, and from the second equation we get $x = 1 - \frac{m}{100} - 2 = 1 - \frac{m+200}{100}$. We want these two solutions to be different, so $\frac{m}{100} + 3 \neq 1 - \frac{m+200}{100}$. Simplifying this inequality we get $m \neq 100$. So $m$ can be any integer from 1 to 99.
The other case $|x - 1| - 2 = - \frac{m}{100}$ leads to two equations: $x - 1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x - 1 = -2 + \frac{m}{100}$. The solutions are $x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$ and $x = - \frac{m}{100} + 1$. However, these two solutions are the same, so the case does not give us any new constraints on $m$. Therefore, the value of $m$ must be any integer from 1 to 99. The number of these integers is $99$.
The answer is: 99.
The answer is: $99$

**Problem:** 

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:

 
The equation $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions.
We consider two cases:
Case 1: $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|=\frac{m}{100}$.
In this case, we have $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \pm \frac{m}{100}$.
Solving for $\vert x-1 \vert$, we get $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 \pm \frac{m}{100}$.
This gives us two equations: $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
The first equation, $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, has two solutions when $2 + \frac{m}{100} > 0$, or $m > -200$.
The second equation, $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, has two solutions when $2 - \frac{m}{100} > 0$, or $m < 200$.
So in this case, the value of $m$ must be in the interval $(0, 200)$.
Case 2: $-|\vert x-1 \vert -2|=\frac{m}{100}$.
In this case, we have $-(\vert x-1 \vert -2) = \frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.
Solving for $\vert x-1 \vert$, we get $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
This equation has two solutions when $2 - \frac{m}{100} > 0$, or $m < 200$.
So in this case, the value of $m$ must be in the interval $(-200, 0)$.
Combining the two cases, we see that the value of $m$ must be an integer in the interval $(-200, 200)$.
The number of positive integers in this interval is $400$.
Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions is $400$.
The answer is $\boxed{400}$.

"Consider systems of three linear equations with unknowns $x$ $y$ , and $z$ \begin{align*} a_1 x + b_1 y + c_1 z & = 0 \\ a_2 x + b_2 y + c_2 z & = 0 \\ a_3 x + b_3 y + c_3 z & = 0 \end{align*} where each of the coefficients is either $0$ or $1$ and the system has a solution other than $x=y=z=0$ .
For example, one such system is \[\{ 1x + 1y + 0z = 0, 0x + 1y + 1z = 0, 0x + 0y + 0z = 0 \}\] with a nonzero solution of $\{x,y,z\} = \{1, -1, 1\}$ . How many such systems of equations are there?
(The equations in a system need not be distinct, and two systems containing the same equations in a
different order are considered different.)"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:
Denote vector $\overrightarrow{i} = \left( i_1, i_2, i_3 \right)^T$ for $i \in \left\{ a, b, c \right\}$ .
Thus, we need to count how many vector tuples $\left( \overrightarrow{a} , \overrightarrow{b} , \overrightarrow{c} \right)$ are linearly dependent.
We do complementary counting.
First, the total number of vector tuples $\left( \overrightarrow{a} , \overrightarrow{b} , \overrightarrow{c} \right)$ is $\left( 2^3 \right)^3 = 512$
Second, we count how many many vector tuples $\left( \overrightarrow{a} , \overrightarrow{b} , \overrightarrow{c} \right)$ are linearly independent.
To meet this condition, no vector can be a zero vector $\overrightarrow{0} = \left( 0, 0, 0 \right)^T$
Next, we do the casework analysis.
Case $1^c$ : Three vectors are all on axes.
In this case, the number of $\left( \overrightarrow{a} , \overrightarrow{b} , \overrightarrow{c} \right)$ is $3!$
Case $2^c$ : Two vectors are on axes and the third vector is not.
We construct such an instance in the following steps.
Step 1: We determine which two vectors lie on axes.
The number of ways is $3$
Step 2: For two vectors selected in Step 1, we determine which two axes they lie on.
The number of ways is $3 \cdot 2$
Step 3: For the third unselected vector, we determine its value.
To make three vectors linear independent, the third vector cannot be on the plane formed by the first two vectors.
So the number of ways is $3$
Following from the rule of product, the number of $\left( \overrightarrow{a} , \overrightarrow{b} , \overrightarrow{c} \right)$ in this case is $3 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 3$
Case $3^c$ : One vector is on an axis and the other two are not.
We construct such an instance in the following steps.
Step 1: We determine which vector lies on an axis.
The number of ways is $3$
Step 2: For the selected vector, we determine which axis it lies on.
The number of ways is $3$
Step 3: We determine the values of the two unselected vectors.
First, to be linearly independent, these two vectors are distinct.
Second, to be linearly independent, we cannot have one vector $(1,1,1)$ and another one that is a diagonal vector on the plane that is perpendicular to the first selected vector.
Thus, the number or ways in this step is $4 \cdot 3-2 = 10$
Following from the rule of product, the number of $\left( \overrightarrow{a} , \overrightarrow{b} , \overrightarrow{c} \right)$ in this case is $3 \cdot 3 \cdot 10$
Case $(4.4)^c$ : No vector is on any axis.
In this case, any three distinct vectors are linearly independent.
So the number of $\left( \overrightarrow{a} , \overrightarrow{b} , \overrightarrow{c} \right)$ in this case is $4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2$
Putting all cases together, the number of vector tuples $\left( \overrightarrow{a} , \overrightarrow{b} , \overrightarrow{c} \right)$ that are linearly independent is \[ 8^3 - 3!  - 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 - 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 10 - 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 = \boxed{338}. \] ~Steven Chen (Professor Chen Education Palace, www.professorchenedu.com) The answer is $\boxed{338}$

**Problem:** 

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}=2.$ This leads to $m=200.$ So there is only one such value of $m.$ The answer is $\boxed{1}$.
