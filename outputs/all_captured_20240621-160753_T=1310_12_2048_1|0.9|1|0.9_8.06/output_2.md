Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Approach:


1. We are looking for positive integers $m$ such that the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has 4 distinct solutions.
2. We can start by setting $\frac{m}{100}$ to $k$ and then solving the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=k$.
3. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=k$ will have 4 distinct solutions if and only if $0 < k < 1$.
4. We can rewrite the equation as two separate cases: $\vert x-1 \vert - 2 = k$ and $\vert x-1 \vert - 2 = -k$.
5. Solving these two equations separately, we get:

Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert - 2 = k \implies \vert x-1 \vert = k+2$. This gives us two sub-cases: $x-1 = k+2$ and $x-1 = -(k+2)$.

Case 2: $\vert x-1 \vert - 2 = -k \implies \vert x-1 \vert = 2-k$. This gives us two sub-cases: $x-1 = 2-k$ and $x-1 = -(2-k)$.

6. Solving these sub-cases, we get four distinct solutions for $x$:

Case 1: $x = k+3$, $x = -k+1$.

Case 2: $x = 3-k$, $x = k-1$.

7. For these four solutions to be distinct, we need $k+3 \neq -k+1$, $k+3 \neq 3-k$, $-k+1 \neq 3-k$, and $-k+1 \neq k-1$.
8. Solving these inequalities, we find that $0 < k < 1$.
9. Therefore, the value of $m$ is the value of $100k$ in this range.

The entire script to calculate the value of $m$ would be as follows:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solve, Eq, Abs

def find_m():
    x, k, m = symbols('x k m')

    # Set the equation
    equation = Eq(Abs(Abs(x - 1) - 2), k)

    # Solve the equation for x in each case
    case1_x = solve(equation.subs(k, m/100), x)
    case2_x = solve(equation.subs(k, -m/100), x)

    # Combine the solutions
    solutions = case1_x + case2_x

    # Ensure the solutions are distinct
    distinct_solutions = all(solutions[i] != solutions[j] for i in range(len(solutions)) for j in range(i+1, len(solutions)))

    # If the solutions are distinct and k is in the range (0, 1), return m
    if distinct_solutions and 0 < m/100 < 1:
        return m

# Find the value of m
m_value = find_m()
print(m_value)
```

It seems the script encounters a problem. Let's rework on it.

We know that $0 < k < 1$ for the equation to have 4 distinct solutions. So we can set $k = \frac{m}{100}$, then we get $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 1$, which simplifies to $0 < m < 100$. The only positive integer $m$ that satisfies this inequality is $m = 1$.

So the positive integer value of $m$ is $\boxed{1}$. The answer is: $\boxed{1}$

Approach:


We want to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. 

This equation is equivalent to a system of four linear inequalities. The solutions to the system will be the values of $x$ that satisfy the equation. The number of distinct solutions will be the number of values of $x$ that satisfy the equation. 

To find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions, we can use sympy's `solve` function to find the values of $x$ that satisfy the equation for each value of $m$, and then count the number of distinct solutions for each value of $m$. 

Here is the entire script that accomplishes this:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solve

def count_distinct_solutions():
    x, m = symbols('x m')
    num_solutions = 0

    for m_value in range(1, 101):  # m ranges from 1 to 100
        equation = abs(abs(x - 1) - 2) - m_value / 100
        solutions = solve(equation, x)
        num_solutions_for_m = len(set(solutions))  # count distinct solutions

        if num_solutions_for_m == 4:
            num_solutions += 1

    return num_solutions

result = count_distinct_solutions()
print(result)
```

100

```output

```
The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 100.
The answer is: $100$

Approach:



1. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 1$. 

2. To find the value of m that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions, we can set $\frac{m}{100}$ equal to 1 and solve for m. This gives us $m = 100$.

3. So the value of m for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 100.

Now, let's write the entire script to print the result:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def find_m():
    # As per our approach, the equation | |x-1| - 2| = m/100 has 4 distinct solutions if and only if m/100 = 1.
    # So we can set m/100 = 1 and solve for m.
    m = 100
    return m

result = find_m()
print(result)
```

100

CODE RESULTS 100

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
100
```
The value of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $100$.
The answer is: $100$
