Solution:

The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, which means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.

Let's consider the first expression:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0.$$

This expression is zero if and only if both terms inside the parenthesis are zero:
$$\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad \vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0.$$

Simplifying these equations, we get:
$$\vert x + y \vert = 10 \quad \text{and} \quad \vert x - y \vert = 10.$$

This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the polygon: $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, and $(-10, 0)$.

Now let's consider the second expression:
$$((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$

This expression is zero if and only if both terms inside the parenthesis are zero:
$$\vert x \vert - 8 = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad \vert y \vert - 8 = 0.$$

Simplifying these equations, we get:
$$\vert x \vert = 8 \quad \text{and} \quad \vert y \vert = 8.$$

This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. But this condition does not affect the vertices of the polygon, which are determined by the first expression.

Now we can draw the polygon: it is a square with side length 10 units. To find its area, we simply square the length of its side: $10^2 = 100$. So the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units.

The answer is $\boxed{100}$.

Solution:

The problem statement defines a set of points $(x, y)$ satisfying a specific equation and asks for the area of the convex polygon that they enclose. The equation is
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]
This equation is equal to zero if and only if at least one of the two factors is zero. Therefore, the points that satisfy the equation must satisfy either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$. This is the equation of two parallel lines.

For $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = \pm 10$. This is also the equation of two parallel lines.

For $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$. This is the equation of two vertical lines.

For $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = \pm 8$. This is the equation of two horizontal lines.

The intersections of these lines form a rectangle with sides of length 16 and 20. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $16 \times 20 = 320$. The answer is: $320$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (hint: answer is a natural number):

Problem Statement: "The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Solution:

The problem statement is asking for the area of a polygon defined by the points that satisfy the given equation. The equation is:

$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$

The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So, the equation is equivalent to:

$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad ((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$

The first equation implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us a square with side length 10, centered at the origin. The second equation implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us a square with side length 16, also centered at the origin.

The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for. The area of the convex polygon is the area of the smaller square, which is $(10)^2 = 100$. So the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units.

The answer is: $100$

Solution:

To solve this problem, we need to understand the conditions given by the equation and find the area of the convex polygon they enclose.

The equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

For the product of two numbers to be zero, either one of the numbers must be zero. Therefore, we have two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From the first case, we have $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

From the second case, we have $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The solutions from the first case are the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, and the lines $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$.

The solutions from the second case are the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$, and the lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

The intersection points of these lines form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points satisfying the given equation is 100 square units.
The answer is: 100

Solution:

The problem statement is asking for the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points $\left(x, y\right)$ that satisfy the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

The expression on the left-hand side of the equation is the product of two terms. In order for this product to be zero, either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.

The first term is zero when either $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. These equations simplify to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The absolute value equations further simplify to the four equations $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These equations represent the sides of a square with side length 10.

The second term is zero when either $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. These equations simplify to $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The absolute value equations further simplify to the four equations $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These equations represent the sides of a square with side length 16.

The intersection of the two squares is a smaller square with side length 8. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of the larger square minus the area of the smaller square. The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of the larger square is $10^2 = 100$, and the area of the smaller square is $8^2 = 64$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $100 - 64 = 36$.

The answer is $\boxed{36}$.

Solution:

The problem statement gives a condition that the product of two terms is zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $\vert x + y \vert = 10$.
This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$.

Case 2: $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
This implies that $x - y = \pm 10$.

Case 3: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $\vert x \vert = 8$.
This implies that $x = \pm 8$.

Case 4: $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
This implies that $y = \pm 8$.

By combining the results from the four cases, we can see that the points that satisfy the given condition are on a square with side length 16. The vertices of the square are $(\pm 8, \pm 8)$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of the square, which is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Solution:

The problem statement provides an equation that is equal to zero and asks for the area of the enclosed region. The equation is:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$

The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the equation is satisfied if either of the following two conditions holds:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first condition to hold, both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ must be zero, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$, which results in the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, and $(-10, 0)$.

For the second condition to hold, both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2$ must be zero, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$, which results in the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The intersection of the two regions is the square with side length 16, which is formed by the intersection of the rectangle and the square. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points that satisfy the given equation is 256 square units.
The answer is: $256$

## Solution:

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given equation and find the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy it. The equation is:

$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$

The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, either:

1. $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$, or
2. $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

For the first case, we have:

$$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \text{ and } (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0.$$

This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these absolute value equations are:

1. $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$,
2. $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$,
3. $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$,
4. $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$.

Solving these systems of equations, we get the vertices of the polygon:

1. $(5, 5)$,
2. $(0, 10)$,
3. $(-5, 5)$,
4. $(0, -10)$.

For the second case, we have:

$$(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \text{ and } (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0.$$

This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these absolute value equations are:

1. $x = 8$ and $y = 8$,
2. $x = 8$ and $y = -8$,
3. $x = -8$ and $y = 8$,
4. $x = -8$ and $y = -8$.

These points also lie on the polygon.

Now we can plot the vertices and draw the polygon. It is a square with side length 10 units. The area of the square is $10^2 = 100$ square units. So the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units.
The answer is: $100$
