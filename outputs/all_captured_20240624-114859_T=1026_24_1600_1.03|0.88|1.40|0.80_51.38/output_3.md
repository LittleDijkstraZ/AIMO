Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. Each of these equations is satisfied if and only if the absolute value of the corresponding expression is equal to 10 or 8. This means that the points that satisfy the equation are the solutions to the following system of equations:
1. $|x + y| = 10$ or $|x + y| = 8$
2. $|x - y| = 10$ or $|x - y| = 8$
3. $|x| = 10$ or $|x| = 8$
4. $|y| = 10$ or $|y| = 8$
The solutions to these equations are the vertices of a square with side length 16 (since $|x| = 8$ implies $-8 \leq x \leq 8$, and similarly for $y$). Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The equation given is equivalent to two separate conditions:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first condition, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This represents a set of lines in the plane.

For the second condition, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. This represents a set of lines in the plane.

The intersection of these lines form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The problem statement involves absolute values and a product of two expressions equal to zero, which suggests that the points satisfying the equation are the solutions to each factor being zero.

The first factor is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. This expression equals to zero if and only if both $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These two equations represent two squares of distances from the point $(x, y)$ to the points $(-5, -5)$ and $(5, 5)$ on the plane. Thus, the points satisfying this factor being zero are the points in the convex polygon with vertices at $(-5, -5)$, $(5, -5)$, $(5, 5)$, and $(-5, 5)$.

The second factor is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. This expression equals to zero if and only if both $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These two equations represent squares of distances from the point $(x, y)$ to the points $(8, 0)$ and $(0, 8)$ on the plane. Thus, the points satisfying this factor being zero are the points in the convex polygon with vertices at $(8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, $(-8, 0)$, and $(0, -8)$.

The intersection of these two polygons is a square with side length of 10 units, and its area is $10^2 = 100$ square units. So, the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units.

Here is a Python function to calculate the area of the polygon:

```python

def area_of_polygon():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    side_length = 10
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

The area of the convex polygon is 100 square units. The answer is: $100$

 The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ implies that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
For the first case, $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies that $x = 0$ and $y = 0$.
For the second case, $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that $x = 8$ or $x = -8$, and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.
These points form a square with side length 16.
The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The problem involves a product of two expressions, each of which must be zero in order for the product to be zero. Therefore, we have two separate cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle.

For the second case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines also form a rectangle.

The two rectangles intersect at their vertices, forming a larger rectangle. The dimensions of the larger rectangle are $20 \times 16$, so its area is $20 \times 16 = 320$.
The answer is: $320$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. Therefore, either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. This gives us two sets of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first set of equations, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$. This implies that $-10 \leq x + y \leq 10$ and $-8 \leq x \leq 8$. Similarly, for the second set of equations, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $-10 \leq x - y \leq 10$ and $-8 \leq y \leq 8$.

The points that satisfy these inequalities form a square with side length 16. Therefore, the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = polygon_area()

The area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{256}$.
