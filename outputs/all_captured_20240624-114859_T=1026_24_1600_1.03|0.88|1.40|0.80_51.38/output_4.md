This problem is a functional equation problem, and it is not straightforward to solve it with a program. However, we can provide a recursive solution based on the given conditions.

First, we can see that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ implies that $f(f(n))$ is the inverse of $f(n)$. Therefore, we can find $f(n)$ by solving the equation $f(f(n)) = n$.

Next, we can use the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to find the value of $f(100)$.

Here is the Python code to calculate $f(100)$:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def f(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    elif n % 2 == 0:
        return 2 * f(n // 2) + 1
    else:
        return 2 * f((n - 1) // 2) + 1

f_100 = f(100)
print(f_100)
```

CODE RESULTS 127

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
127
```
The value of $f(100)$ is $127$. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{127}$.

This problem is a bit tricky to solve directly using code. However, we can make some observations to simplify it.

The second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ implies that $f(n)$ is an increasing function. So, we can start by calculating $f(1)$, then $f(2)$, and so on, until we find $f(100)$.

We know that $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$, so $f(f(1))=1$ or $f(1)=1$.

Then, we can calculate $f(2)$ using the second equation: $f(2)=2f(1)+1=2*1+1=3$.

Next, $f(3)$ can be calculated from $f(f(f(3)))=8*3-7=17$, so $f(f(3))=17$. Since we know $f(3)$ must be greater than 1 (because of the increasing property), and $f(f(3))=17$ is not a value we've seen yet, we can deduce that $f(3)$ is the only possible solution. Thus, $f(3)=3$.

Continuing this way, we can calculate $f(4)=5$, $f(5)=7$, and so on. We find that $f(100)=199$.

So, the answer is $\boxed{199}$.

Below is a Python code to calculate $f(100)$:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def find_f_100():
    # f(f(f(1)))=1 => f(f(1))=1 => f(1)=1
    f_1 = 1
    # f(2n)=2f(n)+1
    for i in range(2, 101):
        f_i = 2 * f_1 + 1
        f_1 = f_i
    return f_i

result = find_f_100()
print(result)
```

The result of the Python code is not correct because the code does not follow the conditions of the function $f$. The conditions are $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. The Python code only uses the second condition and does not use the first condition. Let's modify the Python code to follow the conditions:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def find_f_100():
    # Initialize the function value for n=1
    f_1 = 1
    # Iterate from 2 to 100 to find the value of f(n) using the second condition
    for i in range(2, 101):
        # Calculate f(2n) using the second condition
        f_2n = 2 * f_1 + 1
        # Iterate from 3 to n to find the value of f(n) using the first condition
        for j in range(3, i+1):
            # Calculate f(f(f(j))) using the first condition
            f_ffj = 8 * j - 7
            if f_2n == f_ffj:
                f_i = f_2n
                break
        f_1 = f_i
    return f_i

result = find_f_100()

The modified Python code still gives an error because the code does not correctly calculate $f(n)$ using the first condition. Let's modify the Python code again:

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 To find the value of $f(100)$, we need to use the given conditions to find the value of $f$ at different points and eventually reach $f(100)$.

First, let's set $n = 1$ in the second condition $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. We get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. But we also know from the first condition that $f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = 1$. Since $f(f(f(1))) = 1$, we have $f(f(1)) = f(1)$, and therefore $f(1) = 1$.

Then we substitute $f(1) = 1$ into the equation $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$, we get $f(2) = 2*1 + 1 = 3$.

Now let's set $n = 2$ in the second condition $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. We get $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2*3 + 1 = 7$.

Then set $n = 4$ in the first condition $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, we get $f(f(f(4))) = 8*4 - 7 = 25$. Since $f(f(f(4))) = 25$, we have $f(f(7)) = 25$.

Now set $n = 7$ in the second condition $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. We get $f(14) = 2f(7) + 1$. Since $f(f(7)) = 25$, we have $f(14) = 2*25 + 1 = 51$.

Finally, set $n = 14$ in the first condition $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, we get $f(f(f(14))) = 8*14 - 7 = 109$. Since $f(f(f(14))) = 109$, we have $f(f(51)) = 109$.

But we know that $f(f(7)) = 25$, so we can substitute $f(51)$ into $f(f(51)) = 109$, we get $f(51) = 109/f(7) = 109/25$.

Now set $n = 51$ in the second condition $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. We get $f(102) = 2f(51) + 1 = 2*(109/25) + 1 = 218/25 + 1 = 243/25$. But this result is not an integer, which contradicts the fact that $f(n)$ should be an integer for all positive integers $n$.

Therefore, we must have made a mistake in our calculations. Let's go back and check them again.

After checking the calculations again, we find that the mistake is in the equation $f(14) = 2f(7) + 1$. It should be $f(14) = 2f(7)$. So we correct this and redo the calculations:

$f(1) = 1$, $f(2) = 3$, $f(4) = 7$, $f(7) = 25$, $f(14) = 50$, $f(28) = 101$, $f(56) = 203$, $f(112) = 407$, $f(224) = 815$.

But we notice that $f(224) = 815$ does not fit the form $8n - 7$. So we must have made another mistake. Let's go back and check again.

After checking the calculations again, we find that the mistake is in the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n)$. It should be $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. So we correct this and redo the calculations:

$f(1) = 1$, $f(2) = 3$, $f(4) = 7$, $f(7) = 15$, $f(14) = 31$, $f(28) = 63$, $f(56) = 127$, $f(112) = 255$, $f(224) = 511$.

Now we can see that $f(224) = 511$ fits the form $8n - 7$ because $511 = 8*63 - 7$. So we can conclude that $f(n) = 8n - 7$ for all positive integers $n$.

Finally, we can calculate $f(100)$ by substituting $n = 100$ into $f(n) = 8n - 7$. We get $f(100) = 8*100 - 7 = 793$.
The answer is: $793$

 Solving this problem requires a deep understanding of the function $f$ and its properties. The first equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ gives us information about the nested function, and the second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ helps us understand how the function behaves when the argument is multiplied by 2.

We can start by trying to find the value of $f(1)$ using the second equation. We know that $f(2)=2f(1)+1$. If we set $n=1$, we get $f(2)=2f(1)+1$. But from the first equation, we know that $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$. Since $f(f(f(1)))=1$, it means that $f(1)$ is the only natural number that when fed into $f$ three times gives 1. Therefore, $f(1)$ must be 1 because $f(f(f(1)))=f(f(1))=f(1)=1$. 

Now that we know $f(1)=1$, we can substitute $n=1$ into the second equation to find $f(2)$: $f(2)=2f(1)+1=2*1+1=3$.

We can continue this process to find $f(3)$, $f(4)$, and so on. By doing this, we can find that $f(100)=199$.

Here is a Python program that implements this process:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def f(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1

```

The value of $f(100)$ is $199$. The answer is: $199$

Assistant:

 To solve this problem, we can start by plugging in $n=1$ into the second condition: $f(f(f(1)))=f(f(1))=f(1)=8(1)-7=1$.
So we know that $f(1)=1$.
Then we can plug in $n=1$ into the second condition again: $f(2)=2f(1)+1=2(1)+1=3$.
We can continue this process to find $f(2)=3$, $f(3)=5$, $f(4)=7$, $f(5)=9$, and so on.
We notice a pattern that $f(n)=2n-1$ for all positive integers $n$.
Now we can check if this pattern satisfies the first condition:
$f(f(f(n)))=f(f(2n-1))=f(2(2n-1)-1)=f(4n-3)=8n-7$.
So indeed, the pattern $f(n)=2n-1$ satisfies both conditions.
Finally, we can calculate $f(100)$ using the pattern: $f(100)=2(100)-1=199$.
The answer is: $199$

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 To solve this problem, we need to find the value of $f(100)$ given the conditions $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.

First, we can observe that for $n=1$, the second condition gives us $f(2)=2f(1)+1$.
If we let $f(1)=a$, then $f(2)=2a+1$.
Substituting $f(2)$ into the first condition for $n=1$, we have $f(f(f(1)))=f(f(a))=f(2a+1)=8*1-7=1$.
Since $f(f(f(1)))=1$, we have $f(a)=1$.
Therefore, $a=1$, so $f(1)=1$.

Now, we can use the second condition to find $f(2)$:
$f(2)=2f(1)+1=2*1+1=3$.

Then, we can use the second condition again to find $f(4)$:
$f(4)=2f(2)+1=2*3+1=7$.

And again to find $f(8)$:
$f(8)=2f(4)+1=2*7+1=15$.

Continuing this process, we find:
$f(16) = 31$,
$f(32) = 63$,
$f(64) = 127$.

We notice that the values of $f(2^n)$ are all one less than a power of two. In fact, $f(2^n) = 2^n - 1$.

Now, to find $f(100)$, we need to express 100 as a power of 2. We can write $100 = 2^6 + 2^2 = 64 + 4$.

Using the second condition, we have $f(100) = f(64 + 4) = f(64) + f(4) = (2^6 - 1) + (2*3 + 1) = 64 - 1 + 6 + 1 = 70$.

Therefore, the value of $f(100)$ is 70. The answer is: $70$

This problem is not solvable with basic programming techniques as it involves understanding the properties of a function defined by its equations and using those properties to compute a value. It's a problem of mathematical reasoning and not a programming problem.

However, we can start by setting $n=1$ in the second equation to get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. If we substitute $n=f(1)$ in the first equation, we get $f(f(f(f(1)))) = 8f(1) - 7$. But from the first equation, $f(f(f(f(1)))) = f(f(f(2)))$. So we have $f(f(f(2))) = 8f(1) - 7$.

From the second equation, $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. Substituting this into the equation $f(f(f(2))) = 8f(1) - 7$, we get $f(f(2f(1) + 1)) = 8f(1) - 7$. But from the second equation again, $f(2f(1) + 1) = 2f(f(1)) + 1$. So we have $f(2f(f(1)) + 1) = 8f(1) - 7$.

Now we know that $f(1) = 1$ because $f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = 1$, so $f(f(2)) = 8*1 - 7 = 1$. And from the second equation, $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 3$. Then we can substitute $n=2$ into the second equation to get $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 7$. Continuing this way, we can find that $f(8) = 15$, $f(16) = 31$, and so on.

By analyzing the pattern, we can see that $f(2^k) = 2^{k+2} - 3$ for all positive integers $k$. So in particular, $f(100) = f(2^6 + 2^2 + 2^0) = 2^{6+2} - 3 = 64 - 3 = 61$. Therefore, $f(100) = 61$.

 Solving this problem directly is not feasible due to the complexity of the given functional equations. However, by analyzing the problem, we can notice a few things:

1. The function $f$ is defined recursively, and we are asked to find the value of $f(100)$.
2. The first equation, $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, gives us some insight into the behavior of the function $f$. It implies that applying the function three times will result in a linear function of $n$.
3. The second equation, $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, shows that the function is not strictly increasing, as multiplying the argument by two does not necessarily double the function value. This suggests that the function might have some special property or structure.

Given these insights, it is reasonable to conjecture that the function $f$ might be some kind of transformation that doubles its argument and subtracts a constant. Specifically, we can try the function $f(n) = 2n - 1$ and check if it satisfies the given functional equations.

Let's check the first equation:
\[f(f(f(n))) = f(f(2n - 1)) = f(2(2n - 1) - 1) = f(4n - 3) = 2(4n - 3) - 1 = 8n - 7.\]
So, $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, which satisfies the first equation.

Now let's check the second equation:
\[f(2n) = 2(2n - 1) + 1 = 4n - 1.\]
\[2f(n) + 1 = 2(2n - 1) + 1 = 4n - 1.\]
So, $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, which also satisfies the second equation.

Thus, the function $f(n) = 2n - 1$ satisfies both functional equations. Now we can find $f(100)$:
\[f(100) = 2(100) - 1 = 199.\]

So, the value of $f(100)$ is 199. The answer is: $199$.
