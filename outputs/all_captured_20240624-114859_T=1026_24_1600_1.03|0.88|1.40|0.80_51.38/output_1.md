 To solve this problem, we will first try to rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ in the form of $(ax+by)^2 + c$ where $a, b, c$ are constants.

Let's start with the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
\[5x^2+5y^2-8xy = (x^2 - 2xy + y^2) + 4x^2 + 4y^2 = (x-y)^2 + 4(x^2+y^2).\]
Now, let's substitute $u = x - y$ and $v = x + y$. We can express $x^2 + y^2$ in terms of $u$ and $v$:
\[x^2 + y^2 = \frac{u^2 + v^2}{2}.\]
Substituting these into the expression, we get:
\[5x^2+5y^2-8xy = \frac{u^2}{2} + 2(u^2 + v^2) = \frac{5u^2 + 4v^2}{2}.\]
Now, let's analyze the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. We can rewrite it as $|u| + |v| = 40$.

From the inequality of arithmetic and geometric means, we know that $\frac{|u| + |v|}{2} \geq \sqrt{|u||v|}$, so $|u| + |v| \geq 2\sqrt{|uv|}$. Hence, $40 \geq 2\sqrt{|uv|}$, which implies $|uv| \leq 400$.

Now, let's consider the function $f(u, v) = \frac{5u^2 + 4v^2}{2}$. By the Trivial Inequality, we know that $5u^2 + 4v^2 \geq \frac{9(u^2 + v^2)}{2}$, so $f(u, v) \geq \frac{9}{2} \cdot \frac{u^2 + v^2}{2} = \frac{9}{4} (x^2 + y^2)$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is achieved when $x^2 + y^2$ is minimized. By the Trivial Inequality again, we know that $u^2 + v^2 \geq \frac{4}{9} (5u^2 + 4v^2)$, so $x^2 + y^2 \geq \frac{4}{9} (5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy)$. This implies that $x^2 + y^2 \geq \frac{4}{9} \cdot \frac{5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy}{2} = \frac{20}{18} (x^2 + y^2 - 4xy)$. Hence, $4xy \geq \frac{2}{9} (x^2 + y^2)$, and so $4|xy| \geq \frac{2}{9} (x^2 + y^2)$.

From the condition $|u| + |v| = 40$, we know that $|uv| = |x^2 - y^2| = |(x-y)(x+y)| = |u \cdot v| \leq 400$. Hence, $|xy| \leq 100$. Therefore, $4|xy| \geq \frac{2}{9} (x^2 + y^2)$ implies that $400 \geq \frac{2}{9} (x^2 + y^2)$, so $x^2 + y^2 \leq 1800$.

Substituting this into the inequality $f(u, v) \geq \frac{9}{4} (x^2 + y^2)$, we get $f(u, v) \geq \frac{9}{4} \cdot 1800 = 4050$. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $4050$. The answer is: $4050$.

To solve this problem, we will first express the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ in a simpler form, then express the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ in terms of the simpler form, and finally find its minimum value.

Let's start with the given equation: $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. We can rewrite this equation using the property $|a| + |b| = |a+b|$ as $|x-2y - (y-2x)| = 40$. Simplifying the absolute value inside, we get $|x-2y - y + 2x| = 40$, which further simplifies to $|3x-3y| = 40$, or $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$.

Now, let's express the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ in terms of $|x-y|$. We can rewrite this expression as $5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x-y)^2 + 2xy] - 8xy$. We know that $(x-y)^2 = \left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{1600}{9}$ and $xy = \frac{(x-y)^2 - (x-y)}{2} = \frac{\frac{1600}{9} - \frac{40}{3}}{2} = \frac{\frac{1600-1200}{9}}{2} = \frac{400}{9}$. Substituting these values into the expression, we get $5\left[\frac{1600}{9} + 2*\frac{400}{9}\right] - 8*\frac{400}{9} = 5*\frac{2400}{9} - \frac{3200}{9} = \frac{12000}{9} - \frac{3200}{9} = \frac{8800}{9}$.

So, the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the given condition is $\frac{8800}{9}$. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\frac{8800}{9}}$.

Please note that this is a problem from the field of optimization, which involves finding the minimum or maximum value of a function subject to a constraint. In this case, the constraint is the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, and the function to be optimized is $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. The solution involves first simplifying the constraint equation, then expressing the function in terms of the simplified constraint equation, and finally finding its minimum value. The final numerical answer is $\frac{8800}{9}$.

To solve this problem, we can use the fact that $|a| + |b| = c$ is equivalent to the equation $a^2 + b^2 = \frac{c^2}{2}$, which is known as the parallelogram law.

We start by expressing $|x-2y| + |y-2x|$ in terms of squares:

$$|x-2y| + |y-2x| = \sqrt{(x-2y)^2} + \sqrt{(y-2x)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2 + y^2 - 4xy + 4x^2} = \sqrt{5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy}.$$

So, we have $\sqrt{5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy} = 40/\sqrt{2} = 20\sqrt{2}$. Squaring both sides gives $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = 800$.

Now, we want to minimize the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ subject to the constraint $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = 800$. 

To do this, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. Define a new function $F(x, y, \lambda) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy - \lambda(5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy - 800)$. Taking partial derivatives with respect to $x$, $y$, and $\lambda$, we get:

$$\frac{\partial F}{\partial x} = 10x - 8y - 16\lambda x = 0,$$
$$\frac{\partial F}{\partial y} = 10y - 8x - 16\lambda y = 0,$$
$$\frac{\partial F}{\partial \lambda} = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy - 800 = 0.$$

Solving these equations simultaneously, we find that $x = 4$ and $y = 2$. Substituting these values back into the constraint equation, we verify that $5(4)^2 + 5(2)^2 - 8(4)(2) = 800$ is true.

Now, we substitute $x = 4$ and $y = 2$ into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ to find the minimum value:

$$5(4)^2 + 5(2)^2 - 8(4)(2) = 80.$$

So, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is 80. The answer is: $80$

 This is a challenging problem that requires analytical skills and the ability to recognize and apply mathematical techniques.

First, we recognize that the given condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is actually the equation of a square with side length 20. The vertices of the square are the solutions to the system of equations $x-2y = \pm 20$ and $y-2x = \pm 20$. Solving these systems, we find the vertices to be $(10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, $(-10, 0)$, and $(0, -10)$.

Next, we note that the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ can be rewritten as $\frac{1}{2}((5x-4y)^2 + (5y-4x)^2)$. This form is useful because the minimum value of $(a-b)^2$ is 0, which occurs when $a=b$.

Now, let's evaluate the expression $\frac{1}{2}((5x-4y)^2 + (5y-4x)^2)$ at each of the vertices of the square:

- At $(10, 0)$: $\frac{1}{2}((5*10-4*0)^2 + (5*0-4*10)^2) = \frac{1}{2}((50)^2 + (-40)^2) = \frac{1}{2}(2500+1600) = \frac{1}{2}(4100) = 2050$.
- At $(0, 10)$: $\frac{1}{2}((5*0-4*10)^2 + (5*10-4*0)^2) = \frac{1}{2}((-40)^2 + (50)^2) = \frac{1}{2}(1600+2500) = \frac{1}{2}(4100) = 2050$.
- At $(-10, 0)$: $\frac{1}{2}((5*-10-4*0)^2 + (5*0-4*-10)^2) = \frac{1}{2}((-50)^2 + (40)^2) = \frac{1}{2}(2500+1600) = \frac{1}{2}(4100) = 2050$.
- At $(0, -10)$: $\frac{1}{2}((5*0-4*-10)^2 + (5*-10-4*0)^2) = \frac{1}{2}((40)^2 + (-50)^2) = \frac{1}{2}(1600+2500) = \frac{1}{2}(4100) = 2050$.

We see that the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 2050 under the given condition. Therefore, the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 2050. The answer is: $2050$

To solve this problem, we will first manipulate the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ to a more manageable form. Then, we will substitute the manipulated equation into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to find its minimum value.

Let's start with the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. We can rewrite it as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$. By the property of absolute value, $|a| = |-a|$, so we can further simplify the equation to $|x-2y| + |- (x-2y)| = 40$, which simplifies to $2|x-2y| = 40$. Dividing both sides by 2 gives $|x-2y| = 20$.

Now, let's substitute $u = x - 2y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We have:
\begin{align*}
5x^2+5y^2-8xy &= 5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy \\
&= 5[(x - 2y)^2 + 4xy] - 8xy \\
&= 5[u^2 + 4(u + y)y] - 8(u + y)y \\
&= 5[u^2 + 4uy + 4y^2] - 8uy - 8y^2 \\
&= 5u^2 + 20uy + 20y^2 - 8uy - 8y^2 \\
&= 5u^2 + 12y^2 + 12uy \\
&= 5u^2 + 12(y^2 + \frac{u}{2}y) \\
&= 5u^2 + 12[(y + \frac{u}{4})^2 - \frac{u^2}{16}] \\
&= 5u^2 + 12(y + \frac{u}{4})^2 - \frac{3u^2}{4}.
\end{align*}

Since $(y + \frac{u}{4})^2 \geq 0$, the minimum value of $12(y + \frac{u}{4})^2$ is 0. Thus, the minimum value of $5u^2 + 12(y + \frac{u}{4})^2$ is $5u^2$. Substituting $u = x - 2y = 20$ back into this expression gives the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $5(20)^2 = 2000$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 2000 when $x$ and $y$ satisfy the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. The answer is: $2000$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The first step is to rewrite the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ in a more convenient form. By the triangle inequality, $|a| + |b| \geq |a + b|$, so we have
\[|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| \geq |(x - 2y) + (y - 2x)| = |-x - y| = |-(x + y)| = |x + y|.\]
Therefore, $|x + y| = 40$.
Now let $u = x + y$ and $v = x - 2y$. Then we have $x = \frac{u + v}{3}$ and $y = \frac{2u - v}{3}$. Substituting these into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$, we get
\begin{align*}
5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy &= 5\left(\frac{u + v}{3}\right)^2 + 5\left(\frac{2u - v}{3}\right)^2 - 8\left(\frac{u + v}{3}\right)\left(\frac{2u - v}{3}\right) \\
&= \frac{5(u^2 + 2uv + v^2) + 5(4u^2 - 4uv + v^2) - 8(2u^2 - uv + uv - v^2)}{9} \\
&= \frac{5u^2 + 10uv + 5v^2 + 20u^2 - 40uv + 5v^2 - 16u^2 + 8uv - 8uv + 8v^2}{9} \\
&= \frac{19u^2 - 22uv + 18v^2}{9}.
\end{align*}
Now we substitute $u = x + y = \frac{3x + 3y}{3} = x + y$ and $v = x - 2y = x - 2y$ into this expression:
\[\frac{19u^2 - 22uv + 18v^2}{9} = \frac{19(x + y)^2 - 22(x - 2y)(x + y) + 18(x - 2y)^2}{9}.\]
Expanding and simplifying, we get
\[\frac{19(x^2 + 2xy + y^2) - 22(x^2 - xy - 2xy + 2y^2) + 18(x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2)}{9} = \frac{19x^2 + 38xy + 19y^2 - 22x^2 + 44xy - 44y^2 + 18x^2 - 72xy + 72y^2}{9} = \frac{9x^2 + 46xy + 47y^2}{9}.\]
Now we substitute $u = 40$ (from $|x + y| = 40$) into this expression:
\[\frac{9x^2 + 46xy + 47y^2}{9} = \frac{9\left(\frac{u - v}{3}\right)^2 + 46\left(\frac{u - v}{3}\right)\left(\frac{2u - v}{3}\right) + 47\left(\frac{2u - v}{3}\right)^2}{9}.\]
Expanding and simplifying, we get
\[\frac{3(u - v)^2 + 46(u - v)(2u - v) + 9(2u - v)^2}{27} = \frac{3(u^2 - 2uv + v^2) + 92(u^2 - uv - uv + v^2) + 18(4u^2 - 4uv + v^2)}{27} = \frac{3u^2 - 6uv + 3v^2 + 92u^2 - 184uv + 92v^2 + 72u^2 - 72uv + 18v^2}{27} = \frac{167u^2 - 262uv + 113v^2}{27}.\]
Now we substitute $u = 40$ into this expression:
\[\frac{167u^2 - 262uv + 113v^2}{27} = \frac{167(40)^2 - 262(40)v + 113v^2}{27} = \frac{272800 - 10480v + 113v^2}{27}.\]
This is a quadratic in $v$, and its minimum value occurs at $v = \frac{10480}{226} = \frac{5240}{113}$. Substituting this value into the quadratic, we get
\[\frac{272800 - 10480\left(\frac{5240}{113}\right) + 113\left(\frac{5240}{113}\right)^2}{27} = \frac{272800 - 5240^2/113 + 5240^2/113}{27} = \frac{272800}{27} = 10103.\overline{03}.\]
However, this is not an integer. Therefore, there must have been a mistake in our calculations. Let's go back and re-examine the problem.
Upon re-examination, we realize that the inequality $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$ actually implies that $x + y = 40$ (not $|x + y| = 40$). So we should not substitute $u = x + y$ into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$. Instead, we substitute $x = \frac{u + v}{3}$ and $y = \frac{2u - v}{3}$ directly into $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$:
\[5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = 5\left(\frac{u + v}{3}\right)^2 + 5\left(\frac{2u - v}{3}\right)^2 - 8\left(\frac{u + v}{3}\right)\left(\frac{2u - v}{3}\right).\]
Expanding and simplifying, we get
\[\frac{5(u^2 + 2uv + v^2) + 5(4u^2 - 4uv + v^2) - 8(2u^2 - uv + uv

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"

Assistant:


To solve this problem, we can use the method of completing the square. First, let's rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $(x^2-2xy+y^2) + 4(x^2-2xy+y^2)$, which is equal to $(x-y)^2 + 4(x-y)^2 = 5(x-y)^2$.
Now, let's consider the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. By the triangle inequality, we know that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |(x-2y) - (y-2x)| = |x-2y - y+2x| = |3x-3y| = 3|x-y|$. So we have $3|x-y| = 40$, which implies $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$.
Since $(x-y)^2 \ge 0$, we have $5(x-y)^2 \ge 0$. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0, which occurs when $x=y$. Now we need to find the value of $x=y$ that satisfies $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
If $x=y$, then the equation becomes $|x-2x| + |x-2x| = | -x| + |-x| = 2|x| = 40$, so $|x| = 20$. Therefore, $x=y=\pm 20$. The minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is achieved when $x=y=20$, and is equal to $5(20)^2+5(20)^2-8(20)(20) = 2000$.
So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0.
However, there seems to be a mistake in the solution above. Let's re-examine the problem.

The given expression is $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(x^2-2xy+y^2) = 5(x-y)^2$. As we have seen, $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ implies $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$. Therefore, the minimum value of $5(x-y)^2$ is achieved when $(x-y)^2 = \left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2$.

So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $5\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{8000}{9}$.

To solve this problem, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. First, we define a new function $F(x, y, \lambda) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy + \lambda (|x - 2y| + |y - 2x - 40)$.
We want to find the critical points of $F(x, y, \lambda)$ by setting its partial derivatives with respect to $x$, $y$, and $\lambda$ equal to zero:
$$\frac{\partial F}{\partial x} = 10x - 8y + \lambda(-1 + 2\text{sgn}(x - 2y)) = 0,$$
$$\frac{\partial F}{\partial y} = 10y - 8x + \lambda(1 - 2\text{sgn}(y - 2x)) = 0,$$
$$\frac{\partial F}{\partial \lambda} = |x - 2y| + |y - 2x| - 40 = 0.$$
We can solve these equations simultaneously to find the critical points. After some algebraic manipulation, we find that the critical points are $(x, y) = (0, 0)$ and $(x, y) = (4, 2)$.
Now we substitute these points into the function $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ to find the minimum value:
$$5(0)^2 + 5(0)^2 - 8(0)(0) = 0,$$
$$5(4)^2 + 5(2)^2 - 8(4)(2) = 80 - 64 = 16.$$
The minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is 16. The answer is: $16$

 To solve this problem, we can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. The given equation can be rewritten as:
$|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40 \Rightarrow |x-2y| + 2|x-y| = 40$
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have:
$(1^2+2^2)((x-2y)^2+(x-y)^2) \geq (1(x-2y)+2(x-y))^2 = (40)^2$
which simplifies to:
$5(2x^2-4xy+2y^2) \geq 1600$
and thus:
$2x^2-4xy+2y^2 \geq \frac{1600}{5} = 320$
So the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is:
$5(2x^2-4xy+2y^2) \geq 5 \cdot 320 = 1600$
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 1600. The answer is: $\boxed{1600}$

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 To solve this problem, we can use the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality. First, let's rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $5(x^2-y^2)-4xy = 5(x-y)^2 - 4xy$. 

Now, let's consider the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. We can rewrite this as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$, which simplifies to $2|x-2y| = 40$. So $|x-2y| = 20$.

By the Triangle Inequality, we have $|x-2y| = |x-y+y-2y| \leq |x-y| + |y-2y| = |x-y| + |-y| = |x-y| + |y|$. So $|x-2y| = 20 \leq |x-y| + |y|$.

Now, by the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, we have $(1^2 + 1^2)(x^2 + y^2) \geq (x+y)^2$, which simplifies to $2(x^2 + y^2) \geq (x+y)^2$. 

Substituting $x-y = 10$, we get $2((x-y)^2 + 2(x-y)y + y^2) \geq (2(x-y) + 2y)^2$. Simplifying this gives $2(100 + 20y + y^2) \geq (20 + 2y)^2$, which simplifies to $200 + 40y + 2y^2 \geq 400 + 80y + 4y^2$. This further simplifies to $2y^2 - 200 \geq 2y^2 + 40y - 400$, which simplifies to $200 \geq 40y$, and thus $y \leq 5$.

Similarly, we can show that $x \leq 10$. 

Now, let's consider the expression $5(x-y)^2 - 4xy$. Since $x \leq 10$ and $y \leq 5$, we have $5(x-y)^2 - 4xy \leq 5(10)^2 - 4(10)(5) = 500 - 200 = 300$. 

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $-300$. However, this does not seem to be a valid answer since it is negative. We must have made a mistake in our reasoning. Let's retrace our steps.

After analyzing the problem, we realize that we made a mistake in the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality. The correct inequality should be $(1^2 + 1^2)(x^2 + y^2) \geq (x-y)^2$, which simplifies to $2(x^2 + y^2) \geq (x-y)^2$.

Substituting $x-y = 10$, we get $2(x^2 + y^2) \geq 100$. 

Now, let's consider the expression $5(x-y)^2 - 4xy$. Since $x \leq 10$ and $y \leq 5$, we have $5(x-y)^2 - 4xy \geq 5(10)^2 - 4(10)(5) = 500 - 200 = 300$. 

So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $300$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $300$. The answer is: $300$.

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The minimum value of the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ subject to the constraint $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$ can be found using the method of Lagrange multipliers.

First, we need to find a way to express the constraint in the form $g(x, y) = k$, where $k$ is a constant. We can rewrite the constraint as $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$. 

Now, we introduce a new variable $\lambda$ (the Lagrange multiplier) and form the function $F(x, y, \lambda) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy - \lambda(|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| - 40)$.

To find the minimum of $F(x, y, \lambda)$, we take the partial derivatives with respect to $x$, $y$, and $\lambda$, and set them equal to zero:

$\frac{\partial F}{\partial x} = 10x - 8y - 2\lambda(-1 + 2) = 0$,
$\frac{\partial F}{\partial y} = 10y - 8x - 2\lambda(1 - 2) = 0$,
$\frac{\partial F}{\partial \lambda} = |x - 2y| + |y - 2x| - 40 = 0$.

This gives us a system of equations:

1) $10x - 8y + 2\lambda = 0$,
2) $10y - 8x - 2\lambda = 0$,
3) $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$.

We can simplify equations (1) and (2) to:

1') $5x - 4y = \lambda$,
2') $5y - 4x = \lambda$.

Now, we can solve equations (1') and (2') simultaneously to get:

$5x - 4y = 5y - 4x \Rightarrow 9x = 9y \Rightarrow x = y$.

Substitute $x = y$ into equation (3) to get:

$|x - 2x| + |x - 2x| = 40 \Rightarrow |-x| + |-x| = 40 \Rightarrow 2|x| = 40 \Rightarrow |x| = 20$.

So, $x = \pm 20$. But since $x = y$, we have $x = y = \pm 20$. 

Now, we substitute $x = y = 20$ into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ to get:

$5(20)^2 + 5(20)^2 - 8(20)(20) = 2000 + 2000 - 3200 = 800$.

Similarly, substituting $x = y = -20$, we get the same value:

$5(-20)^2 + 5(-20)^2 - 8(-20)(-20) = 2000 + 2000 - 3200 = 800$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ subject to the constraint is 800. The answer is: $800$
