Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The condition of the problem is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. For the product of two numbers to be zero, either one of the numbers has to be zero. This gives us two cases:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This forms a square with side length 20, so the area is $20^2 = 400$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which forms a square with side length 16, so the area is $16^2 = 256$.

Since the two cases are mutually exclusive, we can add the areas of the two squares to get the total area of the polygon. $400 + 256 = 656$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 656.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import *

# define the variables
x, y = symbols('x y')

# Case 1: |x + y| = 10 and |x - y| = 10
case1_area = 20**2

# Case 2: |x| = 8 and |y| = 8
case2_area = 16**2

# Total area
total_area = case1_area + case2_area
print(total_area)
```

CODE RESULTS 656

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
656
```
The area of the convex polygon is $656$. The answer is: $\boxed{656}$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, which implies that either of the expressions must be zero. This breaks down into four cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
4. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

Case 1 gives us $x = y = \pm 8$.
Case 2 gives us $x = y = \pm 10$.
Case 3 is not possible because it would imply $x = y = 0$.
Case 4 is not possible because it would imply $x = y = 0$.

So the points that satisfy the equation are $(\pm 8, \pm 8)$ and $(\pm 10, \pm 10)$.
These points form a square with side length 16 (since the distance between $(\pm 8, \pm 8)$ and $(\pm 10, \pm 10)$ is $2 * 2 = 4$ in each direction, and there are two such distances).
The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256.
The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, notice that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, we can break down the problem into two cases:

   a) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
   b) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

2. In each case, we set each squared expression equal to zero and solve for $x$ and $y$. 

   a) For the first case, we have:
      - $\vert x + y \vert = 10 \Rightarrow x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$
      - $\vert x - y \vert = 10 \Rightarrow x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$
   b) For the second case, we have:
      - $\vert x \vert = 8 \Rightarrow x = 8$ or $x = -8$
      - $\vert y \vert = 8 \Rightarrow y = 8$ or $y = -8$

3. Solving these equations gives us the coordinates of the vertices of the polygon.

4. Finally, we can use a polygon area formula (such as the shoelace formula) to calculate the area of the polygon.

Now, let's actually do the calculations:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Abs, solve

def find_polygon_vertices():
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # Case 1:
    eq1 = Abs(x + y) - 10
    eq2 = Abs(x - y) - 10
    eq3 = Abs(x) - 8
    eq4 = Abs(y) - 8

    # Solve the equations
    solutions1 = solve([eq1, eq2], (x, y))
    solutions2 = solve([eq3, eq4], (x, y))

    # Combine the solutions
    vertices = solutions1 + solutions2
    vertices = [(vertex[0], vertex[1]) for vertex in vertices if -8 <= vertex[0] <= 8 and -8 <= vertex[1] <= 8]

    return vertices

vertices = find_polygon_vertices()
print(vertices)
```

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
[(-8, -8), (-8, 8), (8, -8), (8, 8)]
```
So the vertices of the polygon are $(-8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, and $(8, 8)$. This forms a square with side length $16$. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $f(x,y) = (\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ defines a set of points in the coordinate plane. The set of points that satisfy $f(x,y) = 0$ are precisely the points that make either the first factor or the second factor equal to zero. 

The first factor is the product of two terms, each of which is a square of an absolute value minus a constant. Each of these terms is nonnegative, so their product is zero if and only if both terms are zero. This happens if and only if $|x+y| = 10$ and $|x-y| = 10$, or $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. 

The solutions to $|x+y| = 10$ and $|x-y| = 10$ are the points that form a square with side length 10. The solutions to $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$ are the points that form a square with side length 16.

The intersection of these two squares is a smaller square with side length 8. Therefore, the set of points that satisfy $f(x,y) = 0$ is the square with side length 8. The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$. 

So the area of the convex polygon formed by the set of points that satisfy the equation is 64.

```python

    # The side length of the square
    side_length = 8

    # Calculate the area of the square
    area = side_length**2

    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

The area of the convex polygon is $64$.
The answer is: $64$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Find the number of 10-tuples $(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{10})$ of real numbers such that
\[(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2 = \frac{1}{11}.\]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,
\begin{align*}
&[(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + \dots + 1^2 + 1^2)][(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2] \\
&\ge [(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + (x_2 - x_3) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10}]^2 = 1.
\end{align*}From the given condition, we have equality, so by the equality condition for Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[\frac{1 - x_1}{1} = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{1} = \frac{x_2 - x_3}{1} = \dots = \frac{x_9 - x_{10}}{1} = \frac{x_{10}}{1}.\]Let
\[d = 1 - x_1 = x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_3 = \dots = x_9 - x_{10} = x_{10}.\]Then
\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so
\[(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_{10}) = \left( \frac{10}{11}, \frac{9}{11}, \frac{8}{11}, \dots, \frac{1}{11} \right).\]In particular, there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The given expression equals zero if and only if both of the following expressions equal zero:
\[(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0,\] \[( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0,\] \[(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0,\] \[( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0.\]These equations are equivalent to:
\[\vert x + y \vert = 10,\] \[\vert x - y \vert = 10,\] \[\vert x \vert = 8,\] \[\vert y \vert = 8.\]The solutions to these equations are:
\[x + y = \pm 10,\] \[x - y = \pm 10,\] \[x = \pm 8,\] \[y = \pm 8.\]This gives us a total of 16 points:
\[(8,0), (-8,0), (0,8), (0,-8), (8,8), (8,-8), (-8,8), (-8,-8).\]Plotting these points, we see that they form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $\boxed{256}$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_ 2= (-16,2).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that
\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as
\[\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1.\]Find $h + k + a + b.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so it is equal to zero if either of the expressions is zero. This gives us two sets of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.

For the first set of equations, we have:

1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10 \Rightarrow x + y = \pm 10$ or $x + y = 0$.
2. $\vert x \vert = 8 \Rightarrow x = \pm 8$ or $x = 0$.
3. $\vert y \vert = 8 \Rightarrow y = \pm 8$ or $y = 0$.

Combining these equations, we get the following solutions: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(2, 8)$, $(-2, 8)$, $(2, -8)$, and $(-2, -8)$.

For the second set of equations, we have:

1. $\vert x - y \vert = 10 \Rightarrow x - y = \pm 10$ or $y - x = \pm 10$.

Combining this with the solutions from the first set of equations, we find that all the points satisfy the second set of equations as well.

So, the solutions to the given equation are the points $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(2, 8)$, $(-2, 8)$, $(2, -8)$, and $(-2, -8)$. These points form a square with side length $16$. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$
