**Problem:** 

"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. So we can set $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$. Rearranging, we get $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$. Let's call this equation (1).

The distance between $A$ and $B$ is given as 6. The distance between two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ in the plane is given by $\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$. Here, $y_1 = y_2 = 4$, so the distance simplifies to $|x_2 - x_1|$. From the problem, we know $|x_2 - x_1| = 6$.

The quadratic equation (1) has two solutions $x_1$ and $x_2$, which are the $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$. From the quadratic formula, we know that $x_{1,2} = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k} = 1 \pm \sqrt{1 - \frac{l - 4}{k}}$. Since $|x_2 - x_1| = 6$, we have $2\sqrt{1 - \frac{l - 4}{k} } = 6$, which simplifies to $\sqrt{1 - \frac{l - 4}{k} } = 3$. Squaring both sides gives $1 - \frac{l - 4}{k} = 9$, or $\frac{l - 4}{k} = -8$. Solving for $l$, we get $l = 4 - 8k$.

Now, we want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. For points on the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$, this is $\sqrt{x^2 + (kx^2 - 2kx + l)^2}$. We need to find the sum of the squares of the distances for $x = x_1$ and $x = x_2$.

Let's denote $d_1 = \sqrt{x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2}$ and $d_2 = \sqrt{x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2}$. Then the sum of the squares of the distances is $d_1^2 + d_2^2$.

Using the identity $(a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2$, we can expand $(kx^2 - 2kx + l)^2$ and simplify to get
\[(kx^2 - 2kx + l)^2 = k^2x^4 - 4k^2x^3 + (4k^2 + 4l)x^2 - 4klx + l^2.\]
Substituting $l = 4 - 8k$ and simplifying, we get
\[(kx^2 - 2kx + l)^2 = k^2x^4 - 4k^2x^3 + (4k^2 + 4(4 - 8k))x^2 - 4k(4 - 8k)x + (4 - 8k)^2 = k^2x^4 - 4k^2x^3 + (16k^2 - 32k^2 + 16)x^2 - (16k - 64k^2)x + 64k^2 - 128k + 16.\]

Substituting $x = x_1$ and $x = x_2$ into the above expression and adding the results, we get a complicated expression involving $k$ and $l$. But we can simplify it by noticing that $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = (2)^2 - 2(-2k) = 4 + 4k$. Also, $x_1x_2 = \frac{2k \cdot (-2k) - (l - 4)}{2k} = -k - (4 - 8k) = -4k + 4$. Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances is
\[d_1^2 + d_2^2 = \left(k(x_1^2) - 2k(x_1) + l\right)^2 + \left(k(x_2^2) - 2k(x_2) + l\right)^2 = \left(k(4 + 4k) - 4k + 4 - 8k + 4\right)^2 + \left(k(4 + 4k) + 4k - 4 - 8k + 4\right)^2 = (4k)^2 + (-4k)^2 = 32k^2.\]

Since we know that $l = 4 - 8k$, we can substitute this into the expression for the sum of the squares of the distances to get
\[d_1^2 + d_2^2 = 32k^2.\]
This is our final answer. So the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $32k^2$.
The answer is: $32k^2$

**Problem:** 

"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


First, we need to find the $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$. Since the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$, we can set $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$. This simplifies to $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$. 

We're given that the points $A$ and $B$ are distance 6 apart, so if $x_1$ and $x_2$ are the roots of this equation, we have $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 36$, which implies $(x_2 - x_1) = 6$ or $(x_2 - x_1) = -6$. 

We can use the fact that for a quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, the sum of the roots is $-b/a$ and the product of the roots is $c/a$. In this case, the sum of the roots is $2k/k = 2$ and the product of the roots is $(l - 4)/k$. 

Now, we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(x_2 - x_1) = 6$. By the difference of roots formula, we have $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = (x_2 + x_1)^2 - 4x_1x_2 = 36$. We know that $x_2 + x_1 = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = (l - 4)/k$, so substituting these values in gives $(2)^2 - 4(l - 4)/k = 36$, or $4 - 4(l - 4)/k = 36$. Solving for $(l - 4)/k$ gives $(l - 4)/k = -8$, or $l = 4 - 8k$.

Case 2: $(x_2 - x_1) = -6$. Similar to the first case, we have $(x_2 + x_1)^2 - 4x_1x_2 = (-6)^2 = 36$. Again substituting the known values in gives $(2)^2 - 4(l - 4)/k = 36$, or $4 - 4(l - 4)/k = 36$. Solving for $(l - 4)/k$ gives $(l - 4)/k = 8$, or $l = 4 + 8k$.

Now, we want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. For point $A$, the $y$-coordinate is $4$, so the distance is $\sqrt{x_1^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{(x_1)^2 + 16}$. Similarly, for point $B$, the distance is $\sqrt{(x_2)^2 + 16}$. 

So the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $(\sqrt{(x_1)^2 + 16})^2 + (\sqrt{(x_2)^2 + 16})^2 = (x_1)^2 + 16 + (x_2)^2 + 16 = (x_1)^2 + (x_2)^2 + 32$.

We know that $(x_1 + x_2)^2 - 4x_1x_2 = (2)^2 - 4(l - 4)/k = 36$. Expanding $(x_1 + x_2)^2 = (x_1)^2 + 2x_1x_2 + (x_2)^2$, we get $(x_1)^2 + 2x_1x_2 + (x_2)^2 - 4x_1x_2 = 36$, or $(x_1)^2 - 2x_1x_2 + (x_2)^2 = 36$. This is the square of the difference of $x_1$ and $x_2$, so we have $(x_1 - x_2)^2 = 36$.

Since the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, we have $(x_1 - x_2)^2 = 6^2 = 36$, confirming our previous result.

Now we substitute $(x_1)^2 + (x_2)^2 = 36 + 4x_1x_2 = 36 + 4(l - 4)/k$. From Case 1, we have $(l - 4)/k = -8$, so substituting this in gives $(x_1)^2 + (x_2)^2 = 36 + 4(-8) = 36 - 32 = 4$.

Similarly, from Case 2, we have $(l - 4)/k = 8$, so substituting this in gives $(x_1)^2 + (x_2)^2 = 36 + 4(8) = 36 + 32 = 68$.

But since the sum of the squares of the distances must be positive, only Case 1 is valid. Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is 4. The answer is: $4$

**Problem:** 

"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:



The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. This means that the solutions of the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$ are the x-coordinates of $A$ and $B$. 

Let's call these solutions $x_1$ and $x_2$. Given that the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, we know that $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 6^2 = 36$.

By Vieta's formulas, we know that $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$. 

By the difference of squares formula, we have $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = (x_2 + x_1)^2 - 4x_1x_2$. Substituting the values we know, we get $36 = 4 - 4\frac{l - 4}{k}$. 

Simplifying, we get $36 = 4 - \frac{4l - 16}{k}$, which simplifies to $\frac{4l - 16}{k} = -32$.

Multiplying both sides by $k$, we get $4l - 16 = -32k$. 

Rearranging, we get $4l = -32k + 16$, and then $l = -8k + 4$.

Now we want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. So for points $A$ and $B$, this is $\sqrt{x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2}$ and $\sqrt{x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2}$ respectively.

But since $A$ and $B$ are on the line $y = 4$, we know that $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$ for both $x = x_1$ and $x = x_2$. So we can simplify the distances to $\sqrt{x^2 + (4 - l)^2}$.

We want to find $x_1^2 + (4 - l)^2 + x_2^2 + (4 - l)^2$. 

By Vieta's formulas, we know that $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 2^2 - 2\frac{l - 4}{k} = 4 - 2\frac{l - 4}{k}$.

Substituting $l = -8k + 4$, we get $4 - 2\frac{-8k + 4 - 4}{k} = 4 - 2\frac{-8k}{k} = 4 + 16 = 20$.

Then we add $(4 - l)^2 = (4 - (-8k + 4))^2 = (8k)^2 = 64k^2$ to get the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin: $20 + 64k^2$.

However, we know that $l = -8k + 4$, and $4 - l = 4 - (-8k + 4) = 8k$. So the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is also $20 + (8k)^2 = 20 + 64k^2$.

Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is always $20 + 64k^2$. However, we want to find the value of this expression for the given parabola and line.

Substituting $k = 1$, we get $20 + 64(1)^2 = 20 + 64 = 84$.

Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is 84. The answer is: $84$.

**Problem:** 

"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


First, we set $y = 4$ in the equation of the parabola and solve for $x$:
\[4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l.\]
Rearranging, we have
\[kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0.\]
Let $x_1$ and $x_2$ be the x-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$, respectively. Since the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, we have
\[|x_2 - x_1| = 6.\]
By the quadratic formula, the roots of the equation are
\[x = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k} = 1 \pm \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k} = 1 \pm \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}}{2k}.\]
Thus,
\[x_2 - x_1 = \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}}{k} = 6.\]
Squaring both sides, we get
\[36 = \frac{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}{k^2}.\]
Simplifying, we have
\[36k^2 = 4k^2 - 4kl + 16k.\]
Rearranging, we get
\[32k^2 = 4kl - 16k.\]
Dividing both sides by 4, we have
\[8k^2 = k^2l - 4k.\]
Rearranging, we get
\[7k^2 = k^2l - 4k.\]
Dividing both sides by $k$, we have
\[7k = kl - 4.\]
Rearranging, we get
\[kl - 7k = 4.\]
Factor out $k$, we have
\[k(l - 7) = 4.\]
Since $k$ and $l$ are both positive, we must have $l - 7 > 0$, so $l > 7$. Substituting this into the equation, we get
\[k = \frac{4}{l - 7}.\]
Now, we want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. For point $A$ with coordinates $(x_1, 4)$, the distance is $\sqrt{x_1^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{(x_1)^2 + 16}$. For point $B$ with coordinates $(x_2, 4)$, the distance is $\sqrt{x_2^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{(x_2)^2 + 16}$.

We know that $x_2 - x_1 = 6$, so $(x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 + (x_1)^2 = 36$. Adding 32 to both sides, we get $(x_2)^2 + 16 - 2x_1x_2 + (x_1)^2 + 16 = 68$. Simplifying, we have
\[(\sqrt{(x_2)^2 + 16})^2 + (\sqrt{(x_1)^2 + 16})^2 = 68.\]
Thus, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is 68.
The answer is $\boxed{68}$.

**Problem:** 

"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$ means that the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$ has two roots, which we'll call $x_1$ and $x_2$. By Vieta's formulas, we know that $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$. We also know that $|x_1 - x_2| = 6/k$. By the difference of squares, $(x_1 - x_2)^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 4x_1x_2 = 4 - 4\frac{l - 4}{k} = \frac{16}{k} - \frac{4l - 16}{k} = \frac{16 - 4l + 16}{k} = \frac{32 - 4l}{k}$.

But $(x_1 - x_2)^2 = (\frac{6}{k})^2 = \frac{36}{k^2}$, so we have $\frac{32 - 4l}{k} = \frac{36}{k^2}$. Cross-multiplying gives $32 - 4l = \frac{36}{k}$. Multiplying both sides by $k$ gives $32k - 4lk = 36$. Rearranging gives $4lk = 32k - 36$, and further rearranging gives $lk = 8k - 9$.

The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $x_1^2 + x_2^2$. By the identity $(x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = x_1^2 + x_2^2$, we have $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 4 - 2\frac{l - 4}{k} = \frac{8}{k} - \frac{2l - 8}{k} = \frac{8 - 2l + 8}{k} = \frac{16 - 2l}{k}$.

Substitute $lk = 8k - 9$ into the equation, we get $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = \frac{16 - 2(8k - 9)/k}{k} = \frac{16 - 16 + 18/k}{k} = \frac{18}{k^2}$. But $k^2 > 0$, so $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = \frac{18}{k^2} > 0$. Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $18$. The answer is: $\boxed{18}$

**Problem:** 

"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


The points of intersection of the parabola and the line $y=4$ satisfy the equation
\[4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l.\]
Rearranging, we have the quadratic equation
\[kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0.\]
Since the line $y=4$ intersects the parabola at two points $A$ and $B$, the quadratic equation has two distinct roots, which we'll call $x_1$ and $x_2$. The distance between $A$ and $B$ is given by $|x_2 - x_1| = 6/1 = 6$.

By Vieta's formulas, $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$.

The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. The square of the distance is $x^2 + y^2$.

For point $A$, which corresponds to $x_1$, its square distance to the origin is $x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2$.

For point $B$, which corresponds to $x_2$, its square distance to the origin is $x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2$.

We want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin, which is
\[(x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2) + (x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2).\]

We know that $x_1 + x_2 = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$. We can express $x_1^2 + x_2^2$ as $(x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 2^2 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = 4 - \frac{2(l - 4)}{k}$.

Also, $(kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2$ can be expanded as $2k^2(x_1^2 + x_2^2) - 8k(x_1 + x_2)(kx_1x_2) + 4l^2 - 8kl + 8k^2x_1x_2$.

Substituting the values of $x_1 + x_2$ and $x_1x_2$, we get
\[2k^2\left(4 - \frac{2(l - 4)}{k}\right) - 8k(2)\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) + 4l^2 - 8kl + 8k^2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right).\]

Simplifying, we get
\[8k^2 - 4k(l - 4) + 4l^2 - 8kl + 8k(l - 4) = 4l^2 + 8k^2 - 8kl.\]

Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $4l^2 + 8k^2 - 8kl$.

However, we know that the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, so by the distance formula, we have
\[6^2 = (x_2 - x_1)^2 + \left(k(x_2^2 - x_1^2)\right)^2.\]

This simplifies to $36 = k^2(x_2^2 + x_1^2) = k^2\left(4 - \frac{2(l - 4)}{k}\right) = 4k^2 - 2k(l - 4)$.

Solving for $l$, we get $l = 4 + \frac{36}{2k} - 2k = 4 + 18/k - 2k$.

Substituting this into the expression for the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin, we get
\[4\left(4 + \frac{18}{k} - 2k\right)^2 + 8k^2 - 8k\left(4 + \frac{18}{k} - 2k\right).\]

Simplifying, we get
\[16\left(1 + \frac{9}{k^2} - \frac{4k}{k} + 4k^2\right) + 8k^2 - 32k - 64k/k + 16k^2.\]

Simplifying further, we get
\[16 + \frac{144}{k} - 64 + 128k - 64k^2 + 8k^2 - 32k + 16k^2 = 16 + \frac{144}{k} - 64 + 144k - 64k^2.\]

Thus, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $16 + \frac{144}{k} - 64 + 144k - 64k^2 = 80 + 144k - 64k^2 + \frac{144}{k}$.

Since the value of $k$ is given in the problem, we can substitute it into the expression to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin.

After substituting $k = 1$, we get
\[80 + 144(1) - 64(1)^2 + \frac{144}{1} = 80 + 144 - 64 + 144 = 264.\]

Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is 264. The answer is: $264$

**Problem:** 

"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:



First, we set $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$. This gives us the quadratic equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$. 

Let the roots of this equation be $x_1$ and $x_2$, which represent the x-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$. By Vieta's formulas, we have $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$.

We are given that $|x_1 - x_2| = 6/k$. By the difference of squares, we have $(x_1 - x_2)^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 4x_1x_2 = \left(\frac{6}{k}\right)^2$. Substituting $x_1 + x_2 = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$, we get $4 - 4\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = \frac{36}{k^2}$. Simplifying gives $4 - \frac{4l - 16}{k} = \frac{36}{k^2}$, or $4k - \frac{4l - 16}{k} = \frac{36}{k^2}$. Multiplying through by $k^2$ gives $4k^3 - (4l - 16)k = 36$.

The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. Since $y = 4$, the distance from a point on the parabola to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + 16}$. The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is thus $(x_1^2 + 16) + (x_2^2 + 16) = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32$.

We know that $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 2^2 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = 4 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = 4 - \frac{2l - 8}{k}$.

Substituting $4 - \frac{2l - 8}{k} = x_1^2 + x_2^2$, we get the sum of the squares of the distances as $4 - \frac{2l - 8}{k} + 32 = 36 - \frac{2l - 8}{k}$.

Substituting $4k - \frac{4l - 16}{k} = 36$, we get $4k - \frac{4l - 16}{k} + \frac{2l - 8}{k} = 36$, or $4k + \frac{8}{k} = 36$.

Multiplying through by $k$ gives $4k^2 + 8 = 36k$, or $4k^2 - 36k + 8 = 0$.

This quadratic equation does not factor nicely, so we can use the quadratic formula to find $k$. We have $k = \frac{36 \pm \sqrt{36^2 - 4 \cdot 4 \cdot 8}}{2 \cdot 4} = \frac{36 \pm \sqrt{1296 - 128}}{8} = \frac{36 \pm \sqrt{1168}}{8} = \frac{36 \pm 4\sqrt{29}}{8} = \frac{9 \pm \sqrt{29}}{2}$.

We take the positive solution $k = \frac{9 + \sqrt{29}}{2}$, as negative values of $k$ do not make sense in this context.

Substituting $k = \frac{9 + \sqrt{29}}{2}$ into $4k + \frac{8}{k} = 36$, we get $4\left(\frac{9 + \sqrt{29}}{2}\right) + \frac{8}{\frac{9 + \sqrt{29}}{2}} = 36$. Simplifying gives $18 + 2\sqrt{29} + \frac{16}{9 + \sqrt{29}} = 36$. Multiplying through by $9 + \sqrt{29}$ gives $18(9 + \sqrt{29}) + 2\sqrt{29}(9 + \sqrt{29}) + 16 = 36(9 + \sqrt{29})$. Simplifying gives $162 + 18\sqrt{29} + 18\sqrt{29} + 2\cdot 29 + 16 = 324 + 36\sqrt{29}$, or $208 + 36\sqrt{29} = 324 + 36\sqrt{29}$. This equation is satisfied.

Substituting $k = \frac{9 + \sqrt{29}}{2}$ into $\frac{2l - 8}{k} = -4$, we get $\frac{2l - 8}{\frac{9 + \sqrt{29}}{2}} = -4$. Multiplying through by $\frac{9 + \sqrt{29}}{2}$ gives $2l - 8 = -4\left(\frac{9 + \sqrt{29}}{2}\right)$. Simplifying gives $2l - 8 = -18 - 2\sqrt{29}$, or $2l = -10 - 2\sqrt{29}$.

Dividing by 2 gives $l = -5 - \sqrt{29}$.

Substituting $k = \frac{9 + \sqrt{29}}{2}$ and $l = -5 - \sqrt{29}$ into $4k^2 - 36k + 8 = 0$, we get $4\left(\frac{9 + \sqrt{29}}{2}\right)^2 - 36\left(\frac{9 + \sqrt{29}}{2}\right) + 8 = 0$. Simplifying gives $4\left(\frac{81 + 18\sqrt{29} + 29}{4}\right) - 36\left(\frac{9 + \sqrt{29}}{2}\right) + 8 = 0$, or $81 + 18\sqrt{29} + 29 - 162 - 36\sqrt{29} + 8 = 0$. This equation is also satisfied.

Substituting $k = \frac{9 + \sqrt{29}}{2}$ and $l = -5 - \sqrt{29}$ into

**Problem:** 

"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:



First, we know that the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. So we set $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$ and we get the quadratic equation $kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0$. This equation has two roots, which are the x-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$.

We're given that the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6. By the quadratic formula, the distance between the roots of a quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ is given by $\frac{\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{a}$. So in our case, we have $\frac{\sqrt{(-2k)^2 - 4*k*(l - 4)}}{k} = 6$, which simplifies to $\sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(l - 4)} = 6k$. Squaring both sides gives $4k^2 - 4k(l - 4) = 36k^2$, or $32k^2 = 4k(l - 4)$, or $8k = l - 4$, so $l = 8k + 4$.

Now we want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. For point $A$ (or $B$), its coordinates are $(x, kx^2 - 2kx + l)$, so the square of the distance to the origin is $x^2 + (kx^2 - 2kx + l)^2$.

We know that the x-coordinates of $A$ and $B$ are the roots of the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0$, so by Vieta's formulas, their sum is $\frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and their product is $\frac{l - 4}{k} = \frac{8k + 4 - 4}{k} = 8$.

Let $d_A^2$ and $d_B^2$ be the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin respectively. Then we have
\[d_A^2 + d_B^2 = (x_A^2 + (kx_A^2 - 2kx_A + l)^2) + (x_B^2 + (kx_B^2 - 2kx_B + l)^2).\]
By Vieta's formulas, $x_A^2 + x_B^2 = (\text{sum of roots})^2 - 2 \cdot \text{product of roots} = 2^2 - 2 \cdot 8 = 4 - 16 = -12$.

Also, $(kx_A^2 - 2kx_A + l)^2 + (kx_B^2 - 2kx_B + l)^2 = [(k(x_A + x_B)^2 - 2k(x_A + x_B) + 2l)^2]$.
Since $x_A + x_B = 2$ and $x_A x_B = 8$, this simplifies to $[k(2)^2 - 2k(2) + 2(8k + 4)]^2 = (4k - 4k + 16k + 8)^2 = (16k + 8)^2$.

Therefore, $d_A^2 + d_B^2 = (-12) + (16k + 8)^2$. We know that $k > 0$, so $16k + 8 > 0$. Therefore, $d_A^2 + d_B^2 = (-12) + (16k + 8)^2 > (-12)$, which means the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is greater than 12.

Now we can use the fact that $l = 8k + 4$. We substitute $l = 8k + 4$ into the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0$ to get $kx^2 - 2kx + (8k) = 0$, or $kx^2 - 2kx + 8k = 0$. This is a quadratic equation with a = k, b = -2k, and c = 8k. We know that its discriminant should be greater than or equal to 0, so $(-2k)^2 - 4*k*8k \geq 0$, or $4k^2 - 32k^2 \geq 0$, or $-28k^2 \geq 0$. This inequality is not true for $k > 0$. Therefore, there must have been a mistake in our calculation.

Let's go back and check our work. We found that $l = 8k + 4$, so we substitute this into the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0$ to get $kx^2 - 2kx + (8k) = 0$, or $kx^2 - 2kx + 8k = 0$. The discriminant of this equation is $(-2k)^2 - 4*k*8k = 4k^2 - 32k^2 = -28k^2$. The discriminant should be greater than or equal to 0, but we got a negative value. This means we made a mistake in our calculation.

Let's retrace our steps and find the mistake. In the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0$, we set $l = 8k + 4$. But in the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0$, we want to solve for $l$, not substitute $l$ into the equation. Let's set the equation to 0 again and solve for $l$:
\[kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0.\]
Rearranging terms, we have $kx^2 - 2kx + 4 = l$. Now let's set $l = 8k + 4$:
\[kx^2 - 2kx + 4 = 8k + 4.\]
Simplifying, we get $kx^2 - 2kx = 8k$. Dividing both sides by $k$ (since $k > 0$), we get $x^2 - 2x = 8$. Rearranging terms, we have $x^2 - 2x - 8 = 0$. This is a quadratic equation, and we can solve it using the quadratic formula:
\[x = \frac{-(-2) \pm \sqrt{(-2)^2 - 4*1*(-8)}}{2*1} = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt

Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


First, we solve the equation $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$ to find the $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$. We get the quadratic equation $kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0$. Let's call the roots of this equation $x_1$ and $x_2$, which represent the $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$ respectively. We are given that $|x_1 - x_2| = 6/k$, so we have $(x_1 - x_2)^2 = \left(\frac{6}{k}\right)^2 = \frac{36}{k^2}$.

Now, we know that $(x_1 - x_2)^2 = (x_1^2 + x_2^2 - 2x_1x_2) = \frac{36}{k^2}$.
By Vieta's formulas, we know that $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$.
So we have $4 - 2\frac{l - 4}{k} = \frac{36}{k^2}$, or $4k^2 - 2(l - 4)k = 36$.

Now, we want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. This is simply $x_1^2 + x_2^2$. We know that $(x_1^2 + x_2^2) = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 4^2 - 2\frac{l - 4}{k} = 16 - 2(l - 4)/k$.

Substituting $4k^2 - 2(l - 4)k = 36$ into this equation gives $16 - 2(l - 4)/k = 16 - \frac{36}{k^2} = 16 - \frac{36}{k^2}$.

Now, substituting $4k^2 - 2(l - 4)k = 36$ again, we get $16 - \frac{36}{k^2} = 16 - \frac{36}{4} = 4$.

Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is 4. The answer is: $4$

9_**Problem:** 

"Let $w_1, w_2, \dots, w_n$ be complex numbers .  A line $L$ in the complex plane is called a mean line for the points $w_1, w_2, \dots, w_n$ if $L$ contains points (complex numbers) $z_1, z_2, \dots, z_n$ such that \[\sum_{k = 1}^n (z_k - w_k) = 0.\] For the numbers $w_1 = 32 + 170i$ $w_2 = - 7 + 64i$ $w_3 = - 9 + 200i$ $w_4 = 1 + 27i$ , and $w_5 = - 14 + 43i$ , there is a unique mean line with $y$ -intercept 3.  Find the slope of this mean line."
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:
We know that
$\sum_{k=1}^5 w_k = 3 + 504i$
And because the sum of the 5 $z$ 's must cancel this out,
$\sum_{k=1}^5 z_k = 3 + 504i$
We write the numbers in the form $a + bi$ and we know that
$\sum_{k=1}^5 a_k = 3$ and $\sum_{k=1}^5 b_k = 504$
The line is of equation $y=mx+3$ . Substituting in the polar coordinates, we have $b_k = ma_k + 3$
Summing all 5 of the equations given for each $k$ , we get
$504 =  3m + 15$
Solving for $m$ , the slope, we get $\boxed{163}$ The answer is $\boxed{163}$

**Problem:** 

"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


First, we need to find the $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$.
The equation of the line $y = 4$ intersects the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ gives us $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$.
Let's call the roots of this equation $x_1$ and $x_2$ (corresponding to $A$ and $B$), then by Vieta's formulas, $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$.
Since $A$ and $B$ are distance 6 apart, we can use the distance formula to get $(x_1 - x_2)^2 = 36$, which simplifies to $(x_1 + x_2)^2 - 4x_1x_2 = 36$. Substituting in the values from Vieta's formulas gives $4 - \frac{4(l - 4)}{k} = 36$, which simplifies to $4k - 4l + 16 = 36k$, or $32 = 36k - 4l$.
Now, we want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. For point $A$, this is $\sqrt{x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2}$. We can simplify this to $\sqrt{(x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2)} = \sqrt{(1 + k^2)x_1^4 - 4k(1 + k)x_1^3 + (4k^2 + 4kl - 4l)x_1^2 + (-4k^2l + 4kl^2)x_1 + l^2}$. Similarly, the distance from $B$ is $\sqrt{(1 + k^2)x_2^4 - 4k(1 + k)x_2^3 + (4k^2 + 4kl - 4l)x_2^2 + (-4k^2l + 4kl^2)x_2 + l^2}$.
The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is therefore
\[((1 + k^2)x_1^4 - 4k(1 + k)x_1^3 + (4k^2 + 4kl - 4l)x_1^2 + (-4k^2l + 4kl^2)x_1 + l^2) + ((1 + k^2)x_2^4 - 4k(1 + k)x_2^3 + (4k^2 + 4kl - 4l)x_2^2 + (-4k^2l + 4kl^2)x_2 + l^2).\]
Since $x_1$ and $x_2$ are roots of the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$, we can substitute $x = x_1$ or $x = x_2$ into this expression and simplify to obtain a constant value. In this case, we find that the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $8l$.
We can use the equation $32 = 36k - 4l$ to express $l$ in terms of $k$: $l = 9k - 8$.
Substituting this into the equation for the sum of squares of distances, we get $8l = 8(9k - 8) = 72k - 64$.
Finally, substituting $l = 9k - 8$ into the equation $32 = 36k - 4l$, we get $32 = 36k - 4(9k - 8)$, which simplifies to $32 = 36k - 36k + 32$, so $k$ can be any positive value.
Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $72k - 64$. Since $k$ can be any positive value, we can let $k = 1$ to get the minimum value of the sum of squares of distances. Substituting $k = 1$ into $72k - 64$ gives $72 - 64 = 8$. Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is 8.
The answer is: $8$

**Problem:** 

"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


First, let's find the x-coordinates of points A and B by setting the y-coordinate of the parabola equal to 4:
\[4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l.\]
Rearranging, we get
\[kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0.\]
This is a quadratic equation, and we know that the solutions are the x-coordinates of points A and B. Let's call these x-coordinates $x_1$ and $x_2$. By the quadratic formula, we have
\[x = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{(2k)^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k} = 1 \pm \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k} = 1 \pm \sqrt{1 - \frac{l - 4}{k}}.\]
We are given that the distance between A and B is 6, so
\[|x_2 - x_1| = 6 \implies 2\sqrt{1 - \frac{l - 4}{k}} = 6 \implies \sqrt{1 - \frac{l - 4}{k}} = 3.\]
Squaring both sides, we get
\[1 - \frac{l - 4}{k} = 9 \implies \frac{l - 4}{k} = -8 \implies l - 4 = -8k \implies l = 4 - 8k.\]
Now, let's find the distances from A and B to the origin. The coordinates of A and B are $(x_1, 4)$ and $(x_2, 4)$ respectively, so the distances are $\sqrt{x_1^2 + 4^2}$ and $\sqrt{x_2^2 + 4^2}$. The sum of the squares of these distances is
\[x_1^2 + 16 + x_2^2 + 16 = (x_1^2 + x_2^2) + 32.\]
By the distance formula, $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = \left(2 + \frac{2\sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{k}\right)^2 - 2\left(1 + \sqrt{1 - \frac{l - 4}{k}}\right)\left(1 - \sqrt{1 - \frac{l - 4}{k}}\right) = \left(2 + \frac{12}{k}\right)^2 - 2(2) = \left(\frac{2k + 12}{k}\right)^2 - 4$.
Substituting $l = 4 - 8k$, we get
\[x_1^2 + x_2^2 = \left(\frac{2k + 12}{k}\right)^2 - 4 = \frac{4k^2 + 48k + 144}{k^2} - 4 = \frac{4k^2 + 48k + 144 - 4k^2}{k^2} = \frac{48k + 144}{k^2}.\]
Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from A and B to the origin is
\[(x_1^2 + x_2^2) + 32 = \frac{48k + 144}{k^2} + 32 = \frac{48k + 144 + 32k^2}{k^2} = \frac{32k^2 + 48k + 144}{k^2} = 32 + \frac{48}{k} + \frac{144}{k^2}.\]
Since $k > 0$, the minimum value of this expression occurs when $k = 1$, so the minimum value is
\[32 + 48 + 144 = 224.\]
Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from A and B to the origin is 224. The answer is: $224$
