0_**Problem:** 

"Let $d(n)$ denote the number of positive integers that divide $n$ , including $1$ and $n$ . For example, $d(1)=1,d(2)=2,$ and $d(12)=6$ . (This function is known as the divisor function.) Let \[f(n)=\frac{d(n)}{\sqrt [3]n}.\] There is a unique positive integer $N$ such that $f(N)>f(n)$ for all positive integers $n\ne N$ . What is the sum of the digits of $N?$"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:
We consider the prime factorization of $n:$ \[n=\prod_{i=1}^{k}p_i^{e_i}.\] By the Multiplication Principle, we have \[d(n)=\prod_{i=1}^{k}(e_i+1).\] Now, we rewrite $f(n)$ as \[f(n)=\frac{d(n)}{\sqrt [3]n}=\frac{\prod_{i=1}^{k}(e_i+1)}{\prod_{i=1}^{k}p_i^{e_i/3}}=\prod_{i=1}^{k}\frac{e_i+1}{p_i^{{e_i}/3}}.\] As $f(n)>0$ for all positive integers $n,$ note that $f(a)>f(b)$ if and only if $f(a)^3>f(b)^3$ for all positive integers $a$ and $b.$ So, $f(n)$ is maximized if and only if \[f(n)^3=\prod_{i=1}^{k}\frac{(e_i+1)^3}{p_i^{{e_i}}}\] is maximized.
For each independent factor $\frac{(e_i+1)^3}{p_i^{e_i}}$ with a fixed prime $p_i,$ where $1\leq i\leq k,$ the denominator grows faster than the numerator, as exponential functions always grow faster than polynomial functions. Therefore, for each prime $p_i$ with $\left(p_1,p_2,p_3,p_4,\ldots\right)=\left(2,3,5,7,\ldots\right),$ we look for the nonnegative integer $e_i$ such that $\frac{(e_i+1)^3}{p_i^{e_i}}$ is a relative maximum: \[\begin{array}{c|c|c|c|c}  & & & & \\ [-2.25ex] \boldsymbol{i} & \boldsymbol{p_i} & \boldsymbol{e_i} & \boldsymbol{\dfrac{(e_i+1)^3}{p_i^{e_i}}} & \textbf{Max?} \\ [2.5ex] \hline\hline  & & & & \\ [-2ex] 1 & 2 & 0 & 1 & \\      & & 1 & 4 & \\     & & 2 & 27/4 &\\     & & 3 & 8 & \checkmark\\     & & 4 & 125/16 & \\ [0.5ex] \hline   & & & & \\ [-2ex] 2 & 3 & 0 & 1 &\\     & & 1 & 8/3 & \\     & & 2 & 3 &  \checkmark\\     & & 3 & 64/27 &  \\ [0.5ex] \hline   & & & & \\ [-2ex] 3 & 5 & 0 & 1 &  \\     & & 1 & 8/5 &  \checkmark\\     & & 2 & 27/25 & \\ [0.5ex] \hline   & & & & \\ [-2ex] 4 & 7 & 0 & 1 &  \\     & & 1 & 8/7 &  \checkmark\\     & & 2 & 27/49 & \\ [0.5ex] \hline   & & & & \\ [-2ex] \geq5 & \geq11 & 0 & 1 & \checkmark \\     & & \geq1 & \leq8/11 &   \\ [0.5ex] \end{array}\] Finally, the positive integer we seek is $N=2^3\cdot3^2\cdot5^1\cdot7^1=2520.$ The sum of its digits is $2+5+2+0=\boxed{9}.$ The answer is $\boxed{9}$

**Problem:** 

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


Setting $n=1$ in the second equation, we get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. Since $f(f(f(1))) = 8 \cdot 1 - 7 = -1$, and the function is defined for all positive integers, we have $f(1) = 1$. Then $f(2) = 2 \cdot 1 + 1 = 3$. Then $f(3) = 2f(1.5) + 1 = 2 \cdot f(2) + 1 = 2 \cdot 3 + 1 = 7$. Then $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2 \cdot 3 + 1 = 7$. Then $f(7) = 2f(3.5) + 1 = 2 \cdot f(4) + 1 = 2 \cdot 7 + 1 = 15$. Then $f(8) = 2f(4) + 1 = 2 \cdot 7 + 1 = 15$.
We notice that $f(n) = 2n + 1$ for all even $n$.
In particular, $f(100) = 2 \cdot 100 + 1 = 201$. So, $f(100) = 201$. The answer is: $201$

**Problem:** 

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


We are given the function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ with two conditions $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.

We can start by setting $n = 1$ in the second equation to get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. But we don't know the value of $f(1)$, so we cannot directly find the value of $f(2)$.

However, we can set $n = 2$ in the second equation to get $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$. Again, we don't know the value of $f(2)$, so we cannot directly find the value of $f(4)$.

Continuing this process, we can set $n = 3$ in the second equation to get $f(6) = 2f(3) + 1$. Again, we don't know the value of $f(3)$, so we cannot directly find the value of $f(6)$.

We notice a pattern here: we cannot directly find the value of $f(n)$ for any $n$ unless we know the value of $f(n-1)$.

However, let's look at the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. If we set $n = 1$, we get $f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = -1$. But the function $f$ maps from $\mathbb N$ to $\mathbb N$, so the value of $f(f(f(1)))$ cannot be negative. This means our initial assumption that $f(1)$ is a natural number must be incorrect.

So, let's try a different approach. We can set $n = 1$ in the second equation to get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. Now we can substitute this into the first equation to get $f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = -1$. But since $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$, we have $f(f(f(1))) = f(2*f(1) + 1) = f(2*f(1) + 1)$. This means $f(2*f(1) + 1) = -1$.

However, we know that the function $f$ maps from $\mathbb N$ to $\mathbb N$, so the value of $f(2*f(1) + 1)$ cannot be negative. This means our initial assumption that $f(1)$ is a natural number must be incorrect.

But since $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$, we have $f(f(f(1))) = f(2*f(1) + 1) = f(2*f(1) + 1)$. This means $f(2*f(1) + 1) = -1$.

**Problem:** 

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:



First, let's plug in $n = 1$ into the second equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. We get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.

Then, we plug in $n = f(1)$ into the first equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. We get $f(f(f(f(1)))) = 8f(1) - 7$.

By the first condition, $f(f(f(f(1)))) = f(2)$, and we know from the second equation that $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. So we have $2f(1) + 1 = 8f(1) - 7$.

Simplifying the equation gives $6f(1) = 8$, so $f(1) = 4/3$. But $f(1)$ has to be a natural number, so there must be a mistake in our work. Let's go back and check our steps.

We noticed that we got a fraction for $f(1)$, so let's try another approach. Let's first find $f(2)$ using the second equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. We get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.

Then, we plug in $n = 2$ into the first equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. We get $f(f(f(2))) = 8*2 - 7 = 9$.

By the first condition, $f(f(f(2))) = f(3)$, so $f(3) = 9$.

Now, let's use the second equation to find $f(4)$ in terms of $f(2)$: $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$.

And we know that $f(4) = 8$ from the first equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$ when $n = 1$. So we have $8 = 2f(2) + 1$.

Solving this equation gives $f(2) = 7/2$, which is not a natural number. So there must be a mistake in our work.

Let's go back and check our steps.

We noticed that we got a fraction for $f(2)$, so let's try another approach. Let's first find $f(3)$ using the second equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. We get $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$.

Then, we plug in $n = 3$ into the first equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. We get $f(f(f(3))) = 8*3 - 7 = 19$.

By the first condition, $f(f(f(3))) = f(4)$, so $f(4) = 19$.

Now, let's use the second equation to find $f(2)$ in terms of $f(1)$: $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.

And we know that $f(4) = 19$, so $19 = 2f(2) + 1$.

Solving this equation gives $f(2) = 9$.

Now, let's use the second equation to find $f(1)$ in terms of $f(2)$: $f(1) = (f(2) - 1)/2$.

And we know that $f(2) = 9$, so $f(1) = (9 - 1)/2 = 4$.

Now we have found $f(1) = 4$ and $f(2) = 9$. Let's check if these values satisfy the original conditions.

For the first condition, we have $f(f(f(1))) = f(f(9)) = f(17)$. But $f(f(f(1))) = f(4)$, so $f(4) = f(17)$. From the second equation, $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2*9 + 1 = 19$, and from the first equation, $f(17) = 8*1 - 7 = 1$. So we have $19 = 1$, which is not possible.

So we made a mistake in our work. Let's go back and check our steps.

We noticed that we got a contradiction when checking the first condition. So let's try another approach. Let's first find $f(4)$ using the second equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. We get $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$.

Then, we plug in $n = 4$ into the first equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. We get $f(f(f(4))) = 8*4 - 7 = 25$.

By the first condition, $f(f(f(4))) = f(5)$, so $f(5) = 25$.

Now, let's use the second equation to find $f(2)$ in terms of $f(1)$: $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.

And we know that $f(5) = 25$, so $25 = 2f(2) + 1$.

Solving this equation gives $f(2) = 12$.

Now, let's use the second equation to find $f(1)$ in terms of $f(2)$: $f(1) = (f(2) - 1)/2$.

And we know that $f(2) = 12$, so $f(1) = (12 - 1)/2 = 5.5$. But $f(1)$ has to be a natural number, so there must be a mistake in our work. Let's go back and check our steps.

We noticed that we got a fraction for $f(1)$, so let's try another approach. Let's first find $f(4)$ using the second equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. We get $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$.

Then, we plug in $n = 4$ into the first equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. We get $f(f(f(4))) = 8*4 - 7 = 25$.

By the first condition, $f(f(f(4))) = f(5)$, so $f(5) = 25$.

3_**Problem:** 

"Let $d(n)$ denote the number of positive integers that divide $n$ , including $1$ and $n$ . For example, $d(1)=1,d(2)=2,$ and $d(12)=6$ . (This function is known as the divisor function.) Let \[f(n)=\frac{d(n)}{\sqrt [3]n}.\] There is a unique positive integer $N$ such that $f(N)>f(n)$ for all positive integers $n\ne N$ . What is the sum of the digits of $N?$"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:
We consider the prime factorization of $n:$ \[n=\prod_{i=1}^{k}p_i^{e_i}.\] By the Multiplication Principle, we have \[d(n)=\prod_{i=1}^{k}(e_i+1).\] Now, we rewrite $f(n)$ as \[f(n)=\frac{d(n)}{\sqrt [3]n}=\frac{\prod_{i=1}^{k}(e_i+1)}{\prod_{i=1}^{k}p_i^{e_i/3}}=\prod_{i=1}^{k}\frac{e_i+1}{p_i^{{e_i}/3}}.\] As $f(n)>0$ for all positive integers $n,$ note that $f(a)>f(b)$ if and only if $f(a)^3>f(b)^3$ for all positive integers $a$ and $b.$ So, $f(n)$ is maximized if and only if \[f(n)^3=\prod_{i=1}^{k}\frac{(e_i+1)^3}{p_i^{{e_i}}}\] is maximized.
For each independent factor $\frac{(e_i+1)^3}{p_i^{e_i}}$ with a fixed prime $p_i,$ where $1\leq i\leq k,$ the denominator grows faster than the numerator, as exponential functions always grow faster than polynomial functions. Therefore, for each prime $p_i$ with $\left(p_1,p_2,p_3,p_4,\ldots\right)=\left(2,3,5,7,\ldots\right),$ we look for the nonnegative integer $e_i$ such that $\frac{(e_i+1)^3}{p_i^{e_i}}$ is a relative maximum: \[\begin{array}{c|c|c|c|c}  & & & & \\ [-2.25ex] \boldsymbol{i} & \boldsymbol{p_i} & \boldsymbol{e_i} & \boldsymbol{\dfrac{(e_i+1)^3}{p_i^{e_i}}} & \textbf{Max?} \\ [2.5ex] \hline\hline  & & & & \\ [-2ex] 1 & 2 & 0 & 1 & \\      & & 1 & 4 & \\     & & 2 & 27/4 &\\     & & 3 & 8 & \checkmark\\     & & 4 & 125/16 & \\ [0.5ex] \hline   & & & & \\ [-2ex] 2 & 3 & 0 & 1 &\\     & & 1 & 8/3 & \\     & & 2 & 3 &  \checkmark\\     & & 3 & 64/27 &  \\ [0.5ex] \hline   & & & & \\ [-2ex] 3 & 5 & 0 & 1 &  \\     & & 1 & 8/5 &  \checkmark\\     & & 2 & 27/25 & \\ [0.5ex] \hline   & & & & \\ [-2ex] 4 & 7 & 0 & 1 &  \\     & & 1 & 8/7 &  \checkmark\\     & & 2 & 27/49 & \\ [0.5ex] \hline   & & & & \\ [-2ex] \geq5 & \geq11 & 0 & 1 & \checkmark \\     & & \geq1 & \leq8/11 &   \\ [0.5ex] \end{array}\] Finally, the positive integer we seek is $N=2^3\cdot3^2\cdot5^1\cdot7^1=2520.$ The sum of its digits is $2+5+2+0=\boxed{9}.$ The answer is $\boxed{9}$

**Problem:** 

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


Setting $n = 1$ in the first equation, we have $f(f(f(1))) = 8(1) - 7 = -1$. However, since $f$ maps only to positive integers, $f(f(f(1))) = -1$ is not possible. So, let's consider the second equation.
Setting $n = 2$ in the second equation, we have $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$. Now, setting $n = f(2)$ in the second equation, we have $f(2f(2)) = 2f(f(2)) + 1$. Substituting $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$ into this equation, we get $f(f(4)) = 2f(f(2)) + 1$. Since $f(f(f(1))) = -1$, we have $f(1) = 1$ from the first equation. Substituting $f(1) = 1$ into the second equation, we get $f(2) = 3$. Now, substituting $f(2) = 3$ into $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$, we get $f(4) = 7$. Finally, substituting $f(2) = 3$ and $f(4) = 7$ into $f(f(4)) = 2f(f(2)) + 1$, we get $f(7) = 2f(3) + 1$.

Now, let's try to find a pattern. We know that $f(1) = 1$, $f(2) = 3$, $f(4) = 7$, and $f(f(4)) = f(7) = 2f(3) + 1$. We can see that $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ for $n = 1, 2, 4$. So, it seems reasonable to conjecture that $f(n) = 2n - 1$ for all positive integers $n$.

Let's check if this function satisfies both conditions.
For the first condition, we have $f(f(f(n))) = f(f(2n - 1)) = f(2(2n - 1) - 1) = f(4n - 3) = 2(4n - 3) - 1 = 8n - 7$. So, the first condition holds.
For the second condition, we have $f(2n) = 2(2n) - 1 = 4n - 1 = 2f(n) + 1$. So, the second condition also holds.

Therefore, $f(n) = 2n - 1$ is the function that satisfies both conditions. To find $f(100)$, we substitute $n = 100$ into $f(n) = 2n - 1$ to get $f(100) = 2(100) - 1 = 199$.
The answer is: $199$

**Problem:** 

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


To find the value of $f(100)$, we need to first find a pattern in the function $f$.

From the given conditions, we have $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. Let's set $n=1$, we get $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1$. So $f(f(f(1)))=1$.
Now let's set $n=2$, we get $f(f(f(2)))=8(2)-7=9$. So $f(f(f(2)))=9$.
Setting $n=3$, we get $f(f(f(3)))=8(3)-7=17$. So $f(f(f(3)))=17$.
From these results, we can observe a pattern that $f(f(f(n)))=4n-3$.

Now let's use the second given condition, $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We can substitute $n=f(n)$ into this equation to get $f(2f(n))=2f(f(n))+1$.
Setting $n=1$, we get $f(2f(1))=2f(f(1))+1$. Since $f(f(f(1)))=1$, we have $f(2f(1))=2f(1)+1$. But from the pattern we observed above, we have $f(f(f(1)))=1$, so $f(2)=2f(1)+1$.

Let's solve for $f(1)$ from this equation. We know $f(2)=2f(1)+1$. From the pattern we observed earlier, we have $f(f(f(2)))=9$, so $f(4)=9$. So $2f(1)+1=9$. Solving for $f(1)$ gives us $f(1)=4$.

Now we can substitute $f(1)=4$ into the equation $f(2)=2f(1)+1$ to get $f(2)=2(4)+1=9$.

Let's continue this process to find the values of $f(3), f(4), f(5), \ldots$.

We have $f(3)=f\left(\frac{f(2)+1}{2}\right)=f\left(\frac{9+1}{2}\right)=f(5)=15$.

We have $f(4)=f\left(\frac{f(3)+1}{2}\right)=f\left(\frac{15+1}{2}\right)=f(8)=19$.

We have $f(5)=f\left(\frac{f(4)+1}{2}\right)=f\left(\frac{19+1}{2}\right)=f(10)=23$.

And so on. By continuing this process, we can find the values of $f(n)$ for all positive integers $n$.

Finally, to find $f(100)$, we can use the pattern we observed earlier, $f(f(f(n)))=4n-3$. We know that $f(f(f(100)))=8(100)-7=793$. So we have $f(100)=f\left(\frac{793+3}{4}\right)=f(199)=799$.

Therefore, $f(100)=799$.
The answer is $\boxed{799}$.

**Problem:** 

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


First, let's substitute $n=1$ into the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we get $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$. So $f(f(f(1)))=1$.

Then, let's substitute $n=2$ into the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we get $f(f(f(2)))=8*2-7=9$. So $f(f(f(2)))=9$.

But we know that $f(f(f(2)))=f(f(2f(1)+1))=f(f(3))$ from the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.

So we have $f(f(3))=9$.

Let's substitute $n=3$ into the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we get $f(f(f(3)))=8*3-7=17$. So $f(f(f(3)))=17$.

But we know that $f(f(f(3)))=f(f(2f(1)+1))=f(f(3))$ from the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.

So we have $f(f(3))=17$.

But from $f(f(3))=9$ and $f(f(3))=17$, we have $9=17$, which is a contradiction.

So we must have made a mistake in our reasoning. Let's go back and re-examine our work.

We found that $f(f(f(1)))=1$, $f(f(f(2)))=9$, and $f(f(f(3)))=17$.

Notice that the numbers $1$, $9$, and $17$ are in an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of $8$.

Also, notice that $f(1)=1$, $f(2)=3$, and $f(3)=5$.

These numbers $1$, $3$, and $5$ are also in an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of $2$.

So we may have found a pattern:
\[f(n)=2n-1.\]

Let's check this pattern by substituting $n=100$ into $f(n)=2n-1$:
\[f(100)=2*100-1=199.\]

Therefore, $f(100)=199$. The answer is: $199$

**Problem:** 

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:



Given $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, if we plug in $n=1$, we get $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1$, which implies that $f(f(1))=1$.

Now, given $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, if we plug in $n=1$, we get $f(2)=2f(1)+1$. Since $f(1)=1$, we get $f(2)=2*1+1=3$.

Again, using the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, if we plug in $n=2$, we get $f(4)=2f(2)+1$. Since $f(2)=3$, we get $f(4)=2*3+1=7$.

Now, we can use the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to find $f(1)$. If we plug in $n=1$, we get $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1$, which implies that $f(f(1))=1$.

Since we know that $f(1)=1$, we can substitute this into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to get $f(2)=2*1+1=3$.

Again, using the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, if we plug in $n=2$, we get $f(4)=2f(2)+1$. Since $f(2)=3$, we get $f(4)=2*3+1=7$.

Finally, using the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, if we plug in $n=4$, we get $f(f(f(4)))=8(4)-7=23$, which implies that $f(f(7))=23$.

Now, we can substitute $f(7)=23$ into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to get $f(14)=2*23+1=47$.

Again, using the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, if we plug in $n=14$, we get $f(28)=2f(14)+1=2*47+1=95$.

Continuing this process, we can find that $f(56)=191$, $f(112)=383$, $f(224)=767$, and so on.

However, we can notice a pattern here. We have $f(1)=1$, $f(2)=3$, $f(4)=7$, $f(7)=23$, $f(14)=47$, $f(28)=95$, $f(56)=191$, $f(112)=383$, $f(224)=767$, and so on. The values of $f(n)$ are all one less than a power of 2.

In particular, we can see that $f(n)=2^k-1$ for some positive integer $k$. From the given equations, we can deduce that $k$ must be the number of 1's in the binary representation of $n$. For example, $1=2^0$, $3=2^1-1$, $7=2^3-1$, and so on.

Therefore, for $n=100$, we need to find the number of 1's in the binary representation of 100. The binary representation of 100 is $1100100$, which has five 1's. So $k=5$.

Therefore, $f(100)=2^5-1=32-1=31$. So the answer is $f(100)=31$.
The answer is: $31$

Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:
We consider the prime factorization of $n:$ \[n=\prod_{i=1}^{k}p_i^{e_i}.\] By the Multiplication Principle, we have \[d(n)=\prod_{i=1}^{k}(e_i+1).\] Now, we rewrite $f(n)$ as \[f(n)=\frac{d(n)}{\sqrt [3]n}=\frac{\prod_{i=1}^{k}(e_i+1)}{\prod_{i=1}^{k}p_i^{e_i/3}}=\prod_{i=1}^{k}\frac{e_i+1}{p_i^{{e_i}/3}}.\] As $f(n)>0$ for all positive integers $n,$ note that $f(a)>f(b)$ if and only if $f(a)^3>f(b)^3$ for all positive integers $a$ and $b.$ So, $f(n)$ is maximized if and only if \[f(n)^3=\prod_{i=1}^{k}\frac{(e_i+1)^3}{p_i^{{e_i}}}\] is maximized.
For each independent factor $\frac{(e_i+1)^3}{p_i^{e_i}}$ with a fixed prime $p_i,$ where $1\leq i\leq k,$ the denominator grows faster than the numerator, as exponential functions always grow faster than polynomial functions. Therefore, for each prime $p_i$ with $\left(p_1,p_2,p_3,p_4,\ldots\right)=\left(2,3,5,7,\ldots\right),$ we look for the nonnegative integer $e_i$ such that $\frac{(e_i+1)^3}{p_i^{e_i}}$ is a relative maximum: \[\begin{array}{c|c|c|c|c}  & & & & \\ [-2.25ex] \boldsymbol{i} & \boldsymbol{p_i} & \boldsymbol{e_i} & \boldsymbol{\dfrac{(e_i+1)^3}{p_i^{e_i}}} & \textbf{Max?} \\ [2.5ex] \hline\hline  & & & & \\ [-2ex] 1 & 2 & 0 & 1 & \\      & & 1 & 4 & \\     & & 2 & 27/4 &\\     & & 3 & 8 & \checkmark\\     & & 4 & 125/16 & \\ [0.5ex] \hline   & & & & \\ [-2ex] 2 & 3 & 0 & 1 &\\     & & 1 & 8/3 & \\     & & 2 & 3 &  \checkmark\\     & & 3 & 64/27 &  \\ [0.5ex] \hline   & & & & \\ [-2ex] 3 & 5 & 0 & 1 &  \\     & & 1 & 8/5 &  \checkmark\\     & & 2 & 27/25 & \\ [0.5ex] \hline   & & & & \\ [-2ex] 4 & 7 & 0 & 1 &  \\     & & 1 & 8/7 &  \checkmark\\     & & 2 & 27/49 & \\ [0.5ex] \hline   & & & & \\ [-2ex] \geq5 & \geq11 & 0 & 1 & \checkmark \\     & & \geq1 & \leq8/11 &   \\ [0.5ex] \end{array}\] Finally, the positive integer we seek is $N=2^3\cdot3^2\cdot5^1\cdot7^1=2520.$ The sum of its digits is $2+5+2+0=\boxed{9}.$ The answer is $\boxed{9}$

**Problem:** 

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


First, we plug $n = 1$ into the second equation to get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.
Then, we plug $n = f(1)$ into the first equation to get $f(f(f(f(1)))) = 8f(1) - 7$.
But since $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, we have $f(f(f(f(1)))) = 8f(1) - 7$.
Comparing these two equations, we have $f(f(f(f(1)))) = f(2)$, so $f(2) = 8f(1) - 7$.
We can substitute $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$ into this equation to get $2f(1) + 1 = 8f(1) - 7$.
Simplifying, we get $6f(1) = 8$, so $f(1) = \frac{4}{3}$.
But $f(1)$ must be a natural number, so this solution is not possible.

Let's try a different approach.
We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$.
If we plug in $n = 1$, we get $f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = 1$.
Since $f(1)$ is a natural number, we can try to find a function that satisfies this equation.
Let's try $f(n) = 2n - 1$.
We can check that $f(f(f(n))) = f(f(2n - 1)) = f(2(2n - 1) - 1) = f(4n - 3) = 2(4n - 3) - 1 = 8n - 7$, which is exactly what we want.
Now we need to check if this function also satisfies the second equation.
Plugging in $n = 2$ into the second equation, we get $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$.
We know that $f(4) = 2(2*f(1) + 1) - 1 = 2(2*1 + 1) - 1 = 6$.
And $2f(2) + 1 = 2(2f(1) + 1) + 1 = 2(2*1 + 1) + 1 = 6$.
So this function does indeed satisfy both equations.

Now we can find $f(100)$.
We know that $f(n) = 2n - 1$, so $f(100) = 2*100 - 1 = 199$.
Therefore, $f(100) = 199$.
The answer is: $199$

Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:



First, let's plug in $n=1$ into the second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We get $f(2)=2f(1)+1$.

Then, let's plug in $f(1)$ into this equation. We know that $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$, so $f(1)$ is the number such that $f(f(f(1)))=1$. From the first equation, we get $f(1)=1$.

Now we can plug in $f(1)=1$ into the equation $f(2)=2f(1)+1$ to get $f(2)=2*1+1=3$.

Now let's plug in $n=2$ into the second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We get $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2*3+1=7$.

Again, let's plug in $f(2)=3$ into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to get $f(6)=2f(3)+1$.

And again, let's plug in $f(3)$ into this equation. We know that $f(f(f(3)))=8*3-7=17$, so $f(3)$ is the number such that $f(f(f(3)))=17$. From the first equation, we get $f(3)=3$.

So we have $f(6)=2f(3)+1=2*3+1=7$.

Finally, let's plug in $n=100$ into the second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We get $f(200)=2f(100)+1$.

And again, let's plug in $f(100)$ into this equation. We know that $f(f(f(100)))=8*100-7=793$, so $f(100)$ is the number such that $f(f(f(100)))=793$. From the first equation, we get $f(100)=100$.

So we have $f(200)=2f(100)+1=2*100+1=201$.

Therefore, $f(100)=100$. The answer is: $100$

**Problem:** 

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:



We are given the equations $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.

By setting $n=1$ in the second equation, we get $f(2)=2f(1)+1$.

Again by setting $n=f(1)$ in the second equation, we get $f(2f(1))=2f(f(1))+1$.

Then by setting $n=f(f(1))$ in the first equation, we get $f(f(f(f(1)))) = 8f(f(1)) - 7$. But from the given equations, we know $f(f(f(1)))=f(2)$, so we can substitute $f(2)$ into this equation to get $f(2) = 8f(f(1)) - 7$.

But we know from the equation $f(2)=2f(1)+1$ that $2f(1)+1 = 8f(f(1)) - 7$. Rearranging this equation gives $8f(f(1)) = 2f(1) + 8$, or $8f(f(1)) - 2f(1) = 8$, or $2f(1)(4 - 1) = 8$, or $6f(1) = 8$, or $f(1) = \frac{8}{6} = \frac{4}{3}$.

However, $f(1)$ is a natural number, and $\frac{4}{3}$ is not. This means we must have made an error somewhere. Let's go back and check our work.

We found that $f(2) = 8f(f(1)) - 7$. But from the second equation, we also have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. Setting these two equal to each other gives $8f(f(1)) - 7 = 2f(1) + 1$, or $8f(f(1)) = 2f(1) + 8$, or $4f(f(1)) = f(1) + 4$, or $3f(f(1)) = 4$.

Again, this is a contradiction because the left side is a multiple of 3 and the right side is not. Let's try a different approach.

We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. Setting $n=1$ gives $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1$. This means that $f(1)$ is a number such that when we apply the function $f$ three times, we get 1.

Let's try a few numbers to see what we get when we apply the function $f$ three times. If we start with $n=1$, we have $f(1)$, then $f(f(1))$, then $f(f(f(1)))$.

If $f(1)=1$, then $f(f(1))=f(1)=1$ and $f(f(f(1)))=f(1)=1$, which is not equal to 1.

If $f(1)=2$, then $f(f(1))=f(2)$ and $f(f(f(1)))=f(f(2))$. But from the second equation, we have $f(2)=2f(1)+1=2(2)+1=5$. So $f(f(2))=f(5)$. But we don't know what $f(5)$ is yet.

If $f(1)=3$, then $f(f(1))=f(3)$ and $f(f(f(1)))=f(f(3))$. But we don't know what $f(3)$ is yet.

Let's try $f(1)=4$. Then $f(f(1))=f(4)$ and $f(f(f(1)))=f(f(4))$. But we don't know what $f(4)$ is yet.

Let's try $f(1)=5$. Then $f(f(1))=f(5)$ and $f(f(f(1)))=f(f(5))$. But we don't know what $f(5)$ is yet.

Let's try $f(1)=6$. Then $f(f(1))=f(6)$ and $f(f(f(1)))=f(f(6))$. But we don't know what $f(6)$ is yet.

Let's try $f(1)=7$. Then $f(f(1))=f(7)$ and $f(f(f(1)))=f(f(7))$. But we don't know what $f(7)$ is yet.

Let's try $f(1)=8$. Then $f(f(1))=f(8)$ and $f(f(f(1)))=f(f(8))$. But we don't know what $f(8)$ is yet.

Let's try $f(1)=9$. Then $f(f(1))=f(9)$ and $f(f(f(1)))=f(f(9))$. But we don't know what $f(9)$ is yet.

Let's try $f(1)=10$. Then $f(f(1))=f(10)$ and $f(f(f(1)))=f(f(10))$. But we don't know what $f(10)$ is yet.

Let's try $f(1)=11$. Then $f(f(1))=f(11)$ and $f(f(f(1)))=f(f(11))$. But we don't know what $f(11)$ is yet.

Let's try $f(1)=12$. Then $f(f(1))=f(12)$ and $f(f(f(1)))=f(f(12))$. But we don't know what $f(12)$ is yet.

Let's try $f(1)=13$. Then $f(f(1))=f(13)$ and $f(f(f(1)))=f(f(13))$. But we don't know what $f(13)$ is yet.

Let's try $f(1)=14$. Then $f(f(1))=f(14)$ and $f(f(f(1)))=f(f(14))$. But we don't know what $f(14)$ is yet.

Let's try $f(1)=15$. Then $f(f(1))=f(15)$ and $f(f(f(1)))=f(f(15))$. But we don't know what $f(15)$ is yet.

Let's try $f(1)=16$. Then $f(f(1

**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:
We consider the prime factorization of $n:$ \[n=\prod_{i=1}^{k}p_i^{e_i}.\] By the Multiplication Principle, we have \[d(n)=\prod_{i=1}^{k}(e_i+1).\] Now, we rewrite $f(n)$ as \[f(n)=\frac{d(n)}{\sqrt [3]n}=\frac{\prod_{i=1}^{k}(e_i+1)}{\prod_{i=1}^{k}p_i^{e_i/3}}=\prod_{i=1}^{k}\frac{e_i+1}{p_i^{{e_i}/3}}.\] As $f(n)>0$ for all positive integers $n,$ note that $f(a)>f(b)$ if and only if $f(a)^3>f(b)^3$ for all positive integers $a$ and $b.$ So, $f(n)$ is maximized if and only if \[f(n)^3=\prod_{i=1}^{k}\frac{(e_i+1)^3}{p_i^{{e_i}}}\] is maximized.
For each independent factor $\frac{(e_i+1)^3}{p_i^{e_i}}$ with a fixed prime $p_i,$ where $1\leq i\leq k,$ the denominator grows faster than the numerator, as exponential functions always grow faster than polynomial functions. Therefore, for each prime $p_i$ with $\left(p_1,p_2,p_3,p_4,\ldots\right)=\left(2,3,5,7,\ldots\right),$ we look for the nonnegative integer $e_i$ such that $\frac{(e_i+1)^3}{p_i^{e_i}}$ is a relative maximum: \[\begin{array}{c|c|c|c|c}  & & & & \\ [-2.25ex] \boldsymbol{i} & \boldsymbol{p_i} & \boldsymbol{e_i} & \boldsymbol{\dfrac{(e_i+1)^3}{p_i^{e_i}}} & \textbf{Max?} \\ [2.5ex] \hline\hline  & & & & \\ [-2ex] 1 & 2 & 0 & 1 & \\      & & 1 & 4 & \\     & & 2 & 27/4 &\\     & & 3 & 8 & \checkmark\\     & & 4 & 125/16 & \\ [0.5ex] \hline   & & & & \\ [-2ex] 2 & 3 & 0 & 1 &\\     & & 1 & 8/3 & \\     & & 2 & 3 &  \checkmark\\     & & 3 & 64/27 &  \\ [0.5ex] \hline   & & & & \\ [-2ex] 3 & 5 & 0 & 1 &  \\     & & 1 & 8/5 &  \checkmark\\     & & 2 & 27/25 & \\ [0.5ex] \hline   & & & & \\ [-2ex] 4 & 7 & 0 & 1 &  \\     & & 1 & 8/7 &  \checkmark\\     & & 2 & 27/49 & \\ [0.5ex] \hline   & & & & \\ [-2ex] \geq5 & \geq11 & 0 & 1 & \checkmark \\     & & \geq1 & \leq8/11 &   \\ [0.5ex] \end{array}\] Finally, the positive integer we seek is $N=2^3\cdot3^2\cdot5^1\cdot7^1=2520.$ The sum of its digits is $2+5+2+0=\boxed{9}.$ The answer is $\boxed{9}$

**Problem:** 

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


First, let's find $f(1)$. Using the second equation, we have $f(2f(1)) = 2f(f(1)) + 1$. If we plug in $n=f(1)$, we get $f(f(f(1))) = 2f(f(1)) + 1$. But from the first equation, we know $f(f(f(1))) = 8(1) - 7 = -1$. So, we have $-1 = 2f(f(1)) + 1$. Simplifying this gives $2f(f(1)) = -2$, so $f(f(1)) = -1$. 

Now, using the second equation again, we have $f(2f(1)) = 2f(f(1)) + 1$. If we plug in $n=1$, we get $f(2) = 2f(f(1)) + 1$. But we just found that $f(f(1)) = -1$, so we have $f(2) = 2(-1) + 1 = -1$. 

But if we plug $n=2$ into the second equation, we get $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$. Since we found that $f(2) = -1$, this gives $f(4) = 2(-1) + 1 = -1$.

Again, using the second equation, we have $f(2f(2)) = 2f(f(2)) + 1$. If we plug in $n=2$, we get $f(4) = 2f(f(2)) + 1$. But we just found that $f(4) = -1$, so we have $-1 = 2f(f(2)) + 1$. Simplifying this gives $2f(f(2)) = -2$, so $f(f(2)) = -1$. But we already found that $f(f(1)) = -1$, so $f(f(2)) = f(f(1))$. Since the function $f$ is one-to-one (i.e., each value of $f(n)$ corresponds to exactly one value of $n$), we must have $f(2) = f(1)$. But we already found that $f(2) = -1$ and $f(1) = -1$, so indeed $f(2) = f(1)$.

So we have found that $f(1) = -1$. 

Now, using the second equation again, we have $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. If we plug in $n=1$, we get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. But we found that $f(1) = -1$, so we have $f(2) = 2(-1) + 1 = -1$. But this is a contradiction, because we already found that $f(2) = -1$ using the first equation. 

So we must have made a mistake in our reasoning. Let's go back and reevaluate our steps.

We started with the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$ and plugged in $n = 1$ to get $f(f(f(1))) = -1$. Then we used the second equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to find that $f(2) = -1$. 

But when we plugged in $n = 2$ into the second equation, we got $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2(-1) + 1 = -1$, which led to $f(f(2)) = -1$. But we already knew that $f(f(1)) = -1$, so $f(f(2)) = f(f(1))$. This implied that $f(2) = f(1)$, but we had already found that $f(2) = -1$ and $f(1) = -1$, so $f(2) = f(1)$ was true.

However, when we plugged $n = 1$ into the second equation to get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$, we got $f(2) = 2(-1) + 1 = -1$. But this was a contradiction, because we had already found that $f(2) = -1$ using the first equation.

The mistake in our reasoning was that we assumed that $f(f(2)) = -1$. Let's try to reevaluate our steps.

We started with the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$ and plugged in $n = 1$ to get $f(f(f(1))) = -1$. Then we used the second equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to find that $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2(-1) + 1 = -1$.

But when we plugged in $n = 2$ into the second equation, we got $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2(-1) + 1 = -1$, which led to $f(f(2)) = -1$. But we already knew that $f(f(1)) = -1$, so $f(f(2)) = f(f(1))$. This implied that $f(2) = f(1)$, but we had already found that $f(2) = -1$ and $f(1) = -1$, so $f(2) = f(1)$ was true.

However, when we plugged $n = 1$ into the second equation to get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$, we got $f(2) = 2(-1) + 1 = -1$. But this was true, so there was no contradiction in our reasoning.

So we have found that $f(1) = -1$ and $f(2) = -1$. Now let's use the second equation again to find $f(4)$: $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2(-1) + 1 = -1$. Continuing this pattern, we can find that $f(8) = -1$, $f(16) = -1$, and so on.

Now let's consider the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. If we plug in $n = 100$, we get $f(f(f(100))) = 8(100) - 7 = 793$. But we know that $f(f(f(100))) = f(f(f(2 \cdot 50))) = f(f(2f(50))) = f(2f(f(50))) = 2f(f(f(

## QUESTION 4 - 12 
- TIME_SPENT : 986 secs

12_**Problem:** 

"Let $d(n)$ denote the number of positive integers that divide $n$ , including $1$ and $n$ . For example, $d(1)=1,d(2)=2,$ and $d(12)=6$ . (This function is known as the divisor function.) Let \[f(n)=\frac{d(n)}{\sqrt [3]n}.\] There is a unique positive integer $N$ such that $f(N)>f(n)$ for all positive integers $n\ne N$ . What is the sum of the digits of $N?$"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:
We consider the prime factorization of $n:$ \[n=\prod_{i=1}^{k}p_i^{e_i}.\] By the Multiplication Principle, we have \[d(n)=\prod_{i=1}^{k}(e_i+1).\] Now, we rewrite $f(n)$ as \[f(n)=\frac{d(n)}{\sqrt [3]n}=\frac{\prod_{i=1}^{k}(e_i+1)}{\prod_{i=1}^{k}p_i^{e_i/3}}=\prod_{i=1}^{k}\frac{e_i+1}{p_i^{{e_i}/3}}.\] As $f(n)>0$ for all positive integers $n,$ note that $f(a)>f(b)$ if and only if $f(a)^3>f(b)^3$ for all positive integers $a$ and $b.$ So, $f(n)$ is maximized if and only if \[f(n)^3=\prod_{i=1}^{k}\frac{(e_i+1)^3}{p_i^{{e_i}}}\] is maximized.
For each independent factor $\frac{(e_i+1)^3}{p_i^{e_i}}$ with a fixed prime $p_i,$ where $1\leq i\leq k,$ the denominator grows faster than the numerator, as exponential functions always grow faster than polynomial functions. Therefore, for each prime $p_i$ with $\left(p_1,p_2,p_3,p_4,\ldots\right)=\left(2,3,5,7,\ldots\right),$ we look for the nonnegative integer $e_i$ such that $\frac{(e_i+1)^3}{p_i^{e_i}}$ is a relative maximum: \[\begin{array}{c|c|c|c|c}  & & & & \\ [-2.25ex] \boldsymbol{i} & \boldsymbol{p_i} & \boldsymbol{e_i} & \boldsymbol{\dfrac{(e_i+1)^3}{p_i^{e_i}}} & \textbf{Max?} \\ [2.5ex] \hline\hline  & & & & \\ [-2ex] 1 & 2 & 0 & 1 & \\      & & 1 & 4 & \\     & & 2 & 27/4 &\\     & & 3 & 8 & \checkmark\\     & & 4 & 125/16 & \\ [0.5ex] \hline   & & & & \\ [-2ex] 2 & 3 & 0 & 1 &\\     & & 1 & 8/3 & \\     & & 2 & 3 &  \checkmark\\     & & 3 & 64/27 &  \\ [0.5ex] \hline   & & & & \\ [-2ex] 3 & 5 & 0 & 1 &  \\     & & 1 & 8/5 &  \checkmark\\     & & 2 & 27/25 & \\ [0.5ex] \hline   & & & & \\ [-2ex] 4 & 7 & 0 & 1 &  \\     & & 1 & 8/7 &  \checkmark\\     & & 2 & 27/49 & \\ [0.5ex] \hline   & & & & \\ [-2ex] \geq5 & \geq11 & 0 & 1 & \checkmark \\     & & \geq1 & \leq8/11 &   \\ [0.5ex] \end{array}\] Finally, the positive integer we seek is $N=2^3\cdot3^2\cdot5^1\cdot7^1=2520.$ The sum of its digits is $2+5+2+0=\boxed{9}.$ The answer is $\boxed{9}$

**Problem:** 

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


We are given that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. Setting $n=f(n)$ gives us $f(f(f(f(n))))=8f(n)-7$. But we also know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, so we can set these two equal to each other: $8f(n)-7=8n-7$. This simplifies to $8f(n)=8n$, so we have $f(n)=n$.

We can check that this solution works by substituting $f(n)=n$ into both equations:
For the first equation, $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ becomes $f(f(n))=8n-7$, and then $f(n)=8n-7$, which simplifies to $n=8n-7$, which is true if $n=1$.
For the second equation, $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ becomes $f(2n)=2n+1$, and substituting $f(n)=n$ gives us $2f(n)+1=2n+1$, which is also true if $f(n)=n$.

Therefore, the function $f(n)=n$ is the solution to the problem. To find $f(100)$, we simply substitute $n=100$ into $f(n)=n$ to get $f(100)=100$.
The answer is $\boxed{100}$.

**Problem:** 

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:



First, we plug in $n=1$ into the second equation to get $f(2)=2f(1)+1$.

Then, we plug in $n=f(1)$ into the second equation to get $f(2f(1))=2f(f(1))+1$.

But we know that $f(2)=2f(1)+1$, so we can substitute $f(2)$ into the above equation to get $f(f(2))=2f(1)+1$.

But we also know from the first equation that $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1$, so we can substitute $f(f(1))$ into the above equation to get $f(1)=2f(1)+1$.

This gives us $f(1)=-1$, but function values can't be negative, so we must have made a mistake.

Let's go back and re-examine the steps. The mistake is in the step where we substituted $f(f(1))$ into the equation. Actually, we know that $f(f(f(1)))=1$, so we can substitute $1$ into the equation $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7$ to get $f(f(1))=1$.

So, the correct steps are:

First, we plug in $n=1$ into the second equation to get $f(2)=2f(1)+1$.

Then, we plug in $n=f(1)$ into the second equation to get $f(2f(1))=2f(f(1))+1$.

But we know that $f(2)=2f(1)+1$, so we can substitute $f(2)$ into the above equation to get $f(f(1)+1)=2f(f(1))+1$.

But we also know that $f(f(1))=1$, so we can substitute $1$ into the above equation to get $f(2)=2(1)+1$.

So, $f(2)=3$.

Now, we can use the second equation to find $f(4)$: $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2(3)+1=7$.

Continuing this way, we find that $f(8)=15$, $f(16)=31$, and so on.

We notice a pattern: $f(2^n)=2^{n+1}-1$.

Now, we want to find $f(100)$. Since $100=2^2\cdot5^2$, we can use the second equation repeatedly to find $f(100)$:

$f(100)=2f(50)+1=2(2f(25)+1)+1=2(2(2f(12.5)+1)+1)+1=2(2(2(2f(6.25)+1)+1)+1)+1$.

Since $6.25=5^2/2^{2}$, we know that $f(6.25)=2(6.25)-1=11$, so

$f(100)=2(2(2(2(11)+1)+1)+1)+1=2(2(2(23)+1)+1)+1=2(2(47)+1)+1=2(95)+1=191$.

So, $f(100)=191$. The answer is $\boxed{191}$.
