0_**Problem:** 

"Let $P_0(x) = x^3 + 313x^2 - 77x - 8\,$ .  For integers $n \ge 1\,$ , define $P_n(x) = P_{n - 1}(x - n)\,$ .  What is the coefficient of $x\,$ in $P_{20}(x)\,$"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:
Notice the transformation of $P_{n-1}(x)\to P_n(x)$ adds $n$ to the roots. Thus, all these transformations will take the roots and add $1+2+\cdots+20=210$ to them. (Indeed, this is very easy to check in general.)
Let the roots be $r_1,r_2,r_3.$ Then $P_{20}(x)=(x-r_1-210)(x-r_2-210)(x-r_3-210).$ By Vieta's/expanding/common sense, you see the coefficient of $x$ is $(r_1+210)(r_2+210)+(r_2+210)(r_3+210)+(r_3+210)(r_1+210).$ Expanding yields $r_1r_2+r_2r_3+r_3r_1+210\cdot 2(r_1+r_2+r_3)+3\cdot 210^2.$ Using Vieta's (again) and plugging stuff in yields $-77+210\cdot 2\cdot -313+3\cdot 210^2=\boxed{763}.$ The answer is $\boxed{763}$

**Problem:** 

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So the equation
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0\]
is satisfied if either
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0\]
or
\[((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]

If $ (\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, and $(-10, 0)$.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these four equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

So the points satisfying the given equation are the vertices of two squares. The side length of the first square is 10, and the side length of the second square is 16. The area of a square is the square of the side length, so the area of the first square is $10^2 = 100$, and the area of the second square is $16^2 = 256$.

The convex polygon enclosed by the points is the union of these two squares. So the area of this convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares, which is $100 + 256 = 356$. The answer is $\boxed{356}$.

1_**Problem:** 

"Let $P_0(x) = x^3 + 313x^2 - 77x - 8\,$ .  For integers $n \ge 1\,$ , define $P_n(x) = P_{n - 1}(x - n)\,$ .  What is the coefficient of $x\,$ in $P_{20}(x)\,$"

Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
For the first equation, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, this equation is satisfied if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.
For the second equation, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, this equation is satisfied if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So we get four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.
The intersection of these lines form a square with side length $20$. Therefore, the area of the square is $20^2 = 400$. The answer is: $400$

2_**Problem:** 

"Let $P_0(x) = x^3 + 313x^2 - 77x - 8\,$ .  For integers $n \ge 1\,$ , define $P_n(x) = P_{n - 1}(x - n)\,$ .  What is the coefficient of $x\,$ in $P_{20}(x)\,$"

**Problem:** 

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


The expression $A \cdot B = 0$ is equivalent to $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. So the given equation is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The first equation is equivalent to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This is the set of points that are at a distance of 10 from the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.
The second equation is equivalent to $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This is the set of points that are at a distance of 8 from the x-axis and y-axis. This forms a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
The convex polygon formed by the intersection of these two sets of points is the smaller square, with side length 10, so the area of this polygon is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is $\boxed{100}$.

Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


The product of two quantities is zero if and only if at least one of the quantities is zero. Thus, the given equation is satisfied if at least one of the following two conditions is met:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The first condition is met if and only if both $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. These four equations give $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$, so the first condition gives us the vertices of a square with side length 20 and area $400$.
The second condition is met if and only if both $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$, so the second condition gives us the vertices of a square with side length 16 and area $256$.
Thus, the points that satisfy the given equation are the vertices of a larger square that contains a smaller square. The area of the convex polygon formed by these points is the area of the larger square minus the area of the smaller square, which is $400 - 256 = 144$. The answer is $\boxed{144}$.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:



The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is equal to zero if either of the two factors are equal to zero.

The first factor is equal to zero if $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

The second factor is equal to zero if $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

So the points that satisfy the equation are on the lines $x + y = \pm 10$, $x - y = \pm 10$, $x = \pm 8$, and $y = \pm 8$. These lines form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$

Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


First, notice that if $ab = 0$, then either $a = 0$ or $b = 0$. So the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied only when either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the lines $y = x \pm 10$ and $y = -(x \pm 10)$.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. This implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So we get the lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

These lines form a square with side length $20$. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$. So the area of the convex polygon is $400$. The answer is $\boxed{400}$.

**Problem:** 

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:



The product of two numbers is zero if and only if one or both of the numbers are zero. Therefore, the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if either of the following two equations are satisfied:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first equation to be true, it requires that both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length 10 and diagonals of length $10\sqrt{2}$.

For the second equation to be true, it requires that both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$ or $x = -8$ and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length 8 and diagonals of length $8\sqrt{2}$.

The points that satisfy the original equation are those that lie in either of these two squares. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon formed by these points is the sum of the areas of the two squares.

The area of a square with side length $a$ is $a^2$. So the area of the first square is $(10)^2 = 100$ and the area of the second square is $(8)^2 = 64$. Therefore, the total area of the convex polygon is $100 + 64 = 164$. The answer is: $164$.

Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:



Firstly, the expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ is equal to zero if and only if both $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ are true at the same time. This is only possible if $x = 0$ and $y = 0$.

Secondly, the expression $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ is only possible if both $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $-8 \leq x \leq 8$ and $-8 \leq y \leq 8$.

Therefore, the only point that satisfies both conditions is $(0,0)$, and the region that we are looking for is a square with side length $16$.

The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{256}$.
The answer is $\boxed{256}$.

8_**Problem:** 

"Let $P_0(x) = x^3 + 313x^2 - 77x - 8\,$ .  For integers $n \ge 1\,$ , define $P_n(x) = P_{n - 1}(x - n)\,$ .  What is the coefficient of $x\,$ in $P_{20}(x)\,$"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:
Notice the transformation of $P_{n-1}(x)\to P_n(x)$ adds $n$ to the roots. Thus, all these transformations will take the roots and add $1+2+\cdots+20=210$ to them. (Indeed, this is very easy to check in general.)
Let the roots be $r_1,r_2,r_3.$ Then $P_{20}(x)=(x-r_1-210)(x-r_2-210)(x-r_3-210).$ By Vieta's/expanding/common sense, you see the coefficient of $x$ is $(r_1+210)(r_2+210)+(r_2+210)(r_3+210)+(r_3+210)(r_1+210).$ Expanding yields $r_1r_2+r_2r_3+r_3r_1+210\cdot 2(r_1+r_2+r_3)+3\cdot 210^2.$ Using Vieta's (again) and plugging stuff in yields $-77+210\cdot 2\cdot -313+3\cdot 210^2=\boxed{763}.$ The answer is $\boxed{763}$

**Problem:** 

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


The expression $AB = 0$ is equivalent to $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. So the given equation is equivalent to the union of the following two equations:
1. $(|x + y| - 10)^2 + (|x - y| - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(|x| - 8)^2 + (|y| - 8)^2 = 0$
The first equation implies $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$. There are four possibilities for the pairs of absolute values:
a. $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$. Solving this system gives $x = 10$ and $y = 0$.
b. $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$. Solving this system gives $x = 0$ and $y = 10$.
c. $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$. Solving this system gives $x = 0$ and $y = -10$.
d. $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$. Solving this system gives $x = -10$ and $y = 0$.
So the first equation represents the four vertices of a rectangle with vertices at $(10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, and $(-10, 0)$.

The second equation implies $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. There are four possibilities for the pairs of absolute values:
a. $x = 8$ and $y = 8$.
b. $x = 8$ and $y = -8$.
c. $x = -8$ and $y = 8$.
d. $x = -8$ and $y = -8$.
So the second equation represents the four vertices of a square with side length 16 and vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The intersection of the two sets of points is the set of points that satisfy both equations, which is the set of vertices of the rectangle.

Therefore, the convex polygon is a rectangle with side lengths 20 and 16. The area of the rectangle is $20 \times 16 = 320$.
The answer is $\boxed{320}$.

Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ has only one solution, which is $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that all points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equation are of the form $(x, -x \pm 10)$ or $(-x \pm 10, x)$. This gives us a square with side length $20$.

Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ has only one solution, which is $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that all points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equation are of the form $(8, y)$ or $(x, 8)$ or $(-8, y)$ or $(x, -8)$. This gives us a square with side length $16$.

The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for. This polygon is also a square, and its side length is the smaller of the two side lengths, which is $8$. So the area of the convex polygon is $8^2 = 64$. The answer is: $\boxed{64}$

Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


First, we notice that the product of two expressions equals zero if and only if at least one of the expressions is zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. Solving these equations gives $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Adding these equations gives $x = \pm 10$ and subtracting gives $y = \pm 10$. So, we have the points $(\pm 10, \pm 10)$.

2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. Solving these equations gives $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So, we have the points $(\pm 8, \pm 8)$.

Now, we can plot these points on a coordinate plane and connect them to form a polygon. By observation, this polygon is a square with side length $20$. The area of a square is given by the square of the side length, so the area of this square is $20^2 = 400$. The answer is: $400$

Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


The product of two quantities is zero if and only if at least one of the quantities is zero. This gives us two separate cases to consider.

Case 1: $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$
The expression inside the parentheses is a sum of two squares and will be zero if and only if both terms are zero. That is, $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The absolute value equations translate to $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0)$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
This implies that $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which gives us $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So, the vertices of the polygon also include $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$.

Now, let's sketch the polygon. It is a square with side length $10$. To find its area, we simply square the side length: $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$

Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


The expression is equal to 0 if either the first set of absolute value expressions equals 0 or the second set of absolute value expressions equals 0. This breaks down into four cases:

1. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$.
2. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.
3. $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$.
4. $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.

For each of these cases, we can solve for $x$ and $y$:

1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ gives $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 2$.
2. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ gives $y = \pm 8$ and $x = \pm 2$.
3. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ gives $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 16$.
4. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ gives $y = \pm 8$ and $x = \pm 16$.

So the points are $(\pm 8, \pm 2)$, $(\pm 8, \pm 16)$, $(\pm 16, \pm 8)$, and the four points where the lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$ intersect. These points form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$
