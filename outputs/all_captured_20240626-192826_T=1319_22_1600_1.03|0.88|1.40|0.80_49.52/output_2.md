"Consider systems of three linear equations with unknowns $x$ $y$ , and $z$ \begin{align*} a_1 x + b_1 y + c_1 z & = 0 \\ a_2 x + b_2 y + c_2 z & = 0 \\ a_3 x + b_3 y + c_3 z & = 0 \end{align*} where each of the coefficients is either $0$ or $1$ and the system has a solution other than $x=y=z=0$ .
For example, one such system is \[\{ 1x + 1y + 0z = 0, 0x + 1y + 1z = 0, 0x + 0y + 0z = 0 \}\] with a nonzero solution of $\{x,y,z\} = \{1, -1, 1\}$ . How many such systems of equations are there?
(The equations in a system need not be distinct, and two systems containing the same equations in a
different order are considered different.)"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:
Let $M_1=\begin{bmatrix}a_1 & b_1 & c_1\end{bmatrix}, M_2=\begin{bmatrix}a_2 & b_2 & c_2\end{bmatrix},$ and $M_3=\begin{bmatrix}a_3 & b_3 & c_3\end{bmatrix}.$
We wish to count the ordered triples $(M_1,M_2,M_3)$ of row matrices. We perform casework:
There are $9+3=12$ ordered triples $(M_1,M_2,M_3).$
Similarly, for each of $M_1+M_3=M_2$ and $M_2+M_3=M_1,$ there are $12$ ordered triples $(M_1,M_2,M_3).$
In this subcase, we have $\boldsymbol{12\cdot3=36}$ ordered triples $\boldsymbol{(M_1,M_2,M_3).}$
Together, the answer is $8+168+126+36=\boxed{338}.$ The answer is $\boxed{338}$

**Problem:** 

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $2$. This is because the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a graph that is a series of V-shapes, each with a base of length $1$, so the equation $f(x) = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $2$. 

This means $\frac{1}{100} < \frac{m}{100} < \frac{2}{100}$, or $1 < m < 200$. 

Since $m$ must be a positive integer, the possible values of $m$ are the integers from $2$ to $199$. 

There are $199 - 2 + 1 = 198$ such integers. So, there are 198 positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. The answer is: $198$.

**Problem:** 

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}=1$. This is because the expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a "V" shape with the "valleys" (the points where the expression is $0$) at $x=1 \pm 2$, or $x=-1$ and $x=3$. So, the equation has $4$ distinct solutions when the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, is equal to the distance between these two valleys, which is $1$. Therefore, we must have $\frac{m}{100}=1$, which implies $m=100$. So, there is only $1$ positive integer $m$ that satisfies the condition. The answer is: $1$

**Problem:** 

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:



The equation $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $0$ and $3$. In other words, $0<\frac{m}{100}<3$, which simplifies to $0<m<300$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from $1$ to $299$. Therefore, there are $299$ positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions. The answer is: $299$

**Problem:** 

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


The expression $|x-1|-2$ takes on the value $\frac{m}{100}$ exactly four times if and only if the graph of $|x-1|-2$ has four points of intersection with the line $y=\frac{m}{100}$.  The graph of $y=|x-1|-2$ is shown below:

[asy]
unitsize(1.5 cm);

draw((-1,0)--(3,0),Arrow);
draw((0,-3)--(0,3),Arrow);

real func (real x) {
  return (abs(x - 1) - 2);
}

real xMin = -1;
real xMax = 3;
real yMin = -3;
real yMax = 3;

draw(graph(func, xMin, xMax), linewidth(1));
draw((1,-3)--(1,3), linewidth(1));
[/asy]

Thus, the line $y=\frac{m}{100}$ must fall strictly between the top and bottom parts of the graph between the points of intersection, as shown below:

[asy]
unitsize(1.5 cm);

draw((-1,0)--(3,0),Arrow);
draw((0,-3)--(0,3),Arrow);

real func (real x) {
  return (abs(x - 1) - 2);
}

real xMin = -1;
real xMax = 3;
real yMin = -3;
real yMax = 3;

draw(graph(func, xMin, xMax), linewidth(1));
draw((1,-3)--(1,3), linewidth(1));
draw((-1,1/2)--(3,1/2), linewidth(1));
[/asy]

This means $\frac{1}{2} < \frac{m}{100} < \frac{3}{2}$, which gives $50 < m < 150$.  The positive integers in this range are the integers from $51$ to $149$, inclusive.  The number of such integers is $149 - 51 + 1 = \boxed{99}$. The answer is $\boxed{99}$.

4_**Problem:** 

"Consider systems of three linear equations with unknowns $x$ $y$ , and $z$ \begin{align*} a_1 x + b_1 y + c_1 z & = 0 \\ a_2 x + b_2 y + c_2 z & = 0 \\ a_3 x + b_3 y + c_3 z & = 0 \end{align*} where each of the coefficients is either $0$ or $1$ and the system has a solution other than $x=y=z=0$ .

**Problem:** 

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}=2$, or $\frac{m}{100}=1$.
For $\frac{m}{100}=2$, we have $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=2$. This simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert -2=2$ or $\vert x-1 \vert -2=-2$. Solving these two equations gives $x-1=4$ or $x-1=0$, which gives $x=5$ or $x=1$.
For $\frac{m}{100}=1$, we have $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=1$. This simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert -2=1$ or $\vert x-1 \vert -2=-1$. Solving these two equations gives $x-1=3$ or $x-1=1$, which gives $x=4$ or $x=2$.
So the possible values of $m$ are $200$ and $100$.
The answer is $\boxed{2}$.

**Problem:** 

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


The equation $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if the equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2=\frac{m}{100}$ or $\vert x-1 \vert -2=-\frac{m}{100}$ has two solutions for each case.
For the equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2=\frac{m}{100}$, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100} + 2$.
This equation has two solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} + 2 > 0$, or $m > -200$.
Similarly, for the equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2=-\frac{m}{100}$, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
This equation has two solutions if and only if $2 - \frac{m}{100} > 0$, or $m < 200$.
Combining these two inequalities, we get $-200 < m < 200$.
The positive integers $m$ in this range are the integers from $1$ to $199$.
Therefore, there are $199$ positive integers $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions. The answer is: $199$.

**Problem:** 

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


We consider the function $f(x) = | |x - 1| - 2|$. The function $f(x)$ takes a value of $0$ only when $|x - 1| = 2$, which gives $x = 3$ or $x = -1$. This means that the graph of $f(x)$ consists of two line segments, one from $(-1, 2)$ to $(3, 2)$, and the other from $(3, 2)$ to $(5, 0)$. The graph of $f(x)$ is shown below.

[asy]
unitsize(1 cm);

draw((-1.5,0)--(5.5,0));
draw((-1.5,0)--(-1,2)--(3,2)--(5,0)--(5.5,0));
draw((-1.5,2)--(5.5,2),dashed);

dot("$(-1, 2)$", (-1,2), S);
dot("$(3, 2)$", (3,2), E);
dot("$(5, 0)$", (5,0), E);
[/asy]

We see that $f(x) = m/100$ has exactly four distinct solutions if $1 < m/100 < 2$, or $200/100 < m/100 < 202/100$. Therefore, the number of such $m$ is the number of positive integers in the interval $(100, 202)$. This interval contains $102$ positive integers. However, we must subtract $1$ from $102$ because $m$ cannot be equal to $100$ or $202$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the given equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $102 - 1 = 101$. The answer is: $101$

**Problem:** 

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is less than $2$ but greater than or equal to $0$. This is because the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a "V" shape with its minimum value at $x=1$ and its value decreasing as $x$ moves away from $1$. The value of $f(x)$ is $2$ when $x=1$, $1$ when $x$ is $1$ plus or minus $1$, and $0$ when $x$ is $1$ plus or minus $2$. So for $f(x)$ to have $4$ distinct roots, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be in the range $[0,2)$ which implies $0 \leq m < 200$.
The number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality is $199$. The answer is: $199$

8_**Problem:** 

"Consider systems of three linear equations with unknowns $x$ $y$ , and $z$ \begin{align*} a_1 x + b_1 y + c_1 z & = 0 \\ a_2 x + b_2 y + c_2 z & = 0 \\ a_3 x + b_3 y + c_3 z & = 0 \end{align*} where each of the coefficients is either $0$ or $1$ and the system has a solution other than $x=y=z=0$ .
For example, one such system is \[\{ 1x + 1y + 0z = 0, 0x + 1y + 1z = 0, 0x + 0y + 0z = 0 \}\] with a nonzero solution of $\{x,y,z\} = \{1, -1, 1\}$ . How many such systems of equations are there?
(The equations in a system need not be distinct, and two systems containing the same equations in a
different order are considered different.)"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:
Let $M_1=\begin{bmatrix}a_1 & b_1 & c_1\end{bmatrix}, M_2=\begin{bmatrix}a_2 & b_2 & c_2\end{bmatrix},$ and $M_3=\begin{bmatrix}a_3 & b_3 & c_3\end{bmatrix}.$
We wish to count the ordered triples $(M_1,M_2,M_3)$ of row matrices. We perform casework:
There are $9+3=12$ ordered triples $(M_1,M_2,M_3).$
Similarly, for each of $M_1+M_3=M_2$ and $M_2+M_3=M_1,$ there are $12$ ordered triples $(M_1,M_2,M_3).$
In this subcase, we have $\boldsymbol{12\cdot3=36}$ ordered triples $\boldsymbol{(M_1,M_2,M_3).}$
Together, the answer is $8+168+126+36=\boxed{338}.$ The answer is $\boxed{338}$

**Problem:** 

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if the number $\frac{m}{100}$ is the distance between two "knees" of the piecewise-linear function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$.

The function $f(x)$ is a piecewise-linear function with "knees" at $x= -1, 1, 3, 5$. The distance between any two consecutive knees is 2, so in order for $\frac{m}{100}$ to be the distance between two knees, $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, which implies $m=200$.

So, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions, and that is $m=200$. The answer is: $\boxed{1}$

**Problem:** 

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


The equation $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if the right side is positive and the equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2=\frac{m}{100}$ or $\vert x-1 \vert -2=-\frac{m}{100}$ has two solutions.
If $\vert x-1 \vert -2=\frac{m}{100}$, then $\vert x-1 \vert = 2+\frac{m}{100}$. The expression on the right is positive, so $x-1$ is positive and $x-1=2+\frac{m}{100}$, or $x-1= -(2+\frac{m}{100})$. This gives us two equations:
1) $x-1=2+\frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x=3+\frac{m}{100}$.
2) $x-1=-2-\frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x=-1-\frac{m}{100}$.
So if $\vert x-1 \vert -2=\frac{m}{100}$ has two solutions, then $3+\frac{m}{100} > -1-\frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $m < 100$.
If $\vert x-1 \vert -2=-\frac{m}{100}$, then $\vert x-1 \vert = 2-\frac{m}{100}$. The expression on the right is positive if $2-\frac{m}{100} > 0$, which simplifies to $m < 200$.
Therefore, the equation $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions when $0 < m < 100$. The positive integers in this range are the integers from $1$ to $99$. Therefore, there are $99$ possible values of $m$. The answer is: $99$

**Problem:** 

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


First, we consider the equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$.
This equation has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 0 and 2.
In other words, $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which implies $0 < m < 200$.
So $m$ is a positive integer between 1 and 199.
We need to count the number of such $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions.
Since $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 0 and 2, we have $0 < m < 200$.
But we also know that $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 0 and 2.
Therefore, we need to count the number of positive integers $m$ between 1 and 199 such that $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$.
Multiplying all sides of the inequality $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$ by 100 gives $0 < m < 200$.
So the number of positive integers $m$ between 1 and 199 that satisfy this inequality is 199.
However, we need to subtract the values of $m$ for which $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ does not have 4 distinct solutions.
We know that $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 0, 2, or 4 distinct solutions.
It does not have 0 or 2 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to 0 or 2.
Therefore, we need to subtract the values of $m$ for which $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to 0 or 2.
If $\frac{m}{100} = 0$, then $m = 0$, which is not a positive integer.
If $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, then $m = 200$, which is not between 1 and 199.
So there are no values of $m$ for which $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ does not have 4 distinct solutions.
Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ between 1 and 199 for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 199. The answer is: $199$.

**Problem:** 

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions when the right-hand side $\frac{m}{100}$ is positive and less than $2$. This is because the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a maximum value of $2$ and reaches this maximum value exactly twice, at $x=1 \pm 2$. Therefore, for the equation to have $4$ distinct solutions, the right-hand side must be less than $2$.

So, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Multiplying all parts of the inequality by $100$, we get $0 < m < 200$.

The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from $1$ to $199$.

Therefore, there are $199$ positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. The answer is: $199$.

**Problem:** 

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $2$.
This means that $1<\frac{m}{100}<2$, or $100<m<200$.
Since $m$ is a positive integer, the possible values for $m$ are $101, 102, \ldots, 199$.
To find the number of these values, we subtract the smallest value from the largest value and add $1$.
So the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the given condition is $199-101+1 = 99$. The answer is $\boxed{99}$.

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}=0.5$. 

This is because the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a graph which is symmetric around $x=1$, and reaches its maximum value of $2$ at $x=1$. So for $f(x)$ to have four distinct solutions, the right side of the equation must equal the maximum value of $f(x)$, which is $0.5$.

So we have $\frac{m}{100}=0.5$, which gives us $m=50$.

So there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions. The answer is: $1$

Similarly, for each of $M_1+M_3=M_2$ and $M_2+M_3=M_1,$ there are $12$ ordered triples $(M_1,M_2,M_3).$
In this subcase, we have $\boldsymbol{12\cdot3=36}$ ordered triples $\boldsymbol{(M_1,M_2,M_3).}$
Together, the answer is $8+168+126+36=\boxed{338}.$ The answer is $\boxed{338}$

**Problem:** 

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:



The equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $0$ and $2$. This is because $| |x-1|-2|$ is a "hump" function that goes from 0 to 2 and back to 0 as $x$ varies over the real numbers. The value of $m$ that makes $| |x-1|-2|$ equal to this value is the one that gives 4 distinct solutions.

So, we need $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Multiplying all parts of the inequality by $100$ gives $0 < m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are exactly the integers from $1$ to $199$. 

Therefore, there are $199$ positive integers $m$ for which the equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. The answer is: $199$.
