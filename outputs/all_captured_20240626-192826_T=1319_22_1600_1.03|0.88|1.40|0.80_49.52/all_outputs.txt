**Problem:** 

"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. So we can set $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$. Rearranging, we get $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$. Let's call this equation (1).

The distance between $A$ and $B$ is given as 6. The distance between two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ in the plane is given by $\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$. Here, $y_1 = y_2 = 4$, so the distance simplifies to $|x_2 - x_1|$. From the problem, we know $|x_2 - x_1| = 6$.

The quadratic equation (1) has two solutions $x_1$ and $x_2$, which are the $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$. From the quadratic formula, we know that $x_{1,2} = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k} = 1 \pm \sqrt{1 - \frac{l - 4}{k}}$. Since $|x_2 - x_1| = 6$, we have $2\sqrt{1 - \frac{l - 4}{k} } = 6$, which simplifies to $\sqrt{1 - \frac{l - 4}{k} } = 3$. Squaring both sides gives $1 - \frac{l - 4}{k} = 9$, or $\frac{l - 4}{k} = -8$. Solving for $l$, we get $l = 4 - 8k$.

Now, we want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. For points on the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$, this is $\sqrt{x^2 + (kx^2 - 2kx + l)^2}$. We need to find the sum of the squares of the distances for $x = x_1$ and $x = x_2$.

Let's denote $d_1 = \sqrt{x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2}$ and $d_2 = \sqrt{x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2}$. Then the sum of the squares of the distances is $d_1^2 + d_2^2$.

Using the identity $(a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2$, we can expand $(kx^2 - 2kx + l)^2$ and simplify to get
\[(kx^2 - 2kx + l)^2 = k^2x^4 - 4k^2x^3 + (4k^2 + 4l)x^2 - 4klx + l^2.\]
Substituting $l = 4 - 8k$ and simplifying, we get
\[(kx^2 - 2kx + l)^2 = k^2x^4 - 4k^2x^3 + (4k^2 + 4(4 - 8k))x^2 - 4k(4 - 8k)x + (4 - 8k)^2 = k^2x^4 - 4k^2x^3 + (16k^2 - 32k^2 + 16)x^2 - (16k - 64k^2)x + 64k^2 - 128k + 16.\]

Substituting $x = x_1$ and $x = x_2$ into the above expression and adding the results, we get a complicated expression involving $k$ and $l$. But we can simplify it by noticing that $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = (2)^2 - 2(-2k) = 4 + 4k$. Also, $x_1x_2 = \frac{2k \cdot (-2k) - (l - 4)}{2k} = -k - (4 - 8k) = -4k + 4$. Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances is
\[d_1^2 + d_2^2 = \left(k(x_1^2) - 2k(x_1) + l\right)^2 + \left(k(x_2^2) - 2k(x_2) + l\right)^2 = \left(k(4 + 4k) - 4k + 4 - 8k + 4\right)^2 + \left(k(4 + 4k) + 4k - 4 - 8k + 4\right)^2 = (4k)^2 + (-4k)^2 = 32k^2.\]

Since we know that $l = 4 - 8k$, we can substitute this into the expression for the sum of the squares of the distances to get
\[d_1^2 + d_2^2 = 32k^2.\]
This is our final answer. So the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $32k^2$.
The answer is: $32k^2$

**Problem:** 

"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


First, we need to find the $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$. Since the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$, we can set $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$. This simplifies to $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$. 

We're given that the points $A$ and $B$ are distance 6 apart, so if $x_1$ and $x_2$ are the roots of this equation, we have $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 36$, which implies $(x_2 - x_1) = 6$ or $(x_2 - x_1) = -6$. 

We can use the fact that for a quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, the sum of the roots is $-b/a$ and the product of the roots is $c/a$. In this case, the sum of the roots is $2k/k = 2$ and the product of the roots is $(l - 4)/k$. 

Now, we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(x_2 - x_1) = 6$. By the difference of roots formula, we have $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = (x_2 + x_1)^2 - 4x_1x_2 = 36$. We know that $x_2 + x_1 = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = (l - 4)/k$, so substituting these values in gives $(2)^2 - 4(l - 4)/k = 36$, or $4 - 4(l - 4)/k = 36$. Solving for $(l - 4)/k$ gives $(l - 4)/k = -8$, or $l = 4 - 8k$.

Case 2: $(x_2 - x_1) = -6$. Similar to the first case, we have $(x_2 + x_1)^2 - 4x_1x_2 = (-6)^2 = 36$. Again substituting the known values in gives $(2)^2 - 4(l - 4)/k = 36$, or $4 - 4(l - 4)/k = 36$. Solving for $(l - 4)/k$ gives $(l - 4)/k = 8$, or $l = 4 + 8k$.

Now, we want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. For point $A$, the $y$-coordinate is $4$, so the distance is $\sqrt{x_1^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{(x_1)^2 + 16}$. Similarly, for point $B$, the distance is $\sqrt{(x_2)^2 + 16}$. 

So the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $(\sqrt{(x_1)^2 + 16})^2 + (\sqrt{(x_2)^2 + 16})^2 = (x_1)^2 + 16 + (x_2)^2 + 16 = (x_1)^2 + (x_2)^2 + 32$.

We know that $(x_1 + x_2)^2 - 4x_1x_2 = (2)^2 - 4(l - 4)/k = 36$. Expanding $(x_1 + x_2)^2 = (x_1)^2 + 2x_1x_2 + (x_2)^2$, we get $(x_1)^2 + 2x_1x_2 + (x_2)^2 - 4x_1x_2 = 36$, or $(x_1)^2 - 2x_1x_2 + (x_2)^2 = 36$. This is the square of the difference of $x_1$ and $x_2$, so we have $(x_1 - x_2)^2 = 36$.

Since the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, we have $(x_1 - x_2)^2 = 6^2 = 36$, confirming our previous result.

Now we substitute $(x_1)^2 + (x_2)^2 = 36 + 4x_1x_2 = 36 + 4(l - 4)/k$. From Case 1, we have $(l - 4)/k = -8$, so substituting this in gives $(x_1)^2 + (x_2)^2 = 36 + 4(-8) = 36 - 32 = 4$.

Similarly, from Case 2, we have $(l - 4)/k = 8$, so substituting this in gives $(x_1)^2 + (x_2)^2 = 36 + 4(8) = 36 + 32 = 68$.

But since the sum of the squares of the distances must be positive, only Case 1 is valid. Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is 4. The answer is: $4$

**Problem:** 

"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:



The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. This means that the solutions of the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$ are the x-coordinates of $A$ and $B$. 

Let's call these solutions $x_1$ and $x_2$. Given that the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, we know that $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 6^2 = 36$.

By Vieta's formulas, we know that $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$. 

By the difference of squares formula, we have $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = (x_2 + x_1)^2 - 4x_1x_2$. Substituting the values we know, we get $36 = 4 - 4\frac{l - 4}{k}$. 

Simplifying, we get $36 = 4 - \frac{4l - 16}{k}$, which simplifies to $\frac{4l - 16}{k} = -32$.

Multiplying both sides by $k$, we get $4l - 16 = -32k$. 

Rearranging, we get $4l = -32k + 16$, and then $l = -8k + 4$.

Now we want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. So for points $A$ and $B$, this is $\sqrt{x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2}$ and $\sqrt{x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2}$ respectively.

But since $A$ and $B$ are on the line $y = 4$, we know that $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$ for both $x = x_1$ and $x = x_2$. So we can simplify the distances to $\sqrt{x^2 + (4 - l)^2}$.

We want to find $x_1^2 + (4 - l)^2 + x_2^2 + (4 - l)^2$. 

By Vieta's formulas, we know that $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 2^2 - 2\frac{l - 4}{k} = 4 - 2\frac{l - 4}{k}$.

Substituting $l = -8k + 4$, we get $4 - 2\frac{-8k + 4 - 4}{k} = 4 - 2\frac{-8k}{k} = 4 + 16 = 20$.

Then we add $(4 - l)^2 = (4 - (-8k + 4))^2 = (8k)^2 = 64k^2$ to get the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin: $20 + 64k^2$.

However, we know that $l = -8k + 4$, and $4 - l = 4 - (-8k + 4) = 8k$. So the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is also $20 + (8k)^2 = 20 + 64k^2$.

Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is always $20 + 64k^2$. However, we want to find the value of this expression for the given parabola and line.

Substituting $k = 1$, we get $20 + 64(1)^2 = 20 + 64 = 84$.

Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is 84. The answer is: $84$.

**Problem:** 

"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


First, we set $y = 4$ in the equation of the parabola and solve for $x$:
\[4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l.\]
Rearranging, we have
\[kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0.\]
Let $x_1$ and $x_2$ be the x-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$, respectively. Since the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, we have
\[|x_2 - x_1| = 6.\]
By the quadratic formula, the roots of the equation are
\[x = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k} = 1 \pm \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k} = 1 \pm \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}}{2k}.\]
Thus,
\[x_2 - x_1 = \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}}{k} = 6.\]
Squaring both sides, we get
\[36 = \frac{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}{k^2}.\]
Simplifying, we have
\[36k^2 = 4k^2 - 4kl + 16k.\]
Rearranging, we get
\[32k^2 = 4kl - 16k.\]
Dividing both sides by 4, we have
\[8k^2 = k^2l - 4k.\]
Rearranging, we get
\[7k^2 = k^2l - 4k.\]
Dividing both sides by $k$, we have
\[7k = kl - 4.\]
Rearranging, we get
\[kl - 7k = 4.\]
Factor out $k$, we have
\[k(l - 7) = 4.\]
Since $k$ and $l$ are both positive, we must have $l - 7 > 0$, so $l > 7$. Substituting this into the equation, we get
\[k = \frac{4}{l - 7}.\]
Now, we want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. For point $A$ with coordinates $(x_1, 4)$, the distance is $\sqrt{x_1^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{(x_1)^2 + 16}$. For point $B$ with coordinates $(x_2, 4)$, the distance is $\sqrt{x_2^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{(x_2)^2 + 16}$.

We know that $x_2 - x_1 = 6$, so $(x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 + (x_1)^2 = 36$. Adding 32 to both sides, we get $(x_2)^2 + 16 - 2x_1x_2 + (x_1)^2 + 16 = 68$. Simplifying, we have
\[(\sqrt{(x_2)^2 + 16})^2 + (\sqrt{(x_1)^2 + 16})^2 = 68.\]
Thus, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is 68.
The answer is $\boxed{68}$.

**Problem:** 

"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$ means that the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$ has two roots, which we'll call $x_1$ and $x_2$. By Vieta's formulas, we know that $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$. We also know that $|x_1 - x_2| = 6/k$. By the difference of squares, $(x_1 - x_2)^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 4x_1x_2 = 4 - 4\frac{l - 4}{k} = \frac{16}{k} - \frac{4l - 16}{k} = \frac{16 - 4l + 16}{k} = \frac{32 - 4l}{k}$.

But $(x_1 - x_2)^2 = (\frac{6}{k})^2 = \frac{36}{k^2}$, so we have $\frac{32 - 4l}{k} = \frac{36}{k^2}$. Cross-multiplying gives $32 - 4l = \frac{36}{k}$. Multiplying both sides by $k$ gives $32k - 4lk = 36$. Rearranging gives $4lk = 32k - 36$, and further rearranging gives $lk = 8k - 9$.

The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $x_1^2 + x_2^2$. By the identity $(x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = x_1^2 + x_2^2$, we have $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 4 - 2\frac{l - 4}{k} = \frac{8}{k} - \frac{2l - 8}{k} = \frac{8 - 2l + 8}{k} = \frac{16 - 2l}{k}$.

Substitute $lk = 8k - 9$ into the equation, we get $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = \frac{16 - 2(8k - 9)/k}{k} = \frac{16 - 16 + 18/k}{k} = \frac{18}{k^2}$. But $k^2 > 0$, so $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = \frac{18}{k^2} > 0$. Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $18$. The answer is: $\boxed{18}$

**Problem:** 

"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


The points of intersection of the parabola and the line $y=4$ satisfy the equation
\[4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l.\]
Rearranging, we have the quadratic equation
\[kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0.\]
Since the line $y=4$ intersects the parabola at two points $A$ and $B$, the quadratic equation has two distinct roots, which we'll call $x_1$ and $x_2$. The distance between $A$ and $B$ is given by $|x_2 - x_1| = 6/1 = 6$.

By Vieta's formulas, $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$.

The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. The square of the distance is $x^2 + y^2$.

For point $A$, which corresponds to $x_1$, its square distance to the origin is $x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2$.

For point $B$, which corresponds to $x_2$, its square distance to the origin is $x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2$.

We want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin, which is
\[(x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2) + (x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2).\]

We know that $x_1 + x_2 = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$. We can express $x_1^2 + x_2^2$ as $(x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 2^2 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = 4 - \frac{2(l - 4)}{k}$.

Also, $(kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2$ can be expanded as $2k^2(x_1^2 + x_2^2) - 8k(x_1 + x_2)(kx_1x_2) + 4l^2 - 8kl + 8k^2x_1x_2$.

Substituting the values of $x_1 + x_2$ and $x_1x_2$, we get
\[2k^2\left(4 - \frac{2(l - 4)}{k}\right) - 8k(2)\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) + 4l^2 - 8kl + 8k^2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right).\]

Simplifying, we get
\[8k^2 - 4k(l - 4) + 4l^2 - 8kl + 8k(l - 4) = 4l^2 + 8k^2 - 8kl.\]

Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $4l^2 + 8k^2 - 8kl$.

However, we know that the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, so by the distance formula, we have
\[6^2 = (x_2 - x_1)^2 + \left(k(x_2^2 - x_1^2)\right)^2.\]

This simplifies to $36 = k^2(x_2^2 + x_1^2) = k^2\left(4 - \frac{2(l - 4)}{k}\right) = 4k^2 - 2k(l - 4)$.

Solving for $l$, we get $l = 4 + \frac{36}{2k} - 2k = 4 + 18/k - 2k$.

Substituting this into the expression for the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin, we get
\[4\left(4 + \frac{18}{k} - 2k\right)^2 + 8k^2 - 8k\left(4 + \frac{18}{k} - 2k\right).\]

Simplifying, we get
\[16\left(1 + \frac{9}{k^2} - \frac{4k}{k} + 4k^2\right) + 8k^2 - 32k - 64k/k + 16k^2.\]

Simplifying further, we get
\[16 + \frac{144}{k} - 64 + 128k - 64k^2 + 8k^2 - 32k + 16k^2 = 16 + \frac{144}{k} - 64 + 144k - 64k^2.\]

Thus, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $16 + \frac{144}{k} - 64 + 144k - 64k^2 = 80 + 144k - 64k^2 + \frac{144}{k}$.

Since the value of $k$ is given in the problem, we can substitute it into the expression to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin.

After substituting $k = 1$, we get
\[80 + 144(1) - 64(1)^2 + \frac{144}{1} = 80 + 144 - 64 + 144 = 264.\]

Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is 264. The answer is: $264$

**Problem:** 

"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:



First, we set $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$. This gives us the quadratic equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$. 

Let the roots of this equation be $x_1$ and $x_2$, which represent the x-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$. By Vieta's formulas, we have $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$.

We are given that $|x_1 - x_2| = 6/k$. By the difference of squares, we have $(x_1 - x_2)^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 4x_1x_2 = \left(\frac{6}{k}\right)^2$. Substituting $x_1 + x_2 = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$, we get $4 - 4\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = \frac{36}{k^2}$. Simplifying gives $4 - \frac{4l - 16}{k} = \frac{36}{k^2}$, or $4k - \frac{4l - 16}{k} = \frac{36}{k^2}$. Multiplying through by $k^2$ gives $4k^3 - (4l - 16)k = 36$.

The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. Since $y = 4$, the distance from a point on the parabola to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + 16}$. The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is thus $(x_1^2 + 16) + (x_2^2 + 16) = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32$.

We know that $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 2^2 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = 4 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = 4 - \frac{2l - 8}{k}$.

Substituting $4 - \frac{2l - 8}{k} = x_1^2 + x_2^2$, we get the sum of the squares of the distances as $4 - \frac{2l - 8}{k} + 32 = 36 - \frac{2l - 8}{k}$.

Substituting $4k - \frac{4l - 16}{k} = 36$, we get $4k - \frac{4l - 16}{k} + \frac{2l - 8}{k} = 36$, or $4k + \frac{8}{k} = 36$.

Multiplying through by $k$ gives $4k^2 + 8 = 36k$, or $4k^2 - 36k + 8 = 0$.

This quadratic equation does not factor nicely, so we can use the quadratic formula to find $k$. We have $k = \frac{36 \pm \sqrt{36^2 - 4 \cdot 4 \cdot 8}}{2 \cdot 4} = \frac{36 \pm \sqrt{1296 - 128}}{8} = \frac{36 \pm \sqrt{1168}}{8} = \frac{36 \pm 4\sqrt{29}}{8} = \frac{9 \pm \sqrt{29}}{2}$.

We take the positive solution $k = \frac{9 + \sqrt{29}}{2}$, as negative values of $k$ do not make sense in this context.

Substituting $k = \frac{9 + \sqrt{29}}{2}$ into $4k + \frac{8}{k} = 36$, we get $4\left(\frac{9 + \sqrt{29}}{2}\right) + \frac{8}{\frac{9 + \sqrt{29}}{2}} = 36$. Simplifying gives $18 + 2\sqrt{29} + \frac{16}{9 + \sqrt{29}} = 36$. Multiplying through by $9 + \sqrt{29}$ gives $18(9 + \sqrt{29}) + 2\sqrt{29}(9 + \sqrt{29}) + 16 = 36(9 + \sqrt{29})$. Simplifying gives $162 + 18\sqrt{29} + 18\sqrt{29} + 2\cdot 29 + 16 = 324 + 36\sqrt{29}$, or $208 + 36\sqrt{29} = 324 + 36\sqrt{29}$. This equation is satisfied.

Substituting $k = \frac{9 + \sqrt{29}}{2}$ into $\frac{2l - 8}{k} = -4$, we get $\frac{2l - 8}{\frac{9 + \sqrt{29}}{2}} = -4$. Multiplying through by $\frac{9 + \sqrt{29}}{2}$ gives $2l - 8 = -4\left(\frac{9 + \sqrt{29}}{2}\right)$. Simplifying gives $2l - 8 = -18 - 2\sqrt{29}$, or $2l = -10 - 2\sqrt{29}$.

Dividing by 2 gives $l = -5 - \sqrt{29}$.

Substituting $k = \frac{9 + \sqrt{29}}{2}$ and $l = -5 - \sqrt{29}$ into $4k^2 - 36k + 8 = 0$, we get $4\left(\frac{9 + \sqrt{29}}{2}\right)^2 - 36\left(\frac{9 + \sqrt{29}}{2}\right) + 8 = 0$. Simplifying gives $4\left(\frac{81 + 18\sqrt{29} + 29}{4}\right) - 36\left(\frac{9 + \sqrt{29}}{2}\right) + 8 = 0$, or $81 + 18\sqrt{29} + 29 - 162 - 36\sqrt{29} + 8 = 0$. This equation is also satisfied.

Substituting $k = \frac{9 + \sqrt{29}}{2}$ and $l = -5 - \sqrt{29}$ into

**Problem:** 

"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:



First, we know that the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. So we set $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$ and we get the quadratic equation $kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0$. This equation has two roots, which are the x-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$.

We're given that the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6. By the quadratic formula, the distance between the roots of a quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ is given by $\frac{\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{a}$. So in our case, we have $\frac{\sqrt{(-2k)^2 - 4*k*(l - 4)}}{k} = 6$, which simplifies to $\sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(l - 4)} = 6k$. Squaring both sides gives $4k^2 - 4k(l - 4) = 36k^2$, or $32k^2 = 4k(l - 4)$, or $8k = l - 4$, so $l = 8k + 4$.

Now we want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. For point $A$ (or $B$), its coordinates are $(x, kx^2 - 2kx + l)$, so the square of the distance to the origin is $x^2 + (kx^2 - 2kx + l)^2$.

We know that the x-coordinates of $A$ and $B$ are the roots of the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0$, so by Vieta's formulas, their sum is $\frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and their product is $\frac{l - 4}{k} = \frac{8k + 4 - 4}{k} = 8$.

Let $d_A^2$ and $d_B^2$ be the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin respectively. Then we have
\[d_A^2 + d_B^2 = (x_A^2 + (kx_A^2 - 2kx_A + l)^2) + (x_B^2 + (kx_B^2 - 2kx_B + l)^2).\]
By Vieta's formulas, $x_A^2 + x_B^2 = (\text{sum of roots})^2 - 2 \cdot \text{product of roots} = 2^2 - 2 \cdot 8 = 4 - 16 = -12$.

Also, $(kx_A^2 - 2kx_A + l)^2 + (kx_B^2 - 2kx_B + l)^2 = [(k(x_A + x_B)^2 - 2k(x_A + x_B) + 2l)^2]$.
Since $x_A + x_B = 2$ and $x_A x_B = 8$, this simplifies to $[k(2)^2 - 2k(2) + 2(8k + 4)]^2 = (4k - 4k + 16k + 8)^2 = (16k + 8)^2$.

Therefore, $d_A^2 + d_B^2 = (-12) + (16k + 8)^2$. We know that $k > 0$, so $16k + 8 > 0$. Therefore, $d_A^2 + d_B^2 = (-12) + (16k + 8)^2 > (-12)$, which means the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is greater than 12.

Now we can use the fact that $l = 8k + 4$. We substitute $l = 8k + 4$ into the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0$ to get $kx^2 - 2kx + (8k) = 0$, or $kx^2 - 2kx + 8k = 0$. This is a quadratic equation with a = k, b = -2k, and c = 8k. We know that its discriminant should be greater than or equal to 0, so $(-2k)^2 - 4*k*8k \geq 0$, or $4k^2 - 32k^2 \geq 0$, or $-28k^2 \geq 0$. This inequality is not true for $k > 0$. Therefore, there must have been a mistake in our calculation.

Let's go back and check our work. We found that $l = 8k + 4$, so we substitute this into the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0$ to get $kx^2 - 2kx + (8k) = 0$, or $kx^2 - 2kx + 8k = 0$. The discriminant of this equation is $(-2k)^2 - 4*k*8k = 4k^2 - 32k^2 = -28k^2$. The discriminant should be greater than or equal to 0, but we got a negative value. This means we made a mistake in our calculation.

Let's retrace our steps and find the mistake. In the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0$, we set $l = 8k + 4$. But in the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0$, we want to solve for $l$, not substitute $l$ into the equation. Let's set the equation to 0 again and solve for $l$:
\[kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0.\]
Rearranging terms, we have $kx^2 - 2kx + 4 = l$. Now let's set $l = 8k + 4$:
\[kx^2 - 2kx + 4 = 8k + 4.\]
Simplifying, we get $kx^2 - 2kx = 8k$. Dividing both sides by $k$ (since $k > 0$), we get $x^2 - 2x = 8$. Rearranging terms, we have $x^2 - 2x - 8 = 0$. This is a quadratic equation, and we can solve it using the quadratic formula:
\[x = \frac{-(-2) \pm \sqrt{(-2)^2 - 4*1*(-8)}}{2*1} = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt

Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


First, we solve the equation $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$ to find the $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$. We get the quadratic equation $kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0$. Let's call the roots of this equation $x_1$ and $x_2$, which represent the $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$ respectively. We are given that $|x_1 - x_2| = 6/k$, so we have $(x_1 - x_2)^2 = \left(\frac{6}{k}\right)^2 = \frac{36}{k^2}$.

Now, we know that $(x_1 - x_2)^2 = (x_1^2 + x_2^2 - 2x_1x_2) = \frac{36}{k^2}$.
By Vieta's formulas, we know that $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$.
So we have $4 - 2\frac{l - 4}{k} = \frac{36}{k^2}$, or $4k^2 - 2(l - 4)k = 36$.

Now, we want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. This is simply $x_1^2 + x_2^2$. We know that $(x_1^2 + x_2^2) = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 4^2 - 2\frac{l - 4}{k} = 16 - 2(l - 4)/k$.

Substituting $4k^2 - 2(l - 4)k = 36$ into this equation gives $16 - 2(l - 4)/k = 16 - \frac{36}{k^2} = 16 - \frac{36}{k^2}$.

Now, substituting $4k^2 - 2(l - 4)k = 36$ again, we get $16 - \frac{36}{k^2} = 16 - \frac{36}{4} = 4$.

Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is 4. The answer is: $4$

9_**Problem:** 

"Let $w_1, w_2, \dots, w_n$ be complex numbers .  A line $L$ in the complex plane is called a mean line for the points $w_1, w_2, \dots, w_n$ if $L$ contains points (complex numbers) $z_1, z_2, \dots, z_n$ such that \[\sum_{k = 1}^n (z_k - w_k) = 0.\] For the numbers $w_1 = 32 + 170i$ $w_2 = - 7 + 64i$ $w_3 = - 9 + 200i$ $w_4 = 1 + 27i$ , and $w_5 = - 14 + 43i$ , there is a unique mean line with $y$ -intercept 3.  Find the slope of this mean line."
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:
We know that
$\sum_{k=1}^5 w_k = 3 + 504i$
And because the sum of the 5 $z$ 's must cancel this out,
$\sum_{k=1}^5 z_k = 3 + 504i$
We write the numbers in the form $a + bi$ and we know that
$\sum_{k=1}^5 a_k = 3$ and $\sum_{k=1}^5 b_k = 504$
The line is of equation $y=mx+3$ . Substituting in the polar coordinates, we have $b_k = ma_k + 3$
Summing all 5 of the equations given for each $k$ , we get
$504 =  3m + 15$
Solving for $m$ , the slope, we get $\boxed{163}$ The answer is $\boxed{163}$

**Problem:** 

"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


First, we need to find the $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$.
The equation of the line $y = 4$ intersects the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ gives us $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$.
Let's call the roots of this equation $x_1$ and $x_2$ (corresponding to $A$ and $B$), then by Vieta's formulas, $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$.
Since $A$ and $B$ are distance 6 apart, we can use the distance formula to get $(x_1 - x_2)^2 = 36$, which simplifies to $(x_1 + x_2)^2 - 4x_1x_2 = 36$. Substituting in the values from Vieta's formulas gives $4 - \frac{4(l - 4)}{k} = 36$, which simplifies to $4k - 4l + 16 = 36k$, or $32 = 36k - 4l$.
Now, we want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. For point $A$, this is $\sqrt{x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2}$. We can simplify this to $\sqrt{(x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2)} = \sqrt{(1 + k^2)x_1^4 - 4k(1 + k)x_1^3 + (4k^2 + 4kl - 4l)x_1^2 + (-4k^2l + 4kl^2)x_1 + l^2}$. Similarly, the distance from $B$ is $\sqrt{(1 + k^2)x_2^4 - 4k(1 + k)x_2^3 + (4k^2 + 4kl - 4l)x_2^2 + (-4k^2l + 4kl^2)x_2 + l^2}$.
The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is therefore
\[((1 + k^2)x_1^4 - 4k(1 + k)x_1^3 + (4k^2 + 4kl - 4l)x_1^2 + (-4k^2l + 4kl^2)x_1 + l^2) + ((1 + k^2)x_2^4 - 4k(1 + k)x_2^3 + (4k^2 + 4kl - 4l)x_2^2 + (-4k^2l + 4kl^2)x_2 + l^2).\]
Since $x_1$ and $x_2$ are roots of the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$, we can substitute $x = x_1$ or $x = x_2$ into this expression and simplify to obtain a constant value. In this case, we find that the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $8l$.
We can use the equation $32 = 36k - 4l$ to express $l$ in terms of $k$: $l = 9k - 8$.
Substituting this into the equation for the sum of squares of distances, we get $8l = 8(9k - 8) = 72k - 64$.
Finally, substituting $l = 9k - 8$ into the equation $32 = 36k - 4l$, we get $32 = 36k - 4(9k - 8)$, which simplifies to $32 = 36k - 36k + 32$, so $k$ can be any positive value.
Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $72k - 64$. Since $k$ can be any positive value, we can let $k = 1$ to get the minimum value of the sum of squares of distances. Substituting $k = 1$ into $72k - 64$ gives $72 - 64 = 8$. Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is 8.
The answer is: $8$

**Problem:** 

"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


First, let's find the x-coordinates of points A and B by setting the y-coordinate of the parabola equal to 4:
\[4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l.\]
Rearranging, we get
\[kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0.\]
This is a quadratic equation, and we know that the solutions are the x-coordinates of points A and B. Let's call these x-coordinates $x_1$ and $x_2$. By the quadratic formula, we have
\[x = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{(2k)^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k} = 1 \pm \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k} = 1 \pm \sqrt{1 - \frac{l - 4}{k}}.\]
We are given that the distance between A and B is 6, so
\[|x_2 - x_1| = 6 \implies 2\sqrt{1 - \frac{l - 4}{k}} = 6 \implies \sqrt{1 - \frac{l - 4}{k}} = 3.\]
Squaring both sides, we get
\[1 - \frac{l - 4}{k} = 9 \implies \frac{l - 4}{k} = -8 \implies l - 4 = -8k \implies l = 4 - 8k.\]
Now, let's find the distances from A and B to the origin. The coordinates of A and B are $(x_1, 4)$ and $(x_2, 4)$ respectively, so the distances are $\sqrt{x_1^2 + 4^2}$ and $\sqrt{x_2^2 + 4^2}$. The sum of the squares of these distances is
\[x_1^2 + 16 + x_2^2 + 16 = (x_1^2 + x_2^2) + 32.\]
By the distance formula, $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = \left(2 + \frac{2\sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{k}\right)^2 - 2\left(1 + \sqrt{1 - \frac{l - 4}{k}}\right)\left(1 - \sqrt{1 - \frac{l - 4}{k}}\right) = \left(2 + \frac{12}{k}\right)^2 - 2(2) = \left(\frac{2k + 12}{k}\right)^2 - 4$.
Substituting $l = 4 - 8k$, we get
\[x_1^2 + x_2^2 = \left(\frac{2k + 12}{k}\right)^2 - 4 = \frac{4k^2 + 48k + 144}{k^2} - 4 = \frac{4k^2 + 48k + 144 - 4k^2}{k^2} = \frac{48k + 144}{k^2}.\]
Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from A and B to the origin is
\[(x_1^2 + x_2^2) + 32 = \frac{48k + 144}{k^2} + 32 = \frac{48k + 144 + 32k^2}{k^2} = \frac{32k^2 + 48k + 144}{k^2} = 32 + \frac{48}{k} + \frac{144}{k^2}.\]
Since $k > 0$, the minimum value of this expression occurs when $k = 1$, so the minimum value is
\[32 + 48 + 144 = 224.\]
Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from A and B to the origin is 224. The answer is: $224$

0_**Problem:** 

"The data set $[6, 19, 33, 33, 39, 41, 41, 43, 51, 57]$ has median $Q_2 = 40$ , first quartile $Q_1 = 33$ , and third quartile $Q_3 = 43$ . An outlier in a data set is a value that is more than $1.5$ times the interquartile range below the first quartle ( $Q_1$ ) or more than $1.5$ times the interquartile range above the third quartile ( $Q_3$ ), where the interquartile range is defined as $Q_3 - Q_1$ . How many outliers does this data set have?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:
The interquartile range is defined as $Q3 - Q1$ , which is $43 - 33 = 10$ $1.5$ times this value is $15$ , so all values more than $15$ below $Q1$ $33 - 15 = 18$ is an outlier. The only one that fits this is $6$ . All values more than $15$ above $Q3 = 43 + 15 = 58$ are also outliers, of which there are none so there is only $\boxed{1}$ outlier in total. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Problem:** 

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:



The expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ can be written as $(5x^2-8xy+5y^2)$, which is a complete square: $(x^2-2xy+y^2) + 4(x^2-2xy+y^2) = (x-y)^2 + 4(x-y)^2 = 5(x-y)^2$.

So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0, which occurs when $x=y$.

Now, let's solve the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. Since $x=y$ is a solution, we substitute $x=y$ into the equation to get $|x-2x| + |x-2x| = 40$, which simplifies to $|-x| + |-x| = 40$, or $2|-x| = 40$. This further simplifies to $|-x| = 20$, which gives us $x = \pm 20$.

So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ occurs when $x=y=\pm 20$, and plugging $x=y=20$ into the expression gives $5(20)^2 - 8(20)^2 + 5(20)^2 = 0$. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0. The answer is: $0$

**Problem:** 

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


The given equation is $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. By the triangle inequality, $|a| + |b| \ge |a+b|$, so we have $|x-2y| + |y-2x| \ge |(x-2y) + (y-2x)| = |-x - y| = |-(x+y)| = |x+y|$. Therefore, we have $|x+y| = 40$.
Now, let's consider the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite it as $5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x+y)^2 - 2xy] - 8xy = 5(x+y)^2 - 18xy$. We know that $|x+y| = 40$, so $(x+y)^2 = 1600$.
Now we just need to minimize $-18xy$ subject to the constraint that $-1600 \le xy \le 1600$.
By the Trivial Inequality, $xy \le \left(\frac{x+y}{2}\right)^2 = 1600$, so $-18xy \ge -18 \cdot 1600 = -28800$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $5 \cdot 1600 - 28800 = 8000 - 28800 = -20800$. The answer is: $\boxed{-20800}$.

**Problem:** 

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:



First, we need to solve the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. We can use the property $|a| + |b| = |a+b|$ to rewrite the equation as $|x - 2y - y + 2x| = 40$, which simplifies to $|3x - 3y| = 40$, or $|x - y| = \frac{40}{3}$.

Now, we need to minimize the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ subject to the constraint $|x - y| = \frac{40}{3}$.

Notice that $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = 5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x - y)^2 + 2xy] - 8xy = 5(x - y)^2 + 3xy$.

By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, $(1 + 4)(x - y)^2 \geq (x - y)^2 + 4xy^2$, so $5(x - y)^2 \geq 3xy$.

Therefore, $5(x - y)^2 + 3xy \geq 3xy$.

Under the constraint $|x - y| = \frac{40}{3}$, the minimum value of $3xy$ is achieved when $x = y = \frac{20}{3}$ (you can verify this by taking the partial derivatives of $3xy$ with respect to $x$ and $y$ and setting them to zero). In this case, $3xy = 3 \cdot \frac{20}{3} \cdot \frac{20}{3} = \frac{400}{3}$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is $\frac{400}{3}$. The answer is: $\boxed{\frac{400}{3}}$

**Problem:** 

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:



The expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ can be written as $5(x^2+y^2)-8xy = 5[(x-y)^2 + 2xy] - 8xy = 5(x-y)^2 - 3xy$.

The expression $|x-2y| + |y-2x|$ can be rewritten as $|2y - x| + |2x - y| = |(2y - x) - (2x - y)| = |y - 3x|$.

We are given that $|y - 3x| = 40$. This means that $y - 3x = 40$ or $y - 3x = -40$.

If $y - 3x = 40$, then $y = 3x + 40$. Substituting this into the expression $5(x-y)^2 - 3xy$ gives $5(x - (3x + 40))^2 - 3x(3x + 40) = 5(-2x - 40)^2 - 9x^2 - 120x = 20x^2 + 400x + 1600 - 9x^2 - 120x = 11x^2 + 280x + 1600$.

If $y - 3x = -40$, then $y = 3x - 40$. Substituting this into the expression $5(x-y)^2 - 3xy$ gives $5(x - (3x - 40))^2 - 3x(3x - 40) = 5(-2x + 40)^2 - 9x^2 + 120x = 20x^2 - 400x + 1600 - 9x^2 + 120x = 11x^2 - 280x + 1600$.

Both of these expressions are of the form $ax^2 + bx + c$, where $a > 0$. This means that they both represent parabolas opening upwards, and thus have a minimum value. The minimum value occurs at the vertex of the parabola. The $x$-coordinate of the vertex of a parabola $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ is given by $-\frac{b}{2a}$. 

For the first expression, the $x$-coordinate of the vertex is $-\frac{280}{2*11} = -\frac{140}{11}$. For the second expression, the $x$-coordinate of the vertex is $\frac{280}{2*11} = \frac{140}{11}$.

Substituting these values back into the expressions gives the minimum value of the first expression as $11\left(-\frac{140}{11}\right)^2 + 280\left(-\frac{140}{11}\right) + 1600 = -\frac{78400}{11} + \frac{39200}{11} + 1600 = -\frac{39200}{11} + 1600 = -\frac{23200}{11}$, and the minimum value of the second expression as $11\left(\frac{140}{11}\right)^2 - 280\left(\frac{140}{11}\right) + 1600 = \frac{78400}{11} - \frac{39200}{11} + 1600 = \frac{39200}{11} + 1600 = \frac{23200}{11}$.

Since $-\frac{23200}{11} < \frac{23200}{11}$, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $-\frac{23200}{11}$.

However, this is not possible, because the minimum value of a parabola $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ with $a > 0$ is $c$, not any value less than $c$. So, we must have made a mistake in our calculations.

Let's go back and check our work. We found that the minimum value of the expression $5(x-y)^2 - 3xy$ occurs at $x = -\frac{140}{11}$ and $y = 3\left(-\frac{140}{11}\right) + 40 = -\frac{420}{11} + \frac{440}{11} = \frac{20}{11}$.

Substituting these values into the expression $5(x-y)^2 - 3xy$ gives $5\left(-\frac{140}{11} - \frac{20}{11}\right)^2 - 3\left(-\frac{140}{11}\right)\left(\frac{20}{11}\right) = 5\left(-\frac{160}{11}\right)^2 - 3\left(-\frac{2800}{121}\right) = \frac{5 \cdot 25600}{121} + \frac{8400}{121} = \frac{128000}{121} + \frac{8400}{121} = \frac{136400}{121}$.

This is still not the correct answer. Let's re-examine our work.

When we set up the equations $y - 3x = 40$ and $y - 3x = -40$, we assumed that the minimum value of the expression $5(x-y)^2 - 3xy$ occurs at the same $x$ value for both cases. However, this is not necessarily true. The minimum value of the expression $5(x-y)^2 - 3xy$ occurs at the $x$ value that minimizes each of the two cases individually, and we need to find the minimum of these two cases.

Let's consider the case $y - 3x = 40$. Substituting $y = 3x + 40$ into the expression $5(x-y)^2 - 3xy$ gives $5(x - (3x + 40))^2 - 3x(3x + 40) = 5(-2x - 40)^2 - 9x^2 - 120x = 20x^2 + 400x + 1600 - 9x^2 - 120x = 11x^2 + 280x + 1600$. The minimum value of this expression occurs at $x = -\frac{280}{2*11} = -\frac

## QUESTION 1 - 4 
- TIME_SPENT : 326 secs

4_**Problem:** 

"The data set $[6, 19, 33, 33, 39, 41, 41, 43, 51, 57]$ has median $Q_2 = 40$ , first quartile $Q_1 = 33$ , and third quartile $Q_3 = 43$ . An outlier in a data set is a value that is more than $1.5$ times the interquartile range below the first quartle ( $Q_1$ ) or more than $1.5$ times the interquartile range above the third quartile ( $Q_3$ ), where the interquartile range is defined as $Q_3 - Q_1$ . How many outliers does this data set have?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:
The interquartile range is defined as $Q3 - Q1$ , which is $43 - 33 = 10$ $1.5$ times this value is $15$ , so all values more than $15$ below $Q1$ $33 - 15 = 18$ is an outlier. The only one that fits this is $6$ . All values more than $15$ above $Q3 = 43 + 15 = 58$ are also outliers, of which there are none so there is only $\boxed{1}$ outlier in total. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Problem:** 

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


First, we notice that the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ can be rewritten as $5(x^2-y^2)-4xy$, which is equivalent to $(5x^2-8xy+5y^2)$, or $(5x^2-2*4xy+4y^2)+y^2$, which can be further simplified to $(5x-4y)^2+y^2$.
Now, we know that $(5x-4y)^2 \geq 0$ and $y^2 \geq 0$, so the minimum value of $(5x-4y)^2+y^2$ is $0$, which occurs when $(5x-4y)^2=0$ and $y^2=0$.
Solving the equation $(5x-4y)^2=0$, we get $5x-4y=0$, or $5x=4y$.
Similarly, solving the equation $y^2=0$, we get $y=0$.
Substituting $y=0$ into $5x=4y$, we get $5x=0$, or $x=0$.
Therefore, the minimum value occurs when $x=0$ and $y=0$.
Substituting these values back into the original equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we get $|0-2*0| + |0-2*0| = 0$, which does not equal $40$.
However, we notice that when $x=2y$, the equation simplifies to $|-x| + |-x| = 40$, or $2|-x| = 40$.
Dividing both sides by $2$, we get $|-x| = 20$, so $x = \pm 20$.
Similarly, when $y=2x$, the equation simplifies to $|x-4x| + |4x-x| = 40$, or $|-3x| + |3x| = 40$, which also equals $40$.
Therefore, the values of $x$ and $y$ that satisfy the given equation are $x=2y$ or $y=2x$.
Now, let's substitute these values back into the expression $(5x-4y)^2+y^2$.
If $x=2y$, we get $(5(2y)-4y)^2+(2y)^2 = (10y-4y)^2+4y^2 = (6y)^2+4y^2 = 36y^2+4y^2 = 40y^2$.
If $y=2x$, we get $(5x-4(2x))^2+(2x)^2 = (5x-8x)^2+4x^2 = (-3x)^2+4x^2 = 9x^2+4x^2 = 13x^2$.
Since we are looking for the minimum value of the expression, we want to find the minimum value of $40y^2$ and $13x^2$.
The minimum value of $40y^2$ and $13x^2$ is $0$, which occurs when $x=0$ and $y=0$.
However, this is not a valid solution as it does not satisfy the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
We must therefore consider the other possibilities for $x$ and $y$.
If $x=2y$, we can substitute $x=2y$ into the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ to get $|-2y-2y| + |y-4y| = 40$, or $|-4y| + |-3y| = 40$.
Simplifying, we get $4|-y| + 3|-y| = 40$, or $7|-y| = 40$, so $|-y| = \frac{40}{7}$.
Since $y$ can be positive or negative, we have $y = \pm \frac{40}{7}$.
Substituting $y = \frac{40}{7}$ into $x=2y$, we get $x = 2*\frac{40}{7} = \frac{80}{7}$.
Similarly, substituting $y = -\frac{40}{7}$ into $x=2y$, we get $x = 2*-\frac{40}{7} = -\frac{80}{7}$.
Therefore, the pairs of $(x,y)$ that satisfy the given equation are $(\frac{80}{7},\frac{40}{7})$ and $(-\frac{80}{7},-\frac{40}{7})$.
Substituting these values into the expression $(5x-4y)^2+y^2$, we get
$(5(\frac{80}{7})-4(\frac{40}{7}))^2+(\frac{40}{7})^2 = (\frac{400}{7}-\frac{160}{7})^2 + (\frac{1600}{49}) = (\frac{240}{7})^2 + \frac{1600}{49} = \frac{57600}{49} + \frac{1600}{49} = \frac{59200}{49}$.
If $y=2x$, we can substitute $y=2x$ into the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ to get $|x-4x| + |2x-x| = 40$, or $|-3x| + |x| = 40$.
Simplifying, we get $3|-x| + |-x| = 40$, or $4|-x| = 40$, so $|-x| = 10$.
Since $x$ can be positive or negative, we have $x = \pm 10$.
Substituting $x = 10$ into $y=2x$, we get $y = 2*10 = 20$.
Similarly, substituting $x = -10$ into $y=2x$, we get $y = 2*(-10) = -20$.
Therefore, the pairs of $(x,y)$ that satisfy the given equation are $(10,20)$ and $(-10,-20)$.
Substituting these values into the expression $(5x-4y)^2+y^2$, we get
$(5(10)-4(20))^2+(20)^2 = (50-80)^2 + 400 = (-30)^2 + 400 = 900 + 400 = 1300$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\frac{59200}{49}$ when $x=\frac{80}{7}$ and $y=\frac{40}{7}$, or $1300$ when $x=10$

**Problem:** 

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:



First, we can rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $5(x^2-y^2)-8xy+10y^2 = 5[(x-y)^2-3y^2]-8xy+10y^2$.

Now, let's focus on the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. By the triangle inequality, we know that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 2|x-y|$, so $2|x-y| = 40$ or $|x-y| = 20$.

We can rewrite $|x-y|$ as $(x-y)^2 = 400$. Expanding this gives $x^2 - 2xy + y^2 = 400$.

Now, let's substitute this into our expression $5[(x-y)^2-3y^2]-8xy+10y^2$. We get:

$$5[400-3y^2]-8xy+10y^2 = 2000 - 15y^2 - 8xy + 10y^2 = 2000 - 5y^2 - 8xy.$$

Now we need to minimize this expression. We can use the inequality $2ab \leq a^2 + b^2$ (which is just the square of the difference), which gives $2(-8xy) \leq (400) + (y^2)$, or $-16xy \leq 400 + y^2$. Rearranging terms gives $-16xy - y^2 \leq 400$, or $-(16xy + y^2) \leq 400$, or $y^2 + 16xy \geq -400$.

Now, we add $5y^2$ to both sides: $y^2 + 16xy + 5y^2 \geq -400 + 5y^2$, or $(1 + 16 + 5)y^2 \geq -400$, or $22y^2 \geq -400$. Dividing both sides by 22 gives $y^2 \geq -\frac{400}{22} = -\frac{200}{11}$. But $y^2$ is always nonnegative, so this inequality is always true.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is achieved when equality holds in the inequality $y^2 + 16xy \geq -400$, which is when $y = 0$.

Substituting $y = 0$ into the constraint gives $|x-0| + |0-2x| = 40$, or $|x| + |2x| = 40$. This simplifies to $3|x| = 40$, so $|x| = \frac{40}{3}$.

But $x$ can't be both positive and negative at the same time, so we must have $x = -\frac{40}{3}$.

Now, we substitute $x = -\frac{40}{3}$ and $y = 0$ into our expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get $5\left(-\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 + 5(0)^2 - 8\left(-\frac{40}{3}\right)(0) = 5\cdot\frac{1600}{9} = \frac{8000}{9}$.

So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $\frac{8000}{9}$. The answer is: $\boxed{\frac{8000}{9}}$.

**Problem:** 

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:



The given condition is $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. This can be rewritten as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$, and then as $|x-2y| - |2y-x| = 40$.

By the property of absolute values, we have $|a| - |b| = |a-b|$, so the equation becomes $|(x-2y) - (2y-x)| = 40$. Simplifying the left side gives $|-4y| = 40$, which means $4|y| = 40$. So $|y| = 10$, which implies $y = 10$ or $y = -10$.

Now we substitute these values into the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$:

1. If $y = 10$, then the equation becomes $|x-20| + |10-2x| = 40$. By considering the cases when $x \geq 20$ and $x < 20$, we can solve this equation and get $x = 10$ or $x = 30$.
2. If $y = -10$, then the equation becomes $|x+20| + |-10-2x| = 40$. By considering the cases when $x \geq -20$ and $x < -20$, we can solve this equation and get $x = -10$ or $x = -30$.

So the possible pairs of $(x, y)$ are $(10, 10)$, $(30, 10)$, $(-10, -10)$, and $(-30, -10)$.

Now we substitute these pairs into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:

1. For $(10, 10)$, the value is $5*10^2 + 5*10^2 - 8*10*10 = 500 + 500 - 800 = 200$.
2. For $(30, 10)$, the value is $5*30^2 + 5*10^2 - 8*30*10 = 4500 + 500 - 2400 = 2600$.
3. For $(-10, -10)$, the value is $5*(-10)^2 + 5*(-10)^2 - 8*(-10)*(-10) = 500 + 500 - 800 = 200$.
4. For $(-30, -10)$, the value is $5*(-30)^2 + 5*(-10)^2 - 8*(-30)*(-10) = 4500 + 500 - 2400 = 2600$.

The minimum value is $200$. The answer is: $200$.

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:



First, we notice that the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ can be written as $\frac{1}{2}((x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2)$. This is because
\[(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2 = x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2 + y^2 - 4xy + 4x^2 = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy.\]

Now, we are given that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. Using the identity $|a| + |b| = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$, we can rewrite the given equation as $\sqrt{(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2} = 40$.

So, we have $\frac{1}{2}((x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2) = 40^2/2 = 800$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 800.
The answer is: $800$.

**Problem:** 

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


We start by expanding the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
\[5x^2+5y^2-8xy = \frac{1}{2}((x-2y)^2+(y-2x)^2)\]
Now, we are given that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, and we know that $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$ for all real numbers $a$ and $b$. Therefore, we have:
\[|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |(x-2y)+(y-2x)| = |x-2y-y+2x| = |3x-3y| = 3|x-y| = 40.\]
So we have $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$.
Now, let's substitute this back into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
\[5x^2+5y^2-8xy = \frac{1}{2}((x-2y)^2+(y-2x)^2) = \frac{1}{2}(|x-2y|^2 + |y-2x|^2).\]
Using the fact that $|a|^2 = a^2$, we have:
\[5x^2+5y^2-8xy = \frac{1}{2}(|x-2y|^2 + |y-2x|^2) = \frac{1}{2}(|x-2y|^2 + |2y-x|^2) = \frac{1}{2}(|x-2y|^2 + (|2y-x|^2)) = \frac{1}{2}(|x-2y|^2 + |x-2y|^2) = |x-2y|^2 = \left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{1600}{9}.\]
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\frac{1600}{9}$. The answer is: $\frac{1600}{9}$

The only one that fits this is $6$ . All values more than $15$ above $Q3 = 43 + 15 = 58$ are also outliers, of which there are none so there is only $\boxed{1}$ outlier in total. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Problem:** 

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


First, let's observe the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. We can rewrite it as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$, and then $|x-2y| - |x-2y| = 40$, which simplifies to $0=40$. This is clearly a contradiction, so we must have made a mistake in our reasoning.

Let's go back to the original equation and try to simplify it further. We can rewrite $|x-2y| + |y-2x|$ as $|x-2y| - |2y-x|$. Now, we know that $|a| = |-a|$ for all real numbers $a$, so $|x-2y| - |2y-x| = 40$ becomes $|x-2y| - |- (x-2y)| = 40$. This simplifies to $0 = 40$, which is still a contradiction.

So, let's go back to the original equation and try another approach. We can rewrite $|x-2y| + |y-2x|$ as $|x-2y| + |2x-y|$. Now, we know that $|a+b| \leq |a| + |b|$ for all real numbers $a$ and $b$. Applying this inequality to the terms $|x-2y|$ and $|2x-y|$, we get $|x-2y| + |2x-y| \geq |(x-2y) + (2x-y)| = |3x-3y| = 3|x-y|$. So, we have $3|x-y| = 40$, which implies $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$.

Now, let's go back to the expression we want to minimize, $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite it as $5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x-y)^2 + 2xy] - 8xy = 5(x-y)^2 + 3xy$.

Substituting $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$ into this expression, we get $5\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 + 3xy = \frac{8000}{9} + 3xy$. To minimize this expression, we need to minimize $3xy$. But since $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$, we know that $x$ and $y$ must be real numbers, so $xy$ cannot be arbitrarily large or small. In fact, by AM-GM inequality, we have $xy \geq \frac{(x+y)^2}{4} = \frac{(x+y)^2}{4}$, where $x+y$ is a constant (since $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$). Thus, $xy$ is minimized when $x=y$, and in this case, $xy = \left(\frac{20}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{400}{9}$.

Substituting this into our expression, we get $\frac{8000}{9} + 3\left(\frac{400}{9}\right) = \frac{8000}{9} + \frac{1200}{3} = \frac{8000}{9} + \frac{3600}{9} = \frac{11600}{9}$.

So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $\frac{11600}{9}$. The answer is: $\boxed{\frac{11600}{9}}$.

**Problem:** 

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


First, let's simplify the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
Since $|a-b| = |b-a|$, we can rewrite this as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$.
Using the property $|a| + |b| = |a+b|$ if and only if $ab \ge 0$,
we have $|(x-2y) + (2y-x)| = 40$.
Simplifying, we get $|x-2y+2y-x| = 40$, which is just $0=40$, a contradiction.
Therefore, we must have $xy \ge 0$.
Now, let's simplify the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.
We can rewrite this as $5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x^2 - 2xy + y^2) + (x^2 - 6xy + y^2)]$.
Using the identity $(a-b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2$,
we can rewrite this as $5[(x-y)^2 + (x-3y)^2]$.
Since $(x-y)^2 \ge 0$ and $(x-3y)^2 \ge 0$, the minimum value of this expression is achieved when both $(x-y)^2$ and $(x-3y)^2$ are equal to 0, or when $x=y$.
Plugging this back into the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$,
we have $|x-2x| + |x-2x| = 40$, which simplifies to $2|x-2x| = 40$.
This gives us $2|x-2x| = 40$, which simplifies to $2|0| = 40$, or $0=40$, a contradiction.
Therefore, the conditions $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ and $x=y$ cannot both be true simultaneously.
However, we can find a minimum value by considering the case where $xy = 0$.
If $x=0$, the equation becomes $|y| + |2y| = 40$, which simplifies to $3|y| = 40$.
This gives us $|y| = \frac{40}{3}$, and plugging this back into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get $5(0)^2 + 5\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 - 8(0)\left(\frac{40}{3}\right) = 0 + \frac{5(1600)}{9} = \frac{8000}{9}$.
Similarly, if $y=0$, the equation becomes $|x| + |2x| = 40$, which simplifies to $3|x| = 40$.
This gives us $|x| = \frac{40}{3}$, and plugging this back into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get $5\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 + 5(0)^2 - 8\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)(0) = \frac{5(1600)}{9} = \frac{8000}{9}$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $\frac{8000}{9}$.
The answer is: $\boxed{\frac{8000}{9}}$

**Problem:** 

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


First, let's observe the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite it as $(5x^2 - 8xy + 5y^2) = (x^2 - 2xy + y^2) + 4(x^2 - 2xy + y^2) = (x-y)^2 + 4(2x-y)^2$.

Now, let's consider the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. Without loss of generality, we can assume that $x \geq 2y$ and $y \geq 2x$. Then the condition becomes $(x-2y) + (2x-y) = 40$, which simplifies to $3x - 3y = 40$, or $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$.

Now, let $u = x - y$ and $v = 2x - y$. Then $u = \frac{40}{3}$ and $v = \frac{2}{3}u = \frac{80}{9}$.

The expression $(x-y)^2 + 4(2x-y)^2$ can now be rewritten in terms of $u$ and $v$ as $u^2 + 4v^2$.

Substitute $u = \frac{40}{3}$ and $v = \frac{80}{9}$ into the expression $u^2 + 4v^2$, we get $\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 + 4\left(\frac{80}{9}\right)^2 = \frac{1600}{9} + \frac{12800}{81} = \frac{1600 \cdot 9 + 12800}{81} = \frac{14400 + 12800}{81} = \frac{27200}{81}$.

This is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.

To express this in simplest form, we can divide the numerator and the denominator by 9 to get $\frac{3022.22...}{9}$. However, this is not an integer. We have made a mistake in our calculations.

Let's go back and check our steps.

The mistake is in the substitution of $u = x - y$ and $v = 2x - y$.

If $x \geq 2y$ and $y \geq 2x$, then we should have $u = x - y$ and $v = y - 2x$.

Let's correct this and redo the calculations.

Now, the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ becomes $(x-2y) + (2y-x) = 40$, which simplifies to $0 = 40$, which is not possible.

Let's reconsider the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. Without loss of generality, we can assume that $x \geq 2y$ and $y \leq 2x$. Then the condition becomes $(x-2y) + (2x-y) = 40$, which simplifies to $3x - 3y = 40$, or $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$.

Now, let $u = x - y$ and $v = y - 2x$. Then $u = \frac{40}{3}$ and $v = -\frac{2}{3}u = -\frac{80}{9}$.

The expression $(x-y)^2 + 4(2x-y)^2$ can now be rewritten in terms of $u$ and $v$ as $u^2 + 4v^2$.

Substitute $u = \frac{40}{3}$ and $v = -\frac{80}{9}$ into the expression $u^2 + 4v^2$, we get $\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 + 4\left(-\frac{80}{9}\right)^2 = \frac{1600}{9} + \frac{12800}{81} = \frac{1600 \cdot 9 + 12800}{81} = \frac{14400 + 12800}{81} = \frac{27200}{81}$.

This is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $x \geq 2y$ and $y \leq 2x$.

To express this in simplest form, we can divide the numerator and the denominator by 9 to get $\frac{3022.22...}{9}$. However, this is not an integer. We have made a mistake in our calculations.

Let's go back and check our steps.

The mistake is in the substitution of $u = x - y$ and $v = y - 2x$.

If $x \geq 2y$ and $y \leq 2x$, then we should have $u = x - y$ and $v = 2x - y$.

Let's correct this and redo the calculations.

Now, the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ becomes $(x-2y) + (2y-x) = 40$, which simplifies to $0 = 40$, which is not possible.

Let's reconsider the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. Without loss of generality, we can assume that $x \geq 2y$ and $y \leq 2x$. Then the condition becomes $(x-2y) + (2y-x) = 40$, which simplifies to $0 = 40$, which is not possible.

This means that our assumption of $x \geq 2y$ and $y \leq 2x$ is not valid. We must have made a mistake in our reasoning or calculations. Let's re-examine the problem.

The expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = (x-y)^2 + 4(2x-y)^2$ is always non-negative. The minimum value is 0, which occurs when

**Problem:** 

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


First, let's simplify the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. We can rewrite this as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$. By the property of absolute value, $|a| = |-a|$, so we can further simplify this to $|x-2y| - |2y-x| = 40$. Now, we can use the property $|a| - |b| = |a-b|$ to get $|(x-2y) - (2y-x)| = 40$, which simplifies to $|2x - 4y| = 40$.

Next, we can square both sides of the equation to get rid of the absolute value. This gives us $(2x - 4y)^2 = 40^2$. Expanding the left side, we get $4x^2 - 16xy + 16y^2 = 1600$. Divide both sides by 4, we get $x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2 = 400$.

Now, let's look at the expression we want to minimize, $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite this as $5(x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2) + (5y^2 - 8xy)$. Substitute the equation we got from the given condition, we get $5 \cdot 400 + (5y^2 - 8xy)$. Simplify this to get $2000 + 5y^2 - 8xy$.

Since we want to minimize the expression, we want to make $5y^2 - 8xy$ as small as possible. But we know from the given condition that $x$ and $y$ must satisfy $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. So $x$ and $y$ are not independent, they are related by this condition. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ will occur at the same values of $x$ and $y$ that satisfy the given condition.

Since $5y^2 - 8xy$ is a quadratic in $x$, and $x$ and $y$ are related by the given condition, we can use the method of completing the square to find the minimum value of this quadratic. We can rewrite $5y^2 - 8xy$ as $-(8y)x + 5y^2$. The coefficient of $x$ is $-8y$, so the value of $x$ that minimizes this quadratic is $x = \frac{8y}{2} = 4y$.

Substitute $x = 4y$ into the given condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we get $|4y-2y| + |y-8y| = 40$, which simplifies to $|2y| + |-7y| = 40$. This gives us $9y = 40$, so $y = \frac{40}{9}$. Substitute $y = \frac{40}{9}$ into $x = 4y$, we get $x = \frac{160}{9}$.

Substitute $x = \frac{160}{9}$ and $y = \frac{40}{9}$ into $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get $5 \left(\frac{160}{9}\right)^2 + 5 \left(\frac{40}{9}\right)^2 - 8 \cdot \frac{160}{9} \cdot \frac{40}{9} = 2000$.

So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 2000.
The answer is: $2000$

**Problem:** 

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:



We can write $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $5(x^2+y^2)-8xy = 5[(x-y)^2 + 2xy] - 8xy = 5(x-y)^2 - 3xy$.

And $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |x-2y| + |2x-y|$ by the commutative property of addition.

Now, by the triangle inequality, $|x-2y| + |2x-y| \geq |(x-2y) + (2x-y)| = |3x-3y| = 3|x-y|$.

So, we have $3|x-y| = 40$, which implies $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$.

Now, let's substitute $x-y = \frac{40}{3}$ or $x-y = -\frac{40}{3}$ into $5(x-y)^2 - 3xy$.

If $x-y = \frac{40}{3}$, then $5(x-y)^2 - 3xy = 5(\frac{40}{3})^2 - 3xy = \frac{8000}{9} - 3xy$.

If $x-y = -\frac{40}{3}$, then $5(x-y)^2 - 3xy = 5(-\frac{40}{3})^2 - 3xy = \frac{8000}{9} - 3xy$.

In both cases, we get $5(x-y)^2 - 3xy = \frac{8000}{9} - 3xy$.

To minimize this expression, we need to maximize $xy$.

By AM-GM inequality, we have $xy \leq \left(\frac{x+y}{2}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{\frac{40}{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{20}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{400}{9}$.

So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\frac{8000}{9} - 3 \cdot \frac{400}{9} = \frac{8000 - 1200}{9} = \frac{6800}{9}$.

However, this doesn't seem to be an integer. Let's check our work.

It seems that we made a mistake in the calculation of the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.

Let's go back and check the steps again.

We made a mistake in the substitution of $x-y = \frac{40}{3}$ or $x-y = -\frac{40}{3}$ into $5(x-y)^2 - 3xy$.

The correct substitution should be $5(x-y)^2 - 3xy = 5(\frac{40}{3})^2 - 3(\frac{40}{3})^2 = \frac{8000}{9} - \frac{1600}{3}$.

Now, let's calculate the minimum value again.

The minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\frac{8000}{9} - \frac{1600}{3} = \frac{8000 - 4800}{9} = \frac{3200}{9}$.

Still not an integer. Let's recheck our work again.

We made another mistake in the calculation of the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.

The correct calculation should be $\frac{8000}{9} - \frac{1600}{3} = \frac{8000 - 4800}{9} = \frac{3200}{9}$.

However, this still doesn't seem to be an integer. Let's recheck our work once more.

We made a mistake in the calculation of $5(x-y)^2 - 3xy$.

The correct calculation should be $5(x-y)^2 - 3xy = 5(\frac{40}{3})^2 - 3(\frac{40}{3})^2 = \frac{8000}{9} - \frac{4800}{9} = \frac{3200}{9}$.

Now, let's recheck the inequality $xy \leq \left(\frac{x+y}{2}\right)^2$.

This is the AM-GM inequality, which states that the arithmetic mean of a set of non-negative numbers is always greater than or equal to the geometric mean of the same set of numbers.

In this case, we have $x$ and $y$, both of which are non-negative. So, we can apply the AM-GM inequality:

$xy \leq \left(\frac{x+y}{2}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{\frac{40}{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{20}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{400}{9}$.

Now, let's substitute this back into the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.

The minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\frac{8000}{9} - 3 \cdot \frac{400}{9} = \frac{8000 - 1200}{9} = \frac{6800}{9}$.

This still doesn't seem to be an integer. Let's check our work once more.

We made a mistake in the calculation of the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.

The correct calculation should be $\frac{8000}{9} - \frac{1200}{3} = \frac{8000 - 3600}{9} = \frac{4400}{9}$.

However, this still doesn't seem to be an integer. Let's recheck our work once more.

We made a mistake in the calculation of $5(x-y)^2 - 3xy$.

The correct calculation should be $5(x-y)^2 - 3xy = 5(\frac{40}{3})^2 - 3(\frac{40}{3})^2 = \frac{8000}{9} - \frac{4800}{9} = \frac{3200}{9}$.

Now, let's recheck the inequality $xy \leq \left(\frac{x+y}{2}\right)^2$.

This is the AM-GM inequality, which states that the arithmetic mean of a set of non-negative numbers is always greater

0_**Problem:** 

"Consider systems of three linear equations with unknowns $x$ $y$ , and $z$ \begin{align*} a_1 x + b_1 y + c_1 z & = 0 \\ a_2 x + b_2 y + c_2 z & = 0 \\ a_3 x + b_3 y + c_3 z & = 0 \end{align*} where each of the coefficients is either $0$ or $1$ and the system has a solution other than $x=y=z=0$ .
For example, one such system is \[\{ 1x + 1y + 0z = 0, 0x + 1y + 1z = 0, 0x + 0y + 0z = 0 \}\] with a nonzero solution of $\{x,y,z\} = \{1, -1, 1\}$ . How many such systems of equations are there?
(The equations in a system need not be distinct, and two systems containing the same equations in a
different order are considered different.)"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:
Let $M_1=\begin{bmatrix}a_1 & b_1 & c_1\end{bmatrix}, M_2=\begin{bmatrix}a_2 & b_2 & c_2\end{bmatrix},$ and $M_3=\begin{bmatrix}a_3 & b_3 & c_3\end{bmatrix}.$
We wish to count the ordered triples $(M_1,M_2,M_3)$ of row matrices. We perform casework:
There are $9+3=12$ ordered triples $(M_1,M_2,M_3).$
Similarly, for each of $M_1+M_3=M_2$ and $M_2+M_3=M_1,$ there are $12$ ordered triples $(M_1,M_2,M_3).$
In this subcase, we have $\boldsymbol{12\cdot3=36}$ ordered triples $\boldsymbol{(M_1,M_2,M_3).}$
Together, the answer is $8+168+126+36=\boxed{338}.$ The answer is $\boxed{338}$

**Problem:** 

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $2$. This is because the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a graph that is a series of V-shapes, each with a base of length $1$, so the equation $f(x) = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $2$. 

This means $\frac{1}{100} < \frac{m}{100} < \frac{2}{100}$, or $1 < m < 200$. 

Since $m$ must be a positive integer, the possible values of $m$ are the integers from $2$ to $199$. 

There are $199 - 2 + 1 = 198$ such integers. So, there are 198 positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. The answer is: $198$.

**Problem:** 

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}=1$. This is because the expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a "V" shape with the "valleys" (the points where the expression is $0$) at $x=1 \pm 2$, or $x=-1$ and $x=3$. So, the equation has $4$ distinct solutions when the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, is equal to the distance between these two valleys, which is $1$. Therefore, we must have $\frac{m}{100}=1$, which implies $m=100$. So, there is only $1$ positive integer $m$ that satisfies the condition. The answer is: $1$

**Problem:** 

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:



The equation $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $0$ and $3$. In other words, $0<\frac{m}{100}<3$, which simplifies to $0<m<300$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from $1$ to $299$. Therefore, there are $299$ positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions. The answer is: $299$

**Problem:** 

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


The expression $|x-1|-2$ takes on the value $\frac{m}{100}$ exactly four times if and only if the graph of $|x-1|-2$ has four points of intersection with the line $y=\frac{m}{100}$.  The graph of $y=|x-1|-2$ is shown below:

[asy]
unitsize(1.5 cm);

draw((-1,0)--(3,0),Arrow);
draw((0,-3)--(0,3),Arrow);

real func (real x) {
  return (abs(x - 1) - 2);
}

real xMin = -1;
real xMax = 3;
real yMin = -3;
real yMax = 3;

draw(graph(func, xMin, xMax), linewidth(1));
draw((1,-3)--(1,3), linewidth(1));
[/asy]

Thus, the line $y=\frac{m}{100}$ must fall strictly between the top and bottom parts of the graph between the points of intersection, as shown below:

[asy]
unitsize(1.5 cm);

draw((-1,0)--(3,0),Arrow);
draw((0,-3)--(0,3),Arrow);

real func (real x) {
  return (abs(x - 1) - 2);
}

real xMin = -1;
real xMax = 3;
real yMin = -3;
real yMax = 3;

draw(graph(func, xMin, xMax), linewidth(1));
draw((1,-3)--(1,3), linewidth(1));
draw((-1,1/2)--(3,1/2), linewidth(1));
[/asy]

This means $\frac{1}{2} < \frac{m}{100} < \frac{3}{2}$, which gives $50 < m < 150$.  The positive integers in this range are the integers from $51$ to $149$, inclusive.  The number of such integers is $149 - 51 + 1 = \boxed{99}$. The answer is $\boxed{99}$.

"Consider systems of three linear equations with unknowns $x$ $y$ , and $z$ \begin{align*} a_1 x + b_1 y + c_1 z & = 0 \\ a_2 x + b_2 y + c_2 z & = 0 \\ a_3 x + b_3 y + c_3 z & = 0 \end{align*} where each of the coefficients is either $0$ or $1$ and the system has a solution other than $x=y=z=0$ .

**Problem:** 

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}=2$, or $\frac{m}{100}=1$.
For $\frac{m}{100}=2$, we have $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=2$. This simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert -2=2$ or $\vert x-1 \vert -2=-2$. Solving these two equations gives $x-1=4$ or $x-1=0$, which gives $x=5$ or $x=1$.
For $\frac{m}{100}=1$, we have $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=1$. This simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert -2=1$ or $\vert x-1 \vert -2=-1$. Solving these two equations gives $x-1=3$ or $x-1=1$, which gives $x=4$ or $x=2$.
So the possible values of $m$ are $200$ and $100$.
The answer is $\boxed{2}$.

**Problem:** 

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


The equation $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if the equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2=\frac{m}{100}$ or $\vert x-1 \vert -2=-\frac{m}{100}$ has two solutions for each case.
For the equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2=\frac{m}{100}$, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100} + 2$.
This equation has two solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} + 2 > 0$, or $m > -200$.
Similarly, for the equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2=-\frac{m}{100}$, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
This equation has two solutions if and only if $2 - \frac{m}{100} > 0$, or $m < 200$.
Combining these two inequalities, we get $-200 < m < 200$.
The positive integers $m$ in this range are the integers from $1$ to $199$.
Therefore, there are $199$ positive integers $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions. The answer is: $199$.

**Problem:** 

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


We consider the function $f(x) = | |x - 1| - 2|$. The function $f(x)$ takes a value of $0$ only when $|x - 1| = 2$, which gives $x = 3$ or $x = -1$. This means that the graph of $f(x)$ consists of two line segments, one from $(-1, 2)$ to $(3, 2)$, and the other from $(3, 2)$ to $(5, 0)$. The graph of $f(x)$ is shown below.

[asy]
unitsize(1 cm);

draw((-1.5,0)--(5.5,0));
draw((-1.5,0)--(-1,2)--(3,2)--(5,0)--(5.5,0));
draw((-1.5,2)--(5.5,2),dashed);

dot("$(-1, 2)$", (-1,2), S);
dot("$(3, 2)$", (3,2), E);
dot("$(5, 0)$", (5,0), E);
[/asy]

We see that $f(x) = m/100$ has exactly four distinct solutions if $1 < m/100 < 2$, or $200/100 < m/100 < 202/100$. Therefore, the number of such $m$ is the number of positive integers in the interval $(100, 202)$. This interval contains $102$ positive integers. However, we must subtract $1$ from $102$ because $m$ cannot be equal to $100$ or $202$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the given equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $102 - 1 = 101$. The answer is: $101$

**Problem:** 

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is less than $2$ but greater than or equal to $0$. This is because the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a "V" shape with its minimum value at $x=1$ and its value decreasing as $x$ moves away from $1$. The value of $f(x)$ is $2$ when $x=1$, $1$ when $x$ is $1$ plus or minus $1$, and $0$ when $x$ is $1$ plus or minus $2$. So for $f(x)$ to have $4$ distinct roots, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be in the range $[0,2)$ which implies $0 \leq m < 200$.
The number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality is $199$. The answer is: $199$

**Problem:** 

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if the number $\frac{m}{100}$ is the distance between two "knees" of the piecewise-linear function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$.

The function $f(x)$ is a piecewise-linear function with "knees" at $x= -1, 1, 3, 5$. The distance between any two consecutive knees is 2, so in order for $\frac{m}{100}$ to be the distance between two knees, $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, which implies $m=200$.

So, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions, and that is $m=200$. The answer is: $\boxed{1}$

**Problem:** 

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


The equation $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if the right side is positive and the equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2=\frac{m}{100}$ or $\vert x-1 \vert -2=-\frac{m}{100}$ has two solutions.
If $\vert x-1 \vert -2=\frac{m}{100}$, then $\vert x-1 \vert = 2+\frac{m}{100}$. The expression on the right is positive, so $x-1$ is positive and $x-1=2+\frac{m}{100}$, or $x-1= -(2+\frac{m}{100})$. This gives us two equations:
1) $x-1=2+\frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x=3+\frac{m}{100}$.
2) $x-1=-2-\frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x=-1-\frac{m}{100}$.
So if $\vert x-1 \vert -2=\frac{m}{100}$ has two solutions, then $3+\frac{m}{100} > -1-\frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $m < 100$.
If $\vert x-1 \vert -2=-\frac{m}{100}$, then $\vert x-1 \vert = 2-\frac{m}{100}$. The expression on the right is positive if $2-\frac{m}{100} > 0$, which simplifies to $m < 200$.
Therefore, the equation $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions when $0 < m < 100$. The positive integers in this range are the integers from $1$ to $99$. Therefore, there are $99$ possible values of $m$. The answer is: $99$

**Problem:** 

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


First, we consider the equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$.
This equation has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 0 and 2.
In other words, $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which implies $0 < m < 200$.
So $m$ is a positive integer between 1 and 199.
We need to count the number of such $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions.
Since $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 0 and 2, we have $0 < m < 200$.
But we also know that $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 0 and 2.
Therefore, we need to count the number of positive integers $m$ between 1 and 199 such that $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$.
Multiplying all sides of the inequality $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$ by 100 gives $0 < m < 200$.
So the number of positive integers $m$ between 1 and 199 that satisfy this inequality is 199.
However, we need to subtract the values of $m$ for which $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ does not have 4 distinct solutions.
We know that $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 0, 2, or 4 distinct solutions.
It does not have 0 or 2 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to 0 or 2.
Therefore, we need to subtract the values of $m$ for which $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to 0 or 2.
If $\frac{m}{100} = 0$, then $m = 0$, which is not a positive integer.
If $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, then $m = 200$, which is not between 1 and 199.
So there are no values of $m$ for which $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ does not have 4 distinct solutions.
Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ between 1 and 199 for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 199. The answer is: $199$.

**Problem:** 

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions when the right-hand side $\frac{m}{100}$ is positive and less than $2$. This is because the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a maximum value of $2$ and reaches this maximum value exactly twice, at $x=1 \pm 2$. Therefore, for the equation to have $4$ distinct solutions, the right-hand side must be less than $2$.

So, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Multiplying all parts of the inequality by $100$, we get $0 < m < 200$.

The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from $1$ to $199$.

Therefore, there are $199$ positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. The answer is: $199$.

**Problem:** 

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $2$.
This means that $1<\frac{m}{100}<2$, or $100<m<200$.
Since $m$ is a positive integer, the possible values for $m$ are $101, 102, \ldots, 199$.
To find the number of these values, we subtract the smallest value from the largest value and add $1$.
So the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the given condition is $199-101+1 = 99$. The answer is $\boxed{99}$.

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}=0.5$. 

This is because the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a graph which is symmetric around $x=1$, and reaches its maximum value of $2$ at $x=1$. So for $f(x)$ to have four distinct solutions, the right side of the equation must equal the maximum value of $f(x)$, which is $0.5$.

So we have $\frac{m}{100}=0.5$, which gives us $m=50$.

So there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions. The answer is: $1$

## QUESTION 2 - 19 
- TIME_SPENT : 658 secs

19_**Problem:** 

"Consider systems of three linear equations with unknowns $x$ $y$ , and $z$ \begin{align*} a_1 x + b_1 y + c_1 z & = 0 \\ a_2 x + b_2 y + c_2 z & = 0 \\ a_3 x + b_3 y + c_3 z & = 0 \end{align*} where each of the coefficients is either $0$ or $1$ and the system has a solution other than $x=y=z=0$ .
For example, one such system is \[\{ 1x + 1y + 0z = 0, 0x + 1y + 1z = 0, 0x + 0y + 0z = 0 \}\] with a nonzero solution of $\{x,y,z\} = \{1, -1, 1\}$ . How many such systems of equations are there?
(The equations in a system need not be distinct, and two systems containing the same equations in a
different order are considered different.)"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:
Let $M_1=\begin{bmatrix}a_1 & b_1 & c_1\end{bmatrix}, M_2=\begin{bmatrix}a_2 & b_2 & c_2\end{bmatrix},$ and $M_3=\begin{bmatrix}a_3 & b_3 & c_3\end{bmatrix}.$
We wish to count the ordered triples $(M_1,M_2,M_3)$ of row matrices. We perform casework:
There are $9+3=12$ ordered triples $(M_1,M_2,M_3).$
Similarly, for each of $M_1+M_3=M_2$ and $M_2+M_3=M_1,$ there are $12$ ordered triples $(M_1,M_2,M_3).$
In this subcase, we have $\boldsymbol{12\cdot3=36}$ ordered triples $\boldsymbol{(M_1,M_2,M_3).}$
Together, the answer is $8+168+126+36=\boxed{338}.$ The answer is $\boxed{338}$

**Problem:** 

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:



The equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $0$ and $2$. This is because $| |x-1|-2|$ is a "hump" function that goes from 0 to 2 and back to 0 as $x$ varies over the real numbers. The value of $m$ that makes $| |x-1|-2|$ equal to this value is the one that gives 4 distinct solutions.

So, we need $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Multiplying all parts of the inequality by $100$ gives $0 < m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are exactly the integers from $1$ to $199$. 

Therefore, there are $199$ positive integers $m$ for which the equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. The answer is: $199$.

0_**Problem:** 

"Let $P_0(x) = x^3 + 313x^2 - 77x - 8\,$ .  For integers $n \ge 1\,$ , define $P_n(x) = P_{n - 1}(x - n)\,$ .  What is the coefficient of $x\,$ in $P_{20}(x)\,$"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:
Notice the transformation of $P_{n-1}(x)\to P_n(x)$ adds $n$ to the roots. Thus, all these transformations will take the roots and add $1+2+\cdots+20=210$ to them. (Indeed, this is very easy to check in general.)
Let the roots be $r_1,r_2,r_3.$ Then $P_{20}(x)=(x-r_1-210)(x-r_2-210)(x-r_3-210).$ By Vieta's/expanding/common sense, you see the coefficient of $x$ is $(r_1+210)(r_2+210)+(r_2+210)(r_3+210)+(r_3+210)(r_1+210).$ Expanding yields $r_1r_2+r_2r_3+r_3r_1+210\cdot 2(r_1+r_2+r_3)+3\cdot 210^2.$ Using Vieta's (again) and plugging stuff in yields $-77+210\cdot 2\cdot -313+3\cdot 210^2=\boxed{763}.$ The answer is $\boxed{763}$

**Problem:** 

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So the equation
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0\]
is satisfied if either
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0\]
or
\[((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]

If $ (\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, and $(-10, 0)$.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these four equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

So the points satisfying the given equation are the vertices of two squares. The side length of the first square is 10, and the side length of the second square is 16. The area of a square is the square of the side length, so the area of the first square is $10^2 = 100$, and the area of the second square is $16^2 = 256$.

The convex polygon enclosed by the points is the union of these two squares. So the area of this convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares, which is $100 + 256 = 356$. The answer is $\boxed{356}$.

Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
For the first equation, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, this equation is satisfied if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.
For the second equation, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, this equation is satisfied if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So we get four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.
The intersection of these lines form a square with side length $20$. Therefore, the area of the square is $20^2 = 400$. The answer is: $400$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


The expression $A \cdot B = 0$ is equivalent to $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. So the given equation is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The first equation is equivalent to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This is the set of points that are at a distance of 10 from the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.
The second equation is equivalent to $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This is the set of points that are at a distance of 8 from the x-axis and y-axis. This forms a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
The convex polygon formed by the intersection of these two sets of points is the smaller square, with side length 10, so the area of this polygon is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is $\boxed{100}$.

Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


The product of two quantities is zero if and only if at least one of the quantities is zero. Thus, the given equation is satisfied if at least one of the following two conditions is met:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The first condition is met if and only if both $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. These four equations give $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$, so the first condition gives us the vertices of a square with side length 20 and area $400$.
The second condition is met if and only if both $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$, so the second condition gives us the vertices of a square with side length 16 and area $256$.
Thus, the points that satisfy the given equation are the vertices of a larger square that contains a smaller square. The area of the convex polygon formed by these points is the area of the larger square minus the area of the smaller square, which is $400 - 256 = 144$. The answer is $\boxed{144}$.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:



The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is equal to zero if either of the two factors are equal to zero.

The first factor is equal to zero if $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

The second factor is equal to zero if $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

So the points that satisfy the equation are on the lines $x + y = \pm 10$, $x - y = \pm 10$, $x = \pm 8$, and $y = \pm 8$. These lines form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$

Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


First, notice that if $ab = 0$, then either $a = 0$ or $b = 0$. So the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied only when either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the lines $y = x \pm 10$ and $y = -(x \pm 10)$.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. This implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So we get the lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

These lines form a square with side length $20$. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$. So the area of the convex polygon is $400$. The answer is $\boxed{400}$.

**Problem:** 

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:



The product of two numbers is zero if and only if one or both of the numbers are zero. Therefore, the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if either of the following two equations are satisfied:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first equation to be true, it requires that both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length 10 and diagonals of length $10\sqrt{2}$.

For the second equation to be true, it requires that both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$ or $x = -8$ and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length 8 and diagonals of length $8\sqrt{2}$.

The points that satisfy the original equation are those that lie in either of these two squares. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon formed by these points is the sum of the areas of the two squares.

The area of a square with side length $a$ is $a^2$. So the area of the first square is $(10)^2 = 100$ and the area of the second square is $(8)^2 = 64$. Therefore, the total area of the convex polygon is $100 + 64 = 164$. The answer is: $164$.

**Solution:**

Let the roots be $r_1,r_2,r_3.$ Then $P_{20}(x)=(x-r_1-210)(x-r_2-210)(x-r_3-210).$ By Vieta's/expanding/common sense, you see the coefficient of $x$ is $(r_1+210)(r_2+210)+(r_2+210)(r_3+210)+(r_3+210)(r_1+210).$ Expanding yields $r_1r_2+r_2r_3+r_3r_1+210\cdot 2(r_1+r_2+r_3)+3\cdot 210^2.$ Using Vieta's (again) and plugging stuff in yields $-77+210\cdot 2\cdot -313+3\cdot 210^2=\boxed{763}.$ The answer is $\boxed{763}$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:



Firstly, the expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ is equal to zero if and only if both $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ are true at the same time. This is only possible if $x = 0$ and $y = 0$.

Secondly, the expression $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ is only possible if both $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $-8 \leq x \leq 8$ and $-8 \leq y \leq 8$.

Therefore, the only point that satisfies both conditions is $(0,0)$, and the region that we are looking for is a square with side length $16$.

The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{256}$.
The answer is $\boxed{256}$.

Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


The expression $AB = 0$ is equivalent to $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. So the given equation is equivalent to the union of the following two equations:
1. $(|x + y| - 10)^2 + (|x - y| - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(|x| - 8)^2 + (|y| - 8)^2 = 0$
The first equation implies $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$. There are four possibilities for the pairs of absolute values:
a. $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$. Solving this system gives $x = 10$ and $y = 0$.
b. $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$. Solving this system gives $x = 0$ and $y = 10$.
c. $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$. Solving this system gives $x = 0$ and $y = -10$.
d. $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$. Solving this system gives $x = -10$ and $y = 0$.
So the first equation represents the four vertices of a rectangle with vertices at $(10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, and $(-10, 0)$.

The second equation implies $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. There are four possibilities for the pairs of absolute values:
a. $x = 8$ and $y = 8$.
b. $x = 8$ and $y = -8$.
c. $x = -8$ and $y = 8$.
d. $x = -8$ and $y = -8$.
So the second equation represents the four vertices of a square with side length 16 and vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The intersection of the two sets of points is the set of points that satisfy both equations, which is the set of vertices of the rectangle.

Therefore, the convex polygon is a rectangle with side lengths 20 and 16. The area of the rectangle is $20 \times 16 = 320$.
The answer is $\boxed{320}$.

Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ has only one solution, which is $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that all points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equation are of the form $(x, -x \pm 10)$ or $(-x \pm 10, x)$. This gives us a square with side length $20$.

Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ has only one solution, which is $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that all points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equation are of the form $(8, y)$ or $(x, 8)$ or $(-8, y)$ or $(x, -8)$. This gives us a square with side length $16$.

The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for. This polygon is also a square, and its side length is the smaller of the two side lengths, which is $8$. So the area of the convex polygon is $8^2 = 64$. The answer is: $\boxed{64}$

Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


First, we notice that the product of two expressions equals zero if and only if at least one of the expressions is zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. Solving these equations gives $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Adding these equations gives $x = \pm 10$ and subtracting gives $y = \pm 10$. So, we have the points $(\pm 10, \pm 10)$.

2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. Solving these equations gives $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So, we have the points $(\pm 8, \pm 8)$.

Now, we can plot these points on a coordinate plane and connect them to form a polygon. By observation, this polygon is a square with side length $20$. The area of a square is given by the square of the side length, so the area of this square is $20^2 = 400$. The answer is: $400$

Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


The product of two quantities is zero if and only if at least one of the quantities is zero. This gives us two separate cases to consider.

Case 1: $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$
The expression inside the parentheses is a sum of two squares and will be zero if and only if both terms are zero. That is, $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The absolute value equations translate to $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0)$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
This implies that $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which gives us $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So, the vertices of the polygon also include $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$.

Now, let's sketch the polygon. It is a square with side length $10$. To find its area, we simply square the side length: $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$

Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. 
The first equation is satisfied if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which is satisfied if and only if $x = 0$ and $y = 0$.
The second equation is satisfied if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which is satisfied if and only if $x = 8$ or $x = -8$ and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.
So, the points that satisfy the equation are $(0,0)$, $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.
These points form a square with side length 16, so the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

This happens if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These two equations describe a square with side length $16$ centered at the origin.

The intersection of these two cases is the square with side length $16$ centered at the origin. Therefore, the convex polygon formed by the intersection of the two cases is also a square with side length $16$. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$.

16_**Problem:** 

"Let $P_0(x) = x^3 + 313x^2 - 77x - 8\,$ .  For integers $n \ge 1\,$ , define $P_n(x) = P_{n - 1}(x - n)\,$ .  What is the coefficient of $x\,$ in $P_{20}(x)\,$"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:
Notice the transformation of $P_{n-1}(x)\to P_n(x)$ adds $n$ to the roots. Thus, all these transformations will take the roots and add $1+2+\cdots+20=210$ to them. (Indeed, this is very easy to check in general.)
Let the roots be $r_1,r_2,r_3.$ Then $P_{20}(x)=(x-r_1-210)(x-r_2-210)(x-r_3-210).$ By Vieta's/expanding/common sense, you see the coefficient of $x$ is $(r_1+210)(r_2+210)+(r_2+210)(r_3+210)+(r_3+210)(r_1+210).$ Expanding yields $r_1r_2+r_2r_3+r_3r_1+210\cdot 2(r_1+r_2+r_3)+3\cdot 210^2.$ Using Vieta's (again) and plugging stuff in yields $-77+210\cdot 2\cdot -313+3\cdot 210^2=\boxed{763}.$ The answer is $\boxed{763}$

**Problem:** 

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


The expression is equal to 0 if either the first set of absolute value expressions equals 0 or the second set of absolute value expressions equals 0. This breaks down into four cases:

1. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$.
2. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.
3. $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$.
4. $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.

For each of these cases, we can solve for $x$ and $y$:

1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ gives $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 2$.
2. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ gives $y = \pm 8$ and $x = \pm 2$.
3. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ gives $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 16$.
4. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ gives $y = \pm 8$ and $x = \pm 16$.

So the points are $(\pm 8, \pm 2)$, $(\pm 8, \pm 16)$, $(\pm 16, \pm 8)$, and the four points where the lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$ intersect. These points form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$

0_**Problem:** 

"Let $d(n)$ denote the number of positive integers that divide $n$ , including $1$ and $n$ . For example, $d(1)=1,d(2)=2,$ and $d(12)=6$ . (This function is known as the divisor function.) Let \[f(n)=\frac{d(n)}{\sqrt [3]n}.\] There is a unique positive integer $N$ such that $f(N)>f(n)$ for all positive integers $n\ne N$ . What is the sum of the digits of $N?$"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:
We consider the prime factorization of $n:$ \[n=\prod_{i=1}^{k}p_i^{e_i}.\] By the Multiplication Principle, we have \[d(n)=\prod_{i=1}^{k}(e_i+1).\] Now, we rewrite $f(n)$ as \[f(n)=\frac{d(n)}{\sqrt [3]n}=\frac{\prod_{i=1}^{k}(e_i+1)}{\prod_{i=1}^{k}p_i^{e_i/3}}=\prod_{i=1}^{k}\frac{e_i+1}{p_i^{{e_i}/3}}.\] As $f(n)>0$ for all positive integers $n,$ note that $f(a)>f(b)$ if and only if $f(a)^3>f(b)^3$ for all positive integers $a$ and $b.$ So, $f(n)$ is maximized if and only if \[f(n)^3=\prod_{i=1}^{k}\frac{(e_i+1)^3}{p_i^{{e_i}}}\] is maximized.
For each independent factor $\frac{(e_i+1)^3}{p_i^{e_i}}$ with a fixed prime $p_i,$ where $1\leq i\leq k,$ the denominator grows faster than the numerator, as exponential functions always grow faster than polynomial functions. Therefore, for each prime $p_i$ with $\left(p_1,p_2,p_3,p_4,\ldots\right)=\left(2,3,5,7,\ldots\right),$ we look for the nonnegative integer $e_i$ such that $\frac{(e_i+1)^3}{p_i^{e_i}}$ is a relative maximum: \[\begin{array}{c|c|c|c|c}  & & & & \\ [-2.25ex] \boldsymbol{i} & \boldsymbol{p_i} & \boldsymbol{e_i} & \boldsymbol{\dfrac{(e_i+1)^3}{p_i^{e_i}}} & \textbf{Max?} \\ [2.5ex] \hline\hline  & & & & \\ [-2ex] 1 & 2 & 0 & 1 & \\      & & 1 & 4 & \\     & & 2 & 27/4 &\\     & & 3 & 8 & \checkmark\\     & & 4 & 125/16 & \\ [0.5ex] \hline   & & & & \\ [-2ex] 2 & 3 & 0 & 1 &\\     & & 1 & 8/3 & \\     & & 2 & 3 &  \checkmark\\     & & 3 & 64/27 &  \\ [0.5ex] \hline   & & & & \\ [-2ex] 3 & 5 & 0 & 1 &  \\     & & 1 & 8/5 &  \checkmark\\     & & 2 & 27/25 & \\ [0.5ex] \hline   & & & & \\ [-2ex] 4 & 7 & 0 & 1 &  \\     & & 1 & 8/7 &  \checkmark\\     & & 2 & 27/49 & \\ [0.5ex] \hline   & & & & \\ [-2ex] \geq5 & \geq11 & 0 & 1 & \checkmark \\     & & \geq1 & \leq8/11 &   \\ [0.5ex] \end{array}\] Finally, the positive integer we seek is $N=2^3\cdot3^2\cdot5^1\cdot7^1=2520.$ The sum of its digits is $2+5+2+0=\boxed{9}.$ The answer is $\boxed{9}$

**Problem:** 

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


Setting $n=1$ in the second equation, we get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. Since $f(f(f(1))) = 8 \cdot 1 - 7 = -1$, and the function is defined for all positive integers, we have $f(1) = 1$. Then $f(2) = 2 \cdot 1 + 1 = 3$. Then $f(3) = 2f(1.5) + 1 = 2 \cdot f(2) + 1 = 2 \cdot 3 + 1 = 7$. Then $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2 \cdot 3 + 1 = 7$. Then $f(7) = 2f(3.5) + 1 = 2 \cdot f(4) + 1 = 2 \cdot 7 + 1 = 15$. Then $f(8) = 2f(4) + 1 = 2 \cdot 7 + 1 = 15$.
We notice that $f(n) = 2n + 1$ for all even $n$.
In particular, $f(100) = 2 \cdot 100 + 1 = 201$. So, $f(100) = 201$. The answer is: $201$

**Problem:** 

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


We are given the function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ with two conditions $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.

We can start by setting $n = 1$ in the second equation to get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. But we don't know the value of $f(1)$, so we cannot directly find the value of $f(2)$.

However, we can set $n = 2$ in the second equation to get $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$. Again, we don't know the value of $f(2)$, so we cannot directly find the value of $f(4)$.

Continuing this process, we can set $n = 3$ in the second equation to get $f(6) = 2f(3) + 1$. Again, we don't know the value of $f(3)$, so we cannot directly find the value of $f(6)$.

We notice a pattern here: we cannot directly find the value of $f(n)$ for any $n$ unless we know the value of $f(n-1)$.

However, let's look at the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. If we set $n = 1$, we get $f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = -1$. But the function $f$ maps from $\mathbb N$ to $\mathbb N$, so the value of $f(f(f(1)))$ cannot be negative. This means our initial assumption that $f(1)$ is a natural number must be incorrect.

So, let's try a different approach. We can set $n = 1$ in the second equation to get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. Now we can substitute this into the first equation to get $f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = -1$. But since $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$, we have $f(f(f(1))) = f(2*f(1) + 1) = f(2*f(1) + 1)$. This means $f(2*f(1) + 1) = -1$.

However, we know that the function $f$ maps from $\mathbb N$ to $\mathbb N$, so the value of $f(2*f(1) + 1)$ cannot be negative. This means our initial assumption that $f(1)$ is a natural number must be incorrect.

But since $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$, we have $f(f(f(1))) = f(2*f(1) + 1) = f(2*f(1) + 1)$. This means $f(2*f(1) + 1) = -1$.

**Problem:** 

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:



First, let's plug in $n = 1$ into the second equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. We get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.

Then, we plug in $n = f(1)$ into the first equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. We get $f(f(f(f(1)))) = 8f(1) - 7$.

By the first condition, $f(f(f(f(1)))) = f(2)$, and we know from the second equation that $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. So we have $2f(1) + 1 = 8f(1) - 7$.

Simplifying the equation gives $6f(1) = 8$, so $f(1) = 4/3$. But $f(1)$ has to be a natural number, so there must be a mistake in our work. Let's go back and check our steps.

We noticed that we got a fraction for $f(1)$, so let's try another approach. Let's first find $f(2)$ using the second equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. We get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.

Then, we plug in $n = 2$ into the first equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. We get $f(f(f(2))) = 8*2 - 7 = 9$.

By the first condition, $f(f(f(2))) = f(3)$, so $f(3) = 9$.

Now, let's use the second equation to find $f(4)$ in terms of $f(2)$: $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$.

And we know that $f(4) = 8$ from the first equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$ when $n = 1$. So we have $8 = 2f(2) + 1$.

Solving this equation gives $f(2) = 7/2$, which is not a natural number. So there must be a mistake in our work.

Let's go back and check our steps.

We noticed that we got a fraction for $f(2)$, so let's try another approach. Let's first find $f(3)$ using the second equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. We get $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$.

Then, we plug in $n = 3$ into the first equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. We get $f(f(f(3))) = 8*3 - 7 = 19$.

By the first condition, $f(f(f(3))) = f(4)$, so $f(4) = 19$.

Now, let's use the second equation to find $f(2)$ in terms of $f(1)$: $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.

And we know that $f(4) = 19$, so $19 = 2f(2) + 1$.

Solving this equation gives $f(2) = 9$.

Now, let's use the second equation to find $f(1)$ in terms of $f(2)$: $f(1) = (f(2) - 1)/2$.

And we know that $f(2) = 9$, so $f(1) = (9 - 1)/2 = 4$.

Now we have found $f(1) = 4$ and $f(2) = 9$. Let's check if these values satisfy the original conditions.

For the first condition, we have $f(f(f(1))) = f(f(9)) = f(17)$. But $f(f(f(1))) = f(4)$, so $f(4) = f(17)$. From the second equation, $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2*9 + 1 = 19$, and from the first equation, $f(17) = 8*1 - 7 = 1$. So we have $19 = 1$, which is not possible.

So we made a mistake in our work. Let's go back and check our steps.

We noticed that we got a contradiction when checking the first condition. So let's try another approach. Let's first find $f(4)$ using the second equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. We get $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$.

Then, we plug in $n = 4$ into the first equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. We get $f(f(f(4))) = 8*4 - 7 = 25$.

By the first condition, $f(f(f(4))) = f(5)$, so $f(5) = 25$.

Now, let's use the second equation to find $f(2)$ in terms of $f(1)$: $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.

And we know that $f(5) = 25$, so $25 = 2f(2) + 1$.

Solving this equation gives $f(2) = 12$.

Now, let's use the second equation to find $f(1)$ in terms of $f(2)$: $f(1) = (f(2) - 1)/2$.

And we know that $f(2) = 12$, so $f(1) = (12 - 1)/2 = 5.5$. But $f(1)$ has to be a natural number, so there must be a mistake in our work. Let's go back and check our steps.

We noticed that we got a fraction for $f(1)$, so let's try another approach. Let's first find $f(4)$ using the second equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. We get $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$.

Then, we plug in $n = 4$ into the first equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. We get $f(f(f(4))) = 8*4 - 7 = 25$.

By the first condition, $f(f(f(4))) = f(5)$, so $f(5) = 25$.

3_**Problem:** 

"Let $d(n)$ denote the number of positive integers that divide $n$ , including $1$ and $n$ . For example, $d(1)=1,d(2)=2,$ and $d(12)=6$ . (This function is known as the divisor function.) Let \[f(n)=\frac{d(n)}{\sqrt [3]n}.\] There is a unique positive integer $N$ such that $f(N)>f(n)$ for all positive integers $n\ne N$ . What is the sum of the digits of $N?$"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:
We consider the prime factorization of $n:$ \[n=\prod_{i=1}^{k}p_i^{e_i}.\] By the Multiplication Principle, we have \[d(n)=\prod_{i=1}^{k}(e_i+1).\] Now, we rewrite $f(n)$ as \[f(n)=\frac{d(n)}{\sqrt [3]n}=\frac{\prod_{i=1}^{k}(e_i+1)}{\prod_{i=1}^{k}p_i^{e_i/3}}=\prod_{i=1}^{k}\frac{e_i+1}{p_i^{{e_i}/3}}.\] As $f(n)>0$ for all positive integers $n,$ note that $f(a)>f(b)$ if and only if $f(a)^3>f(b)^3$ for all positive integers $a$ and $b.$ So, $f(n)$ is maximized if and only if \[f(n)^3=\prod_{i=1}^{k}\frac{(e_i+1)^3}{p_i^{{e_i}}}\] is maximized.
For each independent factor $\frac{(e_i+1)^3}{p_i^{e_i}}$ with a fixed prime $p_i,$ where $1\leq i\leq k,$ the denominator grows faster than the numerator, as exponential functions always grow faster than polynomial functions. Therefore, for each prime $p_i$ with $\left(p_1,p_2,p_3,p_4,\ldots\right)=\left(2,3,5,7,\ldots\right),$ we look for the nonnegative integer $e_i$ such that $\frac{(e_i+1)^3}{p_i^{e_i}}$ is a relative maximum: \[\begin{array}{c|c|c|c|c}  & & & & \\ [-2.25ex] \boldsymbol{i} & \boldsymbol{p_i} & \boldsymbol{e_i} & \boldsymbol{\dfrac{(e_i+1)^3}{p_i^{e_i}}} & \textbf{Max?} \\ [2.5ex] \hline\hline  & & & & \\ [-2ex] 1 & 2 & 0 & 1 & \\      & & 1 & 4 & \\     & & 2 & 27/4 &\\     & & 3 & 8 & \checkmark\\     & & 4 & 125/16 & \\ [0.5ex] \hline   & & & & \\ [-2ex] 2 & 3 & 0 & 1 &\\     & & 1 & 8/3 & \\     & & 2 & 3 &  \checkmark\\     & & 3 & 64/27 &  \\ [0.5ex] \hline   & & & & \\ [-2ex] 3 & 5 & 0 & 1 &  \\     & & 1 & 8/5 &  \checkmark\\     & & 2 & 27/25 & \\ [0.5ex] \hline   & & & & \\ [-2ex] 4 & 7 & 0 & 1 &  \\     & & 1 & 8/7 &  \checkmark\\     & & 2 & 27/49 & \\ [0.5ex] \hline   & & & & \\ [-2ex] \geq5 & \geq11 & 0 & 1 & \checkmark \\     & & \geq1 & \leq8/11 &   \\ [0.5ex] \end{array}\] Finally, the positive integer we seek is $N=2^3\cdot3^2\cdot5^1\cdot7^1=2520.$ The sum of its digits is $2+5+2+0=\boxed{9}.$ The answer is $\boxed{9}$

**Problem:** 

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


Setting $n = 1$ in the first equation, we have $f(f(f(1))) = 8(1) - 7 = -1$. However, since $f$ maps only to positive integers, $f(f(f(1))) = -1$ is not possible. So, let's consider the second equation.
Setting $n = 2$ in the second equation, we have $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$. Now, setting $n = f(2)$ in the second equation, we have $f(2f(2)) = 2f(f(2)) + 1$. Substituting $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$ into this equation, we get $f(f(4)) = 2f(f(2)) + 1$. Since $f(f(f(1))) = -1$, we have $f(1) = 1$ from the first equation. Substituting $f(1) = 1$ into the second equation, we get $f(2) = 3$. Now, substituting $f(2) = 3$ into $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$, we get $f(4) = 7$. Finally, substituting $f(2) = 3$ and $f(4) = 7$ into $f(f(4)) = 2f(f(2)) + 1$, we get $f(7) = 2f(3) + 1$.

Now, let's try to find a pattern. We know that $f(1) = 1$, $f(2) = 3$, $f(4) = 7$, and $f(f(4)) = f(7) = 2f(3) + 1$. We can see that $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ for $n = 1, 2, 4$. So, it seems reasonable to conjecture that $f(n) = 2n - 1$ for all positive integers $n$.

Let's check if this function satisfies both conditions.
For the first condition, we have $f(f(f(n))) = f(f(2n - 1)) = f(2(2n - 1) - 1) = f(4n - 3) = 2(4n - 3) - 1 = 8n - 7$. So, the first condition holds.
For the second condition, we have $f(2n) = 2(2n) - 1 = 4n - 1 = 2f(n) + 1$. So, the second condition also holds.

Therefore, $f(n) = 2n - 1$ is the function that satisfies both conditions. To find $f(100)$, we substitute $n = 100$ into $f(n) = 2n - 1$ to get $f(100) = 2(100) - 1 = 199$.
The answer is: $199$

**Problem:** 

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


To find the value of $f(100)$, we need to first find a pattern in the function $f$.

From the given conditions, we have $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. Let's set $n=1$, we get $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1$. So $f(f(f(1)))=1$.
Now let's set $n=2$, we get $f(f(f(2)))=8(2)-7=9$. So $f(f(f(2)))=9$.
Setting $n=3$, we get $f(f(f(3)))=8(3)-7=17$. So $f(f(f(3)))=17$.
From these results, we can observe a pattern that $f(f(f(n)))=4n-3$.

Now let's use the second given condition, $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We can substitute $n=f(n)$ into this equation to get $f(2f(n))=2f(f(n))+1$.
Setting $n=1$, we get $f(2f(1))=2f(f(1))+1$. Since $f(f(f(1)))=1$, we have $f(2f(1))=2f(1)+1$. But from the pattern we observed above, we have $f(f(f(1)))=1$, so $f(2)=2f(1)+1$.

Let's solve for $f(1)$ from this equation. We know $f(2)=2f(1)+1$. From the pattern we observed earlier, we have $f(f(f(2)))=9$, so $f(4)=9$. So $2f(1)+1=9$. Solving for $f(1)$ gives us $f(1)=4$.

Now we can substitute $f(1)=4$ into the equation $f(2)=2f(1)+1$ to get $f(2)=2(4)+1=9$.

Let's continue this process to find the values of $f(3), f(4), f(5), \ldots$.

We have $f(3)=f\left(\frac{f(2)+1}{2}\right)=f\left(\frac{9+1}{2}\right)=f(5)=15$.

We have $f(4)=f\left(\frac{f(3)+1}{2}\right)=f\left(\frac{15+1}{2}\right)=f(8)=19$.

We have $f(5)=f\left(\frac{f(4)+1}{2}\right)=f\left(\frac{19+1}{2}\right)=f(10)=23$.

And so on. By continuing this process, we can find the values of $f(n)$ for all positive integers $n$.

Finally, to find $f(100)$, we can use the pattern we observed earlier, $f(f(f(n)))=4n-3$. We know that $f(f(f(100)))=8(100)-7=793$. So we have $f(100)=f\left(\frac{793+3}{4}\right)=f(199)=799$.

Therefore, $f(100)=799$.
The answer is $\boxed{799}$.

**Problem:** 

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


First, let's substitute $n=1$ into the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we get $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$. So $f(f(f(1)))=1$.

Then, let's substitute $n=2$ into the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we get $f(f(f(2)))=8*2-7=9$. So $f(f(f(2)))=9$.

But we know that $f(f(f(2)))=f(f(2f(1)+1))=f(f(3))$ from the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.

So we have $f(f(3))=9$.

Let's substitute $n=3$ into the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we get $f(f(f(3)))=8*3-7=17$. So $f(f(f(3)))=17$.

But we know that $f(f(f(3)))=f(f(2f(1)+1))=f(f(3))$ from the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.

So we have $f(f(3))=17$.

But from $f(f(3))=9$ and $f(f(3))=17$, we have $9=17$, which is a contradiction.

So we must have made a mistake in our reasoning. Let's go back and re-examine our work.

We found that $f(f(f(1)))=1$, $f(f(f(2)))=9$, and $f(f(f(3)))=17$.

Notice that the numbers $1$, $9$, and $17$ are in an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of $8$.

Also, notice that $f(1)=1$, $f(2)=3$, and $f(3)=5$.

These numbers $1$, $3$, and $5$ are also in an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of $2$.

So we may have found a pattern:
\[f(n)=2n-1.\]

Let's check this pattern by substituting $n=100$ into $f(n)=2n-1$:
\[f(100)=2*100-1=199.\]

Therefore, $f(100)=199$. The answer is: $199$

Therefore, for each prime $p_i$ with $\left(p_1,p_2,p_3,p_4,\ldots\right)=\left(2,3,5,7,\ldots\right),$ we look for the nonnegative integer $e_i$ such that $\frac{(e_i+1)^3}{p_i^{e_i}}$ is a relative maximum: \[\begin{array}{c|c|c|c|c}  & & & & \\ [-2.25ex] \boldsymbol{i} & \boldsymbol{p_i} & \boldsymbol{e_i} & \boldsymbol{\dfrac{(e_i+1)^3}{p_i^{e_i}}} & \textbf{Max?} \\ [2.5ex] \hline\hline  & & & & \\ [-2ex] 1 & 2 & 0 & 1 & \\      & & 1 & 4 & \\     & & 2 & 27/4 &\\     & & 3 & 8 & \checkmark\\     & & 4 & 125/16 & \\ [0.5ex] \hline   & & & & \\ [-2ex] 2 & 3 & 0 & 1 &\\     & & 1 & 8/3 & \\     & & 2 & 3 &  \checkmark\\     & & 3 & 64/27 &  \\ [0.5ex] \hline   & & & & \\ [-2ex] 3 & 5 & 0 & 1 &  \\     & & 1 & 8/5 &  \checkmark\\     & & 2 & 27/25 & \\ [0.5ex] \hline   & & & & \\ [-2ex] 4 & 7 & 0 & 1 &  \\     & & 1 & 8/7 &  \checkmark\\     & & 2 & 27/49 & \\ [0.5ex] \hline   & & & & \\ [-2ex] \geq5 & \geq11 & 0 & 1 & \checkmark \\     & & \geq1 & \leq8/11 &   \\ [0.5ex] \end{array}\] Finally, the positive integer we seek is $N=2^3\cdot3^2\cdot5^1\cdot7^1=2520.$ The sum of its digits is $2+5+2+0=\boxed{9}.$ The answer is $\boxed{9}$

**Problem:** 

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:



Given $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, if we plug in $n=1$, we get $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1$, which implies that $f(f(1))=1$.

Now, given $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, if we plug in $n=1$, we get $f(2)=2f(1)+1$. Since $f(1)=1$, we get $f(2)=2*1+1=3$.

Again, using the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, if we plug in $n=2$, we get $f(4)=2f(2)+1$. Since $f(2)=3$, we get $f(4)=2*3+1=7$.

Now, we can use the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to find $f(1)$. If we plug in $n=1$, we get $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1$, which implies that $f(f(1))=1$.

Since we know that $f(1)=1$, we can substitute this into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to get $f(2)=2*1+1=3$.

Again, using the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, if we plug in $n=2$, we get $f(4)=2f(2)+1$. Since $f(2)=3$, we get $f(4)=2*3+1=7$.

Finally, using the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, if we plug in $n=4$, we get $f(f(f(4)))=8(4)-7=23$, which implies that $f(f(7))=23$.

Now, we can substitute $f(7)=23$ into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to get $f(14)=2*23+1=47$.

Again, using the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, if we plug in $n=14$, we get $f(28)=2f(14)+1=2*47+1=95$.

Continuing this process, we can find that $f(56)=191$, $f(112)=383$, $f(224)=767$, and so on.

However, we can notice a pattern here. We have $f(1)=1$, $f(2)=3$, $f(4)=7$, $f(7)=23$, $f(14)=47$, $f(28)=95$, $f(56)=191$, $f(112)=383$, $f(224)=767$, and so on. The values of $f(n)$ are all one less than a power of 2.

In particular, we can see that $f(n)=2^k-1$ for some positive integer $k$. From the given equations, we can deduce that $k$ must be the number of 1's in the binary representation of $n$. For example, $1=2^0$, $3=2^1-1$, $7=2^3-1$, and so on.

Therefore, for $n=100$, we need to find the number of 1's in the binary representation of 100. The binary representation of 100 is $1100100$, which has five 1's. So $k=5$.

Therefore, $f(100)=2^5-1=32-1=31$. So the answer is $f(100)=31$.
The answer is: $31$

"Let $d(n)$ denote the number of positive integers that divide $n$ , including $1$ and $n$ . For example, $d(1)=1,d(2)=2,$ and $d(12)=6$ . (This function is known as the divisor function.)

We consider the prime factorization of $n:$ \[n=\prod_{i=1}^{k}p_i^{e_i}.\] By the Multiplication Principle, we have \[d(n)=\prod_{i=1}^{k}(e_i+1).\] Now, we rewrite $f(n)$ as \[f(n)=\frac{d(n)}{\sqrt [3]n}=\frac{\prod_{i=1}^{k}(e_i+1)}{\prod_{i=1}^{k}p_i^{e_i/3}}=\prod_{i=1}^{k}\frac{e_i+1}{p_i^{{e_i}/3}}.\] As $f(n)>0$ for all positive integers $n,$ note that $f(a)>f(b)$ if and only if $f(a)^3>f(b)^3$ for all positive integers $a$ and $b.$ So, $f(n)$ is maximized if and only if \[f(n)^3=\prod_{i=1}^{k}\frac{(e_i+1)^3}{p_i^{{e_i}}}\] is maximized.

**Problem:** 

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


First, we plug $n = 1$ into the second equation to get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.
Then, we plug $n = f(1)$ into the first equation to get $f(f(f(f(1)))) = 8f(1) - 7$.
But since $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, we have $f(f(f(f(1)))) = 8f(1) - 7$.
Comparing these two equations, we have $f(f(f(f(1)))) = f(2)$, so $f(2) = 8f(1) - 7$.
We can substitute $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$ into this equation to get $2f(1) + 1 = 8f(1) - 7$.
Simplifying, we get $6f(1) = 8$, so $f(1) = \frac{4}{3}$.
But $f(1)$ must be a natural number, so this solution is not possible.

Let's try a different approach.
We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$.
If we plug in $n = 1$, we get $f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = 1$.
Since $f(1)$ is a natural number, we can try to find a function that satisfies this equation.
Let's try $f(n) = 2n - 1$.
We can check that $f(f(f(n))) = f(f(2n - 1)) = f(2(2n - 1) - 1) = f(4n - 3) = 2(4n - 3) - 1 = 8n - 7$, which is exactly what we want.
Now we need to check if this function also satisfies the second equation.
Plugging in $n = 2$ into the second equation, we get $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$.
We know that $f(4) = 2(2*f(1) + 1) - 1 = 2(2*1 + 1) - 1 = 6$.
And $2f(2) + 1 = 2(2f(1) + 1) + 1 = 2(2*1 + 1) + 1 = 6$.
So this function does indeed satisfy both equations.

Now we can find $f(100)$.
We know that $f(n) = 2n - 1$, so $f(100) = 2*100 - 1 = 199$.
Therefore, $f(100) = 199$.
The answer is: $199$

**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:



First, let's plug in $n=1$ into the second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We get $f(2)=2f(1)+1$.

Then, let's plug in $f(1)$ into this equation. We know that $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$, so $f(1)$ is the number such that $f(f(f(1)))=1$. From the first equation, we get $f(1)=1$.

Now we can plug in $f(1)=1$ into the equation $f(2)=2f(1)+1$ to get $f(2)=2*1+1=3$.

Now let's plug in $n=2$ into the second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We get $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2*3+1=7$.

Again, let's plug in $f(2)=3$ into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to get $f(6)=2f(3)+1$.

And again, let's plug in $f(3)$ into this equation. We know that $f(f(f(3)))=8*3-7=17$, so $f(3)$ is the number such that $f(f(f(3)))=17$. From the first equation, we get $f(3)=3$.

So we have $f(6)=2f(3)+1=2*3+1=7$.

Finally, let's plug in $n=100$ into the second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We get $f(200)=2f(100)+1$.

And again, let's plug in $f(100)$ into this equation. We know that $f(f(f(100)))=8*100-7=793$, so $f(100)$ is the number such that $f(f(f(100)))=793$. From the first equation, we get $f(100)=100$.

So we have $f(200)=2f(100)+1=2*100+1=201$.

Therefore, $f(100)=100$. The answer is: $100$

**Problem:** 

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:



We are given the equations $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.

By setting $n=1$ in the second equation, we get $f(2)=2f(1)+1$.

Again by setting $n=f(1)$ in the second equation, we get $f(2f(1))=2f(f(1))+1$.

Then by setting $n=f(f(1))$ in the first equation, we get $f(f(f(f(1)))) = 8f(f(1)) - 7$. But from the given equations, we know $f(f(f(1)))=f(2)$, so we can substitute $f(2)$ into this equation to get $f(2) = 8f(f(1)) - 7$.

But we know from the equation $f(2)=2f(1)+1$ that $2f(1)+1 = 8f(f(1)) - 7$. Rearranging this equation gives $8f(f(1)) = 2f(1) + 8$, or $8f(f(1)) - 2f(1) = 8$, or $2f(1)(4 - 1) = 8$, or $6f(1) = 8$, or $f(1) = \frac{8}{6} = \frac{4}{3}$.

However, $f(1)$ is a natural number, and $\frac{4}{3}$ is not. This means we must have made an error somewhere. Let's go back and check our work.

We found that $f(2) = 8f(f(1)) - 7$. But from the second equation, we also have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. Setting these two equal to each other gives $8f(f(1)) - 7 = 2f(1) + 1$, or $8f(f(1)) = 2f(1) + 8$, or $4f(f(1)) = f(1) + 4$, or $3f(f(1)) = 4$.

Again, this is a contradiction because the left side is a multiple of 3 and the right side is not. Let's try a different approach.

We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. Setting $n=1$ gives $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1$. This means that $f(1)$ is a number such that when we apply the function $f$ three times, we get 1.

Let's try a few numbers to see what we get when we apply the function $f$ three times. If we start with $n=1$, we have $f(1)$, then $f(f(1))$, then $f(f(f(1)))$.

If $f(1)=1$, then $f(f(1))=f(1)=1$ and $f(f(f(1)))=f(1)=1$, which is not equal to 1.

If $f(1)=2$, then $f(f(1))=f(2)$ and $f(f(f(1)))=f(f(2))$. But from the second equation, we have $f(2)=2f(1)+1=2(2)+1=5$. So $f(f(2))=f(5)$. But we don't know what $f(5)$ is yet.

If $f(1)=3$, then $f(f(1))=f(3)$ and $f(f(f(1)))=f(f(3))$. But we don't know what $f(3)$ is yet.

Let's try $f(1)=4$. Then $f(f(1))=f(4)$ and $f(f(f(1)))=f(f(4))$. But we don't know what $f(4)$ is yet.

## QUESTION 4 - 11 
- TIME_SPENT : 986 secs

11_**Problem:** 

"Let $d(n)$ denote the number of positive integers that divide $n$ , including $1$ and $n$ . For example, $d(1)=1,d(2)=2,$ and $d(12)=6$ . (This function is known as the divisor function.) Let \[f(n)=\frac{d(n)}{\sqrt [3]n}.\] There is a unique positive integer $N$ such that $f(N)>f(n)$ for all positive integers $n\ne N$ . What is the sum of the digits of $N?$"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:
We consider the prime factorization of $n:$ \[n=\prod_{i=1}^{k}p_i^{e_i}.\] By the Multiplication Principle, we have \[d(n)=\prod_{i=1}^{k}(e_i+1).\] Now, we rewrite $f(n)$ as \[f(n)=\frac{d(n)}{\sqrt [3]n}=\frac{\prod_{i=1}^{k}(e_i+1)}{\prod_{i=1}^{k}p_i^{e_i/3}}=\prod_{i=1}^{k}\frac{e_i+1}{p_i^{{e_i}/3}}.\] As $f(n)>0$ for all positive integers $n,$ note that $f(a)>f(b)$ if and only if $f(a)^3>f(b)^3$ for all positive integers $a$ and $b.$ So, $f(n)$ is maximized if and only if \[f(n)^3=\prod_{i=1}^{k}\frac{(e_i+1)^3}{p_i^{{e_i}}}\] is maximized.
For each independent factor $\frac{(e_i+1)^3}{p_i^{e_i}}$ with a fixed prime $p_i,$ where $1\leq i\leq k,$ the denominator grows faster than the numerator, as exponential functions always grow faster than polynomial functions. Therefore, for each prime $p_i$ with $\left(p_1,p_2,p_3,p_4,\ldots\right)=\left(2,3,5,7,\ldots\right),$ we look for the nonnegative integer $e_i$ such that $\frac{(e_i+1)^3}{p_i^{e_i}}$ is a relative maximum: \[\begin{array}{c|c|c|c|c}  & & & & \\ [-2.25ex] \boldsymbol{i} & \boldsymbol{p_i} & \boldsymbol{e_i} & \boldsymbol{\dfrac{(e_i+1)^3}{p_i^{e_i}}} & \textbf{Max?} \\ [2.5ex] \hline\hline  & & & & \\ [-2ex] 1 & 2 & 0 & 1 & \\      & & 1 & 4 & \\     & & 2 & 27/4 &\\     & & 3 & 8 & \checkmark\\     & & 4 & 125/16 & \\ [0.5ex] \hline   & & & & \\ [-2ex] 2 & 3 & 0 & 1 &\\     & & 1 & 8/3 & \\     & & 2 & 3 &  \checkmark\\     & & 3 & 64/27 &  \\ [0.5ex] \hline   & & & & \\ [-2ex] 3 & 5 & 0 & 1 &  \\     & & 1 & 8/5 &  \checkmark\\     & & 2 & 27/25 & \\ [0.5ex] \hline   & & & & \\ [-2ex] 4 & 7 & 0 & 1 &  \\     & & 1 & 8/7 &  \checkmark\\     & & 2 & 27/49 & \\ [0.5ex] \hline   & & & & \\ [-2ex] \geq5 & \geq11 & 0 & 1 & \checkmark \\     & & \geq1 & \leq8/11 &   \\ [0.5ex] \end{array}\] Finally, the positive integer we seek is $N=2^3\cdot3^2\cdot5^1\cdot7^1=2520.$ The sum of its digits is $2+5+2+0=\boxed{9}.$ The answer is $\boxed{9}$

**Problem:** 

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


First, let's find $f(1)$. Using the second equation, we have $f(2f(1)) = 2f(f(1)) + 1$. If we plug in $n=f(1)$, we get $f(f(f(1))) = 2f(f(1)) + 1$. But from the first equation, we know $f(f(f(1))) = 8(1) - 7 = -1$. So, we have $-1 = 2f(f(1)) + 1$. Simplifying this gives $2f(f(1)) = -2$, so $f(f(1)) = -1$. 

Now, using the second equation again, we have $f(2f(1)) = 2f(f(1)) + 1$. If we plug in $n=1$, we get $f(2) = 2f(f(1)) + 1$. But we just found that $f(f(1)) = -1$, so we have $f(2) = 2(-1) + 1 = -1$. 

But if we plug $n=2$ into the second equation, we get $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$. Since we found that $f(2) = -1$, this gives $f(4) = 2(-1) + 1 = -1$.

Again, using the second equation, we have $f(2f(2)) = 2f(f(2)) + 1$. If we plug in $n=2$, we get $f(4) = 2f(f(2)) + 1$. But we just found that $f(4) = -1$, so we have $-1 = 2f(f(2)) + 1$. Simplifying this gives $2f(f(2)) = -2$, so $f(f(2)) = -1$. But we already found that $f(f(1)) = -1$, so $f(f(2)) = f(f(1))$. Since the function $f$ is one-to-one (i.e., each value of $f(n)$ corresponds to exactly one value of $n$), we must have $f(2) = f(1)$. But we already found that $f(2) = -1$ and $f(1) = -1$, so indeed $f(2) = f(1)$.

So we have found that $f(1) = -1$. 

Now, using the second equation again, we have $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. If we plug in $n=1$, we get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. But we found that $f(1) = -1$, so we have $f(2) = 2(-1) + 1 = -1$. But this is a contradiction, because we already found that $f(2) = -1$ using the first equation. 

So we must have made a mistake in our reasoning. Let's go back and reevaluate our steps.

We started with the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$ and plugged in $n = 1$ to get $f(f(f(1))) = -1$. Then we used the second equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to find that $f(2) = -1$. 

But when we plugged in $n = 2$ into the second equation, we got $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2(-1) + 1 = -1$, which led to $f(f(2)) = -1$. But we already knew that $f(f(1)) = -1$, so $f(f(2)) = f(f(1))$. This implied that $f(2) = f(1)$, but we had already found that $f(2) = -1$ and $f(1) = -1$, so $f(2) = f(1)$ was true.

However, when we plugged $n = 1$ into the second equation to get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$, we got $f(2) = 2(-1) + 1 = -1$. But this was a contradiction, because we had already found that $f(2) = -1$ using the first equation.

The mistake in our reasoning was that we assumed that $f(f(2)) = -1$. Let's try to reevaluate our steps.

We started with the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$ and plugged in $n = 1$ to get $f(f(f(1))) = -1$. Then we used the second equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to find that $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2(-1) + 1 = -1$.

But when we plugged in $n = 2$ into the second equation, we got $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2(-1) + 1 = -1$, which led to $f(f(2)) = -1$. But we already knew that $f(f(1)) = -1$, so $f(f(2)) = f(f(1))$. This implied that $f(2) = f(1)$, but we had already found that $f(2) = -1$ and $f(1) = -1$, so $f(2) = f(1)$ was true.

However, when we plugged $n = 1$ into the second equation to get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$, we got $f(2) = 2(-1) + 1 = -1$. But this was true, so there was no contradiction in our reasoning.

So we have found that $f(1) = -1$ and $f(2) = -1$. Now let's use the second equation again to find $f(4)$: $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2(-1) + 1 = -1$. Continuing this pattern, we can find that $f(8) = -1$, $f(16) = -1$, and so on.

Now let's consider the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. If we plug in $n = 100$, we get $f(f(f(100))) = 8(100) - 7 = 793$. But we know that $f(f(f(100))) = f(f(f(2 \cdot 50))) = f(f(2f(50))) = f(2f(f(50))) = 2f(f(f(

**Problem:** 

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


We are given that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. Setting $n=f(n)$ gives us $f(f(f(f(n))))=8f(n)-7$. But we also know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, so we can set these two equal to each other: $8f(n)-7=8n-7$. This simplifies to $8f(n)=8n$, so we have $f(n)=n$.

We can check that this solution works by substituting $f(n)=n$ into both equations:
For the first equation, $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ becomes $f(f(n))=8n-7$, and then $f(n)=8n-7$, which simplifies to $n=8n-7$, which is true if $n=1$.
For the second equation, $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ becomes $f(2n)=2n+1$, and substituting $f(n)=n$ gives us $2f(n)+1=2n+1$, which is also true if $f(n)=n$.

Therefore, the function $f(n)=n$ is the solution to the problem. To find $f(100)$, we simply substitute $n=100$ into $f(n)=n$ to get $f(100)=100$.
The answer is $\boxed{100}$.

**Problem:** 

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:



First, we plug in $n=1$ into the second equation to get $f(2)=2f(1)+1$.

Then, we plug in $n=f(1)$ into the second equation to get $f(2f(1))=2f(f(1))+1$.

But we know that $f(2)=2f(1)+1$, so we can substitute $f(2)$ into the above equation to get $f(f(2))=2f(1)+1$.

But we also know from the first equation that $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1$, so we can substitute $f(f(1))$ into the above equation to get $f(1)=2f(1)+1$.

This gives us $f(1)=-1$, but function values can't be negative, so we must have made a mistake.

Let's go back and re-examine the steps. The mistake is in the step where we substituted $f(f(1))$ into the equation. Actually, we know that $f(f(f(1)))=1$, so we can substitute $1$ into the equation $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7$ to get $f(f(1))=1$.

So, the correct steps are:

First, we plug in $n=1$ into the second equation to get $f(2)=2f(1)+1$.

Then, we plug in $n=f(1)$ into the second equation to get $f(2f(1))=2f(f(1))+1$.

But we know that $f(2)=2f(1)+1$, so we can substitute $f(2)$ into the above equation to get $f(f(1)+1)=2f(f(1))+1$.

But we also know that $f(f(1))=1$, so we can substitute $1$ into the above equation to get $f(2)=2(1)+1$.

So, $f(2)=3$.

Now, we can use the second equation to find $f(4)$: $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2(3)+1=7$.

Continuing this way, we find that $f(8)=15$, $f(16)=31$, and so on.

We notice a pattern: $f(2^n)=2^{n+1}-1$.

Now, we want to find $f(100)$. Since $100=2^2\cdot5^2$, we can use the second equation repeatedly to find $f(100)$:

$f(100)=2f(50)+1=2(2f(25)+1)+1=2(2(2f(12.5)+1)+1)+1=2(2(2(2f(6.25)+1)+1)+1)+1$.

Since $6.25=5^2/2^{2}$, we know that $f(6.25)=2(6.25)-1=11$, so

$f(100)=2(2(2(2(11)+1)+1)+1)+1=2(2(2(23)+1)+1)+1=2(2(47)+1)+1=2(95)+1=191$.

So, $f(100)=191$. The answer is $\boxed{191}$.
