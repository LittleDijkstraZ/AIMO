Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. This means that the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be equal to 2.

So we have $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, which gives $m = 200$.

Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions, and that is $m = 200$.

So the answer is $\boxed{1}$.

## QUESTION 2 - 1

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"For certain ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ of real numbers, the system of equations
\[\begin{aligned} ax+by&=1 \\ x^2 + y^2 &= 50  \end{aligned}\]has at least one solution, and each solution is an ordered pair $(x,y)\,$ of integers. How many such ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ are there?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The graph of $ax+by=1$ is a line, while the graph of $x^2+y^2=50$ is a circle centered at the origin. Therefore, $(a, b)$ satisfies the conditions if and only if the line and circle intersect at least once, and they intersect only at lattice points (points with integer coordinates).

Knowing this, it makes sense to look for lattice points on the circle whose equation is $x^2+y^2=50$. Testing cases, we find that there are twelve lattice points on the circle: $(\pm 1, \pm 7)$, $(\pm 7, \pm 1)$, and $(\pm 5, \pm 5)$ (where the two $\pm$ signs in each pair are independent of each other).

There are $\tbinom{12}{2} = 66$ pairs of these points, and each pair determines a line. However, the graph of $ax+by=1$ can never pass through the origin $(0, 0)$, since if $x=y=0$, then $ax+by=0 \neq 1$. Therefore, the six pairs which consist of diametrically opposed points are invalid, since the line through them passes through the origin. This corrects our count to $66 - 6 = 60$.

In addition, for each of the twelve points, there is a line tangent to the circle at that point, so that the only solution to the system is that one point. This brings the final total to $60 + 12 = \boxed{72}$. The answer is $\boxed{72}$

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $2$. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a graph that is a series of "steps" with width $1$ and height $2$, so the equation has $4$ solutions when the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, is strictly between $1$ and $2$.

To find the values of $m$ that satisfy this condition, we can set up the inequality $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Multiplying all parts of the inequality by $100$ gives $100 < m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from $101$ to $199$, inclusive. To find the number of these integers, we can subtract the smallest integer from the largest and add $1$. So the number of positive integers $m$ is $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $99$. The answer is: $99$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many distinct solutions are there to the equation $|x-7| = |x+1|$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
If $|x-7| = |x+1|$, then either $x-7 = x+1$ or $x-7 = -(x+1)$.  Simplifying $x-7=x+1$ gives $0=8$, which has no solutions, so no values of $x$ satisfy $x-7 = x+1$.  If $x-7 = -(x+1)$, then $x-7 = -x-1$, so $2x = 6$, which gives $x=3$.  So, there is $\boxed{1}$ solution.

Challenge: See if you can find a quick solution to this problem by simply thinking about the graphs of $y=|x-7|$ and $y=|x+1|$. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 1 and 2. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ oscillates between 1 and 2. Therefore, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be in the interval $(1,2)$ for the equation to have 4 distinct solutions.

To find the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy this condition, we can multiply all parts of the inequality by 100 to get rid of the fraction:
\[1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2.\]
Multiplying through by 100 gives:
\[100 < m < 200.\]
The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from 101 to 199, inclusive. To find the number of these integers, we can subtract the smallest integer from the largest and add 1:
\[199 - 101 + 1 = 99.\]
Therefore, there are 99 positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

The answer is: $99$

Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly four distinct solutions.

First, let's simplify the equation. Multiplying both sides by 100 gives us $100 \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = m$. This equation has four distinct solutions if and only if the equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ has two distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ can be rewritten as $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. This equation has two distinct solutions if and only if $2 + \frac{m}{100} > 0$.

Solving the inequality $2 + \frac{m}{100} > 0$ gives us $m > -200$. Since $m$ is a positive integer, the smallest possible value for $m$ is 1.

Now, we need to find the largest possible value for $m$. The equation $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ has two distinct solutions if and only if $2 + \frac{m}{100} < 3$, because the absolute value of a quantity cannot be greater than 3. Solving the inequality $2 + \frac{m}{100} < 3$ gives us $m < 100$. The largest possible value for $m$ is 99.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly four distinct solutions is the number of positive integers from 1 to 99, which is 99.
The answer is: $99$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.
2. Let's first consider the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$. Since $m$ is a positive integer, $\frac{m}{100}$ is a positive fraction.
3. The left side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, is a double absolute value function, which can take on a value between 0 and 2.
4. Therefore, for the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be a value in the range (0, 2).
5. This means $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which simplifies to $0 < m < 200$.
6. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from 1 to 199.
7. However, we are asked for the number of positive integers $m$ that make the equation have 4 distinct solutions.
8. To find this, we need to count the number of multiples of 100 in the range (1, 200).
9. The multiples of 100 in the range (1, 200) are 100 and 200.
10. Therefore, there are 2 positive integers $m$ that make the equation have 4 distinct solutions.

Now, let's write a Python script to find the number of positive integers $m$:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def count_m():
    # Define the range for m
    lower_bound = 1
    upper_bound = 200

    # Count the multiples of 100 in the range

    return count

result = count_m()

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many integers are solutions to the equation $$(x-2)^{(25-x^2)}=1?$$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
We need some basic facts from number theory: $a^0 = 1$ for any $a,$ $1^b = 1$ for any $b,$ and $(-1)^c = 1$ if $c$ is an even integer. Unless the base is a complex number (which is excluded since we are looking for integer solutions), there are no other ways to get an RHS of $1.$ Thus, either the exponent is zero $($giving the equation $25 - x^2 = 0),$ the base is $1$ $($giving $x -2 = 1),$ or the base is $-1$ and the exponent is even $($giving the simultaneous equations $x - 2 = -1$ and $25 - x^2 = 2n$ for some integer $n).$ Solving the first equation gives $x = \pm 5,$ and solving the second gives $x = 3.$ The third equation implies that $x = 1,$ in which case $25 - x^2 = 24$ is indeed even, so $x = 1$ is a valid solution. In all, there are $\boxed{4}$ integer solutions. The answer is $\boxed{4}$
