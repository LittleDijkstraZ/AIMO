Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is:
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0\]

This equation is satisfied if either of the two factors is zero. Therefore, the points that satisfy this equation are the union of the points that satisfy:
\[(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0\]
\[(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0\]
\[(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0\]
\[(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0\]

Each of these equations has solutions that form a square with side length 16. The first two equations give squares centered at the origin, and the last two equations give squares centered at $(0, 8)$ and $(8, 0)$.

The intersection of these squares is a convex polygon. This polygon is a square with side length 8. The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 64.
The answer is: $64$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Given the equation $f(x, y) = ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$, we know that $f(x, y) = 0$ if and only if either $g(x, y) = (\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $h(x, y) = (\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

1. $g(x, y) = 0$ if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This is the equation of a square with side length $20$.

2. $h(x, y) = 0$ if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This is the equation of a square with side length $16$.

Therefore, the points that satisfy the equation $f(x, y) = 0$ are the points that lie on the square with side length $20$ or the square with side length $16$. The intersection of these two squares is a smaller square with side length $8$.

The area of the convex polygon is the area of the larger square minus the area of the smaller square. The area of a square is given by the square of the side length, so the area of the larger square is $20^2 = 400$ and the area of the smaller square is $8^2 = 64$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $400 - 64 = 336$. Since $336$ is a positive integer, our solution is valid.

So the area of the convex polygon is $336$.
The answer is: $336$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is given as $$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$ This equation is satisfied if either of the two factors is zero. Therefore, the points that satisfy this equation are those that satisfy either $$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$$ or $$(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0,$$ or $$(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0,$$ or $$(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0.$$

From these equations, we can see that the points that satisfy them are:

1. $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
2. $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
3. $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
4. $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

These equations represent the lines and points that form a square with side length 16. The vertices of the square are at $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon formed by the points that satisfy the given equation is 256.
The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, we need to understand that the expression equals zero if and only if at least one of the factors equals zero. So, we have two cases to consider:

   a) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
   b) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

2. For case a), we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points lie on a square with side length 10.

3. For case b), we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that the points lie on a square with side length 16.

4. The intersection of these two cases is a square with side length 10, which is entirely contained within the larger square with side length 16.

5. The area of the square with side length 10 is $10^2 = 100$. So the area of the convex polygon is 100.

The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The condition is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

The product of two factors equals zero if and only if at least one of the factors equals zero. So, we have two separate cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
This can only happen if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This is the condition for a square with side length 10 centered at the origin.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This can only happen if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This is the condition for a square with side length 16 centered at the origin.

The intersection of these two cases is the square with side length 10, which is completely contained within the square with side length 16.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of the square with side length 10, which is $10^2 = 100$.

The positive integer area of the convex polygon is 100.
The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The expression $ ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is true if either of the two expressions is zero. This gives us two sets of equations to solve:

1. $ (\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $ (\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $ (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $ (\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From the first set of equations, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8, \vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us a square with side length 16.

From the second set of equations, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8, \vert y \vert = 8$. This also gives us a square with side length 16.

The union of these two squares is the convex polygon in question. The area of a square with side length $s$ is $s^2$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $16^2 + 16^2 = 256 + 256 = 512$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 512.
The answer is: $512$

If the product of two numbers equals zero, then at least one of the numbers must be zero. So we have two cases to consider:

1) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. The only way for this to be true is if $x + y = \pm 10$.

From $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$.

From $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only way for this to be true is if $x - y = \pm 10$.

From $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = \pm 8$.

So the four points are $(8, 10)$, $(8, -10)$, $(-8, 10)$, and $(-8, -10)$. These points form a rectangle with side lengths of 16 and 20, so the area is $16 \times 20 = 320$.

The answer is: $320$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is given as:

$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$

This equation is equal to zero if either of the two factors is zero. Therefore, we have two sets of equations:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From the first set of equations, we have:

1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
2. From $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, we have $x + y = \pm 10$.
3. From $\vert x \vert = 8$, we have $x = \pm 8$.
4. From $\vert y \vert = 8$, we have $y = \pm 8$.

Similarly, from the second set of equations, we have:

1. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
2. From $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, we have $x - y = \pm 10$.
3. From $\vert x \vert = 8$, we have $x = \pm 8$.
4. From $\vert y \vert = 8$, we have $y = \pm 8$.

The points that satisfy these conditions form a square with side length 16. Therefore, the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. So the area of the convex polygon is 256.

The solution is: $256$. The answer is: $256$.

Assistant:

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero, which means that each expression must be zero. So we have two systems of equations:

1) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

2) One of the expressions $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2$ is not equal to zero.

For the first system of equations, we have:

- $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ which means $x + y = \pm 10$
- $\vert x \vert = 8$ which means $x = \pm 8$
- $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ which means $x - y = \pm 10$
- $\vert y \vert = 8$ which means $y = \pm 8$

The solutions to this system are the intersections of these lines, which form a square with side length 16 centered at the origin.

For the second system of equations, at least one of the expressions must be nonzero. However, if any of the expressions $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2$ is nonzero, then the product of the two expressions cannot be zero. So, this system of equations has no solutions.

Therefore, the only solutions to the original equation are those from the first system of equations. The area of the square is the side length squared, which is $16^2 = 256$. So the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units.
The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



We have the equation $A \cdot B = 0$, where $A = (|x+y| - 10)^2 + (|x-y| - 10)^2$ and $B = (|x| - 8)^2 + (|y| - 8)^2$. This equation is satisfied if and only if either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$.

If $A = 0$, we have:
$$(|x+y| - 10)^2 + (|x-y| - 10)^2 = 0.$$
This implies $|x+y| = 10$ and $|x-y| = 10$. The solutions to these equations are $x+y = \pm 10$ and $x-y = \pm 10$. These four lines form a square with side length $20$.

If $B = 0$, we have:
$$(|x| - 8)^2 + (|y| - 8)^2 = 0.$$
This implies $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. The solutions to these equations are $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. These four lines form a square with side length $16$.

The two squares intersect at the points where the lines $x+y = \pm 10$ and $x-y = \pm 10$ intersect the lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. These points are the vertices of the polygon.

The side length of the larger square is $20$, so its area is $20^2 = 400$. The side length of the smaller square is $16$, so its area is $16^2 = 256$. The area of the convex polygon is the difference between the areas of the two squares: $400 - 256 = 144$.

The answer is: $\boxed{144}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



If the product of two numbers is zero, then at least one of the numbers must be zero. Thus, either
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0 \tag{1}$$
or
$$((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0 \tag{2}$$

From equation (1), we have:
$$\vert x + y \vert = 10 \text{ and } \vert x - y \vert = 10$$
This implies that $x + y = \pm10$ and $x - y = \pm10$, which gives us four lines in the plane: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

From equation (2), we have:
$$\vert x \vert = 8 \text{ and } \vert y \vert = 8$$
This implies that $x = \pm8$ and $y = \pm8$, which gives us four lines in the plane: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersection of these lines form a square with side length 10 (from $x + y = \pm10$ and $x = \pm8$), so the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Thus the equation is equivalent to the two equations $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first two equations, this implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

For the last two equations, this implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

Thus the polygon is a square with side length 16 (since the absolute value of a number is the distance from the number to zero). Therefore, the area of the polygon is $16^2 = 256$.

The answer is: $256$
