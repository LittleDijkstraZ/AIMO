 To analyze this problem, let's break it down into smaller parts. 

The equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has 4 distinct solutions. This means the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, will change sign twice as $x$ varies over the real numbers. 

The expression $\vert x-1 \vert -2$ changes sign at $x=1 \pm 2$, or $x=3$ and $x=-1$. This is because $\vert x-1 \vert$ is equal to $x-1$ for $x \geq 1$ and $1-x$ for $x < 1$. So, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$ changes from negative to positive at $x=3$ and from positive to negative at $x=-1$. 

Therefore, for the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ to have 4 distinct solutions, we need $\frac{m}{100}$ to be in the interval $[-2, 2]$. 

This implies $-200 \leq m \leq 200$. However, we are only interested in positive integers $m$, so the possible values of $m$ are $1, 2, ..., 200$. 

So, the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation has 4 distinct solutions is $\boxed{200}$.

    # The equation has 4 distinct solutions when m/100 is in the range (0, 2).

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"

To solve this problem, we can analyze the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] and find out how many ways we can set it up to have 4 distinct solutions.

Firstly, we can try to solve the equation with a specific value of $m$. The left side of the equation has two absolute values. To simplify this, we can consider the number of solutions for each case separately.

Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$
This case represents the case where both absolute values in the equation are positive or zero. To satisfy this, $x-1$ should be within the range $[-2, +\infty)$, which means $x$ should be in the range $[1-2, +\infty)$, which is $x \geq -1$. This gives us the equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$. Solving this equation, we get two solutions $x = 1 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = 1 - \frac{m}{100}$. To have 4 distinct solutions, we need this interval to be at least $[-1, 3]$, which gives $1 - \frac{m}{100} \geq -1$ and $1 + \frac{m}{100} \leq 3$. Solving these inequalities, we get $m \geq 100$ and $m \leq 200$. So, for $m$ in the interval $[100, 200]$, we have 4 distinct solutions for this case.

Case 2: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$
This case represents the case where one of the absolute values is negative. But note that the absolute value of a real number is always non-negative, so this case will never happen.

So, for $m$ in the interval $[100, 200]$, the equation has 4 distinct solutions. The number of such $m$ is $200 - 100 + 1 = 101$. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{101}$.

In Python, this can be solved as follows:

```python

def solve():
    m_values = list(range(100, 201))
    return len(m_values)

print(solve())
```
