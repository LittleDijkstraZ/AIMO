 This problem is a functional equation problem, so it does not have a direct solution by Python. Instead, we need to think about the problem and build our solution step by step.

Let's start by assuming that the function $f$ is continuous. We can start by considering the base case $f(1)$. According to the second condition, we have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. Applying the first condition, we get $f(f(f(1))) = 8(1) - 7 = 1$. Since $f(f(f(1))) = f(f(2)) = f(2)$, we have $f(2) = 1$. Substituting $f(2) = 1$ into the equation $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$, we get $1 = 2f(1) + 1$, which implies $f(1) = 0$. 

Now let's consider the general case for $f(n)$. We can use the second condition to express $f(2n)$ in terms of $f(n)$: $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. For $n = 2$, we have $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 3$. For $n = 4$, we have $f(8) = 2f(4) + 1 = 7$. Continuing this pattern, we can see that $f(2^{k}) = 2^{k+1} - 1$.

Now let's apply the first condition. For $n = 2^{k}$, we have $f(f(f(2^{k}))) = f(f(2^{k+1} - 1)) = 8(2^{k}) - 7$. Since $f(f(f(2^{k}))) = f(8(2^{k}) - 7)$, we have $f(8(2^{k}) - 7) = 8(2^{k}) - 7$. 

For $n = 3$, we can use the second condition to express $f(6)$ in terms of $f(3)$: $f(6) = 2f(3) + 1$. Since $f(6) = 7$, we have $f(3) = 3$. For $n = 6$, we can similarly find $f(12) = 2f(6) + 1 = 15$. Continuing this pattern, we can see that $f(3 \cdot 2^{k}) = 3 \cdot 2^{k+1} - 1$.

Now let's apply the first condition. For $n = 3 \cdot 2^{k}$, we have $f(f(f(3 \cdot 2^{k}))) = f(f(3 \cdot 2^{k+1} - 1)) = 8(3 \cdot 2^{k}) - 7$. Since $f(f(f(3 \cdot 2^{k}))) = f(8(3 \cdot 2^{k}) - 7)$, we have $f(8(3 \cdot 2^{k}) - 7) = 8(3 \cdot 2^{k}) - 7$.

From these observations, we can see that $f(n) = n$ for all positive integers $n$. Therefore, $f(100) = 100$.

So the answer is $\boxed{100}$.

I had some problems running your code, it seems the Sympy library is not properly installed. However, I can provide you with a possible solution to the problem:

According to the given conditions, for $n=100$, we have $f(f(f(100)))=8\cdot100-7=793$, and $f(2\cdot100)=2f(100)+1=2f(100)+1$. 

Using the second condition, we have $f(f(f(100)))=8\cdot100-7=793$, so $f(793)=8\cdot100-7=793$.

Then, $f(2\cdot100)=2f(100)+1=2f(100)+1$.

We know that $f(f(f(100)))=793$, so we can substitute $f(f(f(100)))$ with $793$ in the equation $f(2\cdot100)=2f(100)+1$ to get $f(2\cdot100)=2f(100)+1=2f(100)+1$.

Solving this equation for $f(100)$ will give us the value of $f(100)$.

Let's solve it:

$f(2\cdot100)=2f(100)+1=2f(100)+1$

=> $f(200)=2f(100)+1$.

Substitute $f(200)$ with $793$ (from $f(2\cdot100)=793$) to get:

$793=2f(100)+1$

=> $792=2f(100)$

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

$f(100)=396$.

So, the value of $f(100)$ is $\boxed{396}$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 We can solve this problem by using the two given conditions to find a pattern in the function $f$.

First, let's plug $n=1$ into the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to get $f(2)=2f(1)+1$.

Next, let's plug $n=2$ into the second condition to get $f(4)=2f(2)+1$.

Similarly, we can plug $n=3$ into the second condition to get $f(6)=2f(3)+1$.

We can continue this pattern for $n=100$ to get $f(200)=2f(100)+1$.

Now, we can plug $n=200$ into the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to get $f(f(f(200)))=8*200-7$.

Since we know that $f(200)=2f(100)+1$, we can substitute $f(200)$ into the first condition to get $f(f(f(200)))=f(f(2f(100)+1))=8*200-7$.

This simplifies to $f(f(2f(100)+1))=1593$.

Now, we can plug $n=2f(100)+1$ into the first condition to get $f(f(2f(100)+1))=8(2f(100)+1)-7=1593$.

This simplifies to $f(4f(100)+2)=1593$.

Since we know that $f(200)=2f(100)+1$, we can substitute $f(200)$ into the previous equation to get $f(4f(100)+2)=f(200)=1593$.

Now, we can divide both sides of the equation $f(4f(100)+2)=1593$ by $4$ to get $f(f(100)+\frac{1}{2})=398.25$.

This means that $f(100+\frac{1}{2})=398.25$.

Since $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can divide both sides of the equation $f(100+\frac{1}{2})=398.25$ by $2$ to get $f(50+\frac{1}{4})=199.125$.

This means that $f(50+\frac{1}{4})=199.125$.

Since $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can divide both sides of the equation $f(50+\frac{1}{4})=199.125$ by $2$ to get $f(25+\frac{1}{8})=99.5625$.

This means that $f(25+\frac{1}{8})=99.5625$.

Since $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can divide both sides of the equation $f(25+\frac{1}{8})=99.5625$ by $2$ to get $f(12.5+\frac{1}{16})=49.78125$.

This means that $f(12.5+\frac{1}{16})=49.78125$.

Since $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can divide both sides of the equation $f(12.5+\frac{1}{16})=49.78125$ by $2$ to get $f(6.25+\frac{1}{32})=24.890625$.

This means that $f(6.25+\frac{1}{32})=24.890625$.

We can see that the value of $f(n)$ is getting smaller and smaller, which means that $f(n)$ is likely to converge to a certain value.

Let's guess that $f(6.25+\frac{1}{32})=25$.

Now, we can plug $f(6.25+\frac{1}{32})=25$ into the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to get $f(12.5+\frac{1}{16})=2*25-1=49$.

This means that $f(12.5+\frac{1}{16})=49$.

We can see that the value of $f(n)$ is getting closer to $49$, which is $1$ less than $50$.

Let's guess that $f(12.5+\frac{1}{16})=50$.

Now, we can plug $f(12.5+\frac{1}{16})=50$ into the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to get $f(25+\frac{1}{8})=2*50-1=99$.

This means that $f(25+\frac{1}{8})=99$.

We can see that the value of $f(n)$ is getting closer to $99$, which is $1$ less than $100$.

Let's guess that $f(25+\frac{1}{8})=100$.

Now, we can plug $f(25+\frac{1}{8})=100$ into the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to get $f(50+\frac{1}{4})=2*100-1=199$.

This means that $f(50+\frac{1}{4})=199$.

We can see that the value of $f(n)$ is getting closer to $199$, which is $1$ less than $200$.

Let's guess that $f(50+\frac{1}{4})=200$.

Now, we can plug $f(50+\frac{1}{4})=200$ into the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to get $f(100)=2*200-1=399$.

This means that $f(100)=399$.

We can see that the value of $f(n)$ is getting closer to $400$, which is $1$ less than $400$.

Let's guess that $f(100)=400$.

Now, we can plug $f(100)=400$ into the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$

This problem is too complex for Sympy to solve directly. However, with a clever observation, we can find a function $f$ which satisfies the conditions.

Observe that if we let $f(n) = 2n + 1$, then $f(f(f(n))) = f(f(2n+1)) = f(4n+3) = 8n+7$, and $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1 = 2(2n+1) + 1 = 4n+3$, which satisfy the given conditions.

Therefore, the function $f(n) = 2n + 1$ satisfies the conditions, and we can calculate $f(100) = 2*100+1 = \boxed{201}$.

 This problem can be solved by implementing a recursive function. 

The python function `f` implements the given conditions and returns the result of `f(n)` for a given `n`. The first condition is used when `n` is a multiple of 8 (i.e., `n` is in the form of `8k`), and the second condition is used when `n` is not a multiple of 8.

print(result)
```

INTERMEDIATE OUT :

Traceback: line 6, in f
    if n % 8 == 0:
RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded in comparison

```
The solution seems to be incorrect because the depth of recursion exceeded the maximum allowed depth for Python. This happens because the function `f` is not well defined for all positive integers $n$. The first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ is not well-defined for all $n$, specifically when $n$ is not in the form of $8k$. 

Let's revisit the problem. The given conditions are:

1. $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$
2. $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$

From the first condition, we know that $f$ is a function that maps a number to another number such that the result of applying the function three times gives $8n-7$. However, this condition is not well-defined for all $n$, specifically when $n$ is not in the form of $8k$. 

The second condition, $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, is well-defined for all $n$, but it does not provide enough information to determine the value of $f(n)$ for a given $n$. 

The problem does not provide enough information to uniquely define the function $f$, so it is not possible to compute a numerical answer for $f(100)$ using the given conditions.

So, the answer is $\boxed{The problem is not well-defined}$.

    # Since f(f(f(n)))=8n−7, for n = 1 we get f(f(f(1))) = 1, thus f(f(1)) = 1
    # Since f(2n)=2f(n)+1, for f(f(1)) = 1 we get f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2
    # Hence, f(f(2)) = f(2) = 2
    # Since f(f(f(n)))=8n−7, for n = 2 we get f(f(f(2))) = 1, thus f(f(2)) = 1
    # Since f(f(2)) = f(2) = 2, it contradicts with f(f(f(n)))=8n−7 for n = 2
    
    # Since f(f(f(n)))=8n−7, for n = f(1) we get f(f(f(f(1)))) = f(f(1)) = 1, thus f(f(f(1))) = 1
    # Since f(f(f(1))) = 1, it contradicts with f(f(f(n)))=8n−7 for n = f(1)

This code solves the problem by getting the solutions for f(1), f(2), f(3), f(4), f(5), f(6), f(7), and f(8) separately, and then solving for f(100). However, due to an error in the code, it's unable to calculate the values for f(1), f(2), f(3), f(4), f(5), f(6), f(7), and f(8) correctly.

However, by analyzing the conditions given in the problem, we find that f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7. Therefore, f(f(f(1))) = 1, f(f(f(2))) = 2, f(f(f(3))) = 3, f(f(f(4))) = 4, f(f(f(5))) = 5, f(f(f(6))) = 6, f(f(f(7))) = 7, and f(f(f(8))) = 8. 

Since f(f(f(n))) = n for all n from 1 to 8, we have f(100) = f(f(f(88))) = 88. 

So, the final answer is 88. 

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{88}$.
