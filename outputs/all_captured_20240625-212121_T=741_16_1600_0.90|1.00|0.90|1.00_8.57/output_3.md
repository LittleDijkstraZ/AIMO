"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 To solve this problem, we need to find the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points that satisfy the given equation.

First, let's analyze the equation:
$((|x + y| - 10)^2 + (|x - y| - 10)^2)((|x| - 8)^2 + (|y| - 8)^2) = 0$

This equation is equal to zero if either of the two terms inside the parentheses is equal to zero. Therefore, we have two possible cases:

1. $(|x + y| - 10)^2 + (|x - y| - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(|x| - 8)^2 + (|y| - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first case, we have $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$. These are the equations of two lines parallel to the x and y axes, respectively.

For the second case, we have $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. These are the equations of two lines parallel to the x and y axes, respectively.

Now, let's find the coordinates of the intersection points of these lines:

1. Intersection of $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x| = 8$:
   - For $x = 8$, we have $y = 2$ or $y = -18$. So, the intersection points are $(8, 2)$ and $(8, -18)$.
   - For $x = -8$, we have $y = 18$ or $y = -2$. So, the intersection points are $(-8, 18)$ and $(-8, -2)$.

2. Intersection of $|x - y| = 10$ and $|y| = 8$:
   - For $y = 8$, we have $x = 2$ or $x = -18$. So, the intersection points are $(2, 8)$ and $(-18, 8)$.
   - For $y = -8$, we have $x = 18$ or $x = -2$. So, the intersection points are $(18, -8)$ and $(-2, -8)$.

Now, we have all the intersection points: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -18)$, $(-8, 18)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(2, 8)$, $(-18, 8)$, $(18, -8)$, and $(-2, -8)$. These points form a rectangle with side lengths of 16 and 32. The area of this rectangle is $16 \times 32 = 512$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points that satisfy the given equation is $\boxed{512}$.

 The only way for the expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ to equal 0 is if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ (since both terms are squares, and square roots of 0 are only 0). Similarly, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

We can split this into four cases:
- $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$
- $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$
- $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$
- $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$

Solving these gives $x = 5$ and $y = 5$, $x = -5$ and $y = 15$, $x = 5$ and $y = -15$, and $x = -5$ and $y = -5$. These are the vertices of the polygon.

The polygon is a square with side length 10 units, so its area is $10^2 = 100$ square units.

So the answer is $\boxed{100}$.

To solve this problem, we need to understand the properties of absolute value and how it can affect the equations. The given equation is a product of two terms, so either term can be zero. We have two absolute value expressions, which means the expressions inside the absolute value can be positive or negative. 

Let's consider the two terms separately:

1. $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$: 

This term equals to 0 when $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. This means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. These four equations form the sides of a square with side length 10.

2. $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$: 

This term equals to 0 when $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. This means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. These four lines form a square with side length 8.

The combined solution is the intersection of the two squares, which is a smaller square with side length 8. The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$.

So, the area of the convex polygon formed by the points satisfying the given equation is $\boxed{64}$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 To solve this problem, we can break it down into two parts:

1. Analyze the conditions for the points to satisfy.
2. Find the area of the convex polygon enclosed by these points.

Let's start with the first part:

The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

This equation is true if either of the following two conditions holds:

- $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
- $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

Let's analyze these conditions:

- If $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, then $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives $x = \pm 5$ and $y = \pm 5$.
- If $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, then $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

So, the points that satisfy the conditions are $(\pm 5, \pm 5)$, $(\pm 8, 0)$, $(0, \pm 8)$, $(0, 0)$.

Now, let's move on to the second part:

The points $(\pm 5, \pm 5)$, $(\pm 8, 0)$, $(0, \pm 8)$ form a square with side length $10$. The point $(0, 0)$ is the center of the square.

The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon enclosed by these points is $\boxed{100}$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 We can start by analyzing the problem given. It is clear that the equation is equal to zero if either of the following conditions is met:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From condition 1, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. After solving these equations, we can easily see that $x = \pm 5$ and $y = \pm 5$.

From condition 2, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

Now we have the vertices of our polygon: $(\pm 5, \pm 5)$ and $(\pm 8, \pm 8)$. Since the problem mentions that the points enclose a convex polygon, we can assume that the sides of the polygon are connected with line segments.

To find the area of the polygon, we can divide it into four right triangles, each with side lengths of 5, 5, and 10 (the diagonal of the rectangle formed by the vertices). The area of each triangle is $\frac{1}{2} \times 5 \times 5 = 12.5$, and since there are 4 triangles, the total area is $4 \times 12.5 = 50$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{50}$.
