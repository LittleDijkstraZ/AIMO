Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Approach:


The equation given in the problem is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.
The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$ and the second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$.
Setting each expression equal to zero gives us the following:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. Solving these equations gives us the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle with sides of length 10 and width 10.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. Solving these equations gives us the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with sides of length 16.
The convex polygon formed by the intersection of these lines is a square with side length 10 (since the rectangle is entirely contained within the square). The area of a square is given by side length squared, so the area of the convex polygon is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$

Approach:

 The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if either of the two factors is zero. This means that the points that satisfy the equation are the points that satisfy either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The first equation is satisfied if and only if both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two squares, centered at the origin, with side length 20. The intersection of these two squares forms a square with side length 10.

The second equation is satisfied if and only if both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This is the equation of a square with side length 16, centered at the origin.

Therefore, the points that satisfy the given equation are the points that lie inside the square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 100.
The answer is: $100$

Assistant:

Approach:

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. Therefore, either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. This means that the set of points satisfying the equation is the union of the set of points satisfying each of the two separate equations.

1. For the equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, the only way this equation can be true is if $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only way these two equations can be true simultaneously is if $x = y$ or $x = -y$. This means the set of points satisfying this equation form two lines $y = x$ and $y = -x$.

2. For the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, the only way this equation can be true is if $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The only way these two equations can be true simultaneously is if $x = 8$ or $x = -8$ and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. This means the set of points satisfying this equation form a square with vertices at $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

The intersection of the two sets of points is the set of points $(0,0)$, which is a single point. Therefore, the convex polygon formed by the union of the two sets of points is a square with side length 16 (since the distance from $(8,8)$ to $(-8,-8)$ is $8+8=16$). The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side, so the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:


The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.
Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$.
Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
The vertices of the polygon are also $(8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(8, -8)$.
The polygon is a square with side length 16.
The area of a square is the square of the length of its side, so the area of this polygon is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: 256

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

Approach:


The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. 

Let's analyze each expression separately:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$: This expression is equal to zero if and only if both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. Solving these equations gives us $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ or $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$. In both cases, we get $x = 5$ and $y = 5$. So one vertex of the polygon is $(5,5)$.

2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$: This expression is equal to zero if and only if both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. Solving these equations gives us $x = 8$ and $y = 8$. So another vertex of the polygon is $(8,8)$.

Now, we need to find the other vertices of the polygon. Notice that the expressions $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ are always non-negative, so for the product to be zero, both $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2$ must be zero. 

Similarly, we find that $x - y = 10$ and $y = 8$ implies $x = 18$, and $x + y = 10$ and $x = 8$ implies $y = -8$. So the other vertices of the polygon are $(18,-8)$ and $(8,-8)$.

The polygon is a square with side length 10. The area of the square is the square of the side length, which is $10^2 = 100$. So the area of the convex polygon is 100.

The answer is: $100$

Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:


The given equation is a product of two terms equals to zero, so either of the terms should be zero.
We can break the equation into two cases and solve each case separately.
Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
The solutions to these equations are the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$.
The area of the square is $(10\sqrt{2})^2 = 200$.
Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The solutions to these equations are the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length $16$.
The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.
However, the area of the convex polygon formed by the intersection of the solutions of both cases should be considered.
The intersection of the solutions of both cases forms a smaller square with side length $8\sqrt{2}$.
The area of this smaller square is $(8\sqrt{2})^2 = 128$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the difference of the areas of the two squares, which is $256 - 200 = 56$.
The answer is: 56

Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:

 The equation given is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either one of the terms must be zero for the entire expression to be zero. This gives us two systems of equations to solve. The solutions to these systems of equations will be the vertices of the polygon. Once we have the vertices, we can calculate the area of the polygon.

Step 1: Solve the system $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This gives us $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$. The possible values for $x$ are $-8, 8$. For each of these values of $x$, we can find the corresponding value of $y$ from the equation $\vert x + y \vert = 10$.

- If $x = 8$, then $\vert 8 + y \vert = 10$, which gives $y = 2$ or $y = -18$. So we have the points $(8, 2)$ and $(8, -18)$.
- If $x = -8$, then $\vert -8 + y \vert = 10$, which gives $y = 18$ or $y = -2$. So we have the points $(-8, 18)$ and $(-8, -2)$.

Step 2: Solve the system $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This gives us $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The possible values for $y$ are $-8, 8$. For each of these values of $y$, we can find the corresponding value of $x$ from the equation $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

- If $y = 8$, then $\vert x - 8 \vert = 10$, which gives $x = 18$ or $x = -2$. So we have the points $(18, 8)$ and $(-2, 8)$.
- If $y = -8$, then $\vert x + 8 \vert = 10$, which gives $x = 2$ or $x = -18$. So we have the points $(2, -8)$ and $(-18, -8)$.

Step 3: Combine all the vertices to form the polygon.
The vertices of the polygon are $(8, 2)$, $(8, -18)$, $(-8, 18)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(18, 8)$, $(-2, 8)$, $(2, -8)$, and $(-18, -8)$.

Step 4: Calculate the area of the polygon.
The polygon is a rectangle with length 20 and width 16. The area of a rectangle is given by length times width, so the area is $20 \times 16 = 320$.
The answer is: $320$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:


The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ equals to zero if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first case, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we know that both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ must be zero, which implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we find that the points $\left(x, y\right)$ that satisfy this case are $\left(8, 2\right)$, $\left(8, -2\right)$, $\left(2, 8\right)$, and $\left(-2, 8\right)$.

For the second case, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we know that both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2$ must be zero, which implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So the points $\left(x, y\right)$ that satisfy this case are $\left(8, 8\right)$, $\left(8, -8\right)$, $\left(-8, 8\right)$, and $\left(-8, -8\right)$.

Therefore, the points $\left(x, y\right)$ that satisfy the given equation are the vertices of a square with side length $10$. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So the area of the convex polygon is $100$. The answer is: $100$

Approach:

 The equation $A \cdot B = 0$ implies that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This is satisfied only when $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$.

The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which is satisfied only when $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

The points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the given equation are therefore the vertices of a square with side length 20. To find the area of this square, we simply square the length of its side: $20^2 = 400$. So the area of the convex polygon is 400.
The answer is: 400

The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if either of the factors is zero.
If the first factor is zero, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which imply that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives the vertices of the polygon as $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, and $(-10, 0)$.
If the second factor is zero, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which imply that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives the vertices of the polygon as $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.
The polygon formed by these vertices is a square with side length 10. Therefore, the area of the polygon is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$
