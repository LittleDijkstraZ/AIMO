Approach:



1. We want the equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ to have 4 distinct solutions. This equation is equivalent to two cases: $|x - 1| - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $-(|x - 1| - 2) = \frac{m}{100}$.

2. Solving the first case, $|x - 1| - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$ gives $|x - 1| = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. This equation has two sub-cases: $x - 1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x - 1 = -(2 + \frac{m}{100})$.

3. Solving the second case, $-(|x - 1| - 2) = \frac{m}{100}$ gives $-(x - 1) - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $-x + 1 - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$, or $-x - 1 = \frac{m}{100}$, and further simplifies to $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

4. For each of the four resulting equations, we need to find the number of integer solutions for $m$.

5. Count the number of integer solutions for each equation and add them up. The sum of these counts will be the desired answer.

The steps are quite involved and may be tedious to perform by hand. However, a Python script can be written to perform these calculations. Here's a Python script that solves the problem:

Approach:

 The given equation has four distinct solutions, which means the right-hand side, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be equal to one of the four values of the absolute value expression on the left-hand side. We can analyze the possible values of the absolute value expression to find out which values of $\frac{m}{100}$ make it possible for the equation to have four distinct solutions.

Solution: The absolute value expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ can take on the following four values:
1. $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = 0$: This gives us $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$, and further simplification gives $x-1 = 2$ or $x-1 = -2$, which leads to $x = 3$ or $x = -1$.
2. $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = 1$: This gives us two cases:
   a. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 1$, which gives $\vert x-1 \vert = 3$. This leads to $x-1 = 3$ or $x-1 = -3$, which gives $x = 4$ or $x = -2$.
   b. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -1$, which gives $\vert x-1 \vert = 1$. This leads to $x-1 = 1$ or $x-1 = -1$, which gives $x = 2$ or $x = 0$.
3. $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = 2$: This gives us two cases:
   a. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 2$, which gives $\vert x-1 \vert = 4$. However, this has no solution since the absolute value of a real number cannot be negative or positive without a lower bound.
   b. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -2$, which gives $\vert x-1 \vert = 0$, which leads to $x = 1$. But this value of $x$ does not satisfy the original equation.
4. $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = 3$: This gives us two cases:
   a. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 3$, which gives $\vert x-1 \vert = 5$. However, this has no solution since the absolute value of a real number cannot be negative or positive without a lower bound.
   b. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -3$, which gives $\vert x-1 \vert = -1$. This has no solution since the absolute value of a real number cannot be negative.

From the above analysis, we can see that the values of the absolute value expression are $0, 1, 2$, which are all less than or equal to $2$. Therefore, the only possible value of $\frac{m}{100}$ is $2$, which gives us $m = 200$.
The value of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $200$. The answer is: $1$

Approach:

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions, which means the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be in the range $(0, 2)$. The reason is that the absolute value function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a graph that oscillates between 0 and 4, and it has exactly 4 distinct solutions when the right side of the equation is in this range. So we need to find how many positive integers $m$ satisfy $\frac{m}{100} \in (0, 2)$.

Solving for the range of $m$, we get $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Multiplying all sides by 100 gives $0 < m < 200$. So $m$ must be an integer in the range $(0, 200)$. The number of positive integers in this range is $200 - 1 = 199$. However, we must exclude the cases where $\frac{m}{100} = 0$ or $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, because the equation would only have 2 or 3 distinct solutions respectively in these cases.

If $\frac{m}{100} = 0$, then $m = 0$, which is not positive.

If $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, then $m = 200$, which also doesn't count because it doesn't satisfy the condition $m < 200$.

So we have 198 positive integers $m$ that make the equation have 4 distinct solutions. The answer is: $198$.
The answer is: 198

Approach:


We need to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

First, let's consider the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. The right side of the equation is always non-negative, so the number of solutions to this equation is the same as the number of solutions to the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=n$, where $n$ is a positive integer.

Now, let's consider the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=n$. This equation can be rewritten as two separate equations: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = n$ and $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -n$.

For the equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = n$, we can further rewrite it as $\vert x-1 \vert = n+2$. This equation has two solutions: $x-1 = n+2$ and $x-1 = -(n+2)$, or $x = n+3$ and $x = 1-n-2$, or $x = n+3$ and $x = -n-1$.

For the equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -n$, we can further rewrite it as $\vert x-1 \vert = 2-n$. This equation has two solutions: $x-1 = 2-n$ and $x-1 = -(2-n)$, or $x = 3-n$ and $x = n-1$.

In order for the original equation to have $4$ distinct solutions, we need to have two solutions from the first set ($x = n+3$ and $x = -n-1$) and two solutions from the second set ($x = 3-n$ and $x = n-1$).

Setting the two solutions from the first set equal to each other gives $n+3 = -n-1$, or $2n = -4$, or $n = -2$. But $n$ must be a positive integer, so there are no solutions from the first set.

Setting the two solutions from the second set equal to each other gives $3-n = n-1$, or $4 = 2n$, or $n = 2$.

So, the only value of $n$ that gives $4$ distinct solutions is $n = 2$. This means $m = 100n = 200$.

Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions, and that is $m = 200$. The answer is: $1$

Approach:


The given equation is $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ and we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which this equation has $4$ distinct solutions.

We know that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be broken down into four separate equations based on the different cases for the absolute values.

1. For $\vert x-1 \vert -2 > 0$, the equation becomes $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$.
2. For $\vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0$, the equation becomes $-( \vert x-1 \vert -2) = \frac{m}{100}$.

For each of these cases, we need to find the number of integer solutions for $m$.

Solution:

1. For the first case, we have $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$. This can be further broken down into two sub-cases:
   a. If $x-1 > 0$, then $x-1 -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = 1 + 2 + \frac{m}{100} = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.
   b. If $x-1 < 0$, then $-(x-1) -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = 1 - 2 - \frac{m}{100} = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

2. For the second case, we have $-( \vert x-1 \vert -2) = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$. This can be further broken down into two sub-cases:
   a. If $x-1 > 0$, then $x-1 -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = 1 + 2 - \frac{m}{100} = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
   b. If $x-1 < 0$, then $-(x-1) -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = 1 - 2 + \frac{m}{100} = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

For each of the four equations obtained above, we need to find the number of integer solutions for $m$. We can see that for each equation, there are two branches of solutions, one for $x > 1$ and one for $x < 1$. Each branch gives two integer solutions for $m$, one for the positive value of $m$ and one for the negative value of $m$. Since we are looking for positive integer values of $m$, we only consider the positive value of $m$.

The number of integer solutions for $m$ in each case is 2. Therefore, for the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ to have 4 distinct solutions, the sum of the number of integer solutions for $m$ in the four cases must be equal to 4. Since each case gives 2 integer solutions for $m$, the sum is $4 \times 2 = 8$. However, this is not possible since the maximum value of $m$ is 100 (as it is a fraction with denominator 100). Therefore, there must be some overlap in the solutions from the four cases.

After analyzing the four cases, we find that the overlap occurs when $m=0$. In this case, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=0$ has four distinct solutions: $x=3$, $x=1$, $x=-1$, and $x=-3$. This means that the value $m=0$ is counted twice in the sum of 8. To correct this, we subtract 2 from the sum, giving us $8-2=6$. However, this is still not possible since the maximum value of $m$ is 100.

After further analysis, we find that the overlap also occurs when $m=200$. In this case, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{200}{100}=2$ has four distinct solutions: $x=5$, $x=3$, $x=-1$, and $x=-3$. This means that the value $m=200$ is also counted twice in the sum of 8. To correct this, we subtract 4 from the sum, giving us $8-4=4$. This is possible since the maximum value of $m$ is 100.

Therefore, the only positive integer value of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is $m=200$. Hence, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 1. The answer is: 1
