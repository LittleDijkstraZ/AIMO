**Problem:** 
"Let $\mathcal{P}$ be the parabola in the plane determined by the equation $y = x^2.$  Suppose a circle $\mathcal{C}$ intersects $\mathcal{P}$ at four distinct points.  If three of these points are $(-28,784),$ $(-2,4),$ and $(13,169),$ find the sum of the distances from the focus of $\mathcal{P}$ to all four of the intersection points."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Let the four intersection points be $(a,a^2),$ $(b,b^2),$ $(c,c^2),$ and $(d,d^2).$  Let the equation of the circle be
\[(x - k)^2 + (y - h)^2 = r^2.\]Substituting $y = x^2,$ we get
\[(x - k)^2 + (x^2 - h)^2 = r^2.\]Expanding this equation, we get a fourth degree polynomial whose roots are $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ and $d.$  Furthermore, the coefficient of $x^3$ is 0, so by Vieta's formulas, $a + b + c + d = 0.$

We are given that three intersection points are $(-28,784),$ $(-2,4),$ and $(13,196),$ so the fourth root is $-((-28) + (-2) + 13) = 17.$

The distance from the focus to a point on the parabola is equal to the distance from the point to the directrix, which is $y = -\frac{1}{4}.$  Thus, the sum of the distances is
\[784 + \frac{1}{4} + 4 + \frac{1}{4} + 169 + \frac{1}{4} + 17^2 + \frac{1}{4} = \boxed{1247}.\] The answer is $\boxed{1247}$

**Problem**
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


To solve this problem, we first need to find the coordinates of points $A$ and $B$. Since they are on the line $y = 4$, we can substitute $y = 4$ into the equation of the parabola to get an equation in $x$:
\[4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l.\]
Rearranging terms, we get a quadratic equation:
\[kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0.\]
Let $x_1$ and $x_2$ be the roots of this equation. Then by Vieta's formulas, $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$.

Given that the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, we have $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 6^2 = 36$. By the difference of squares, $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = (x_2 + x_1)^2 - 4x_1x_2$, so we can substitute the values we know:
\[36 = 4 - 4\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right).\]
Simplifying, we get $4\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = -32$, or $\frac{l - 4}{k} = -8$. Solving for $l$, we get $l = 4 - 8k$.

Now we can find the coordinates of $A$ and $B$. Since $A$ and $B$ are on the line $y = 4$, their coordinates are of the form $(x_1, 4)$ and $(x_2, 4)$.

Finally, we can find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$, so the square of the distance is $x^2 + y^2$. For point $A$, this is $x_1^2 + 16$, and for point $B$, it is $x_2^2 + 16$. The sum of these squares is
\[(x_1^2 + 16) + (x_2^2 + 16) = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32.\]

We know that $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 2^2 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = 4 + 16 = 20$.

So the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $20 + 32 = 52$.

Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is 52. The answer is: $52$

"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, we need to find the points $A$ and $B$. We know that the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$, so we can set these two equal to each other and solve for $x$:
$$kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4.$$

2. This is a quadratic equation, and we know that it has two solutions, corresponding to the points $A$ and $B$. Let's denote these solutions as $x_1$ and $x_2$. The distance between $A$ and $B$ is given as 6, so we know that $|x_2 - x_1| = 6$.

3. Now, we need to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. For point $A$, this is $\sqrt{x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2}$, and for point $B$, it's $\sqrt{x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2}$.

4. We want to find the sum of the squares of these distances, so we need to calculate $x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2 + x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2$.

5. To do this, we can use the fact that $(x_1 + x_2)^2 - 4x_1x_2 = (x_2 - x_1)^2 = 36$. We also know that $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k}$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$, so we can substitute these into the equation to get:
$$\left(\frac{2k}{k}\right)^2 - 4\frac{l - 4}{k} = 36.$$

6. Solving this equation for $l$ gives us the value of $l$ in terms of $k$. Then, we can substitute this value of $l$ back into the expression for the sum of the squares of the distances to find its value in terms of $k$.

7. Finally, we need to find the value of this expression when $k = 1$. This will give us the numerical value of the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin.

Let's do this in sympy:

```python

    # Solve for l

    # Substitute l into the expression for the sum of the squares of the distances
    distance_sum_expr = k**2 + (k*1**2 - 2*k*1 + l_value)**2 + k**2 + (k*2**2 - 2*k*2 + l_value)**2

    # Simplify the expression

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, we need to find the x-coordinates of points A and B by setting the equation of the parabola equal to the equation of the line and solving for x. This gives us the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$. Let's call the roots of this equation $x_1$ and $x_2$, where $x_1$ and $x_2$ are the x-coordinates of points A and B, respectively.

2. We know that the distance between A and B is 6, so we have $|x_2 - x_1| = 6$. By Vieta's formulas, we know that $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$.

3. We want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from A and B to the origin. This is equal to $(x_1^2 + y_1^2) + (x_2^2 + y_2^2)$, where $y_1 = kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l$ and $y_2 = kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l$.

4. We can simplify this expression to $x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 2(l - 4)$.

5. We know that $(x_1 + x_2)^2 = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 2x_1x_2$, so we can substitute the values of $x_1 + x_2$ and $x_1x_2$ to get $(2)^2 = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 2(\frac{l - 4}{k})$.

6. Solving for $x_1^2 + x_2^2$, we get $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = 4 - 2(\frac{l - 4}{k}) = 4 - 2(\frac{l - 4}{k})$.

7. Substituting this into the expression for the sum of the squares of the distances, we get $4 - 2(\frac{l - 4}{k}) + 2(l - 4) = 4 - 2(\frac{l - 4}{k}) + 2l - 8 = 2l - 4 - 2(\frac{l - 4}{k})$.

8. We know that $k^2 + l^2 = 4^2 = 16$ from the Pythagorean theorem, because the line $y = 4$ is a horizontal line at a distance of 4 units from the origin.

9. Solving the equation $k^2 + l^2 = 16$ for $l$, we get $l = \sqrt{16 - k^2}$.

10. Substituting this into the expression for the sum of the squares of the distances, we get $2\sqrt{16 - k^2} - 4 - 2(\frac{\sqrt{16 - k^2} - 4}{k}) = 2\sqrt{16 - k^2} - 4 - 2\sqrt{16 - k^2} + 8 = 4$.

So the sum of the squares of the distances from A and B to the origin is 4.

The answer is: $4$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"The smallest distance between the origin and a point on the parabola $y=x^2-5$ can be expressed as $\sqrt{a}/b$, where $a$ and $b$ are positive integers, and $a$ is not divisible by the square of any prime.  Find $a+b$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the distance formula, we are trying to minimize $\sqrt{x^2+y^2}=\sqrt{x^2+x^4-10x^2+25}$. In general minimization problems like this require calculus, but one elementary optimization method that sometimes works is completing the square.  We have $$\sqrt{x^2+x^4-10x^2+25}=\sqrt{(x^2-9/2)^2+(25-81/4)}.$$This expression is minimized when the square equals $0$, i.e. when $x=\pm 3/\sqrt{2}.$ For this value of $x$, the distance is $$\sqrt{25-\frac{81}{4}}=\frac{\sqrt{19}}{2}.$$Hence the desired answer is $\boxed{21}$. The answer is $\boxed{21}$

```
The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $2(k^2 + l^2)$. However, we know that the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, and this distance is equal to the square root of the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. Therefore, we can set up the equation $6 = \sqrt{(k^2 + l^2) + (k^2 + l^2)}$, which simplifies to $6 = 2\sqrt{k^2 + l^2}$. Solving for $k^2 + l^2$ gives us $k^2 + l^2 = \frac{36}{4} = 9$.

Substituting this into the equation for the sum of the squares of the distances gives us $2(k^2 + l^2) = 2 \cdot 9 = 18$.

So the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $18$. The answer is $\boxed{18}$.

"The graph of $y=ax^2 + bx + c$ is a parabola with vertical axis of symmetry.  The vertex of this parabola is $(2,3)$ and the parabola contains the point $(4,4)$.  Find the value of $y$ when $x=6$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Because the parabola has vertex $(2,3)$, it is the graph of  \[y=a(x-2)^2+3\] for some number $a$.  In order for the graph to contain the point $(4,4)$, we must also have  \[4=a(4-2)^2+3=4a+3,\] so $a=\frac14$, and our parabola is the graph of \[y=\frac14(x-2)^2 + 3.\] Setting $x=6$ in this gives us  \[y = \frac14(6-2)^2 + 3 = 4+3=\boxed{7}.\] The answer is $\boxed{7}$

"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step.

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



First, we find the x-coordinates of points A and B by setting $y = 4$ in the equation of the parabola and solving for x. This gives us the equation $4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l$. Rearranging terms, we get $kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0$.

The roots of this quadratic equation are the x-coordinates of points A and B. Let's denote these roots as $x_1$ and $x_2$. Since the distance between A and B is 6, we know that $|x_2 - x_1| = 6$. This is equivalent to $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 36$.

By Vieta's formulas, we know that $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$. We can use these to express $(x_2 - x_1)^2$ in terms of k and l:

\[(x_2 - x_1)^2 = (x_2 + x_1)^2 - 4x_1x_2 = 4 - \frac{4(l - 4)}{k} = 36.\]

Solving this equation for $l$ gives us $l = k + 10$.

Now, we want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from A and B to the origin. This is equivalent to $x_1^2 + x_2^2$. We can use the identity $(x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = x_1^2 + x_2^2$ to find this:

\[x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 2^2 - 2\frac{l - 4}{k} = 4 - 2\frac{k + 6}{k} = 4 - 2 - \frac{12}{k} = 2 - \frac{12}{k}.\]

Since we know that $l = k + 10$, we can substitute this into the equation to get:

\[x_1^2 + x_2^2 = 2 - \frac{12}{k} = 2 - \frac{12}{1} = -10.\]

However, this result is not possible because the sum of squares of distances cannot be negative. Therefore, we must have made a mistake in our calculations. Let's go back and check our work.

After re-examining our calculations, we realize that we made a mistake in the last step. The correct equation should be:

\[x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 2^2 - 2\frac{l - 4}{k} = 4 - 2\frac{k + 6}{k} = 4 - 2 - \frac{12}{k} = 2 - \frac{12}{k}.\]

But we know that $l = k + 10$, so we should substitute this into the equation:

\[x_1^2 + x_2^2 = 2 - \frac{12}{k} = 2 - \frac{12}{1} = -10.\]

Again, this result is not possible because the sum of squares of distances cannot be negative. Therefore, we must have made another mistake.

After re-examining our calculations again, we realize that we made a mistake in the first step. The equation $4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ should be rearranged as $kx^2 - 2kx + (4 - l) = 0$, not $kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0$. Let's correct this and re-calculate:

Rearranging the equation $4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ gives us $kx^2 - 2kx + (4 - l) = 0$.

By Vieta's formulas, we know that $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{4 - l}{k}$. We can use these to express $(x_2 - x_1)^2$ in terms of k and l:

\[(x_2 - x_1)^2 = (x_2 + x_1)^2 - 4x_1x_2 = 4 - \frac{4(4 - l)}{k} = 36.\]

Solving this equation for $l$ gives us $l = k - 2$.

Now, we want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from A and B to the origin. This is equivalent to $x_1^2 + x_2^2$. We can use the identity $(x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = x_1^2 + x_2^2$ to find this:

\[x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 2^2 - 2\frac{4 - l}{k} = 4 - 2\frac{2}{k} = 4 - \frac{4}{k}.\]

Since we know that $l = k - 2$, we can substitute this into the equation to get:

\[x_1^2 + x_2^2 = 4 - \frac{4}{k} = 4 - \frac{4}{1} = 0.\]

This result is possible because the sum of squares of distances can be zero if the points A and B are the same point. In this case, the distance from A (or B) to the origin is the distance from the point of intersection to the origin.

Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from A and B to the origin is 0.

However, this result doesn't seem to make sense in the context of the problem. Let's go back and re-examine our calculations again.

After re-examining our calculations, we realize that we made a mistake in the last step. The correct equation should be:

\[x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 2^2 - 2\frac{4 - l}{k} = 4 - 2\frac{2}{k} = 4 - \frac{4}{k}.\]

But we know that $l = k - 2$, so we should substitute this into the equation:

\[x_1^2 + x_2^2 = 4 - \frac{4}{k} = 4 - \frac{4}{1} = 0.\]

Again, this result is not possible because the sum of squares of distances cannot be zero. Therefore, we must have made another mistake.

After re-examining our calculations again, we realize that we made a mistake in the first step. The equation $4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ should be rearranged as $kx^2 - 2kx + (4 - l) = 0$, not $kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0$. Let's correct this and re-calculate:

Rearranging the equation $4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ gives us $kx^2 - 2kx + (4 - l) = 0$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $\mathcal{P}$ be the parabola in the plane determined by the equation $y = x^2.$  Suppose a circle $\mathcal{C}$ intersects $\mathcal{P}$ at four distinct points.  If three of these points are $(-28,784),$ $(-2,4),$ and $(13,169),$ find the sum of the distances from the focus of $\mathcal{P}$ to all four of the intersection points."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Let the four intersection points be $(a,a^2),$ $(b,b^2),$ $(c,c^2),$ and $(d,d^2).$  Let the equation of the circle be
\[(x - k)^2 + (y - h)^2 = r^2.\]Substituting $y = x^2,$ we get
\[(x - k)^2 + (x^2 - h)^2 = r^2.\]Expanding this equation, we get a fourth degree polynomial whose roots are $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ and $d.$  Furthermore, the coefficient of $x^3$ is 0, so by Vieta's formulas, $a + b + c + d = 0.$

We are given that three intersection points are $(-28,784),$ $(-2,4),$ and $(13,196),$ so the fourth root is $-((-28) + (-2) + 13) = 17.$

The distance from the focus to a point on the parabola is equal to the distance from the point to the directrix, which is $y = -\frac{1}{4}.$  Thus, the sum of the distances is
\[784 + \frac{1}{4} + 4 + \frac{1}{4} + 169 + \frac{1}{4} + 17^2 + \frac{1}{4} = \boxed{1247}.\] The answer is $\boxed{1247}$

**Problem:** 
"The smallest distance between the origin and a point on the parabola $y=x^2-5$ can be expressed as $\sqrt{a}/b$, where $a$ and $b$ are positive integers, and $a$ is not divisible by the square of any prime.  Find $a+b$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the distance formula, we are trying to minimize $\sqrt{x^2+y^2}=\sqrt{x^2+x^4-10x^2+25}$. In general minimization problems like this require calculus, but one elementary optimization method that sometimes works is completing the square.  We have $$\sqrt{x^2+x^4-10x^2+25}=\sqrt{(x^2-9/2)^2+(25-81/4)}.$$This expression is minimized when the square equals $0$, i.e. when $x=\pm 3/\sqrt{2}.$ For this value of $x$, the distance is $$\sqrt{25-\frac{81}{4}}=\frac{\sqrt{19}}{2}.$$Hence the desired answer is $\boxed{21}$. The answer is $\boxed{21}$

The output is not a numerical value, which indicates that we made a mistake in our calculations. Let's go back and reevaluate our steps.

We are given that the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. We want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin.

First, let's find the coordinates of points $A$ and $B$. Since they lie on the line $y = 4$, we have $y = 4$ for both points. For point $A$, let's say its $x$-coordinate is $x_A$, then its coordinates are $(x_A, 4)$. Similarly, for point $B$, let's say its $x$-coordinate is $x_B$, then its coordinates are $(x_B, 4)$.

The distance between points $A$ and $B$ is given as 6, so we have $|x_B - x_A| = 6$.

Now, let's find the $x$-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$ by solving the equation for the parabola and $y = 4$:
\[kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0.\]
Let's denote the solutions of this equation as $x_A$ and $x_B$. Then we have:
\[x_A = \frac{2k + \sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k} = 1 + \frac{\sqrt{k(k - l + 4)}}{k},\]
\[x_B = \frac{2k - \sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k} = 1 - \frac{\sqrt{k(k - l + 4)}}{k}.\]

Now we can find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin:
\[(x_A^2 + 4^2) + (x_B^2 + 4^2) = x_A^2 + x_B^2 + 32.\]

Substituting the expressions for $x_A$ and $x_B$ we get:
\[(1 + \frac{\sqrt{k(k - l + 4)}}{k})^2 + (1 - \frac{\sqrt{k(k - l + 4)}}{k})^2 + 32.\]

Let's simplify this expression:
\[1 + 2\frac{\sqrt{k(k - l + 4)}}{k} + \frac{k(k - l + 4)}{k^2} + 1 - 2\frac{\sqrt{k(k - l + 4)}}{k} + \frac{k(k - l + 4)}{k^2} + 32.\]

The terms with $\frac{\sqrt{k(k - l + 4)}}{k}$ cancel out, and we are left with:
\[2 + \frac{2k(k - l + 4)}{k^2} + 32 = 34 + \frac{2(k - l + 4)}{k}.\]

Now we can substitute the given condition that the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6:
\[|x_B - x_A| = 6 \implies \left|\frac{2\sqrt{k(k - l + 4)}}{k}\right| = 6 \implies \sqrt{k(k - l + 4)} = 3k.\]

Squaring both sides gives:
\[k(k - l + 4) = 9k^2 \implies k - l + 4 = 9k \implies l = -8k + 4.\]

Substituting this into the expression for the sum of squares of distances:
\[34 + \frac{2(-8k + 4 + 4)}{k} = 34 - \frac{16k}{k} = 34 - 16 = 18.\]

So the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is 18.

However, we made a mistake in our calculations. Let's go back and reevaluate our steps.

We are given that the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. We want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin.

First, let's find the coordinates of points $A$ and $B$. Since they lie on the line $y = 4$, we have $y = 4$ for both points. For point $A$, let's say its $x$-coordinate is $x_A$, then its coordinates are $(x_A, 4)$. Similarly, for point $B$, let's say its $x$-coordinate is $x_B$, then its coordinates are $(x_B, 4)$.

The distance between points $A$ and $B$ is given as 6, so we have $|x_B - x_A| = 6$.

Now, let's find the $x$-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$ by solving the equation for the parabola and $y = 4$:
\[kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0.\]
Let's denote the solutions of this equation as $x_A$ and $x_B$. Then we have:
\[x_A = \frac{2k + \sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k}

**Problem:** 
"The graph of $y=ax^2 + bx + c$ is a parabola with vertical axis of symmetry.  The vertex of this parabola is $(2,3)$ and the parabola contains the point $(4,4)$.  Find the value of $y$ when $x=6$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Because the parabola has vertex $(2,3)$, it is the graph of  \[y=a(x-2)^2+3\] for some number $a$.  In order for the graph to contain the point $(4,4)$, we must also have  \[4=a(4-2)^2+3=4a+3,\] so $a=\frac14$, and our parabola is the graph of \[y=\frac14(x-2)^2 + 3.\] Setting $x=6$ in this gives us  \[y = \frac14(6-2)^2 + 3 = 4+3=\boxed{7}.\] The answer is $\boxed{7}$

The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $\boxed{\frac{2(18k - l + 4)}{k}}$. However, we know that the points $A$ and $B$ are distance 6 apart. Therefore, we can use the equation $(A - B)^2 = 6^2$ to find a relationship between $k$ and $l$. 

The equation of the parabola can be rewritten as $y = k(x - 1)^2 + (4 - k)$. The vertex of the parabola is at $(1, 4 - k)$. Since the line $y = 4$ is parallel to the axis of symmetry of the parabola, the distance from the vertex to the line $y = 4$ is $k$. Therefore, $k = 1$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $\mathcal{P}$ be the parabola in the plane determined by the equation $y = x^2.$  Suppose a circle $\mathcal{C}$ intersects $\mathcal{P}$ at four distinct points.  If three of these points are $(-28,784),$ $(-2,4),$ and $(13,169),$ find the sum of the distances from the focus of $\mathcal{P}$ to all four of the intersection points."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Let the four intersection points be $(a,a^2),$ $(b,b^2),$ $(c,c^2),$ and $(d,d^2).$  Let the equation of the circle be
\[(x - k)^2 + (y - h)^2 = r^2.\]Substituting $y = x^2,$ we get
\[(x - k)^2 + (x^2 - h)^2 = r^2.\]Expanding this equation, we get a fourth degree polynomial whose roots are $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ and $d.$  Furthermore, the coefficient of $x^3$ is 0, so by Vieta's formulas, $a + b + c + d = 0.$

We are given that three intersection points are $(-28,784),$ $(-2,4),$ and $(13,196),$ so the fourth root is $-((-28) + (-2) + 13) = 17.$

The distance from the focus to a point on the parabola is equal to the distance from the point to the directrix, which is $y = -\frac{1}{4}.$  Thus, the sum of the distances is
\[784 + \frac{1}{4} + 4 + \frac{1}{4} + 169 + \frac{1}{4} + 17^2 + \frac{1}{4} = \boxed{1247}.\] The answer is $\boxed{1247}$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $\mathcal{P}$ be the parabola in the plane determined by the equation $y = x^2.$  Suppose a circle $\mathcal{C}$ intersects $\mathcal{P}$ at four distinct points.  If three of these points are $(-28,784),$ $(-2,4),$ and $(13,169),$ find the sum of the distances from the focus of $\mathcal{P}$ to all four of the intersection points."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Let the four intersection points be $(a,a^2),$ $(b,b^2),$ $(c,c^2),$ and $(d,d^2).$  Let the equation of the circle be
\[(x - k)^2 + (y - h)^2 = r^2.\]Substituting $y = x^2,$ we get
\[(x - k)^2 + (x^2 - h)^2 = r^2.\]Expanding this equation, we get a fourth degree polynomial whose roots are $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ and $d.$  Furthermore, the coefficient of $x^3$ is 0, so by Vieta's formulas, $a + b + c + d = 0.$

We are given that three intersection points are $(-28,784),$ $(-2,4),$ and $(13,196),$ so the fourth root is $-((-28) + (-2) + 13) = 17.$

The distance from the focus to a point on the parabola is equal to the distance from the point to the directrix, which is $y = -\frac{1}{4}.$  Thus, the sum of the distances is
\[784 + \frac{1}{4} + 4 + \frac{1}{4} + 169 + \frac{1}{4} + 17^2 + \frac{1}{4} = \boxed{1247}.\] The answer is $\boxed{1247}$

The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $\boxed{\frac{2(18k - l + 4)}{k}}$. However, we know that the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, and this distance is equal to $2k$. So we can set up the equation $2k = 6$, which gives us $k = 3$. Substituting $k = 3$ into the expression for the sum of squares, we get:

```python

CODE RESULTS 116/3 - 2*l/3

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
116/3 - 2*l/3
```
Now, we know that the distance from the origin to a point $(x, y)$ is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. The distance from the origin to point $A$ (with coordinates $(x_1, 4)$) is $\sqrt{x_1^2 + 4^2}$, and the distance from the origin to point $B$ (with coordinates $(x_2, 4)$) is $\sqrt{x_2^2 + 4^2}$. Since the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, we have $x_2 - x_1 = 3$.

We can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is equal to the sum of the squares of the coordinates of $A$ and $B$:

$(x_1^2 + 4^2) + (x_2^2 + 4^2) = (x_1^2 + x_2^2) + 32$.

We know that $x_2 - x_1 = 3$, so $x_2 = x_1 + 3$. Substituting this into the equation above, we get:

$(x_1^2 + 4^2) + ((x_1 + 3)^2 + 4^2) = (x_1^2 + (x_1 + 3)^2) + 32$.

Simplifying this equation, we get:

$2(x_1^2 + 16) = 2x_1^2 + 18x_1 + 25$,

$32 = 18x_1 + 25$,

$7 = 18x_1$,

$x_1 = 7/18$.

Now, we can substitute $x_1 = 7/18$ into the equation $x_2 = x_1 + 3$ to find $x_2$:

$x_2 = 7/18 + 3 = 59/18$.

Finally, we can substitute $x_1 = 7/18$ and $x_2 = 59/18$ into the expression for the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin:

$((7/18)^2 + 4^2) + ((59/18)^2 + 4^2) = (49/324 + 16) + (3481/324 + 16) = 5297/324 + 5281/324 = 10578/324 = 32.6$.

However, this result is not possible because the sum of the squares of two real numbers cannot be a non-real number. We must have made a mistake in our calculations. Let's go back and check our work.

Upon reexamination, we realize that we made a mistake in our substitution of $k = 3$ into the expression for the sum of squares. The correct substitution should be $k = 3$ into the equation $2k = 6$, which gives us $k = 3$. However, this is not necessary for our solution. We made a mistake in our simplification of the equation $(x_1^2 + 4^2) + (x_2^2 + 4^2) = (x_1^2 + x_2^2) + 32$. The correct simplification should be:

$(x_1^2 + 4^2) + ((x_1 + 3)^2 + 4^2) = (x_1^2 + (x_1 + 3)^2) + 32$,

$2(x_1^2 + 16) = 2x_1^2 + 18x_1 + 25$,

$32 = 18x_1 + 25$,

$7 = 18x_1$,

$x_1 = 7/18$.

Now, we can substitute $x_1 = 7/18$ into the equation $x_2 = x_1 + 3$ to find $x_2$:

$x_2 = 7/18 + 3 = 59/18$.

Finally, we can substitute $x_1 = 7/18$ and $x_2 = 59/18$ into the expression for the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin:

$((7/18)^2 + 4^2) + ((59/18)^2 + 4^2) = (49/324 + 16) + (

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"The smallest distance between the origin and a point on the parabola $y=x^2-5$ can be expressed as $\sqrt{a}/b$, where $a$ and $b$ are positive integers, and $a$ is not divisible by the square of any prime.  Find $a+b$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the distance formula, we are trying to minimize $\sqrt{x^2+y^2}=\sqrt{x^2+x^4-10x^2+25}$. In general minimization problems like this require calculus, but one elementary optimization method that sometimes works is completing the square.  We have $$\sqrt{x^2+x^4-10x^2+25}=\sqrt{(x^2-9/2)^2+(25-81/4)}.$$This expression is minimized when the square equals $0$, i.e. when $x=\pm 3/\sqrt{2}.$ For this value of $x$, the distance is $$\sqrt{25-\frac{81}{4}}=\frac{\sqrt{19}}{2}.$$Hence the desired answer is $\boxed{21}$. The answer is $\boxed{21}$

**Problem:** 
"What is the minimum value of the expression $2x^2+3y^2+8x-24y+62$ for real $x$ and $y$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Rearranging the expression, we have  \[2x^2+8x+3y^2-24y+62\]We first complete the square in $x$. Factoring a 2 from the first two terms of the expression, we get  \[2(x^2+4x)+3y^2-24y+62\]In order for the expression inside the parenthesis to be a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(4/2)^2=4$ inside the parenthesis. Doing this, we have \[2(x^2+4x+4-4)+3y^2-24y+62 \Rightarrow 2(x+2)^2+3y^2-24y+54\]Now we complete the square in $y$. Factoring a 3 from the $y$ terms in the expression, we get \[2(x+2)^2+3(y^2-8y)+54\]In order for the expression inside the second parenthesis to be a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(8/2)^2=16$ inside the parenthesis. Doing this, we have \[2(x+2)^2+3(y^2-8y+16-16)+54 \Rightarrow 2(x+2)^2+3(y-4)^2+6\]Since the minimum value of $2(x+2)^2$ and $3(y-4)^2$ is $0$ (perfect squares can never be negative), the minimum value of the entire expression is $\boxed{6}$, and is achieved when $x=-2$ and $y=4$. The answer is $\boxed{6}$

**Problem**
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


This problem is a bit tricky and requires some mathematical insight. However, we can solve it using the following steps:

1. First, we notice that the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ can be rewritten as $(5x^2-8xy+5y^2)$, which is a perfect square: $(x-y)^2$.
2. Next, we notice that the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$, which simplifies to $2|x-2y| = 40$, or $|x-2y| = 20$.
3. This condition implies that the distance between $x$ and $2y$ is always 20. Therefore, the minimum value of $(x-y)^2$ is achieved when $x=y$, because the distance between $x$ and $2y$ is minimized when $x=y$.
4. Substituting $x=y$ into $(x-y)^2$, we get $0^2 = 0$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0, when $x=y$. The answer is: $0$

**Problem:** 
"What is the minimum value of the expression $x^2+y^2+2x-4y+8$ for real $x$ and $y$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Rearranging the expression, we have  \[x^2+2x+y^2-4y+8\]Completing the square in $x$, we need to add and subtract $(2/2)^2=1$. Completing the square in $y$, we need to add and subtract $(4/2)^2=4$. Thus, we have \[(x^2+2x+1)-1+(y^2-4y+4)-4+8 \Rightarrow (x+1)^2+(y-2)^2+3\]Since the minimum value of $(x+1)^2$ and $(y-2)^2$ is $0$ (perfect squares can never be negative), the minimum value of the entire expression is $\boxed{3}$, and is achieved when $x=-1$ and $y=2$. The answer is $\boxed{3}$

**Problem**
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


To solve this problem, we can use the method of completing the square. First, let's rewrite the given expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $(x^2-4xy+4y^2) + (y^2-4xy+4x^2) = (x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2$.
Now, let's consider the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. By the triangle inequality, we have $|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |(x-2y) - (y-2x)| = |x-2y-y+2x| = |3x-3y| = 3|x-y| = 40$.
So, we have $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$.
Now, let's substitute $u = x-2y$ and $v = y-2x$. Then, we have $|u| + |v| = 40$. By the triangle inequality, we have $|u| + |v| \geq |u-v|$. So, we have $|u-v| \leq 40$.
Now, let's substitute back $u = x-2y$ and $v = y-2x$. We have $|(x-2y) - (y-2x)| \leq 40$, which simplifies to $|x-2y-y+2x| \leq 40$, or $|3x-3y| \leq 40$. So, we have $|x-y| \leq \frac{40}{3}$.
Now, let's consider the expression $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2$. By the AM-GM inequality, we have $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2 \geq 2\sqrt{(x-2y)^2(y-2x)^2} = 2|x-2y||y-2x| = 2|x-y|\cdot|2x-y|$.
By the triangle inequality, we have $|x-y| + |2x-y| \geq |(x-y) - (2x-y)| = |x-2y| = \frac{40}{3}$.
So, we have $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2 \geq 2\cdot\frac{40}{3}\cdot|x-y| = \frac{80}{3}|x-y|$.
Now, by the inequality $|x-y| \leq \frac{40}{3}$, we have $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2 \geq \frac{80}{3}\cdot\frac{40}{3} = \frac{3200}{9}$.
So, the minimum value of $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2$ is $\frac{3200}{9}$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\frac{3200}{9}$.
The answer is: $\frac{3200}{9}$

Doing this, we have \[2(x^2+4x+4-4)+3y^2-24y+62 \Rightarrow 2(x+2)^2+3y^2-24y+54\]Now we complete the square in $y$. Factoring a 3 from the $y$ terms in the expression, we get \[2(x+2)^2+3(y^2-8y)+54\]In order for the expression inside the second parenthesis to be a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(8/2)^2=16$ inside the parenthesis.

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


This problem is a bit tricky and requires some algebraic manipulation. First, let's rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2$. Now, let's denote $a = x - 2y$ and $b = y - 2x$. Then, we have $|a| + |b| = 40$. We also know that $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2 = a^2 + b^2$.

Now, we want to minimize $a^2 + b^2$ under the condition $|a| + |b| = 40$. By the triangle inequality, we know that $|a| + |b| \geq |a + b|$, so $|a + b| \leq 40$. On the other hand, by the parallelogram law, we know that $a^2 + b^2 = (a + b)^2 - 2ab$. Since $a^2 + b^2$ is what we want to minimize, we want to minimize $(a + b)^2 - 2ab$ under the condition $|a + b| \leq 40$.

By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we know that $(a^2 + b^2)(1 + 1) \geq (a + b)^2$, so $2(a^2 + b^2) \geq (a + b)^2$. Therefore, $(a + b)^2 - 2ab \leq 2(a^2 + b^2) - 2ab = 2(a^2 + b^2 - ab)$.

Now, we want to minimize $a^2 + b^2 - ab$. By the AM-GM inequality, we know that $a^2 + b^2 - ab \geq 0$, with equality if and only if $a = b$. But from the condition $|a| + |b| = 40$, we know that $a = b$ is not possible. However, we can still minimize $a^2 + b^2 - ab$ by setting $a = -b$, which gives us $a^2 + b^2 - ab = 2a^2$.

Now, we want to find the maximum value of $2a^2$ under the condition $|a + b| \leq 40$ and $a = -b$. Since $a = -b$, we have $|a + b| = |a - a| = 0$, which is less than or equal to 40. So, the maximum value of $2a^2$ is achieved when $a = -b$.

Substituting $a = -b$ into the condition $|a| + |b| = 40$, we get $|a| + |-a| = 40$, which simplifies to $2|a| = 40$, so $|a| = 20$. Therefore, the maximum value of $2a^2$ is achieved when $a = 20$ or $a = -20$. Since $a^2 + b^2 - ab = 2a^2$, we want to minimize $2a^2$. The minimum value of $2a^2$ is achieved when $a = -20$, so the minimum value of $a^2 + b^2 - ab$ is $2(-20)^2 = 800$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $800$. The answer is: $800$

**Problem**
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


This problem is a bit more complex than the previous one, and it requires a bit of mathematical insight. However, we can still solve it using Python and some mathematical manipulation.

First, let's rewrite the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$. Now, let's consider the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite this as $5(x^2+y^2)-8xy = 5[(x-y)^2+2xy]-8xy = 5(x-y)^2-3xy$.

Now, let's use the equation $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$ to find a relationship between $x$ and $y$. We can use the property $|a| + |b| = c$ implies $a = 0$ or $b = 0$. So, we have two cases:

1. $2y - x = 0$ and $2x - y = 0$, which gives $x = y$.
2. $2y - x = 0$ and $y - 2x = 0$, which gives $x = 2y$.

Let's consider the first case $x = y$. Substituting into the expression $5(x-y)^2-3xy$, we get $5(0)^2 - 3x^2 = -3x^2$.

Now let's consider the second case $x = 2y$. Substituting into the expression $5(x-y)^2-3xy$, we get $5(y)^2 - 6y^2 = -y^2$.

Comparing the two cases, we see that the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is achieved when $x = 2y$. So, we substitute $x = 2y$ into the equation $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$ to get $|2y-2y| + |4y-y| = 40$, which simplifies to $|0| + |3y| = 40$. This gives $3y = 40$, so $y = \frac{40}{3}$. Substituting $y = \frac{40}{3}$ into $x = 2y$, we get $x = \frac{80}{3}$.

Now, we substitute $x = \frac{80}{3}$ and $y = \frac{40}{3}$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to get the minimum value:

```python

## QUESTION 2 - 0 
- TIME_SPENT : 509 secs

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"For certain ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ of real numbers, the system of equations
\[\begin{aligned} ax+by&=1 \\ x^2 + y^2 &= 50  \end{aligned}\]has at least one solution, and each solution is an ordered pair $(x,y)\,$ of integers. How many such ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ are there?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The graph of $ax+by=1$ is a line, while the graph of $x^2+y^2=50$ is a circle centered at the origin. Therefore, $(a, b)$ satisfies the conditions if and only if the line and circle intersect at least once, and they intersect only at lattice points (points with integer coordinates).

Knowing this, it makes sense to look for lattice points on the circle whose equation is $x^2+y^2=50$. Testing cases, we find that there are twelve lattice points on the circle: $(\pm 1, \pm 7)$, $(\pm 7, \pm 1)$, and $(\pm 5, \pm 5)$ (where the two $\pm$ signs in each pair are independent of each other).

There are $\tbinom{12}{2} = 66$ pairs of these points, and each pair determines a line. However, the graph of $ax+by=1$ can never pass through the origin $(0, 0)$, since if $x=y=0$, then $ax+by=0 \neq 1$. Therefore, the six pairs which consist of diametrically opposed points are invalid, since the line through them passes through the origin. This corrects our count to $66 - 6 = 60$.

In addition, for each of the twelve points, there is a line tangent to the circle at that point, so that the only solution to the system is that one point. This brings the final total to $60 + 12 = \boxed{72}$. The answer is $\boxed{72}$

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we first need to understand the structure of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. This equation has four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $2$. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ oscillates between $1$ and $2$ as $x$ varies over the real numbers. Therefore, we have $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which implies $100 < m < 200$. The only positive integer $m$ in this range is $101$. So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is $1$. The answer is $\boxed{1}$.

Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Any solution to this equation must make the numerator of the left-hand side zero, while keeping the denominator non-zero. The numerator is zero when $x$ is one of the numbers $1, 2, 3, \dots, 100.$ However, for any value in this list that is a perfect square, the denominator will also be zero, so that value of $x$ will not be a root. Therefore, we want to find the number of integers in the list $1, 2, \dots, 100$ which are not perfect squares. The perfect squares in the list are $1^2, 2^2, \dots, 10^2,$ so there are $10$ perfect squares, and \[100 - 10 = \boxed{90}\]integers which are not perfect squares. The answer is $\boxed{90}$

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly four distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be rewritten as $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. This equation has four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $2$. That is, $1<\frac{m}{100}<2$, which implies $100<m<200$. The positive integers in this range are exactly the integers from $101$ to $199$, inclusive. The number of these integers is $199-101+1=99$. Therefore, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions for exactly $99$ positive integers $m$. The answer is: $99$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Find the number of 10-tuples $(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{10})$ of real numbers such that
\[(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2 = \frac{1}{11}.\]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,
\begin{align*}
&[(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + \dots + 1^2 + 1^2)][(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2] \\
&\ge [(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + (x_2 - x_3) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10}]^2 = 1.
\end{align*}From the given condition, we have equality, so by the equality condition for Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[\frac{1 - x_1}{1} = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{1} = \frac{x_2 - x_3}{1} = \dots = \frac{x_9 - x_{10}}{1} = \frac{x_{10}}{1}.\]Let
\[d = 1 - x_1 = x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_3 = \dots = x_9 - x_{10} = x_{10}.\]Then
\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so
\[(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_{10}) = \left( \frac{10}{11}, \frac{9}{11}, \frac{8}{11}, \dots, \frac{1}{11} \right).\]In particular, there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we first need to understand the given equation and the conditions that make it equal to zero. The equation is a product of two terms, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.

The first term is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. This term is zero when both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) = 0$. This happens when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This represents a square with side length 20, centered at the origin.

The second term is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. This term is zero when both $(\vert x \vert - 8) = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8) = 0$. This happens when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This represents a square with side length 16, centered at the origin.

The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for. The area of a square is given by the square of the side length, so the area of the first square is $20^2 = 400$ and the area of the second square is $16^2 = 256$. The intersection of the two squares is a square with side length 8 (the smaller side of the two squares), so its area is $8^2 = 64$.

To find the area of the convex polygon, we subtract the area of the intersection from the sum of the areas of the two squares: $400 + 256 - 64 = 592$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 592. The answer is: $592$

Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

It seems like we have a problem with our code. The error `IndexError: list index out of range` is because our solution list `solutions` is empty. This is because the equations we are solving are not straightforward to solve using sympy's `solve` function. Let's try a different approach.

We can solve this problem by observing that the given equation is satisfied if and only if either one of the following four conditions is satisfied:

1. $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$
2. $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x| = 8$
3. $|x - y| = 10$ and $|y| = 8$
4. $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$

These conditions define four lines in the plane. The intersection points of these lines form a rectangle with side lengths 16 and 20. The area of this rectangle is $16 \times 20 = 320$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 320.

The answer is: $320$

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. This gives us four cases to consider:
1. $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x - y| - 10 = 0$.
2. $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x| - 8 = 0$.
3. $|x - y| - 10 = 0$ and $|y| - 8 = 0$.
4. $|x| - 8 = 0$ and $|y| - 8 = 0$.

For each of these cases, we can find the corresponding points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equation and plot them on a coordinate plane. The points that satisfy each case form a square or a rectangle. The union of these squares and rectangles forms a larger square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Find the number of 10-tuples $(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{10})$ of real numbers such that
\[(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2 = \frac{1}{11}.\]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,
\begin{align*}
&[(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + \dots + 1^2 + 1^2)][(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2] \\
&\ge [(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + (x_2 - x_3) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10}]^2 = 1.
\end{align*}From the given condition, we have equality, so by the equality condition for Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[\frac{1 - x_1}{1} = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{1} = \frac{x_2 - x_3}{1} = \dots = \frac{x_9 - x_{10}}{1} = \frac{x_{10}}{1}.\]Let
\[d = 1 - x_1 = x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_3 = \dots = x_9 - x_{10} = x_{10}.\]Then
\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so
\[(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_{10}) = \left( \frac{10}{11}, \frac{9}{11}, \frac{8}{11}, \dots, \frac{1}{11} \right).\]In particular, there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


The equation is of the form $A \cdot B = 0$, which means that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. So we can break the problem into two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

For the second case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersection points of these lines are the vertices of the polygon. By plotting these lines, we find that the polygon is a square with side length 16. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we first need to understand the given equation and the conditions that make it equal to zero. The equation is:
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]
This equation is equal to zero if either of the two factors is zero. The first factor is zero when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which represent two circles in the $xy$-plane. The second factor is zero when $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$, which represent two more circles in the $xy$-plane. The intersection of these four circles forms a square.

To find the side length of the square, we can use the distance between the centers of the circles $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The centers of these circles are at $(0, 10)$ and $(10, 0)$, respectively. The distance between these two points is $\sqrt{(10-0)^2 + (0-10)^2} = \sqrt{100+100} = \sqrt{200} = 10\sqrt{2}$. So the side length of the square is $10\sqrt{2} - 2(8) = 10\sqrt{2} - 16$.

The area of the square is then $(10\sqrt{2} - 16)^2$. We can calculate this value using sympy:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, sqrt, simplify

def calculate_area():
    # Define the side length of the square
    side_length = 10*sqrt(2) - 16

    # Calculate the area of the square
    area = side_length**2

    # Simplify the area
    area = simplify(area)

    return area

result = calculate_area()
print(result)

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.
For the first term to be zero, we must have $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$.
This means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
The solutions to these equations are the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.
For the second term to be zero, we must have $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.
This means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The solutions to these equations are the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.
The points that satisfy either of these conditions form a square with side length 16.
The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
So the area of the convex polygon is 256.
The answer is: $256$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"We define a function $f(x)$ such that $f(14)=7$, and if there exists an integer $a$ such that $f(a)=b$, then $f(b)$ is defined and

$f(b)=3b+1$ if $b$ is odd

$f(b)=\frac{b}{2}$ if $b$ is even.

What is the smallest possible number of integers in the domain of $f$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Since $f(14)=7$, we know that $f(7)$ is defined, and it must equal $22$.  Similarly, we know that $f(22)$ is defined, and it must equal $11$.  Continuing on this way,  \begin{align*}
f(11)&=34\\
f(34)&=17\\
f(17)&=52\\
f(52)&=26\\
f(26)&=13\\
f(13)&=40\\
f(40)&=20\\
f(20)&=10\\
f(10)&=5\\
f(5)&=16\\
f(16)&=8\\
f(8)&=4\\
f(4)&=2\\
f(2)&=1\\
f(1)&=4
\end{align*}We are now in a cycle $1$, $4$, $2$, $1$, and so on.  Thus there are no more values which need to be defined, as there is no $a$ currently defined for which $f(a)$ is a $b$ not already defined.  Thus the minimum number of integers we can define is the number we have already defined, which is $\boxed{18}$. The answer is $\boxed{18}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
**Problem**
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


To solve this problem, we need to find the value of $f(100)$ using the given conditions. Let's start by calculating $f(100)$ using the second condition:
\[f(2 \cdot 50) = 2f(50) + 1.\]
This means that $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$. Now we need to find the value of $f(50)$. We can use the second condition again:
\[f(2 \cdot 25) = 2f(25) + 1.\]
This means that $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$. Now we need to find the value of $f(25)$. We can use the second condition again:
\[f(2 \cdot 12.5) = 2f(12.5) + 1.\]
But $12.5$ is not a natural number, so we cannot use the second condition directly. We need to use the first condition instead:
\[f(f(f(12.5))) = 8 \cdot 12.5 - 7 = 100.\]
Since $f(f(f(12.5))) = 100$, we can substitute $f(12.5)$ with $x$ and solve for $x$:
\[f(f(x)) = 100.\]
Using the first condition again, we have:
\[f(f(x)) = 8x - 7.\]
So we have:
\[8x - 7 = 100.\]
Solving for $x$, we get:
\[8x = 107 \implies x = \frac{107}{8}.\]
But $x$ should be a natural number, so there must be a mistake in our reasoning. Let's go back and check our work. We noticed that we cannot use the second condition directly when we tried to find the value of $f(25)$. Let's use the first condition instead:
\[f(f(f(25))) = 8 \cdot 25 - 7 = 193.\]
Since $f(f(f(25))) = 193$, we can substitute $f(25)$ with $y$ and solve for $y$:
\[f(f(y)) = 193.\]
Using the first condition again, we have:
\[f(f(y)) = 8y - 7.\]
So we have:
\[8y - 7 = 193.\]
Solving for $y$, we get:
\[8y = 200 \implies y = 25.\]
So $f(25) = 25$. Now we can continue to find the value of $f(50)$:
\[f(50) = 2f(25) + 1 = 2 \cdot 25 + 1 = 51.\]
And finally, we can find the value of $f(100)$:
\[f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2 \cdot 51 + 1 = 103.\]
So $f(100) = 103$. The answer is: $103$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"The function $f$ is defined on the set of integers and satisfies \[f(n)= \begin{cases}  n-3 & \mbox{if }n\ge 1000 \\  f(f(n+5)) & \mbox{if }n<1000. \end{cases}\]Find $f(84)$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Denote by (1) and (2) the two parts of the definition of $f$, respectively. If we begin to use the definition of $f$ to compute $f(84)$, we use (2) until the argument is at least $1000$: \[f(84) = f(f(89)) = f(f(f(94))) = \dots = f^N(1004)\](where $f^N$ denotes composing $f$ with itself $N$ times, for some $N$). The numbers $84, 89, 94, \dots, 1004$ form an arithmetic sequence with common difference $5$; since $1004 - 84 = 920 = 184 \cdot 5$, this sequence has $184 + 1 = 185$ terms, so $N = 185$.

At this point, (1) and (2) are both used: we compute \[\begin{aligned} f^N(1004) &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-1}(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-1}(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(1000) \\ &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(997) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1002) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(999) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1004). \end{aligned}\]Repeating this process, we see that \[f^N(1004) = f^{N-2}(1004) = f^{N-4}(1004) = \dots = f^3(1004).\](The pattern breaks down for $f^k(1004)$ when $k$ is small, so it is not true that $f^3(1004) = f(1004)$.) Now, we have \[f^3(1004) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^2(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^2(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(1000) \stackrel{(1)}{=} \boxed{997}.\] The answer is $\boxed{997}$

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we can start by plugging in $n=1$ into the second equation to get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. Then, we can plug in $f(1)$ into the first equation to get $f(f(f(1))) = f(f(1)) = 8(1) - 7 = 1$. Since $f(f(f(1))) = 1$, we have $f(f(1)) = 1$. Then, from $f(f(1)) = 1$, we can get $f(1)$.

After finding $f(1)$, we can use the second equation to find $f(2)$, $f(4)$, $f(8)$, and so on, until we find $f(100)$.

Here is the Python code to solve this problem:

```python

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

def find_f_100():
    f1 = symbols('f1')
    # From f(f(f(1))) = 1, we have f(f(1)) = 1
    # So f(1) is a solution to f(f1) = 1
    eq1 = Eq(f1, 1)
    f1_solution = solve(eq1, f1)[0]

    # Now we can use the second equation to find f(2), f(4), f(8), and so on, until we find f(100)
    f_2 = 2 * f1_solution + 1
    f_4 = 2 * f_2 + 1
    f_8 = 2 * f_4 + 1

    # We can see a pattern here: f(2^n) = 2^n + 1
    # So f(100) = 100 + 1 = 101
    f_100 = 100 + 1

    return f_100

result = find_f_100()

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"The function $f$ is defined on the set of integers and satisfies \[f(n)= \begin{cases}  n-3 & \mbox{if }n\ge 1000 \\  f(f(n+5)) & \mbox{if }n<1000. \end{cases}\]Find $f(84)$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Denote by (1) and (2) the two parts of the definition of $f$, respectively. If we begin to use the definition of $f$ to compute $f(84)$, we use (2) until the argument is at least $1000$: \[f(84) = f(f(89)) = f(f(f(94))) = \dots = f^N(1004)\](where $f^N$ denotes composing $f$ with itself $N$ times, for some $N$). The numbers $84, 89, 94, \dots, 1004$ form an arithmetic sequence with common difference $5$; since $1004 - 84 = 920 = 184 \cdot 5$, this sequence has $184 + 1 = 185$ terms, so $N = 185$.

At this point, (1) and (2) are both used: we compute \[\begin{aligned} f^N(1004) &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-1}(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-1}(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(1000) \\ &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(997) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1002) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(999) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1004). \end{aligned}\]Repeating this process, we see that \[f^N(1004) = f^{N-2}(1004) = f^{N-4}(1004) = \dots = f^3(1004).\](The pattern breaks down for $f^k(1004)$ when $k$ is small, so it is not true that $f^3(1004) = f(1004)$.) Now, we have \[f^3(1004) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^2(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^2(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(1000) \stackrel{(1)}{=} \boxed{997}.\] The answer is $\boxed{997}$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"We define a function $f(x)$ such that $f(14)=7$, and if there exists an integer $a$ such that $f(a)=b$, then $f(b)$ is defined and

$f(b)=3b+1$ if $b$ is odd

$f(b)=\frac{b}{2}$ if $b$ is even.

What is the smallest possible number of integers in the domain of $f$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Since $f(14)=7$, we know that $f(7)$ is defined, and it must equal $22$.  Similarly, we know that $f(22)$ is defined, and it must equal $11$.  Continuing on this way,  \begin{align*}
f(11)&=34\\
f(34)&=17\\
f(17)&=52\\
f(52)&=26\\
f(26)&=13\\
f(13)&=40\\
f(40)&=20\\
f(20)&=10\\
f(10)&=5\\
f(5)&=16\\
f(16)&=8\\
f(8)&=4\\
f(4)&=2\\
f(2)&=1\\
f(1)&=4
\end{align*}We are now in a cycle $1$, $4$, $2$, $1$, and so on.  Thus there are no more values which need to be defined, as there is no $a$ currently defined for which $f(a)$ is a $b$ not already defined.  Thus the minimum number of integers we can define is the number we have already defined, which is $\boxed{18}$. The answer is $\boxed{18}$

**Problem**
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


To solve this problem, we can use the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to find a pattern in the function $f$.

Let's start with $n=1$. We have $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1$, so $f(f(1))=1$. Then, using the second condition, we have $f(2)=2f(1)+1$. Since $f(f(1))=1$, we can substitute $f(1)$ with $1$ in the equation, so we get $f(2)=2(1)+1=3$.

Now, let's find $f(4)$ using the second condition again: $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2(3)+1=7$.

Continuing this process, we find that $f(8)=15$, $f(16)=31$, and so on. It seems that $f(2^k)=2^k-1$ for all positive integers $k$.

Now, let's use the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to check this pattern. If $n=2^k$, then $f(f(f(2^k)))=f(f(2^k-1))=f(2^{k-1}-1)=8(2^k)-7=2^{k+3}-7$. But we also know that $f(f(f(2^k)))=8(2^k)-7=2^{k+3}-7$. So the pattern $f(2^k)=2^k-1$ is correct.

Now, we want to find $f(100)$. Since $100=2^2 \cdot 5^2$, we can use the second condition to find $f(100)$. We have $f(100)=2f(50)+1$. But $50=2 \cdot 25$, so $f(50)=2f(25)+1=2(2f(12.5)+1)+1=2(2(2f(6.25)+1)+1)+1=2(2(2(2f(3.125)+1)+1)+1)+1=2(2(2(2(2f(1.5625)+1)+1)+1)+1)+1=2(2(2(2(2(2f(0.78125)+1)+1)+1)+1)+1)+1$. Since $0.78125$ is not a power of $2$, we know that $f(0.78125)=0.78125-1=0.78125$, which is not a natural number. This means we have made a mistake in our reasoning.

Let's go back and check our work. We found that $f(2^k)=2^k-1$ for all positive integers $k$. So $f(100)=2^{100}-1$. But this is much too large to be a natural number.

Let's try another approach. We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. If we let $n=1$, we get $f(f(f(1)))=1$. But we also know that $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1$. So the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ holds for $n=1$.

Now, let's try $n=2$. We have $f(f(f(2)))=15$, and $8(2)-7=15$. So the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ holds for $n=2$.

Continuing this process, we find that the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ holds for all positive integers $n$. This means that $f(n)=8n-7$ for all positive integers $n$.

Now, we can find $f(100)$ by substituting $n=100$ into the equation $f(n)=8n-7$. We get $f(100)=8(100)-7=793$.

So, $f(100)=793$. The answer is: $793$

**Problem:** 
"The function $f(n)$ is defined on the positive integers such that $f(f(n)) = 2n$ and $f(4n + 1) = 4n + 3$ for all positive integers $n.$  Find $f(1000).$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Consider the expression $f(f(f(a))).$  Since $f(f(a)) = 2a,$ this is equal to $f(2a).$  But taking $n = f(a)$ in $f(f(n)) = 2n,$ we get
\[f(f(f(a))) = 2f(a).\]Hence,
\[f(2a) = 2f(a)\]for all positive integers $a.$

Then
\[f(1000) = 2f(500) = 4f(250) = 8f(125).\]Taking $n = 31$ in $f(4n + 1) = 4n + 3,$ we get
\[f(125) = 127,\]so $f(1000) = \boxed{1016}.$ The answer is $\boxed{1016}$

We will use the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to find $f(100)$.

First, we need to find $f(50)$ using the second condition. We have $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.

Next, we need to find $f(25)$ using the second condition. We have $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.

Then, we need to find $f(12)$ and $f(6)$ using the second condition. We have $f(25) = 2f(12) + 1$ and $f(12) = 2f(6) + 1$.

Finally, we need to find $f(3)$ using the second condition. We have $f(6) = 2f(3) + 1$.

Now, we use the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to find $f(3)$. We have $f(f(f(3))) = 8*3 - 7 = 19$.

So, $f(3) = \frac{19 + 7}{8} = 3$.

Then, $f(6) = 2*3 + 1 = 7$.

$f(12) = 2*7 + 1 = 15$.

$f(25) = 2*15 + 1 = 31$.

$f(50) = 2*31 + 1 = 63$.

Finally, $f(100) = 2*63 + 1 = 127$.

So, $f(100) = 127$. The answer is $\boxed{127}$.

**Solution:**


To solve this problem, we can use the second condition to find $f(100)$ step by step.

First, we can find $f(200)$ using the second condition: $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$.
Then, we can find $f(f(200))$ using the first condition: $f(f(200)) = 8(200) - 7 = 1593$.
Since $f(200) = f(f(f(100)))$, we have $f(f(200)) = f(f(f(f(100))))$.
So, $f(f(f(f(100)))) = 1593$.

Now, we can find $f(f(100))$ by applying the first condition again: $f(f(100)) = \frac{1593 + 7}{8} = 199$.
Then, we can find $f(100)$ by applying the second condition: $f(100) = \frac{f(200) - 1}{2}$.
Since we know $f(200) = 199$, we have $f(100) = \frac{199 - 1}{2} = 99$.

So, $f(100) = 99$. The answer is: $99$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $
f(n) =

n^2+1 & \text{if }n\text{ is odd} \\
\dfrac{n}{2} & \text{if }n\text{ is even}
\end{cases}.
$

For how many integers $n$ from 1 to 100, inclusive, does $f ( f (\dotsb f (n) \dotsb )) = 1$ for some number of applications of $f$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we note that if $n$ is a positive integer, then $f(n)$ is also a positive integer.  We claim that $f ( f (\dotsb f (n) \dotsb )) = 1$ for some number of applications of $f$ only for $n = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32,$ and $64.$  (In other words, $n$ must be a power of 2.)

Note that $f(1) = 2,$ so $f(f(1)) = f(2) = 1.$  If $n > 1$ is a power of 2, it is easy to see that repeated applications of $f$ on $n$ eventually reach 1.

Suppose $n$ is an odd positive integer, where $n > 1.$  Write $n = 2k + 1,$ where $k$ is a positive integer.  Since $n$ is odd,
\[f(n) = n^2 + 1 = (2k + 1)^2 + 1 = 4k^2 + 4k + 2 = 2(2k^2 + 2k + 1).\]Since $2k^2 + 2k$ is always even, $2k^2 + 2k + 1$ is always odd (and greater than 1), so $f(n)$ can never be a power of 2 when $n$ is odd and greater than 1.

Now, suppose $n$ is even.  For example, if $n = 2^3 \cdot 11,$ then
\[f(2^3 \cdot 11) = f(2^2 \cdot 11) = f(2 \cdot 11) = f(11),\]which we know is not a power of 2.

More generally, suppose $n = 2^e \cdot m,$ where $e$ is nonnegative and $m$ is odd.  Then
\[f(2^e \cdot m) = f(2^{e - 1} \cdot m) = f(2^{e - 2} \cdot m) = \dots = f(m).\]If $m = 1,$ then $n$ is a power of 2, and the sequence eventually reaches 1.  Otherwise, $f(m)$ is not a power of 2.  We also know that $f(m)$ is odd and greater than 1, $f(f(m))$ is not a power of 2 either, and so on.  Thus, the sequence can never reach 1.

Therefore, $n$ must be one of the $\boxed{7}$ values 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, or 64. The answer is $\boxed{7}$

**Problem**
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


To find $f(100)$, we can use the second condition of the function $f$. We know that $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. So, we can find $f(50)$ first, then $f(25)$, and finally $f(100)$.

Let's start with $f(50)$:
\[f(50) = 2f(25) + 1.\]

Next, let's find $f(25)$:
\[f(25) = 2f(12.5).\]

But we know that $f(n)$ only accepts natural numbers as input, so $f(12.5)$ is not defined. However, we can use the first condition of the function $f$, which is $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. If we let $n = 12.5$, we get:
\[f(f(f(12.5))) = 8(12.5) - 7 = 100.\]

So, we can set $f(f(f(12.5))) = 100$ and solve for $f(12.5)$:
\[f(12.5) = \frac{f(f(100)) + 7}{8}.\]

Now we can substitute this into the equation for $f(25)$:
\[f(25) = 2f\left(\frac{f(f(100)) + 7}{8}\right).\]

Finally, we can substitute this into the equation for $f(50)$:
\[f(50) = 2\left[2f\left(\frac{f(f(100)) + 7}{8}\right) + \frac{1}{2}\right] = 4f\left(\frac{f(f(100)) + 7}{8}\right) + 1.\]

And we can substitute this into the equation for $f(100)$:
\[f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2\left(4f\left(\frac{f(f(100)) + 7}{8}\right) + 1\right) + 1 = 8f\left(\frac{f(f(100)) + 7}{8}\right) + 3.\]

Now we can solve for $f(f(100))$:
\[f(f(100)) = 8(100) - 7 = 793.\]

Substitute this into the equation for $f(100)$:
\[f(100) = 8f\left(\frac{793 + 7}{8}\right) + 3 = 8f(100) + 3.\]

Rearranging the equation gives:
\[0 = 8f(100) - f(100) - 3.\]

Solving for $f(100)$ gives:
\[f(100) = \frac{3}{7}.\]

But this is not a natural number, which contradicts our assumption that $f(n)$ only accepts natural numbers as input. Therefore, our assumption that $f(12.5)$ exists must be incorrect.

Let's go back and look at the second condition of the function $f$, which is $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. If we let $n = 12.5$, we get:
\[f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1.\]

But we know that $f(25)$ is a natural number, so $2f(12.5) + 1$ must also be a natural number. This means that $2f(12.5)$ must be an even number. Therefore, $f(12.5)$ must also be an even number. But we know that $f(12.5)$ is not defined, so our assumption that $f(12.5)$ exists must be incorrect again.

This contradiction suggests that we made an error in our reasoning. Let's go back and reevaluate the problem.

After reevaluating the problem, we realize that the second condition of the function $f$, which is $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, is not applicable to the first condition of the function $f$, which is $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. The two conditions are not related, and we cannot use them together to solve the problem.

However, we can still use the first condition of the function $f$ to find $f(100)$. If we let $n = 100$ in the first condition, we get:
\[f(f(f(100))) = 8(100) - 7 = 793.\]

We know that $f(f(f(100))) = 793$, so we can solve for $f(100)$:
\[f(100) = \sqrt[3]{793}.\]

But this is also not a natural number, which contradicts our assumption that $f(n)$ only accepts natural numbers as input.

Let's go back and reevaluate the problem again.

After reevaluating the problem, we realize that the first condition of the function $f$, which is $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, is not applicable to the second condition of the function $f$, which is $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. The two conditions are not related, and we cannot use them together to solve the problem.

However, we can still use the second condition of the function $f$ to find $f(100)$. If we let $n = 50$ in the second condition, we get:
\[f(100) = 2f(50) + 1.\]

We know that $f(50)$ is a natural number, so $2f(50) + 1$ must also be a natural number. This means that $2f(50)$ must be an even number. Therefore, $f(50)$ must also be an even number.

Now let's find $f(25)$:
\[f(50) = 2f(25) + 1.\]

We know that $f(50)$ is an even number, so $2f(25) + 1$ must also be an even number. This means that $2f(25)$ must be an odd number. Therefore, $f(25)$ must be a natural number.

Now let's find $f(12.5)$:
\[f(25) = 2f(12.5).\]

We know that $f(25)$ is a natural number, so $2f(12.5)$ must also be a natural number. This means that $f(12.5)$ must also be a natural number.

Now let's find $f(6.25)$:
\[f(12.5) = 2f(6.25).\]

We know that $f(12.5)$ is a natural number, so $2f(6.25)$ must also be a natural number. This means that $f(6.25)$ must also be a natural number.

We can continue this process, and we will eventually find that $f(n)$ is a natural number for all positive integers $n$. Therefore, we can use the first condition of the function $f$, which is $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, to find $f(100)$. If we let $n = 100$ in the first condition

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"We define a function $f(x)$ such that $f(14)=7$, and if there exists an integer $a$ such that $f(a)=b$, then $f(b)$ is defined and

$f(b)=3b+1$ if $b$ is odd

$f(b)=\frac{b}{2}$ if $b$ is even.

What is the smallest possible number of integers in the domain of $f$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Since $f(14)=7$, we know that $f(7)$ is defined, and it must equal $22$.  Similarly, we know that $f(22)$ is defined, and it must equal $11$.  Continuing on this way,  \begin{align*}
f(11)&=34\\
f(34)&=17\\
f(17)&=52\\
f(52)&=26\\
f(26)&=13\\
f(13)&=40\\
f(40)&=20\\
f(20)&=10\\
f(10)&=5\\
f(5)&=16\\
f(16)&=8\\
f(8)&=4\\
f(4)&=2\\
f(2)&=1\\
f(1)&=4
\end{align*}We are now in a cycle $1$, $4$, $2$, $1$, and so on.  Thus there are no more values which need to be defined, as there is no $a$ currently defined for which $f(a)$ is a $b$ not already defined.  Thus the minimum number of integers we can define is the number we have already defined, which is $\boxed{18}$. The answer is $\boxed{18}$

**Problem**
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



First, we need to find the value of $f(100)$ using the given conditions. 

We can start by finding the value of $f(f(f(100)))$ using the first condition. We know that $f(f(f(100))) = 8*100 - 7 = 793$.

Now, we need to find the value of $f(793)$. To do this, we can use the second condition $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. We can write $793 = 2*396.5$, which is not an integer. So, we need to find another way to express 793 in the form of $2n$ to use the second condition.

Notice that $793 = 2*396.5$, but we can also express $793 = 2*396 + 1$. So, we can write $f(793) = f(2*396 + 1)$.

Using the second condition, we have $f(2*396 + 1) = 2f(396) + 1$. Now, we need to find the value of $f(396)$.

Again, we can use the second condition. We can write $396 = 2*198$, so $f(396) = 2f(198)$. Now, we need to find the value of $f(198)$.

We can continue this process until we reach a value that we can easily find using the second condition. After several steps, we find that $f(100) = 199$.

So, the value of $f(100)$ is 199.

The answer is: $199$

**Problem:** 
"The function $f$ is defined on the set of integers and satisfies \[f(n)= \begin{cases}  n-3 & \mbox{if }n\ge 1000 \\  f(f(n+5)) & \mbox{if }n<1000. \end{cases}\]Find $f(84)$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Denote by (1) and (2) the two parts of the definition of $f$, respectively. If we begin to use the definition of $f$ to compute $f(84)$, we use (2) until the argument is at least $1000$: \[f(84) = f(f(89)) = f(f(f(94))) = \dots = f^N(1004)\](where $f^N$ denotes composing $f$ with itself $N$ times, for some $N$). The numbers $84, 89, 94, \dots, 1004$ form an arithmetic sequence with common difference $5$; since $1004 - 84 = 920 = 184 \cdot 5$, this sequence has $184 + 1 = 185$ terms, so $N = 185$.

At this point, (1) and (2) are both used: we compute \[\begin{aligned} f^N(1004) &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-1}(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-1}(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(1000) \\ &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(997) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1002) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(999) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1004). \end{aligned}\]Repeating this process, we see that \[f^N(1004) = f^{N-2}(1004) = f^{N-4}(1004) = \dots = f^3(1004).\](The pattern breaks down for $f^k(1004)$ when $k$ is small, so it is not true that $f^3(1004) = f(1004)$.) Now, we have \[f^3(1004) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^2(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^2(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(1000) \stackrel{(1)}{=} \boxed{997}.\] The answer is $\boxed{997}$

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we can start by substituting $n = 1$ into the second equation to find $f(1)$. We have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. Then, we can substitute $f(1)$ into the first equation to find $f(f(1))$. We have $f(f(1)) = 8 \cdot 1 - 7 = 1$. Since $f(f(f(1))) = f(1)$, we have $f(1) = 1$. Then, we can substitute $n = 2$ into the second equation to find $f(4)$. We have $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$. Then, we can substitute $f(2)$ into this equation to find $f(4)$. We have $f(4) = 2(2f(1) + 1) + 1 = 2(2 \cdot 1 + 1) + 1 = 2 \cdot 3 + 1 = 7$. Then, we can substitute $n = 4$ into the second equation to find $f(8)$. We have $f(8) = 2f(4) + 1 = 2 \cdot 7 + 1 = 15$. Continuing this process, we can find $f(16) = 31$, $f(32) = 63$, and so on. We notice that $f(2^k) = 2^k - 1$ for all positive integers $k$.
Now, we can substitute $n = 100$ into the second equation to find $f(200)$. We have $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$. Then, we can substitute $f(100)$ into this equation to find $f(200)$. We have $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$. Since $100 = 2^2 \cdot 25$, we can use the pattern we found earlier to find $f(100)$. We have $f(100) = 2^2 \cdot 25 - 1 = 4 \cdot 25 - 1 = 100 - 1 = 99$. Then, we can substitute $f(100)$ into the equation to find $f(200)$. We have $f(200) = 2 \cdot 99 + 1 = 198 + 1 = 199$. Finally, we can substitute $n = 200$ into the second equation to find $f(400)$. We have $f(400) = 2f(200) + 1 = 2 \cdot 199 + 1 = 398 + 1 = 399$. Continuing this process, we can find $f(800) = 799$, $f(1600) = 1599$, and so on. We notice that $f(2^k \cdot 100) = 2^k \cdot 99 - 1$ for all positive integers $k$.
Since $100 = 2^2 \cdot 25$, we can use the pattern we found earlier to find $f(100)$. We have $f(100) = 2^2 \cdot 25 - 1 = 4 \cdot 25 - 1 = 100 - 1 = 99$. Therefore, the value of $f(100)$ is $99$. The answer is: $99$

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


To solve this problem, we can use the second condition to simplify the first one.

From the second condition, we have $f(f(f(n)))=f(2f(f(n)) + 1)$.

Comparing this with the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we can see that $2f(f(n)) + 1 = 8n - 7$.

Solving this equation for $f(f(n))$, we get $f(f(n)) = 4n - 4$.

Now, we can substitute $f(f(n)) = 4n - 4$ into the second condition to get $f(2n) = 2(4n - 4) + 1 = 8n - 7$.

This means that the function $f(n) = 2n - 3$ satisfies both conditions.

Now we can calculate $f(100)$ by substituting $n = 100$ into the function: $f(100) = 2(100) - 3 = 197$.

So, the value of $f(100)$ is 197.

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



First, we can see that the function $f$ is a bit tricky to work with directly. However, we can observe that the function $f$ is applying itself three times on $n$ to get $8n-7$. This suggests that the function might be doubling and incrementing numbers.

Let's try to find the value of $f(1)$. From the second condition, we have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. But from the first condition, we also have $f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = -1$. Since $f(f(f(1))) = f(2)$, we have $f(2) = -1$. Substituting this into the second condition gives $ -1 = 2f(1) + 1$, so $f(1) = -1$.

Now we can find $f(100)$ by repeatedly applying the second condition. We have:

$f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$,
$f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$,
$f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1$,
$f(12.5) = 2f(6.25) + 1$,
$f(6.25) = 2f(3.125) + 1$,
$f(3.125) = 2f(1.5625) + 1$,
$f(1.5625) = 2f(0.78125) + 1$,
$f(0.78125) = 2f(0.390625) + 1$,
$f(0.390625) = 2f(0.1953125) + 1$,
$f(0.1953125) = 2f(0.09765625) + 1$,
$f(0.09765625) = 2f(0.048828125) + 1$,
$f(0.048828125) = 2f(0.0244140625) + 1$,
$f(0.0244140625) = 2f(0.01220703125) + 1$,
$f(0.01220703125) = 2f(0.006103515625) + 1$,
$f(0.006103515625) = 2f(0.0030517578125) + 1$,
$f(0.0030517578125) = 2f(0.00152587890625) + 1$,
$f(0.00152587890625) = 2f(0.000762939453125) + 1$.

At this point, we can see that we are getting very small numbers and it's not easy to continue this way. However, we can notice a pattern here. The function $f$ is doubling the argument and adding 1. This suggests that $f(x) = 2x + 1$. Let's verify this by checking if it satisfies the given conditions.

For the first condition, we have $f(f(f(x))) = f(f(2x+1)) = f(4x+3) = 8x+7$, which is not equal to $8x-7$. So, $f(x) = 2x + 1$ does not satisfy the first condition.

However, we can modify this function slightly to make it satisfy the first condition. Let's try $f(x) = 2x - 1$. Then we have:

$f(f(f(x))) = f(f(2x-1)) = f(4x-3) = 8x-7$, which is equal to $8x-7$. So, $f(x) = 2x - 1$ does satisfy the first condition.

Now let's check if it satisfies the second condition:

$f(2x) = 2(2x) - 1 = 4x - 1$, and $2f(x) + 1 = 2(2x - 1) + 1 = 4x - 1$. So, $f(x) = 2x - 1$ also satisfies the second condition.

Therefore, the function $f(x) = 2x - 1$ satisfies both conditions. Now we can find $f(100)$:

$f(100) = 2*100 - 1 = 199$.

So, $f(100) = 199$. The answer is $\boxed{199}$.

"The function $f(n)$ is defined on the positive integers such that $f(f(n)) = 2n$ and $f(4n + 1) = 4n + 3$ for all positive integers $n.$  Find $f(1000).$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Consider the expression $f(f(f(a))).$  Since $f(f(a)) = 2a,$ this is equal to $f(2a).$  But taking $n = f(a)$ in $f(f(n)) = 2n,$ we get
\[f(f(f(a))) = 2f(a).\]Hence,
\[f(2a) = 2f(a)\]for all positive integers $a.$

Then
\[f(1000) = 2f(500) = 4f(250) = 8f(125).\]Taking $n = 31$ in $f(4n + 1) = 4n + 3,$ we get
\[f(125) = 127,\]so $f(1000) = \boxed{1016}.$ The answer is $\boxed{1016}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
**Problem**
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


To solve this problem, we can start by applying the second condition to the first condition in the problem. We have:
\[f(f(f(n)))=8n-7 \implies f(f(2f(n)+1))=8n-7.\]
Now, applying the second condition again, we get:
\[f(2f(2f(n)+1)+1)=8n-7.\]
This simplifies to:
\[f(4f(n)+3)=8n-7.\]
Now, let's set $n=1$ in the above equation:
\[f(4f(1)+3)=8-7 \implies f(4f(1)+3)=1.\]
Since $f(1)$ is a natural number, the only possible value for $f(1)$ is $1$. Now, we can substitute $f(1)=1$ into the equation $f(4f(n)+3)=8n-7$:
\[f(4n+3)=8n-7.\]
Setting $n=25$ in the above equation, we get:
\[f(103)=8*25-7=200-7=193.\]
So, $f(100)=193$. The answer is: $\boxed{193}$
