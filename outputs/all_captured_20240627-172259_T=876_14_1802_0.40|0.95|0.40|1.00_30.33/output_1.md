**Problem:** 
"What is the minimum value of the expression $2x^2+3y^2+8x-24y+62$ for real $x$ and $y$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Rearranging the expression, we have  \[2x^2+8x+3y^2-24y+62\]We first complete the square in $x$. Factoring a 2 from the first two terms of the expression, we get  \[2(x^2+4x)+3y^2-24y+62\]In order for the expression inside the parenthesis to be a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(4/2)^2=4$ inside the parenthesis. Doing this, we have \[2(x^2+4x+4-4)+3y^2-24y+62 \Rightarrow 2(x+2)^2+3y^2-24y+54\]Now we complete the square in $y$. Factoring a 3 from the $y$ terms in the expression, we get \[2(x+2)^2+3(y^2-8y)+54\]In order for the expression inside the second parenthesis to be a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(8/2)^2=16$ inside the parenthesis. Doing this, we have \[2(x+2)^2+3(y^2-8y+16-16)+54 \Rightarrow 2(x+2)^2+3(y-4)^2+6\]Since the minimum value of $2(x+2)^2$ and $3(y-4)^2$ is $0$ (perfect squares can never be negative), the minimum value of the entire expression is $\boxed{6}$, and is achieved when $x=-2$ and $y=4$. The answer is $\boxed{6}$

**Problem**
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


This problem is a bit tricky and requires some mathematical insight. However, we can solve it using the following steps:

1. First, we notice that the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ can be rewritten as $(5x^2-8xy+5y^2)$, which is a perfect square: $(x-y)^2$.
2. Next, we notice that the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$, which simplifies to $2|x-2y| = 40$, or $|x-2y| = 20$.
3. This condition implies that the distance between $x$ and $2y$ is always 20. Therefore, the minimum value of $(x-y)^2$ is achieved when $x=y$, because the distance between $x$ and $2y$ is minimized when $x=y$.
4. Substituting $x=y$ into $(x-y)^2$, we get $0^2 = 0$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0, when $x=y$. The answer is: $0$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"What is the minimum value of the expression $x^2+y^2+2x-4y+8$ for real $x$ and $y$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Rearranging the expression, we have  \[x^2+2x+y^2-4y+8\]Completing the square in $x$, we need to add and subtract $(2/2)^2=1$. Completing the square in $y$, we need to add and subtract $(4/2)^2=4$. Thus, we have \[(x^2+2x+1)-1+(y^2-4y+4)-4+8 \Rightarrow (x+1)^2+(y-2)^2+3\]Since the minimum value of $(x+1)^2$ and $(y-2)^2$ is $0$ (perfect squares can never be negative), the minimum value of the entire expression is $\boxed{3}$, and is achieved when $x=-1$ and $y=2$. The answer is $\boxed{3}$

**Problem**
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


To solve this problem, we can use the method of completing the square. First, let's rewrite the given expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $(x^2-4xy+4y^2) + (y^2-4xy+4x^2) = (x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2$.
Now, let's consider the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. By the triangle inequality, we have $|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |(x-2y) - (y-2x)| = |x-2y-y+2x| = |3x-3y| = 3|x-y| = 40$.
So, we have $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$.
Now, let's substitute $u = x-2y$ and $v = y-2x$. Then, we have $|u| + |v| = 40$. By the triangle inequality, we have $|u| + |v| \geq |u-v|$. So, we have $|u-v| \leq 40$.
Now, let's substitute back $u = x-2y$ and $v = y-2x$. We have $|(x-2y) - (y-2x)| \leq 40$, which simplifies to $|x-2y-y+2x| \leq 40$, or $|3x-3y| \leq 40$. So, we have $|x-y| \leq \frac{40}{3}$.
Now, let's consider the expression $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2$. By the AM-GM inequality, we have $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2 \geq 2\sqrt{(x-2y)^2(y-2x)^2} = 2|x-2y||y-2x| = 2|x-y|\cdot|2x-y|$.
By the triangle inequality, we have $|x-y| + |2x-y| \geq |(x-y) - (2x-y)| = |x-2y| = \frac{40}{3}$.
So, we have $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2 \geq 2\cdot\frac{40}{3}\cdot|x-y| = \frac{80}{3}|x-y|$.
Now, by the inequality $|x-y| \leq \frac{40}{3}$, we have $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2 \geq \frac{80}{3}\cdot\frac{40}{3} = \frac{3200}{9}$.
So, the minimum value of $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2$ is $\frac{3200}{9}$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\frac{3200}{9}$.
The answer is: $\frac{3200}{9}$

Rearranging the expression, we have  \[2x^2+8x+3y^2-24y+62\]We first complete the square in $x$. Factoring a 2 from the first two terms of the expression, we get  \[2(x^2+4x)+3y^2-24y+62\]In order for the expression inside the parenthesis to be a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(4/2)^2=4$ inside the parenthesis. Doing this, we have \[2(x^2+4x+4-4)+3y^2-24y+62 \Rightarrow 2(x+2)^2+3y^2-24y+54\]Now we complete the square in $y$. Factoring a 3 from the $y$ terms in the expression, we get \[2(x+2)^2+3(y^2-8y)+54\]In order for the expression inside the second parenthesis to be a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(8/2)^2=16$ inside the parenthesis. Doing this, we have \[2(x+2)^2+3(y^2-8y+16-16)+54 \Rightarrow 2(x+2)^2+3(y-4)^2+6\]Since the minimum value of $2(x+2)^2$ and $3(y-4)^2$ is $0$ (perfect squares can never be negative), the minimum value of the entire expression is $\boxed{6}$, and is achieved when $x=-2$ and $y=4$.

**Solution:**


This problem is a bit tricky and requires some algebraic manipulation. First, let's rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2$. Now, let's denote $a = x - 2y$ and $b = y - 2x$. Then, we have $|a| + |b| = 40$. We also know that $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2 = a^2 + b^2$.

Now, we want to minimize $a^2 + b^2$ under the condition $|a| + |b| = 40$. By the triangle inequality, we know that $|a| + |b| \geq |a + b|$, so $|a + b| \leq 40$. On the other hand, by the parallelogram law, we know that $a^2 + b^2 = (a + b)^2 - 2ab$. Since $a^2 + b^2$ is what we want to minimize, we want to minimize $(a + b)^2 - 2ab$ under the condition $|a + b| \leq 40$.

By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we know that $(a^2 + b^2)(1 + 1) \geq (a + b)^2$, so $2(a^2 + b^2) \geq (a + b)^2$. Therefore, $(a + b)^2 - 2ab \leq 2(a^2 + b^2) - 2ab = 2(a^2 + b^2 - ab)$.

Now, we want to minimize $a^2 + b^2 - ab$. By the AM-GM inequality, we know that $a^2 + b^2 - ab \geq 0$, with equality if and only if $a = b$. But from the condition $|a| + |b| = 40$, we know that $a = b$ is not possible. However, we can still minimize $a^2 + b^2 - ab$ by setting $a = -b$, which gives us $a^2 + b^2 - ab = 2a^2$.

Now, we want to find the maximum value of $2a^2$ under the condition $|a + b| \leq 40$ and $a = -b$. Since $a = -b$, we have $|a + b| = |a - a| = 0$, which is less than or equal to 40. So, the maximum value of $2a^2$ is achieved when $a = -b$.

Substituting $a = -b$ into the condition $|a| + |b| = 40$, we get $|a| + |-a| = 40$, which simplifies to $2|a| = 40$, so $|a| = 20$. Therefore, the maximum value of $2a^2$ is achieved when $a = 20$ or $a = -20$. Since $a^2 + b^2 - ab = 2a^2$, we want to minimize $2a^2$. The minimum value of $2a^2$ is achieved when $a = -20$, so the minimum value of $a^2 + b^2 - ab$ is $2(-20)^2 = 800$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $800$. The answer is: $800$

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


This problem is a bit more complex than the previous one, and it requires a bit of mathematical insight. However, we can still solve it using Python and some mathematical manipulation.

First, let's rewrite the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$. Now, let's consider the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite this as $5(x^2+y^2)-8xy = 5[(x-y)^2+2xy]-8xy = 5(x-y)^2-3xy$.

Now, let's use the equation $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$ to find a relationship between $x$ and $y$. We can use the property $|a| + |b| = c$ implies $a = 0$ or $b = 0$. So, we have two cases:

1. $2y - x = 0$ and $2x - y = 0$, which gives $x = y$.
2. $2y - x = 0$ and $y - 2x = 0$, which gives $x = 2y$.

Let's consider the first case $x = y$. Substituting into the expression $5(x-y)^2-3xy$, we get $5(0)^2 - 3x^2 = -3x^2$.

Now let's consider the second case $x = 2y$. Substituting into the expression $5(x-y)^2-3xy$, we get $5(y)^2 - 6y^2 = -y^2$.

Comparing the two cases, we see that the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is achieved when $x = 2y$. So, we substitute $x = 2y$ into the equation $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$ to get $|2y-2y| + |4y-y| = 40$, which simplifies to $|0| + |3y| = 40$. This gives $3y = 40$, so $y = \frac{40}{3}$. Substituting $y = \frac{40}{3}$ into $x = 2y$, we get $x = \frac{80}{3}$.

Now, we substitute $x = \frac{80}{3}$ and $y = \frac{40}{3}$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to get the minimum value:
