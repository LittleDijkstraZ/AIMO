**Problem:** 
"We define a function $f(x)$ such that $f(14)=7$, and if there exists an integer $a$ such that $f(a)=b$, then $f(b)$ is defined and

$f(b)=3b+1$ if $b$ is odd

$f(b)=\frac{b}{2}$ if $b$ is even.

What is the smallest possible number of integers in the domain of $f$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Since $f(14)=7$, we know that $f(7)$ is defined, and it must equal $22$.  Similarly, we know that $f(22)$ is defined, and it must equal $11$.  Continuing on this way,  \begin{align*}
f(11)&=34\\
f(34)&=17\\
f(17)&=52\\
f(52)&=26\\
f(26)&=13\\
f(13)&=40\\
f(40)&=20\\
f(20)&=10\\
f(10)&=5\\
f(5)&=16\\
f(16)&=8\\
f(8)&=4\\
f(4)&=2\\
f(2)&=1\\
f(1)&=4
\end{align*}We are now in a cycle $1$, $4$, $2$, $1$, and so on.  Thus there are no more values which need to be defined, as there is no $a$ currently defined for which $f(a)$ is a $b$ not already defined.  Thus the minimum number of integers we can define is the number we have already defined, which is $\boxed{18}$. The answer is $\boxed{18}$

**Problem**
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


To solve this problem, we need to find the value of $f(100)$ using the given conditions. Let's start by calculating $f(100)$ using the second condition:
\[f(2 \cdot 50) = 2f(50) + 1.\]
This means that $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$. Now we need to find the value of $f(50)$. We can use the second condition again:
\[f(2 \cdot 25) = 2f(25) + 1.\]
This means that $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$. Now we need to find the value of $f(25)$. We can use the second condition again:
\[f(2 \cdot 12.5) = 2f(12.5) + 1.\]
But $12.5$ is not a natural number, so we cannot use the second condition directly. We need to use the first condition instead:
\[f(f(f(12.5))) = 8 \cdot 12.5 - 7 = 100.\]
Since $f(f(f(12.5))) = 100$, we can substitute $f(12.5)$ with $x$ and solve for $x$:
\[f(f(x)) = 100.\]
Using the first condition again, we have:
\[f(f(x)) = 8x - 7.\]
So we have:
\[8x - 7 = 100.\]
Solving for $x$, we get:
\[8x = 107 \implies x = \frac{107}{8}.\]
But $x$ should be a natural number, so there must be a mistake in our reasoning. Let's go back and check our work. We noticed that we cannot use the second condition directly when we tried to find the value of $f(25)$. Let's use the first condition instead:
\[f(f(f(25))) = 8 \cdot 25 - 7 = 193.\]
Since $f(f(f(25))) = 193$, we can substitute $f(25)$ with $y$ and solve for $y$:
\[f(f(y)) = 193.\]
Using the first condition again, we have:
\[f(f(y)) = 8y - 7.\]
So we have:
\[8y - 7 = 193.\]
Solving for $y$, we get:
\[8y = 200 \implies y = 25.\]
So $f(25) = 25$. Now we can continue to find the value of $f(50)$:
\[f(50) = 2f(25) + 1 = 2 \cdot 25 + 1 = 51.\]
And finally, we can find the value of $f(100)$:
\[f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2 \cdot 51 + 1 = 103.\]
So $f(100) = 103$. The answer is: $103$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"The function $f$ is defined on the set of integers and satisfies \[f(n)= \begin{cases}  n-3 & \mbox{if }n\ge 1000 \\  f(f(n+5)) & \mbox{if }n<1000. \end{cases}\]Find $f(84)$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Denote by (1) and (2) the two parts of the definition of $f$, respectively. If we begin to use the definition of $f$ to compute $f(84)$, we use (2) until the argument is at least $1000$: \[f(84) = f(f(89)) = f(f(f(94))) = \dots = f^N(1004)\](where $f^N$ denotes composing $f$ with itself $N$ times, for some $N$). The numbers $84, 89, 94, \dots, 1004$ form an arithmetic sequence with common difference $5$; since $1004 - 84 = 920 = 184 \cdot 5$, this sequence has $184 + 1 = 185$ terms, so $N = 185$.

At this point, (1) and (2) are both used: we compute \[\begin{aligned} f^N(1004) &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-1}(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-1}(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(1000) \\ &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(997) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1002) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(999) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1004). \end{aligned}\]Repeating this process, we see that \[f^N(1004) = f^{N-2}(1004) = f^{N-4}(1004) = \dots = f^3(1004).\](The pattern breaks down for $f^k(1004)$ when $k$ is small, so it is not true that $f^3(1004) = f(1004)$.) Now, we have \[f^3(1004) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^2(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^2(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(1000) \stackrel{(1)}{=} \boxed{997}.\] The answer is $\boxed{997}$

To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we can start by plugging in $n=1$ into the second equation to get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. Then, we can plug in $f(1)$ into the first equation to get $f(f(f(1))) = f(f(1)) = 8(1) - 7 = 1$. Since $f(f(f(1))) = 1$, we have $f(f(1)) = 1$. Then, from $f(f(1)) = 1$, we can get $f(1)$.

After finding $f(1)$, we can use the second equation to find $f(2)$, $f(4)$, $f(8)$, and so on, until we find $f(100)$.

Here is the Python code to solve this problem:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

def find_f_100():
    f1 = symbols('f1')
    # From f(f(f(1))) = 1, we have f(f(1)) = 1
    # So f(1) is a solution to f(f1) = 1
    eq1 = Eq(f1, 1)
    f1_solution = solve(eq1, f1)[0]

    # Now we can use the second equation to find f(2), f(4), f(8), and so on, until we find f(100)
    f_2 = 2 * f1_solution + 1
    f_4 = 2 * f_2 + 1
    f_8 = 2 * f_4 + 1

    # We can see a pattern here: f(2^n) = 2^n + 1
    # So f(100) = 100 + 1 = 101
    f_100 = 100 + 1

    return f_100

result = find_f_100()
print(result)

The value of $f(100)$ is $101$. The answer is $\boxed{101}$.

"We define a function $f(x)$ such that $f(14)=7$, and if there exists an integer $a$ such that $f(a)=b$, then $f(b)$ is defined and

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


To solve this problem, we can use the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to find a pattern in the function $f$.

Let's start with $n=1$. We have $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1$, so $f(f(1))=1$. Then, using the second condition, we have $f(2)=2f(1)+1$. Since $f(f(1))=1$, we can substitute $f(1)$ with $1$ in the equation, so we get $f(2)=2(1)+1=3$.

Now, let's find $f(4)$ using the second condition again: $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2(3)+1=7$.

Continuing this process, we find that $f(8)=15$, $f(16)=31$, and so on. It seems that $f(2^k)=2^k-1$ for all positive integers $k$.

Now, let's use the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to check this pattern. If $n=2^k$, then $f(f(f(2^k)))=f(f(2^k-1))=f(2^{k-1}-1)=8(2^k)-7=2^{k+3}-7$. But we also know that $f(f(f(2^k)))=8(2^k)-7=2^{k+3}-7$. So the pattern $f(2^k)=2^k-1$ is correct.

Now, we want to find $f(100)$. Since $100=2^2 \cdot 5^2$, we can use the second condition to find $f(100)$. We have $f(100)=2f(50)+1$. But $50=2 \cdot 25$, so $f(50)=2f(25)+1=2(2f(12.5)+1)+1=2(2(2f(6.25)+1)+1)+1=2(2(2(2f(3.125)+1)+1)+1)+1=2(2(2(2(2f(1.5625)+1)+1)+1)+1)+1=2(2(2(2(2(2f(0.78125)+1)+1)+1)+1)+1)+1$. Since $0.78125$ is not a power of $2$, we know that $f(0.78125)=0.78125-1=0.78125$, which is not a natural number. This means we have made a mistake in our reasoning.

Let's go back and check our work. We found that $f(2^k)=2^k-1$ for all positive integers $k$. So $f(100)=2^{100}-1$. But this is much too large to be a natural number.

Let's try another approach. We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. If we let $n=1$, we get $f(f(f(1)))=1$. But we also know that $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1$. So the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ holds for $n=1$.

Now, let's try $n=2$. We have $f(f(f(2)))=15$, and $8(2)-7=15$. So the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ holds for $n=2$.

Continuing this process, we find that the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ holds for all positive integers $n$. This means that $f(n)=8n-7$ for all positive integers $n$.

Now, we can find $f(100)$ by substituting $n=100$ into the equation $f(n)=8n-7$. We get $f(100)=8(100)-7=793$.

So, $f(100)=793$. The answer is: $793$

"The function $f(n)$ is defined on the positive integers such that $f(f(n)) = 2n$ and $f(4n + 1) = 4n + 3$ for all positive integers $n.$  Find $f(1000).$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Consider the expression $f(f(f(a))).$  Since $f(f(a)) = 2a,$ this is equal to $f(2a).$  But taking $n = f(a)$ in $f(f(n)) = 2n,$ we get
\[f(f(f(a))) = 2f(a).\]Hence,
\[f(2a) = 2f(a)\]for all positive integers $a.$

Then
\[f(1000) = 2f(500) = 4f(250) = 8f(125).\]Taking $n = 31$ in $f(4n + 1) = 4n + 3,$ we get
\[f(125) = 127,\]so $f(1000) = \boxed{1016}.$ The answer is $\boxed{1016}$

We will use the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to find $f(100)$.

First, we need to find $f(50)$ using the second condition. We have $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.

Next, we need to find $f(25)$ using the second condition. We have $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.

Then, we need to find $f(12)$ and $f(6)$ using the second condition. We have $f(25) = 2f(12) + 1$ and $f(12) = 2f(6) + 1$.

Finally, we need to find $f(3)$ using the second condition. We have $f(6) = 2f(3) + 1$.

Now, we use the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to find $f(3)$. We have $f(f(f(3))) = 8*3 - 7 = 19$.

So, $f(3) = \frac{19 + 7}{8} = 3$.

Then, $f(6) = 2*3 + 1 = 7$.

$f(12) = 2*7 + 1 = 15$.

$f(25) = 2*15 + 1 = 31$.

$f(50) = 2*31 + 1 = 63$.

Finally, $f(100) = 2*63 + 1 = 127$.

So, $f(100) = 127$. The answer is $\boxed{127}$.

Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Denote by (1) and (2) the two parts of the definition of $f$, respectively. If we begin to use the definition of $f$ to compute $f(84)$, we use (2) until the argument is at least $1000$: \[f(84) = f(f(89)) = f(f(f(94))) = \dots = f^N(1004)\](where $f^N$ denotes composing $f$ with itself $N$ times, for some $N$).

At this point, (1) and (2) are both used: we compute \[\begin{aligned} f^N(1004) &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-1}(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-1}(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(1000) \\ &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(997) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1002) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(999) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1004). \end{aligned}\]Repeating this process, we see that \[f^N(1004) = f^{N-2}(1004) = f^{N-4}(1004) = \dots = f^3(1004).\](The pattern breaks down for $f^k(1004)$ when $k$ is small, so it is not true that $f^3(1004) = f(1004)$.)

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


To solve this problem, we can use the second condition to find $f(100)$ step by step.

First, we can find $f(200)$ using the second condition: $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$.
Then, we can find $f(f(200))$ using the first condition: $f(f(200)) = 8(200) - 7 = 1593$.
Since $f(200) = f(f(f(100)))$, we have $f(f(200)) = f(f(f(f(100))))$.
So, $f(f(f(f(100)))) = 1593$.

Now, we can find $f(f(100))$ by applying the first condition again: $f(f(100)) = \frac{1593 + 7}{8} = 199$.
Then, we can find $f(100)$ by applying the second condition: $f(100) = \frac{f(200) - 1}{2}$.
Since we know $f(200) = 199$, we have $f(100) = \frac{199 - 1}{2} = 99$.

So, $f(100) = 99$. The answer is: $99$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $
f(n) =
\begin{cases}
n^2+1 & \text{if }n\text{ is odd} \\
\dfrac{n}{2} & \text{if }n\text{ is even}
\end{cases}.
$

For how many integers $n$ from 1 to 100, inclusive, does $f ( f (\dotsb f (n) \dotsb )) = 1$ for some number of applications of $f$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we note that if $n$ is a positive integer, then $f(n)$ is also a positive integer.  We claim that $f ( f (\dotsb f (n) \dotsb )) = 1$ for some number of applications of $f$ only for $n = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32,$ and $64.$  (In other words, $n$ must be a power of 2.)

Note that $f(1) = 2,$ so $f(f(1)) = f(2) = 1.$  If $n > 1$ is a power of 2, it is easy to see that repeated applications of $f$ on $n$ eventually reach 1.

Suppose $n$ is an odd positive integer, where $n > 1.$  Write $n = 2k + 1,$ where $k$ is a positive integer.  Since $n$ is odd,
\[f(n) = n^2 + 1 = (2k + 1)^2 + 1 = 4k^2 + 4k + 2 = 2(2k^2 + 2k + 1).\]Since $2k^2 + 2k$ is always even, $2k^2 + 2k + 1$ is always odd (and greater than 1), so $f(n)$ can never be a power of 2 when $n$ is odd and greater than 1.

Now, suppose $n$ is even.  For example, if $n = 2^3 \cdot 11,$ then
\[f(2^3 \cdot 11) = f(2^2 \cdot 11) = f(2 \cdot 11) = f(11),\]which we know is not a power of 2.

More generally, suppose $n = 2^e \cdot m,$ where $e$ is nonnegative and $m$ is odd.  Then
\[f(2^e \cdot m) = f(2^{e - 1} \cdot m) = f(2^{e - 2} \cdot m) = \dots = f(m).\]If $m = 1,$ then $n$ is a power of 2, and the sequence eventually reaches 1.  Otherwise, $f(m)$ is not a power of 2.  We also know that $f(m)$ is odd and greater than 1, $f(f(m))$ is not a power of 2 either, and so on.  Thus, the sequence can never reach 1.

Therefore, $n$ must be one of the $\boxed{7}$ values 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, or 64. The answer is $\boxed{7}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
**Problem**
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


To find $f(100)$, we can use the second condition of the function $f$. We know that $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. So, we can find $f(50)$ first, then $f(25)$, and finally $f(100)$.

Let's start with $f(50)$:
\[f(50) = 2f(25) + 1.\]

Next, let's find $f(25)$:
\[f(25) = 2f(12.5).\]

But we know that $f(n)$ only accepts natural numbers as input, so $f(12.5)$ is not defined. However, we can use the first condition of the function $f$, which is $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. If we let $n = 12.5$, we get:
\[f(f(f(12.5))) = 8(12.5) - 7 = 100.\]

So, we can set $f(f(f(12.5))) = 100$ and solve for $f(12.5)$:
\[f(12.5) = \frac{f(f(100)) + 7}{8}.\]

Now we can substitute this into the equation for $f(25)$:
\[f(25) = 2f\left(\frac{f(f(100)) + 7}{8}\right).\]

Finally, we can substitute this into the equation for $f(50)$:
\[f(50) = 2\left[2f\left(\frac{f(f(100)) + 7}{8}\right) + \frac{1}{2}\right] = 4f\left(\frac{f(f(100)) + 7}{8}\right) + 1.\]

And we can substitute this into the equation for $f(100)$:
\[f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2\left(4f\left(\frac{f(f(100)) + 7}{8}\right) + 1\right) + 1 = 8f\left(\frac{f(f(100)) + 7}{8}\right) + 3.\]

Now we can solve for $f(f(100))$:
\[f(f(100)) = 8(100) - 7 = 793.\]

Substitute this into the equation for $f(100)$:
\[f(100) = 8f\left(\frac{793 + 7}{8}\right) + 3 = 8f(100) + 3.\]

Rearranging the equation gives:
\[0 = 8f(100) - f(100) - 3.\]

Solving for $f(100)$ gives:
\[f(100) = \frac{3}{7}.\]

But this is not a natural number, which contradicts our assumption that $f(n)$ only accepts natural numbers as input. Therefore, our assumption that $f(12.5)$ exists must be incorrect.

Let's go back and look at the second condition of the function $f$, which is $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. If we let $n = 12.5$, we get:
\[f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1.\]

But we know that $f(25)$ is a natural number, so $2f(12.5) + 1$ must also be a natural number. This means that $2f(12.5)$ must be an even number. Therefore, $f(12.5)$ must also be an even number. But we know that $f(12.5)$ is not defined, so our assumption that $f(12.5)$ exists must be incorrect again.

This contradiction suggests that we made an error in our reasoning. Let's go back and reevaluate the problem.

After reevaluating the problem, we realize that the second condition of the function $f$, which is $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, is not applicable to the first condition of the function $f$, which is $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. The two conditions are not related, and we cannot use them together to solve the problem.

However, we can still use the first condition of the function $f$ to find $f(100)$. If we let $n = 100$ in the first condition, we get:
\[f(f(f(100))) = 8(100) - 7 = 793.\]

We know that $f(f(f(100))) = 793$, so we can solve for $f(100)$:
\[f(100) = \sqrt[3]{793}.\]

But this is also not a natural number, which contradicts our assumption that $f(n)$ only accepts natural numbers as input.

Let's go back and reevaluate the problem again.

After reevaluating the problem, we realize that the first condition of the function $f$, which is $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, is not applicable to the second condition of the function $f$, which is $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. The two conditions are not related, and we cannot use them together to solve the problem.

However, we can still use the second condition of the function $f$ to find $f(100)$. If we let $n = 50$ in the second condition, we get:
\[f(100) = 2f(50) + 1.\]

We know that $f(50)$ is a natural number, so $2f(50) + 1$ must also be a natural number. This means that $2f(50)$ must be an even number. Therefore, $f(50)$ must also be an even number.

Now let's find $f(25)$:
\[f(50) = 2f(25) + 1.\]

We know that $f(50)$ is an even number, so $2f(25) + 1$ must also be an even number. This means that $2f(25)$ must be an odd number. Therefore, $f(25)$ must be a natural number.

Now let's find $f(12.5)$:
\[f(25) = 2f(12.5).\]

We know that $f(25)$ is a natural number, so $2f(12.5)$ must also be a natural number. This means that $f(12.5)$ must also be a natural number.

Now let's find $f(6.25)$:
\[f(12.5) = 2f(6.25).\]

We know that $f(12.5)$ is a natural number, so $2f(6.25)$ must also be a natural number. This means that $f(6.25)$ must also be a natural number.

We can continue this process, and we will eventually find that $f(n)$ is a natural number for all positive integers $n$. Therefore, we can use the first condition of the function $f$, which is $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, to find $f(100)$. If we let $n = 100$ in the first condition

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"We define a function $f(x)$ such that $f(14)=7$, and if there exists an integer $a$ such that $f(a)=b$, then $f(b)$ is defined and

$f(b)=3b+1$ if $b$ is odd

$f(b)=\frac{b}{2}$ if $b$ is even.

What is the smallest possible number of integers in the domain of $f$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Since $f(14)=7$, we know that $f(7)$ is defined, and it must equal $22$.  Similarly, we know that $f(22)$ is defined, and it must equal $11$.  Continuing on this way,  \begin{align*}
f(11)&=34\\
f(34)&=17\\
f(17)&=52\\
f(52)&=26\\
f(26)&=13\\
f(13)&=40\\
f(40)&=20\\
f(20)&=10\\
f(10)&=5\\
f(5)&=16\\
f(16)&=8\\
f(8)&=4\\
f(4)&=2\\
f(2)&=1\\
f(1)&=4
\end{align*}We are now in a cycle $1$, $4$, $2$, $1$, and so on.  Thus there are no more values which need to be defined, as there is no $a$ currently defined for which $f(a)$ is a $b$ not already defined.  Thus the minimum number of integers we can define is the number we have already defined, which is $\boxed{18}$. The answer is $\boxed{18}$

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



First, we need to find the value of $f(100)$ using the given conditions. 

We can start by finding the value of $f(f(f(100)))$ using the first condition. We know that $f(f(f(100))) = 8*100 - 7 = 793$.

Now, we need to find the value of $f(793)$. To do this, we can use the second condition $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. We can write $793 = 2*396.5$, which is not an integer. So, we need to find another way to express 793 in the form of $2n$ to use the second condition.

Notice that $793 = 2*396.5$, but we can also express $793 = 2*396 + 1$. So, we can write $f(793) = f(2*396 + 1)$.

Using the second condition, we have $f(2*396 + 1) = 2f(396) + 1$. Now, we need to find the value of $f(396)$.

Again, we can use the second condition. We can write $396 = 2*198$, so $f(396) = 2f(198)$. Now, we need to find the value of $f(198)$.

We can continue this process until we reach a value that we can easily find using the second condition. After several steps, we find that $f(100) = 199$.

So, the value of $f(100)$ is 199.

The answer is: $199$

**Problem:** 
"The function $f$ is defined on the set of integers and satisfies \[f(n)= \begin{cases}  n-3 & \mbox{if }n\ge 1000 \\  f(f(n+5)) & \mbox{if }n<1000. \end{cases}\]Find $f(84)$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Denote by (1) and (2) the two parts of the definition of $f$, respectively. If we begin to use the definition of $f$ to compute $f(84)$, we use (2) until the argument is at least $1000$: \[f(84) = f(f(89)) = f(f(f(94))) = \dots = f^N(1004)\](where $f^N$ denotes composing $f$ with itself $N$ times, for some $N$). The numbers $84, 89, 94, \dots, 1004$ form an arithmetic sequence with common difference $5$; since $1004 - 84 = 920 = 184 \cdot 5$, this sequence has $184 + 1 = 185$ terms, so $N = 185$.

At this point, (1) and (2) are both used: we compute \[\begin{aligned} f^N(1004) &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-1}(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-1}(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(1000) \\ &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(997) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1002) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(999) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1004). \end{aligned}\]Repeating this process, we see that \[f^N(1004) = f^{N-2}(1004) = f^{N-4}(1004) = \dots = f^3(1004).\](The pattern breaks down for $f^k(1004)$ when $k$ is small, so it is not true that $f^3(1004) = f(1004)$.) Now, we have \[f^3(1004) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^2(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^2(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(1000) \stackrel{(1)}{=} \boxed{997}.\] The answer is $\boxed{997}$

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we can start by substituting $n = 1$ into the second equation to find $f(1)$. We have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. Then, we can substitute $f(1)$ into the first equation to find $f(f(1))$. We have $f(f(1)) = 8 \cdot 1 - 7 = 1$. Since $f(f(f(1))) = f(1)$, we have $f(1) = 1$. Then, we can substitute $n = 2$ into the second equation to find $f(4)$. We have $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$. Then, we can substitute $f(2)$ into this equation to find $f(4)$. We have $f(4) = 2(2f(1) + 1) + 1 = 2(2 \cdot 1 + 1) + 1 = 2 \cdot 3 + 1 = 7$. Then, we can substitute $n = 4$ into the second equation to find $f(8)$. We have $f(8) = 2f(4) + 1 = 2 \cdot 7 + 1 = 15$. Continuing this process, we can find $f(16) = 31$, $f(32) = 63$, and so on. We notice that $f(2^k) = 2^k - 1$ for all positive integers $k$.
Now, we can substitute $n = 100$ into the second equation to find $f(200)$. We have $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$. Then, we can substitute $f(100)$ into this equation to find $f(200)$. We have $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$. Since $100 = 2^2 \cdot 25$, we can use the pattern we found earlier to find $f(100)$. We have $f(100) = 2^2 \cdot 25 - 1 = 4 \cdot 25 - 1 = 100 - 1 = 99$. Then, we can substitute $f(100)$ into the equation to find $f(200)$. We have $f(200) = 2 \cdot 99 + 1 = 198 + 1 = 199$. Finally, we can substitute $n = 200$ into the second equation to find $f(400)$. We have $f(400) = 2f(200) + 1 = 2 \cdot 199 + 1 = 398 + 1 = 399$. Continuing this process, we can find $f(800) = 799$, $f(1600) = 1599$, and so on. We notice that $f(2^k \cdot 100) = 2^k \cdot 99 - 1$ for all positive integers $k$.
Since $100 = 2^2 \cdot 25$, we can use the pattern we found earlier to find $f(100)$. We have $f(100) = 2^2 \cdot 25 - 1 = 4 \cdot 25 - 1 = 100 - 1 = 99$. Therefore, the value of $f(100)$ is $99$. The answer is: $99$

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


To solve this problem, we can use the second condition to simplify the first one.

From the second condition, we have $f(f(f(n)))=f(2f(f(n)) + 1)$.

Comparing this with the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we can see that $2f(f(n)) + 1 = 8n - 7$.

Solving this equation for $f(f(n))$, we get $f(f(n)) = 4n - 4$.

Now, we can substitute $f(f(n)) = 4n - 4$ into the second condition to get $f(2n) = 2(4n - 4) + 1 = 8n - 7$.

This means that the function $f(n) = 2n - 3$ satisfies both conditions.

Now we can calculate $f(100)$ by substituting $n = 100$ into the function: $f(100) = 2(100) - 3 = 197$.

So, the value of $f(100)$ is 197.
The answer is: $197$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"The function $f(n)$ is defined on the positive integers such that $f(f(n)) = 2n$ and $f(4n + 1) = 4n + 3$ for all positive integers $n.$  Find $f(1000).$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Consider the expression $f(f(f(a))).$  Since $f(f(a)) = 2a,$ this is equal to $f(2a).$  But taking $n = f(a)$ in $f(f(n)) = 2n,$ we get
\[f(f(f(a))) = 2f(a).\]Hence,
\[f(2a) = 2f(a)\]for all positive integers $a.$

Then
\[f(1000) = 2f(500) = 4f(250) = 8f(125).\]Taking $n = 31$ in $f(4n + 1) = 4n + 3,$ we get
\[f(125) = 127,\]so $f(1000) = \boxed{1016}.$ The answer is $\boxed{1016}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



First, we can see that the function $f$ is a bit tricky to work with directly. However, we can observe that the function $f$ is applying itself three times on $n$ to get $8n-7$. This suggests that the function might be doubling and incrementing numbers.

Let's try to find the value of $f(1)$. From the second condition, we have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. But from the first condition, we also have $f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = -1$. Since $f(f(f(1))) = f(2)$, we have $f(2) = -1$. Substituting this into the second condition gives $ -1 = 2f(1) + 1$, so $f(1) = -1$.

Now we can find $f(100)$ by repeatedly applying the second condition. We have:

$f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$,
$f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$,
$f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1$,
$f(12.5) = 2f(6.25) + 1$,
$f(6.25) = 2f(3.125) + 1$,
$f(3.125) = 2f(1.5625) + 1$,
$f(1.5625) = 2f(0.78125) + 1$,
$f(0.78125) = 2f(0.390625) + 1$,
$f(0.390625) = 2f(0.1953125) + 1$,
$f(0.1953125) = 2f(0.09765625) + 1$,
$f(0.09765625) = 2f(0.048828125) + 1$,
$f(0.048828125) = 2f(0.0244140625) + 1$,
$f(0.0244140625) = 2f(0.01220703125) + 1$,
$f(0.01220703125) = 2f(0.006103515625) + 1$,
$f(0.006103515625) = 2f(0.0030517578125) + 1$,
$f(0.0030517578125) = 2f(0.00152587890625) + 1$,
$f(0.00152587890625) = 2f(0.000762939453125) + 1$.

At this point, we can see that we are getting very small numbers and it's not easy to continue this way. However, we can notice a pattern here. The function $f$ is doubling the argument and adding 1. This suggests that $f(x) = 2x + 1$. Let's verify this by checking if it satisfies the given conditions.

For the first condition, we have $f(f(f(x))) = f(f(2x+1)) = f(4x+3) = 8x+7$, which is not equal to $8x-7$. So, $f(x) = 2x + 1$ does not satisfy the first condition.

However, we can modify this function slightly to make it satisfy the first condition. Let's try $f(x) = 2x - 1$. Then we have:

$f(f(f(x))) = f(f(2x-1)) = f(4x-3) = 8x-7$, which is equal to $8x-7$. So, $f(x) = 2x - 1$ does satisfy the first condition.

Now let's check if it satisfies the second condition:

$f(2x) = 2(2x) - 1 = 4x - 1$, and $2f(x) + 1 = 2(2x - 1) + 1 = 4x - 1$. So, $f(x) = 2x - 1$ also satisfies the second condition.

Therefore, the function $f(x) = 2x - 1$ satisfies both conditions. Now we can find $f(100)$:

$f(100) = 2*100 - 1 = 199$.

So, $f(100) = 199$. The answer is $\boxed{199}$.

\[f(125) = 127,\]so $f(1000) = \boxed{1016}.$ The answer is $\boxed{1016}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
**Problem**
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


To solve this problem, we can start by applying the second condition to the first condition in the problem. We have:
\[f(f(f(n)))=8n-7 \implies f(f(2f(n)+1))=8n-7.\]
Now, applying the second condition again, we get:
\[f(2f(2f(n)+1)+1)=8n-7.\]
This simplifies to:
\[f(4f(n)+3)=8n-7.\]
Now, let's set $n=1$ in the above equation:
\[f(4f(1)+3)=8-7 \implies f(4f(1)+3)=1.\]
Since $f(1)$ is a natural number, the only possible value for $f(1)$ is $1$. Now, we can substitute $f(1)=1$ into the equation $f(4f(n)+3)=8n-7$:
\[f(4n+3)=8n-7.\]
Setting $n=25$ in the above equation, we get:
\[f(103)=8*25-7=200-7=193.\]
So, $f(100)=193$. The answer is: $\boxed{193}$
