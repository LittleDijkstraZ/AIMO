**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Find the number of 10-tuples $(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{10})$ of real numbers such that
\[(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2 = \frac{1}{11}.\]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,
\begin{align*}
&[(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + \dots + 1^2 + 1^2)][(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2] \\
&\ge [(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + (x_2 - x_3) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10}]^2 = 1.
\end{align*}From the given condition, we have equality, so by the equality condition for Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[\frac{1 - x_1}{1} = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{1} = \frac{x_2 - x_3}{1} = \dots = \frac{x_9 - x_{10}}{1} = \frac{x_{10}}{1}.\]Let
\[d = 1 - x_1 = x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_3 = \dots = x_9 - x_{10} = x_{10}.\]Then
\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so
\[(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_{10}) = \left( \frac{10}{11}, \frac{9}{11}, \frac{8}{11}, \dots, \frac{1}{11} \right).\]In particular, there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we first need to understand the given equation and the conditions that make it equal to zero. The equation is a product of two terms, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.

The first term is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. This term is zero when both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) = 0$. This happens when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This represents a square with side length 20, centered at the origin.

The second term is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. This term is zero when both $(\vert x \vert - 8) = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8) = 0$. This happens when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This represents a square with side length 16, centered at the origin.

The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for. The area of a square is given by the square of the side length, so the area of the first square is $20^2 = 400$ and the area of the second square is $16^2 = 256$. The intersection of the two squares is a square with side length 8 (the smaller side of the two squares), so its area is $8^2 = 64$.

To find the area of the convex polygon, we subtract the area of the intersection from the sum of the areas of the two squares: $400 + 256 - 64 = 592$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 592. The answer is: $592$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_ 2= (-16,2).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that
\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as
\[\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1.\]Find $h + k + a + b.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

It seems like we have a problem with our code. The error `IndexError: list index out of range` is because our solution list `solutions` is empty. This is because the equations we are solving are not straightforward to solve using sympy's `solve` function. Let's try a different approach.

We can solve this problem by observing that the given equation is satisfied if and only if either one of the following four conditions is satisfied:

1. $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$
2. $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x| = 8$
3. $|x - y| = 10$ and $|y| = 8$
4. $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$

These conditions define four lines in the plane. The intersection points of these lines form a rectangle with side lengths 16 and 20. The area of this rectangle is $16 \times 20 = 320$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 320.

The answer is: $320$

\end{align*}From the given condition, we have equality, so by the equality condition for Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[\frac{1 - x_1}{1} = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{1} = \frac{x_2 - x_3}{1} = \dots = \frac{x_9 - x_{10}}{1} = \frac{x_{10}}{1}.\]Let
\[d = 1 - x_1 = x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_3 = \dots = x_9 - x_{10} = x_{10}.\]Then

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. This gives us four cases to consider:
1. $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x - y| - 10 = 0$.
2. $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x| - 8 = 0$.
3. $|x - y| - 10 = 0$ and $|y| - 8 = 0$.
4. $|x| - 8 = 0$ and $|y| - 8 = 0$.

For each of these cases, we can find the corresponding points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equation and plot them on a coordinate plane. The points that satisfy each case form a square or a rectangle. The union of these squares and rectangles forms a larger square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    # The side length of the square is 16
    side_length = 16

    # The area of the square is side_length^2
    area = side_length**2

    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

The area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


The equation is of the form $A \cdot B = 0$, which means that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. So we can break the problem into two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

For the second case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersection points of these lines are the vertices of the polygon. By plotting these lines, we find that the polygon is a square with side length 16. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we first need to understand the given equation and the conditions that make it equal to zero. The equation is:
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]
This equation is equal to zero if either of the two factors is zero. The first factor is zero when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which represent two circles in the $xy$-plane. The second factor is zero when $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$, which represent two more circles in the $xy$-plane. The intersection of these four circles forms a square.

To find the side length of the square, we can use the distance between the centers of the circles $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The centers of these circles are at $(0, 10)$ and $(10, 0)$, respectively. The distance between these two points is $\sqrt{(10-0)^2 + (0-10)^2} = \sqrt{100+100} = \sqrt{200} = 10\sqrt{2}$. So the side length of the square is $10\sqrt{2} - 2(8) = 10\sqrt{2} - 16$.

The area of the square is then $(10\sqrt{2} - 16)^2$. We can calculate this value using sympy:

```python

def calculate_area():
    # Define the side length of the square

    area = side_length**2

    # Simplify the area
    area = simplify(area)

## QUESTION 3 - 10 
- TIME_SPENT : 547 secs

10_
**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Find the number of 10-tuples $(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{10})$ of real numbers such that
\[(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2 = \frac{1}{11}.\]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,
\begin{align*}
&[(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + \dots + 1^2 + 1^2)][(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2] \\
&\ge [(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + (x_2 - x_3) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10}]^2 = 1.
\end{align*}From the given condition, we have equality, so by the equality condition for Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[\frac{1 - x_1}{1} = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{1} = \frac{x_2 - x_3}{1} = \dots = \frac{x_9 - x_{10}}{1} = \frac{x_{10}}{1}.\]Let
\[d = 1 - x_1 = x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_3 = \dots = x_9 - x_{10} = x_{10}.\]Then
\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so
\[(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_{10}) = \left( \frac{10}{11}, \frac{9}{11}, \frac{8}{11}, \dots, \frac{1}{11} \right).\]In particular, there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.
For the first term to be zero, we must have $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$.
This means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
The solutions to these equations are the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.
For the second term to be zero, we must have $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.
This means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The solutions to these equations are the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.
The points that satisfy either of these conditions form a square with side length 16.
The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
So the area of the convex polygon is 256.
The answer is: $256$
