 To solve this problem, we will first analyze the equation and understand the conditions under which it is satisfied. Then, we will use these conditions to determine the vertices of the polygon and calculate its area.

The given equation is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

Notice that the second term of the equation becomes zero when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means all points $(x, y)$ that lie inside or on the boundary of a square with side length 16, centered at the origin, satisfy the equation. 

Similarly, the first term of the equation becomes zero when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This forms four isosceles triangles with side lengths $10, 10, 10\sqrt{2}$ (by the Pythagorean theorem) around the origin. 

These four triangles together form a square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$, which is completely contained within the square with side length 16.

Therefore, the polygon formed by the points satisfying the equation is a square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$.

The area of this square is $(10\sqrt{2})^2 = 200$.

Let's use Python to calculate the area of the square:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import sqrt

def calculate_area():
    side_length = 10 * sqrt(2)
    area = side_length**2
    return area

result = calculate_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 200

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
200
```

So, the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{200}$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The given equation is a product of two terms. In order for the product to be zero, one of the terms must be zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

Case 1: The expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ represents two circles centered at $(10,10)$ and $(-10,10)$ with a radius of $10$. 

Case 2: The expression $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2$ represents two circles centered at $(8,8)$ and $(-8,8)$ with a radius of $8$.

From the equations of the circles in each case, we can see that the points satisfying the equation are the points on the boundary of the four circles. These four circles enclose a convex polygon.

To find the area of this convex polygon, we can find the area of the four circles and subtract the area of the two overlapping regions. 

The radius of the circles is $10$ and $8$, so the area of a circle is $\pi r^2$. The total area of the four circles is $4\pi(10^2 + 8^2)$.

The area of the overlapping region is the area of the rectangle formed by the centers of the two sets of circles. The width of the rectangle is $2(10 + 8)$, and the height is $2(10 + 8)$.

So, the area of the overlapping region is $4(10 + 8)^2$.

The area of the convex polygon is the total area of the four circles minus the area of the overlapping region: $4\pi(10^2 + 8^2) - 4(10 + 8)^2$.

Below is Python code to calculate the area of the convex polygon:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import pi

def area_of_polygon():
    # Radius of the circles
    r1 = 10
    r2 = 8

    # Total area of the four circles
    total_area = 4 * pi * (r1**2 + r2**2)

    # Area of the overlapping region
    overlapping_area = 4 * (r1 + r2)**2

    # Area of the convex polygon
    polygon_area = total_area - overlapping_area

    return polygon_area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS -1296 + 656*pi

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
-1296 + 656*pi
```
The area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{-1296 + 656\pi}$.
