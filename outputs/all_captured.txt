"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.



To solve this problem, we can start by plugging in $n=100$ into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. This gives us $f(200)=2f(100)+1$.

Next, we can plug in $f(100)$ into the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. This gives us $f(f(f(100)))=8*100-7=793$.

Since $f(f(f(100)))=793$, we can substitute $f(100)$ with $x$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. This gives us $f(f(f(x)))=8x-7=793$.

Solving for $x$ in the equation $f(f(f(x)))=793$, we can see that $x=100$. Therefore, $f(100)=100$.

Now we can substitute $f(100)$ with $100$ in the equation $f(200)=2f(100)+1$. This gives us $f(200)=2*100+1=201$.

So, $f(100)=100$ and $f(200)=201$.

We can use these two equations to find a pattern in the function $f(n)$. From $f(200)=201$, we can see that $f(n)$ is an increasing function.

Since $f(100)=100$, we can deduce that $f(n)=n$ for $n \leq 100$.

Therefore, $f(100)=100$. The answer is: $100$
