Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

 This problem seems to be a bit off-topic for this platform, as it requires a deep understanding of absolute value functions and how to handle them mathematically. But, if you want a numerical answer, you can simply solve it using a bit of logical thinking.

The equation is $0$ if either of the two terms inside the product is $0$. Therefore, we have four separate cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x - y \vert = 10$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert y \vert = 8$.

From 3 and 4, we can conclude that the points must lie inside a square with side length $16$ (since the absolute value of $x$ or $y$ must be less than or equal to $8$).

From 1 and 2, we know that for any point $(x, y)$ that satisfies the equation, the sum or difference of its coordinates must be $10$. This means that the points must lie on a square grid, with a spacing of $10$ units between the lines of the grid.

The intersection of these conditions is a $16 \times 16$ square with $10 \times 10$ smaller squares removed from each corner (since the points cannot be at a distance of $10$ units from the origin).

The area of the convex polygon is then the area of the $16 \times 16$ square minus the area of the $4$ corner squares of side length $10$, which is $256 - 4 \times 50 = 256 - 200 = 56$. So the area of the convex polygon is $56$.

However, this is not the correct answer as it is not possible to enclose a $16 \times 16$ square with a grid of $10 \times 10$ squares. The spacing between the grid lines should be $8$ units, not $10$ units. Let's correct this:

From 1 and 2, we know that for any point $(x, y)$ that satisfies the equation, the sum or difference of its coordinates must be $8$. This means that the points must lie on a square grid, with a spacing of $8$ units between the lines of the grid.

The intersection of these conditions is a $16 \times 16$ square with $8 \times 8$ smaller squares removed from each corner (since the points cannot be at a distance of $8$ units from the origin).

The area of the convex polygon is then the area of the $16 \times 16$ square minus the area of the $4$ corner squares of side length $8$, which is $256 - 4 \times 64 = 256 - 256 = 0$.

This still doesn't give a valid answer, so let's reconsider the problem.

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = \vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that for any point $(x, y)$ that satisfies the equation, the sum of its coordinates is always equal to the difference of its coordinates, and both are equal to $10$. This implies that the points lie on a line, specifically the line $y = x$.

Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = \vert y \vert = 8$. This means that the x and y coordinates of the points are always equal to $8$ or $-8$. This implies that the points lie on the lines $y = x$ and $y = -x$, and the distance from the origin is always $8\sqrt{2}$.

The intersection of these conditions is a square with side length $16$ (since the distance from the origin is $8\sqrt{2}$, and the diagonal of a square is $16$), with a $10 \times 10$ smaller square removed from each corner (since the points cannot be at a distance of $10$ units from the origin).

The area of the convex polygon is then the area of the $16 \times 16$ square minus the area of the $4$ corner squares of side length $10$, which is $256 - 4 \times 50 = 256 - 200 = 56$. So the area of the convex polygon is $56$.

The area of the convex polygon is then the area of the $16 \times 16$ square minus the area of the $4$ corner squares of side length $8$, which is $256 - 4 \times 64 = 256 - 256 = 0$.

This still doesn't give a valid answer, so let's reconsider the problem again.

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = \vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that for any point $(x, y)$ that satisfies the equation, the sum of its coordinates is always equal to the difference of its coordinates, and both are equal to $10$. This implies that the points lie on a line, specifically the line $y = x$.

Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = \vert y \vert = 8$. This means that the x and y coordinates of the points are always equal to $8$ or $-8$. This implies that the points lie on the lines $y = x$ and $y = -x$, and the distance from the origin is

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The expression $ab = 0$ is true if and only if either $a = 0$ or $b = 0$. Therefore, the given equation is satisfied if either $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$ or $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

The first equation is satisfied if and only if both $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These two equations define a square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$ and vertices at $(5,5)$, $(-5,5)$, $(-5,-5)$, and $(5,-5)$.

The second equation is satisfied if and only if both $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These two equations define a square with side length $16$ and vertices at $(8,8)$, $(-8,8)$, $(-8,-8)$, and $(8,-8)$.

The intersection of these two squares is a smaller square with side length $10$ and vertices at $(5,5)$, $(-5,5)$, $(-5,-5)$, and $(5,-5)$.

The area of a square with side length $s$ is $s^2$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $(10)^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The problem statement asks for the area of a polygon formed by the points that satisfy a given condition. The condition is that the product of two expressions is zero, which means that each of the expressions must be zero.

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$ and the second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. Each of these expressions will be zero only if the absolute value quantities are equal to their respective numbers (10 and 8). This gives us the following four equations:

1. $x + y = 10$
2. $x + y = -10$
3. $x - y = 10$
4. $x - y = -10$
5. $x = 8$
6. $x = -8$
7. $y = 8$
8. $y = -8$

By solving these equations, we can find the vertices of the polygon. The vertices are:
$(8, 2)$, $(8, -18)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, -18)$, $(2, 8)$, $(-18, 8)$, $(2, -8)$, $(-18, -8)$.

The polygon is a square with side length of $20$. The area of a square is the side length squared, so the area of this polygon is $20^2 = 400$. The answer is: $400$

Assistant:

 The given equation is of the form $AB = 0$, which implies that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. So, we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solution to these equations forms a square with side length 20, centered at the origin.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solution to these equations forms a square with side length 16, centered at the origin.

The intersection of these two regions is the convex polygon enclosed by the points that satisfy the given equation. This intersection is a square with side length 16.

The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
If $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$, which implies $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
If $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

Combining these conditions, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$. These form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The equation given is $ ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

For the product of two numbers to be zero, either one of the numbers must be zero. Therefore, we have two cases:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of a square with side length 10: $(5, 5), (5, -5), (-5, -5), (-5, 5)$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of a square with side length 16: $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, -8), (-8, 8)$.

The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for. The area of a square is given by the square of the side length, so the area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares: $10^2 + 16^2 = 100 + 256 = 356$.
The answer is: 356

The given equation is of the form $AB = 0$, which implies that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. 

For the equation to be true, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 10, which has an area of $10^2 = 100$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100.

This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The only way this can happen is if $x = 8$ or $x = -8$, and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. This gives us four points: $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

Plotting these points on a coordinate plane, we can see that they form a square with side length $10$. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon formed by these points is $100$.

The answer is: $100$
