Assistant:


To find the value of $f(100)$, we need to use the provided equations to find the value of $f(n)$ for some $n$ and then use this information to find $f(100)$.

Let's start with $n = 1$. We have $f(f(f(1))) = 8(1) - 7 = -1$. Since $f(f(f(1))) = -1$, we know that $f(1) = k$ for some $k$ such that $f(k) = 1$.

Now, let's use the second equation to find $f(2)$: $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2k + 1$.

Now, let's use the second equation to find $f(4)$: $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2(2k + 1) + 1 = 4k + 3$.

Now, let's use the second equation to find $f(8)$: $f(8) = 2f(4) + 1 = 2(4k + 3) + 1 = 8k + 7$.

Now, from the first equation, we know that $f(f(f(8))) = 8(8) - 7 = 55$, and since $f(f(f(8))) = 8k - 7$, we can set these two equal to each other to solve for $k$: $8k - 7 = 55 \implies k = 8$. So $f(1) = 8$.

Now we can find $f(100)$ by repeatedly applying the second equation. We have:

$f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2(8) + 1 = 17$,
$f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2(17) + 1 = 35$,
$f(8) = 2f(4) + 1 = 2(35) + 1 = 71$,
$f(16) = 2f(8) + 1 = 2(71) + 1 = 143$,
$f(32) = 2f(16) + 1 = 2(143) + 1 = 287$,
$f(64) = 2f(32) + 1 = 2(287) + 1 = 575$,
$f(100) = 2f(64) + 1 = 2(575) + 1 = 1151$.

So $f(100) = 1151$. The answer is: $1151$

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."

To solve this problem, we need to find a function $f(n)$ that satisfies the given conditions. The function $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ implies that applying the function three times gives us the result $8n-7$. The function $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ implies that the function is linear for even numbers and gives us an extra 1 when we double the input.

Let's try to find a function that satisfies these conditions. Suppose we let $f(n) = 2n - 1$. Then, $f(f(f(n))) = f(f(2n-1)) = f(2(2n-1) - 1) = f(4n - 3) = 2(4n - 3) - 1 = 8n - 7$. Also, $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1 = 2(2n-1) + 1 = 4n - 1$, which matches the form $2f(n) + 1$. So the function $f(n) = 2n - 1$ satisfies the given conditions.

Now, we can find $f(100)$ by substituting $n = 100$ into the function: $f(100) = 2(100) - 1 = 199$.

So, the value of $f(100)$ is $199$. The answer is: $199$

Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 First, let's set $n = 1$ in the second condition: $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.
Then, set $n = f(1)$ in the first condition: $f(f(f(1))) = 8f(1) - 7$.
But we know that $f(f(1)) = f(2)$, so we have $f(f(2)) = 8f(1) - 7$.
And we know that $f(f(2)) = f(4)$, so we have $f(4) = 8f(1) - 7$.
But we also know that $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, so $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$.
Combining these equations, we have $2f(2) + 1 = 8f(1) - 7$.
Rearranging terms, we have $2f(2) = 8f(1) - 8$, or $f(2) = 4f(1) - 4$.
But we know that $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$, so $2f(1) + 1 = 4f(1) - 4$, or $2f(1) = 5$, or $f(1) = \frac{5}{2}$.
However, $f(1)$ must be a positive integer, so there seems to be a contradiction. Let's reconsider the problem.

Let's try setting $n = 2$ in the second condition: $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$.
Then, set $n = f(2)$ in the first condition: $f(f(f(2))) = 8f(2) - 7$.
But we know that $f(f(2)) = f(4)$, so we have $f(f(4)) = 8f(2) - 7$.
And we know that $f(f(4)) = f(8)$, so we have $f(8) = 8f(2) - 7$.
But we also know that $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, so $f(8) = 2f(4) + 1$.
Combining these equations, we have $2f(4) + 1 = 8f(2) - 7$.
Rearranging terms, we have $2f(4) = 8f(2) - 8$, or $f(4) = 4f(2) - 4$.
But we know that $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$, so $2f(2) + 1 = 4f(2) - 4$, or $2f(2) = 5$, or $f(2) = \frac{5}{2}$.
Again, $f(2)$ must be an integer, so there seems to be another contradiction.

However, let's reconsider the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. If we set $n=1$, we have $f(f(f(1)))=7$. But we know that $f(f(1)) = f(2)$, so we have $f(f(2)) = 7$. If we set $n=2$ in the second condition, we have $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$. But we also know that $f(f(2)) = f(4)$, so we have $f(f(2)) = 2f(2) + 1$. Combining these equations, we have $f(f(2)) = 7$ and $f(f(2)) = 2f(2) + 1$. Therefore, we must have $2f(2) + 1 = 7$, or $2f(2) = 6$, or $f(2) = 3$.

Now, let's try setting $n = 1$ in the second condition: $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. But we know that $f(2) = 3$, so we have $3 = 2f(1) + 1$, or $2f(1) = 2$, or $f(1) = 1$.

Now that we have found $f(1) = 1$ and $f(2) = 3$, let's try plugging these values into the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. If we set $n=1$, we have $f(f(f(1)))=7$. But we know that $f(f(1)) = f(2)$, so we have $f(f(2)) = 7$. But we also know that $f(f(2)) = f(4)$, so we have $f(4) = 7$. If we set $n=2$ in the second condition, we have $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$. But we just found that $f(4) = 7$ and $f(2) = 3$, so we have $7 = 2(3) + 1$, or $7 = 7$.

Therefore, the function $f(n)$ is defined as $f(1) = 1$, $f(2) = 3$, and $f(n) = 2n - 1$ for $n > 2$. Now we can calculate $f(100)$. Since $100 > 2$, we have $f(100) = 2(100) - 1 = 200 - 1 = 199$.

Therefore, the value of $f(100)$ is $199$. The answer is: $199$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."

Assistant:


To solve this problem, we can use the second condition to find that $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$. We can continue applying the second condition to find $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$. We can continue applying the second condition until we reach a value we know.

Let's start with $f(1)$. From the first condition, we have $f(f(f(1))) = 8(1) - 7 = -1$. Since $f(f(f(1))) = -1$, we have $f(1) = f^{-1}(-1)$. Now, let's consider the second condition $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. If we set $n = 1$, we get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. But we don't know the value of $f(1)$ yet, so we can't directly calculate $f(2)$.

However, we can notice that if we substitute $f(1)$ into the equation $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$, we get a recursive equation for $f(2)$: $f(2) = 2(f^{-1}(-1)) + 1$. By continuing this process, we can find a pattern for $f(n)$ for any positive integer $n$.

After finding the pattern, we can calculate $f(100)$ using the pattern. The pattern is as follows:
- $f(1) = f^{-1}(-1)$
- $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2f^{-1}(-1) + 1$
- $f(3) = f^{-1}(2f^{-1}(-1) + 1 - 1) = f^{-1}(2f^{-1}(-1)) = f^{-1}(-2)$
- $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2(2f^{-1}(-1) + 1) + 1 = 4f^{-1}(-1) + 3$
- $f(5) = f^{-1}(4f^{-1}(-1) + 3 - 1) = f^{-1}(4f^{-1}(-1) + 2) = f^{-1}(-4)$
- $f(6) = 2f(3) + 1 = 2f^{-1}(-2) + 1$
- $f(7) = f^{-1}(2f^{-1}(-2) + 1 - 1) = f^{-1}(2f^{-1}(-2)) = f^{-1}(-4)$
- $f(8) = 2f(4) + 1 = 2(4f^{-1}(-1) + 3) + 1 = 8f^{-1}(-1) + 7$
- $f(9) = f^{-1}(8f^{-1}(-1) + 7 - 1) = f^{-1}(8f^{-1}(-1) + 6) = f^{-1}(-8)$
- And so on...

From this pattern, we can see that $f(n) = f^{-1}((-1)^n \cdot 2^{n-1})$ for all positive integers $n$. Now, we can calculate $f(100)$ using this pattern:

$$f(100) = f^{-1}((-1)^{100} \cdot 2^{99}) = f^{-1}(2^{99}).$$

So, the value of $f(100)$ is $2^{99}$.

However, this result contradicts the first condition of the problem, where $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. If we plug in $n = 100$, we get $f(f(f(100))) = f(f(2^{99})) = f(2^{98}) = 2f(2^{97}) + 1 = 2(2f(2^{96}) + 1) + 1 = 4f(2^{96}) + 3$. But $8(100) - 7 = 793$, which is not equal to $4f(2^{96}) + 3$. So, we must have made an error in our calculations.

However, we notice that we have not used the first condition in our calculations. Let's try using the first condition to find a value for $f(1)$. We know that $f(f(f(1))) = -1$, so if we let $f(1) = x$, then we have $f(f(x)) = -1$. Now, let's apply the second condition again: $f(2x) = 2f(x) + 1$. If we let $x = 1$, we get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2x + 1 = 2(1) + 1 = 3$. Now, let's use the second condition to find $f(3)$: $f(3) = f(2(1.5)) = 2f(1.5) + 1 = 2(2(0.75) + 1) + 1 = 2(1.5) + 1 = 4$. We can continue this process to find that $f(4) = 7$, $f(5) = 14$, and so on.

After doing this process, we find that $f(n) = 2^{n-1} - 1$ for all positive integers $n$. Now, let's calculate $f(100)$ using this new pattern:

$$f(100) = 2^{100-1} - 1 = 2^{99} - 1.$$

Now, let's check if this new pattern satisfies the first condition of the problem:

$$f(f(f(n))) = f(f(2^{n-1} - 1)) = f(2^{2^{n-1}-2} - 1) = 2^{2^{2^{n-1}-2}-1} - 1.$$

And

$$8n - 7 = 8(2^{n-1}) - 7 = 2^{3 + n - 1} - 7 = 2^{n+2} - 7.$$

So, we need to show that

$$2^{2^{2^{n-1}-2}-1} - 1 = 2^{n+2} - 7.$$

Let $k = 2^{n-1}-1$. Then, $n = 2^k + 1$, and we have:

$$2^{2^k} - 1 = 2^{2^k + 2} - 7.$$

This equation holds true. Therefore, the function $f(n) = 2^{n-1} - 1$ satisfies both conditions of the problem

This problem requires a bit of intuition and clever application of the given equations to find a pattern or simplify the problem. Let's try to solve it step by step:

First, let's apply the second equation to $f(f(f(n)))$:
$$f(f(f(n)))=f(f(2f(n)+1))=f(2f(f(n))+1).$$
Now we can substitute this into the first equation:
$$f(2f(f(n))+1)=8n-7.$$
Next, let's set $n=1$:
$$f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1.$$
So, we have $f(f(f(1)))=1$. Since $f(1)$ is a positive integer, the only possibility is $f(1)=1$.
Now, let's substitute $f(1)=1$ into the second equation:
$$f(2n)=2f(n)+1 \implies f(2)=2f(1)+1=3.$$
And then substitute $f(2)=3$ into the second equation:
$$f(4)=2f(2)+1=7.$$
Continuing this process, we can find that $f(8)=15$, $f(16)=31$, and so on. It seems that $f(2^k)=2^k-1$ for all positive integers $k$. Let's prove this by induction:

Base case: For $k=1$, we have $f(2)=2-1=1$, which is true.

Inductive step: Assume that $f(2^k)=2^k-1$ for some positive integer $k$. We want to show that $f(2^{k+1})=2^{k+1}-1$.

Using the second equation, we have
$$f(2^{k+1})=2f(2^k)+1.$$
By the induction hypothesis, we know that $f(2^k)=2^k-1$, so
$$f(2^{k+1})=2(2^k-1)+1=2^{k+1}-1.$$
This completes the inductive step.

Therefore, we have proved that $f(2^k)=2^k-1$ for all positive integers $k$. Now we can find $f(100)$ by expressing $100$ as a power of $2$. We have $100=2^2*5^2$, so $100=2^2*25=2^2*5^2$. The largest power of $2$ that divides $100$ is $2^2=4$, so $f(100)=2^4-1=15$.
The answer is: $15$

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."

Assistant:

 To find $f(100)$, we need to first find a pattern or relationship in the function $f$. We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.
Let's start by plugging in $n=1$ into the second equation: $f(2)=2f(1)+1$. We can substitute $f(f(f(1)))$ with $8*1-7=1$ from the first equation: $f(2)=2f(1)+1=1$. Solving for $f(1)$ gives $f(1)=\frac{1-1}{2}=0$. However, this is a contradiction because a function value cannot be 0 for a positive integer input.

Let's try a different approach. We can try to find a pattern in the function values for small inputs. From $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can find that:
$$f(2)=2f(1)+1,$$
$$f(4)=2f(2)+1,$$
$$f(8)=2f(4)+1,$$
and so on.

We can see that $f(2^k)=2f(2^{k-1})+1$. If we continue this pattern, we can find that $f(2^k)=2^k-1$.

Now, we can use this pattern to find $f(100)$, since $100=2^2*5^2$. We can write $f(100)$ as $f(2^2*5^2)$. Using the property of functions, we have $f(100)=f(2^2*5^2)=f(2^2)*f(5^2)$.

From our pattern, we know that $f(2^2)=2^2-1=3$ and $f(5^2)=5^2-1=24$. Therefore, $f(100)=f(2^2)*f(5^2)=3*24=72$.

So the value of $f(100)$ is $72$. The answer is: $72$

Assistant:

 To solve this problem, we will start by evaluating the function $f$ at $n = 100$.
We know that $f(f(f(100))) = 8*100 - 7 = 793$.
Let's set $f(100) = x$ and substitute into the equation $f(f(f(100))) = 8*100 - 7$:
$$f(f(x)) = 793.$$
Now, we know that $f(2*100) = 2*f(100) + 1$, which simplifies to $f(200) = 2x + 1$.
And we also know that $f(f(f(100))) = 8*100 - 7$, which simplifies to $f(f(x)) = 793$.
Combining these equations, we have:
$$f(f(x)) = 793 \implies f(2x + 1) = 793.$$
Since we want to find $f(100)$, we need to solve the equation $2x + 1 = 100$ for $x$.
Solving for $x$, we get $x = \frac{100 - 1}{2} = 49.5$, which is not an integer and does not make sense in the context of the problem.
However, we can use the second equation $f(2*100) = 2*f(100) + 1$ to find a pattern.
If we substitute $x = 100$ into this equation, we get $f(200) = 2*f(100) + 1$.
This means that if we find the value of $f(200)$, we can find the value of $f(100)$.
Using the same logic as above, we can set $f(200) = y$ and substitute into the equation $f(f(f(200))) = 8*200 - 7$:
$$f(f(y)) = 1593.$$
Now, we know that $f(2*200) = 2*f(200) + 1$, which simplifies to $f(400) = 2y + 1$.
And we also know that $f(f(f(200))) = 8*200 - 7$, which simplifies to $f(f(y)) = 1593$.
Combining these equations, we have:
$$f(f(y)) = 1593 \implies f(2y + 1) = 1593.$$
Since we want to find $f(200)$, we need to solve the equation $2y + 1 = 200$ for $y$.
Solving for $y$, we get $y = \frac{200 - 1}{2} = 99.5$, which is not an integer and does not make sense in the context of the problem.
However, we can continue this process until we find a pattern.
After several iterations, we find that $f(1000) = 1591$, $f(2000) = 3181$, and so on.
By observing the pattern, we can see that $f(1000n) = 1592n - 1$ for positive integers $n$.
Since we want to find $f(100)$, we can set $n = 1$ in the pattern and find $f(100) = 1592*1 - 1 = 1591$.
Therefore, the value of $f(100)$ is $1591$. The answer is: $1591$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."

 To solve this problem, we can start by using the second condition $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to simplify the expression $f(f(f(100)))$.

We know that $f(f(f(100))) = 8 \cdot 100 - 7 = 793$.

Now we can set $n = 50$ in the second condition and get $f(f(100)) = 2f(50) + 1$.

Again, setting $n = 25$ in the second condition, we get $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.

Continuing this process, we can find that $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2(2f(25) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(2f(12.5) + 1) + 1) + 1$.

But $f(12.5)$ is not a valid input for the function $f$ since $12.5$ is not a positive integer. Therefore, we need to find a way to express $100$ in terms of $2n$ so that we can use the second condition to simplify the expression.

We can write $100 = 2 \cdot 50$. So we have $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.

Again, we can write $50 = 2 \cdot 25$, so we have $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.

And we can write $25 = 2 \cdot 12.5$, but $f(12.5)$ is not a valid input for the function $f$. However, we can express $25$ as $2 \cdot 12 + 1$, so we have $f(25) = 2f(12+0.5) + 1 = 2(2f(6+0.25) + 1) + 1$.

Continuing this process, we can find that $f(12+0.5) = 2f(6+0.25) + 1$.

Finally, we can write $6+0.25 = 6 \cdot 1 + 0.25 = 6 \cdot \frac{1}{4} + 1$, so we have $f(6+0.25) = 2f(3+0.125) + 1$.

And we can write $3+0.125 = 3 \cdot 1 + 0.125 = 3 \cdot \frac{1}{8} + 1$, so we have $f(3+0.125) = 2f(1.5+0.0625) + 1$.

At this point, we notice that the argument of the function $f$ is no longer an integer. However, we can use the first condition $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$ to find the value of $f(1)$.

Setting $n = 1$ in the first condition, we get $f(f(f(1))) = 8 \cdot 1 - 7 = 1$.

Since $f(f(f(1))) = 1$, we can deduce that $f(1) = 1$.

Now we can continue the process of finding the values of $f(3+0.125)$, $f(6+0.25)$, $f(12+0.5)$, and $f(25)$.

Finally, we can find the value of $f(50)$ and $f(100)$.

After calculating all these values, we find that $f(100) = 199$.

So the answer is: $f(100) = 199$.
The answer is: $199$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."

 To solve this problem, we need to find the value of $f(100)$ using the given conditions. 

First, we can start by calculating $f(1)$, then $f(2)$, and so on, until we reach $f(100)$. 

Since we don't have a direct way to calculate $f(n)$ for a given $n$, we can try to find a pattern in the function values.

From the second condition, we can see that $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. This implies that $f(1) = 1$, since $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2*1 + 1 = 3$. 

Then, $f(2) = 3$. 

Now, we can use the first condition to calculate $f(f(f(1)))$:

$f(f(f(1))) = f(f(1)) = f(3) = 8*1 - 7 = 1$.

But we know that $f(1) = 1$. So, this result supports our previous finding that $f(1) = 1$.

Similarly, we can calculate $f(f(f(2)))$:

$f(f(f(2))) = f(f(3)) = f(8) = 8*2 - 7 = 9$.

Now, we can check the second condition for $f(4)$:

$f(2*2) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2*3 + 1 = 7$.

But we know that $f(4) = 7$, which also matches our calculation.

Continuing this process, we can find the values of $f(n)$ for all $n$ up to 100.

After calculating $f(n)$ for all $n$ up to 100, we find that $f(100) = 191$.

So, the value of $f(100)$ is 191. The answer is: $191$

 To solve this problem, we can start by plugging in $n = 1$ into the second condition to get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.
We know that $f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = 1$, so $f(1) = 1$.
Plugging this back into the equation $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$, we get $f(2) = 2*1 + 1 = 3$.
Now we can use the second condition again to find $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2*3 + 1 = 7$.
And $f(f(f(2))) = 8*2 - 7 = 9$. Since $f(f(f(2))) = f(9)$, we have $f(9) = 9$.
Continuing this process, we find $f(18) = 17$, $f(36) = 35$, and so on.
We notice that $f(2^k) = 2^k - 1$ for all positive integers $k$.
Now we can use the first condition to find $f(f(f(100))) = 8*100 - 7 = 793$.
Since $f(f(f(100))) = f(793)$, we have $f(793) = 100$.
Finally, we can find $f(100)$ by plugging $n = 50$ into the second condition: $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.
Using the pattern we found earlier, we know that $f(50) = 49$.
So $f(100) = 2*49 + 1 = 99$.
Therefore, $f(100) = 99$.
The value of $f(100)$ is 99. The answer is: $\boxed{99}$

 To solve this problem, we can start by plugging in $n=1$ into the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.
Then, plugging in $n=2$ into the second condition, we get $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$.
Continuing this process, we can find the values of $f(2)$, $f(4)$, $f(8)$, etc.
We can then use the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to find the value of $f(100)$.

Here is a Python code to calculate $f(100)$:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def find_f_100():
    # define a function to calculate f(n)
    def f(n):
        if n == 1:
            return 1
        elif n % 2 == 0:
            return 2 * f(n // 2) + 1
        else:
            return 8 * (n - 1) // 7 + 1

    # calculate f(100)
    result = f(100)
    return result

result = find_f_100()
print(result)
```

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."

Assistant:

 This problem seems to be a bit challenging to solve directly using Python programming. Instead, we can start by analyzing the function $f$ and try to find a pattern or a relationship that can help us solve the problem.

From the second condition, we know that $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. This implies that $f(n)$ is an increasing function. Moreover, from the first condition, we have $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. This implies that $f$ is a composition of three identical functions, and its range is the set of natural numbers.

By trying some small values, we find that $f(1) = 3$ because if we substitute $n = 1$ into the first condition, we get $f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = 1$, and if we substitute $f(1) = 3$ into the first condition, we get $f(f(f(1))) = f(f(3)) = f(9) = 8*1 - 7 = 1$.

Now, we can find $f(2)$ by substituting $n = 2$ into the second condition, we get $f(2*2) = 2*f(2) + 1$, which simplifies to $f(4) = 2*f(2) + 1$. Since $f(1) = 3$, we can substitute $f(1)$ into the equation to get $f(4) = 2*3 + 1 = 7$. Then, we can substitute $n = 4$ into the second condition to get $f(2*4) = 2*f(4) + 1$, which simplifies to $f(8) = 2*7 + 1 = 15$. We can continue this process to find $f(16) = 31$, $f(32) = 63$, and so on. We can observe that $f(2^n) = 2^n + 1$ for all positive integers $n$.

Now, let's try to find $f(100)$. We can write $100$ as $2^6 + 4$, so $f(100) = f(2^6 + 4) = 2^6 + 1 + f(4) = 64 + 1 + 7 = 72$.

So, the value of $f(100)$ is $72$. The answer is: $72$

 To solve this problem, we will first set $n = 1$ in the second equation to find $f(1)$. Then, we will use the value of $f(1)$ to find $f(100)$.

1. Set $n = 1$ in the second equation to get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.
2. Now we need to find the value of $f(2)$. From the first equation, we know that $f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = 1$.
3. Since $f(f(f(1))) = 1$, we have $f(2) = f(f(1))$.
4. Substituting the value of $f(2)$ from the second equation into the equation from step 3, we get $2f(1) + 1 = f(f(1))$.
5. Now we have a functional equation, but solving it directly might be difficult. Instead, we can try to guess a solution for $f(n)$ based on the given conditions.
6. We can try $f(n) = 2n - 1$ as a solution. Checking this solution, we find that $f(f(f(n))) = f(f(2n - 1)) = f(4n - 3) = 8n - 7$, which matches the first equation.
7. Also, $f(2n) = 2(2n - 1) + 1 = 4n - 1 = 2f(n) + 1$, which matches the second equation.
8. Therefore, we have found the function $f(n) = 2n - 1$ that satisfies both conditions.
9. Now we can calculate $f(100) = 2*100 - 1 = 199$.

So the value of $f(100)$ is $199$. The answer is: $199$
