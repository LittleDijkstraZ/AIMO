0_**Problem:** 

"Let $P_0(x) = x^3 + 313x^2 - 77x - 8\,$ .  For integers $n \ge 1\,$ , define $P_n(x) = P_{n - 1}(x - n)\,$ .  What is the coefficient of $x\,$ in $P_{20}(x)\,$"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:
Notice that \begin{align*}P_{20}(x) &= P_{19}(x - 20)\\ &= P_{18}((x - 20) - 19)\\ &= P_{17}(((x - 20) - 19) - 18)\\ &= \cdots\\ &= P_0(x - (20 + 19 + 18 + \ldots + 2 + 1)).\end{align*}
Using the formula for the sum of the first $n$ numbers, $1 + 2 + \cdots + 20 = \frac{20(20+1)}{2} = 210$ . Therefore, \[P_{20}(x) = P_0(x - 210).\]
Substituting $x - 210$ into the function definition, we get $P_0(x-210) = (x - 210)^3 + 313(x - 210)^2 - 77(x - 210) - 8$ . We only need the coefficients of the linear terms, which we can find by the binomial theorem
Adding up the coefficients, we get $630 \cdot 210 - 626 \cdot 210 - 77 = \boxed{763}$ The answer is $\boxed{763}$

**Problem:** 

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if and only if at least one of the following two conditions is satisfied:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$,
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first condition to be satisfied, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we find that the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the first condition are $(5, 5)$, $(5, -5)$, $(-5, 5)$, and $(-5, -5)$.

For the second condition to be satisfied, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations, we find that the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the second condition are $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

Therefore, the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the original equation are the points $(5, 5)$, $(5, -5)$, $(-5, 5)$, $(-5, -5)$, $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$. These points form a rectangle with side lengths $10$ and $16$, so its area is $10 \times 16 = 160$. The answer is $\boxed{160}$.

1_**Problem:** 

"Let $P_0(x) = x^3 + 313x^2 - 77x - 8\,$ .  For integers $n \ge 1\,$ , define $P_n(x) = P_{n - 1}(x - n)\,$ .  What is the coefficient of $x\,$ in $P_{20}(x)\,$"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:
Notice that \begin{align*}P_{20}(x) &= P_{19}(x - 20)\\ &= P_{18}((x - 20) - 19)\\ &= P_{17}(((x - 20) - 19) - 18)\\ &= \cdots\\ &= P_0(x - (20 + 19 + 18 + \ldots + 2 + 1)).\end{align*}
Using the formula for the sum of the first $n$ numbers, $1 + 2 + \cdots + 20 = \frac{20(20+1)}{2} = 210$ . Therefore, \[P_{20}(x) = P_0(x - 210).\]
Substituting $x - 210$ into the function definition, we get $P_0(x-210) = (x - 210)^3 + 313(x - 210)^2 - 77(x - 210) - 8$ . We only need the coefficients of the linear terms, which we can find by the binomial theorem
Adding up the coefficients, we get $630 \cdot 210 - 626 \cdot 210 - 77 = \boxed{763}$ The answer is $\boxed{763}$

**Problem:** 

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:



The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives $x = 0, y = \pm 10$ or $x = \pm 10, y = 0$. These four points form a square with side length 10, so its area is $10^2 = 100$.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. These four points form a square with side length 16, so its area is $16^2 = 256$.

The points that satisfy either condition form a square with side length 16 (since the side length of the square formed by the first condition is 10, which is contained within the square formed by the second condition). Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of this square, which is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

2_**Problem:** 

"Let $P_0(x) = x^3 + 313x^2 - 77x - 8\,$ .  For integers $n \ge 1\,$ , define $P_n(x) = P_{n - 1}(x - n)\,$ .  What is the coefficient of $x\,$ in $P_{20}(x)\,$"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:
Notice that \begin{align*}P_{20}(x) &= P_{19}(x - 20)\\ &= P_{18}((x - 20) - 19)\\ &= P_{17}(((x - 20) - 19) - 18)\\ &= \cdots\\ &= P_0(x - (20 + 19 + 18 + \ldots + 2 + 1)).\end{align*}
Using the formula for the sum of the first $n$ numbers, $1 + 2 + \cdots + 20 = \frac{20(20+1)}{2} = 210$ . Therefore, \[P_{20}(x) = P_0(x - 210).\]
Substituting $x - 210$ into the function definition, we get $P_0(x-210) = (x - 210)^3 + 313(x - 210)^2 - 77(x - 210) - 8$ . We only need the coefficients of the linear terms, which we can find by the binomial theorem
Adding up the coefficients, we get $630 \cdot 210 - 626 \cdot 210 - 77 = \boxed{763}$ The answer is $\boxed{763}$

**Problem:** 

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is equal to 0 if either of the two factors is equal to 0. 
This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The first equation is only possible if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
This gives us four equations: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.
The second equation is only possible if both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
This gives us four more equations: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.
Plotting these eight lines on a graph, we find that they enclose a square with side length 20.
The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$. The answer is $\boxed{400}$.
The answer is $\boxed{400}$.

3_**Problem:** 

"Let $P_0(x) = x^3 + 313x^2 - 77x - 8\,$ .  For integers $n \ge 1\,$ , define $P_n(x) = P_{n - 1}(x - n)\,$ .  What is the coefficient of $x\,$ in $P_{20}(x)\,$"

Notice that \begin{align*}P_{20}(x) &= P_{19}(x - 20)\\ &= P_{18}((x - 20) - 19)\\ &= P_{17}(((x - 20) - 19) - 18)\\ &= \cdots\\ &= P_0(x - (20 + 19 + 18 + \ldots + 2 + 1)).\end{align*}
Using the formula for the sum of the first $n$ numbers, $1 + 2 + \cdots + 20 = \frac{20(20+1)}{2} = 210$ . Therefore, \[P_{20}(x) = P_0(x - 210).\]

**Problem:** 

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:



Firstly, the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So, the equation

$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$

implies that either 

$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$$

or

$$((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$

For the first equation, 

$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0,$$

this implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle with side lengths $20$ and $10\sqrt{2}$, so the area of this rectangle is $20 \cdot 10\sqrt{2} = 200\sqrt{2}$.

For the second equation, 

$$((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0,$$

this implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length $16$, so the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

However, the points that satisfy both equations simultaneously are the vertices of the rectangle, which are also the vertices of the square. This means that the convex polygon formed by the points that satisfy at least one of the equations is the union of the rectangle and the square.

The area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the rectangle and the square, so it is $200\sqrt{2} + 256$.

So, the area of this convex polygon is $\boxed{200\sqrt{2} + 256}$.
The answer is $\boxed{200\sqrt{2}+256}$.

4_**Problem:** 

"Let $P_0(x) = x^3 + 313x^2 - 77x - 8\,$ .  For integers $n \ge 1\,$ , define $P_n(x) = P_{n - 1}(x - n)\,$ .  What is the coefficient of $x\,$ in $P_{20}(x)\,$"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:
Notice that \begin{align*}P_{20}(x) &= P_{19}(x - 20)\\ &= P_{18}((x - 20) - 19)\\ &= P_{17}(((x - 20) - 19) - 18)\\ &= \cdots\\ &= P_0(x - (20 + 19 + 18 + \ldots + 2 + 1)).\end{align*}
Using the formula for the sum of the first $n$ numbers, $1 + 2 + \cdots + 20 = \frac{20(20+1)}{2} = 210$ . Therefore, \[P_{20}(x) = P_0(x - 210).\]
Substituting $x - 210$ into the function definition, we get $P_0(x-210) = (x - 210)^3 + 313(x - 210)^2 - 77(x - 210) - 8$ . We only need the coefficients of the linear terms, which we can find by the binomial theorem

**Problem:** 

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:



The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Thus, the given equation is satisfied if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. 

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$. The equation $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = \pm 10$. The equations $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ imply $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. 

These equations represent lines in the coordinate plane. The lines $x + y = \pm 10$, $x - y = \pm 10$, $x = \pm 8$, and $y = \pm 8$ enclose a convex polygon. 

To find the area of this polygon, we can draw it on a coordinate plane and use the formula for the area of a polygon. The polygon is a square with side length 16 (the maximum value of $x$ or $y$ that satisfies the conditions). The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256.
The answer is: $256$

5_**Problem:** 

"Let $P_0(x) = x^3 + 313x^2 - 77x - 8\,$ .  For integers $n \ge 1\,$ , define $P_n(x) = P_{n - 1}(x - n)\,$ .  What is the coefficient of $x\,$ in $P_{20}(x)\,$"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:
Notice that \begin{align*}P_{20}(x) &= P_{19}(x - 20)\\ &= P_{18}((x - 20) - 19)\\ &= P_{17}(((x - 20) - 19) - 18)\\ &= \cdots\\ &= P_0(x - (20 + 19 + 18 + \ldots + 2 + 1)).\end{align*}

**Problem:** 

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


If a product is zero, then one of the factors must be zero. So we have two cases to consider:

1. $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$
2. $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$

From the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These equations represent a square with side length 10, centered at the origin.

From the second case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These equations represent a square with side length 16, centered at the origin.

The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for. It is a square with side length 10, since the side length of the square formed by $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ is 10.

The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. So the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{100}$. The answer is $\boxed{100}$.

Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the equation implies that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The first two equations imply that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
The last two equations imply that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The four lines defined by the above equations are:
1. $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.
2. $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.
3. $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.
4. $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

These lines form a square with side length 10. Therefore, the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is $\boxed{100}$.

The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, we have two cases:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
This is possible only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$ and area $200$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
This is possible only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length $16$ and area $256$.

The area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares, which is $200 + 256 = 456$. The answer is: $\boxed{456}$

8_**Problem:** 

"Let $P_0(x) = x^3 + 313x^2 - 77x - 8\,$ .  For integers $n \ge 1\,$ , define $P_n(x) = P_{n - 1}(x - n)\,$ .  What is the coefficient of $x\,$ in $P_{20}(x)\,$"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:
Notice that \begin{align*}P_{20}(x) &= P_{19}(x - 20)\\ &= P_{18}((x - 20) - 19)\\ &= P_{17}(((x - 20) - 19) - 18)\\ &= \cdots\\ &= P_0(x - (20 + 19 + 18 + \ldots + 2 + 1)).\end{align*}
Using the formula for the sum of the first $n$ numbers, $1 + 2 + \cdots + 20 = \frac{20(20+1)}{2} = 210$ . Therefore, \[P_{20}(x) = P_0(x - 210).\]
Substituting $x - 210$ into the function definition, we get $P_0(x-210) = (x - 210)^3 + 313(x - 210)^2 - 77(x - 210) - 8$ . We only need the coefficients of the linear terms, which we can find by the binomial theorem
Adding up the coefficients, we get $630 \cdot 210 - 626 \cdot 210 - 77 = \boxed{763}$ The answer is $\boxed{763}$

**Problem:** 

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


The expression is equal to zero if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The first two equations imply that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
The second pair of equations imply that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
These equations describe a square with side length 16 centered at the origin.
The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
So the area of the convex polygon is 256.
The answer is: $256$

Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:
Notice that \begin{align*}P_{20}(x) &= P_{19}(x - 20)\\ &= P_{18}((x - 20) - 19)\\ &= P_{17}(((x - 20) - 19) - 18)\\ &= \cdots\\ &= P_0(x - (20 + 19 + 18 + \ldots + 2 + 1)).\end{align*}
Using the formula for the sum of the first $n$ numbers, $1 + 2 + \cdots + 20 = \frac{20(20+1)}{2} = 210$ . Therefore, \[P_{20}(x) = P_0(x - 210).\]
Substituting $x - 210$ into the function definition, we get $P_0(x-210) = (x - 210)^3 + 313(x - 210)^2 - 77(x - 210) - 8$ . We only need the coefficients of the linear terms, which we can find by the binomial theorem

Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


If $ab=0$ then either $a=0$ or $b=0$. Thus the product in the problem is zero if and only if at least one of the following groups of absolute value expressions is equal to zero:
1) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$;
2) $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$;
3) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $x = 8$ or $x = -8$;
4) $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert y \vert = 8$, or $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

The first two equations give lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ on the plane and their reflections across the x and y axes. The last two equations give lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$ and their reflections across the y axis, and lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$ and their reflections across the x axis.

When we plot these lines, we see that the intersection points are:
A(8, 2), B(8, -2), C(-8, 2), D(-8, -2), E(2, 8), F(2, -8), G(-2, 8), H(-2, -8).

The area of the convex polygon is then a square with side length 8, so its area is $8 \times 8 = 64$.
The answer is: $64$.

Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:
Notice that \begin{align*}P_{20}(x) &= P_{19}(x - 20)\\ &= P_{18}((x - 20) - 19)\\ &= P_{17}(((x - 20) - 19) - 18)\\ &= \cdots\\ &= P_0(x - (20 + 19 + 18 + \ldots + 2 + 1)).\end{align*}
Using the formula for the sum of the first $n$ numbers, $1 + 2 + \cdots + 20 = \frac{20(20+1)}{2} = 210$ . Therefore, \[P_{20}(x) = P_0(x - 210).\]

Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For case 1, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $-8 \leq x,y \leq 8$. The points $(x,y)$ satisfying $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ form a rhombus with vertices at $(8,2)$, $(-8,-2)$, $(-8,2)$, and $(8,-2)$. 

For case 2, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $-8 \leq x,y \leq 8$. The points $(x,y)$ satisfying $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ form a rhombus with vertices at $(8,-2)$, $(-8,2)$, $(-8,-2)$, and $(8,2)$. 

The union of the two rhombuses is a square with side length 16, so the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is $\boxed{256}$.

**Problem:** 

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is equal to zero if either of the two factors is equal to zero. 
The first factor is equal to zero if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two lines in the plane, so they form a square with side length 20. 
The second factor is equal to zero if $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$, which are the equations of two lines parallel to the x-axis and two lines parallel to the y-axis, respectively, forming a square with side length 16.
The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon that satisfies the given equation. 
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of the smaller square, which is $(20/2)^2 = 100$. The answer is $\boxed{100}$ square units.

Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This only happens when $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$. So, these four lines are the sides of the square.
Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This only happens when $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So, these four lines are the sides of the square.
The intersection of these two squares forms a smaller square with side length 6 (the difference between the lengths of the sides of the larger and smaller squares). The area of this square is $6^2 = 36$. The answer is: $36$

Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving this system of equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 2), (8, -2), (-8, -2), (-8, 2)$.

Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So we have another square with vertices at $(8, 8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8), (8, -8)$.

The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for. It's a square with side length 8. The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$.
The answer is $\boxed{64}$.

Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


For the product of two factors to be zero, either one of the factors must be zero. Therefore, we can set each factor equal to zero separately:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \implies \vert x + y \vert = 10$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \implies \vert x - y \vert = 10$
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \implies \vert x \vert = 8$
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \implies \vert y \vert = 8$
From these equations, we can see that the points satisfying these conditions are the vertices of a square with side length 20. Therefore, the area of the square is $20^2 = 400$. So the area of the convex polygon is 400. The answer is: $400$

The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So the equation is satisfied if and only if either $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$ or $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
The first equation is satisfied if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.
The second equation is satisfied if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.
The lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$ intersect the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$ to form a square with side length $20$. Therefore, the area of the square is $20^2 = 400$.
The answer is $\boxed{400}$.

## QUESTION 3 - 21 
- TIME_SPENT : 732 secs

21_**Problem:** 

"Let $P_0(x) = x^3 + 313x^2 - 77x - 8\,$ .  For integers $n \ge 1\,$ , define $P_n(x) = P_{n - 1}(x - n)\,$ .  What is the coefficient of $x\,$ in $P_{20}(x)\,$"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:
Notice that \begin{align*}P_{20}(x) &= P_{19}(x - 20)\\ &= P_{18}((x - 20) - 19)\\ &= P_{17}(((x - 20) - 19) - 18)\\ &= \cdots\\ &= P_0(x - (20 + 19 + 18 + \ldots + 2 + 1)).\end{align*}
Using the formula for the sum of the first $n$ numbers, $1 + 2 + \cdots + 20 = \frac{20(20+1)}{2} = 210$ . Therefore, \[P_{20}(x) = P_0(x - 210).\]
Substituting $x - 210$ into the function definition, we get $P_0(x-210) = (x - 210)^3 + 313(x - 210)^2 - 77(x - 210) - 8$ . We only need the coefficients of the linear terms, which we can find by the binomial theorem
Adding up the coefficients, we get $630 \cdot 210 - 626 \cdot 210 - 77 = \boxed{763}$ The answer is $\boxed{763}$

**Problem:** 

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
If $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
If $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

The points satisfying these conditions are the vertices of a square with side length 16. To find the area of this square, we simply square the length of its side, so the area is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: 256
