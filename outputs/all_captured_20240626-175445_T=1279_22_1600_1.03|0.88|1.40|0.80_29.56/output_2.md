0_**Problem:** 

"Consider systems of three linear equations with unknowns $x$ $y$ , and $z$ \begin{align*} a_1 x + b_1 y + c_1 z & = 0 \\ a_2 x + b_2 y + c_2 z & = 0 \\ a_3 x + b_3 y + c_3 z & = 0 \end{align*} where each of the coefficients is either $0$ or $1$ and the system has a solution other than $x=y=z=0$ .
For example, one such system is \[\{ 1x + 1y + 0z = 0, 0x + 1y + 1z = 0, 0x + 0y + 0z = 0 \}\] with a nonzero solution of $\{x,y,z\} = \{1, -1, 1\}$ . How many such systems of equations are there?
(The equations in a system need not be distinct, and two systems containing the same equations in a
different order are considered different.)"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:
Denote vector $\overrightarrow{i} = \left( i_1, i_2, i_3 \right)^T$ for $i \in \left\{ a, b, c \right\}$ .
Thus, we need to count how many vector tuples $\left( \overrightarrow{a} , \overrightarrow{b} , \overrightarrow{c} \right)$ are linearly dependent.
We do complementary counting.
First, the total number of vector tuples $\left( \overrightarrow{a} , \overrightarrow{b} , \overrightarrow{c} \right)$ is $\left( 2^3 \right)^3 = 512$
Second, we count how many many vector tuples $\left( \overrightarrow{a} , \overrightarrow{b} , \overrightarrow{c} \right)$ are linearly independent.
To meet this condition, no vector can be a zero vector $\overrightarrow{0} = \left( 0, 0, 0 \right)^T$
Next, we do the casework analysis.
Case $1^c$ : Three vectors are all on axes.
In this case, the number of $\left( \overrightarrow{a} , \overrightarrow{b} , \overrightarrow{c} \right)$ is $3!$
Case $2^c$ : Two vectors are on axes and the third vector is not.
We construct such an instance in the following steps.
Step 1: We determine which two vectors lie on axes.
The number of ways is $3$
Step 2: For two vectors selected in Step 1, we determine which two axes they lie on.
The number of ways is $3 \cdot 2$
Step 3: For the third unselected vector, we determine its value.
To make three vectors linear independent, the third vector cannot be on the plane formed by the first two vectors.
So the number of ways is $3$
Following from the rule of product, the number of $\left( \overrightarrow{a} , \overrightarrow{b} , \overrightarrow{c} \right)$ in this case is $3 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 3$
Case $3^c$ : One vector is on an axis and the other two are not.
We construct such an instance in the following steps.
Step 1: We determine which vector lies on an axis.
The number of ways is $3$
Step 2: For the selected vector, we determine which axis it lies on.
The number of ways is $3$
Step 3: We determine the values of the two unselected vectors.
First, to be linearly independent, these two vectors are distinct.
Second, to be linearly independent, we cannot have one vector $(1,1,1)$ and another one that is a diagonal vector on the plane that is perpendicular to the first selected vector.
Thus, the number or ways in this step is $4 \cdot 3-2 = 10$
Following from the rule of product, the number of $\left( \overrightarrow{a} , \overrightarrow{b} , \overrightarrow{c} \right)$ in this case is $3 \cdot 3 \cdot 10$
Case $(4.4)^c$ : No vector is on any axis.
In this case, any three distinct vectors are linearly independent.
So the number of $\left( \overrightarrow{a} , \overrightarrow{b} , \overrightarrow{c} \right)$ in this case is $4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2$
Putting all cases together, the number of vector tuples $\left( \overrightarrow{a} , \overrightarrow{b} , \overrightarrow{c} \right)$ that are linearly independent is \[ 8^3 - 3!  - 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 - 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 10 - 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 = \boxed{338}. \] ~Steven Chen (Professor Chen Education Palace, www.professorchenedu.com) The answer is $\boxed{338}$

**Problem:** 

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


The equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $0$ and $2$. This is because the function $| |x - 1| - 2 |$ is a "V" shape with maximum value of $2$ and minimum value of $0$. So, the equation has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $0$ and $2$.

If $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $0$ and $2$, then $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$.

Multiplying all sides of the inequalities by $100$ gives $0 < m < 200$.

The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from $1$ to $199$.

Therefore, there are $199$ positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions. The answer is: $\boxed{199}$

1_**Problem:** 

"Consider systems of three linear equations with unknowns $x$ $y$ , and $z$ \begin{align*} a_1 x + b_1 y + c_1 z & = 0 \\ a_2 x + b_2 y + c_2 z & = 0 \\ a_3 x + b_3 y + c_3 z & = 0 \end{align*} where each of the coefficients is either $0$ or $1$ and the system has a solution other than $x=y=z=0$ .

**Problem:** 

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if the number $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $2$. This is because the expression inside the absolute value on the left-hand side, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, can be thought of as a "piecewise-linear" function that changes its slope at $x=1$. Specifically, it slopes downwards for $x<1$ and upwards for $x>1$. The equation has four distinct solutions if and only if the value $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between the two $y$-intercepts of this function, which are $-1$ and $1$. So we have $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which gives $100 < m < 200$. Since $m$ must be a positive integer, the positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are $101, 102, \ldots, 199$. To count the number of these integers, we subtract the smallest from the largest and add $1$, so the number of such positive integers $m$ is $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions is 99. The answer is $\boxed{99}$.

"Consider systems of three linear equations with unknowns $x$ $y$ , and $z$ \begin{align*} a_1 x + b_1 y + c_1 z & = 0 \\ a_2 x + b_2 y + c_2 z & = 0 \\ a_3 x + b_3 y + c_3 z & = 0 \end{align*} where each of the coefficients is either $0$ or $1$ and the system has a solution other than $x=y=z=0$ .

**Problem:** 

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:



First, let's solve the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}.\]

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. This is because the function $| |x-1|-2|$ has a graph that is a $V$ shape, with the minimum value of $0$ at $x=1$, and the distance between the two branches of the $V$ is $4$. 

So we have $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, which implies $m = 200$.

Therefore, the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $m = 200$. So the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition is $1$. The answer is: $1$.

**Problem:** 

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

First, let's consider the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=k$, where $k$ is a positive number.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=k$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $0<k\le1$.

So in our case, $\frac{m}{100}$ should be a number between $0$ and $1$, which means $0<\frac{m}{100}\le1$.

This inequality can be rewritten as $0<m\le100$.

But $m$ is a positive integer, so the possible values of $m$ are the integers from $1$ to $100$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $100$.
The answer is: $100$

**Problem:** 

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


First, we note that the equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}=2$.
This is because the function $| |x-1|-2|$ is a "W" shaped graph, and it has 4 distinct solutions exactly when the right side of the equation is 2.

So, we set $\frac{m}{100}=2$, and we get $m=200$.

Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$, namely 200, for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions.
The answer is $\boxed{1}$.

"Consider systems of three linear equations with unknowns $x$ $y$ , and $z$ \begin{align*} a_1 x + b_1 y + c_1 z & = 0 \\ a_2 x + b_2 y + c_2 z & = 0 \\ a_3 x + b_3 y + c_3 z & = 0 \end{align*} where each of the coefficients is either $0$ or $1$ and the system has a solution other than $x=y=z=0$ .
For example, one such system is \[\{ 1x + 1y + 0z = 0, 0x + 1y + 1z = 0, 0x + 0y + 0z = 0 \}\] with a nonzero solution of $\{x,y,z\} = \{1, -1, 1\}$ . How many such systems of equations are there?
(The equations in a system need not be distinct, and two systems containing the same equations in a
different order are considered different.)"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:
Denote vector $\overrightarrow{i} = \left( i_1, i_2, i_3 \right)^T$ for $i \in \left\{ a, b, c \right\}$ .
Thus, we need to count how many vector tuples $\left( \overrightarrow{a} , \overrightarrow{b} , \overrightarrow{c} \right)$ are linearly dependent.
We do complementary counting.
First, the total number of vector tuples $\left( \overrightarrow{a} , \overrightarrow{b} , \overrightarrow{c} \right)$ is $\left( 2^3 \right)^3 = 512$
Second, we count how many many vector tuples $\left( \overrightarrow{a} , \overrightarrow{b} , \overrightarrow{c} \right)$ are linearly independent.
To meet this condition, no vector can be a zero vector $\overrightarrow{0} = \left( 0, 0, 0 \right)^T$
Next, we do the casework analysis.
Case $1^c$ : Three vectors are all on axes.
In this case, the number of $\left( \overrightarrow{a} , \overrightarrow{b} , \overrightarrow{c} \right)$ is $3!$
Case $2^c$ : Two vectors are on axes and the third vector is not.
We construct such an instance in the following steps.
Step 1: We determine which two vectors lie on axes.
The number of ways is $3$
Step 2: For two vectors selected in Step 1, we determine which two axes they lie on.
The number of ways is $3 \cdot 2$
Step 3: For the third unselected vector, we determine its value.
To make three vectors linear independent, the third vector cannot be on the plane formed by the first two vectors.
So the number of ways is $3$
Following from the rule of product, the number of $\left( \overrightarrow{a} , \overrightarrow{b} , \overrightarrow{c} \right)$ in this case is $3 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 3$
Case $3^c$ : One vector is on an axis and the other two are not.
We construct such an instance in the following steps.
Step 1: We determine which vector lies on an axis.
The number of ways is $3$
Step 2: For the selected vector, we determine which axis it lies on.
The number of ways is $3$
Step 3: We determine the values of the two unselected vectors.
First, to be linearly independent, these two vectors are distinct.
Second, to be linearly independent, we cannot have one vector $(1,1,1)$ and another one that is a diagonal vector on the plane that is perpendicular to the first selected vector.
Thus, the number or ways in this step is $4 \cdot 3-2 = 10$
Following from the rule of product, the number of $\left( \overrightarrow{a} , \overrightarrow{b} , \overrightarrow{c} \right)$ in this case is $3 \cdot 3 \cdot 10$
Case $(4.4)^c$ : No vector is on any axis.
In this case, any three distinct vectors are linearly independent.
So the number of $\left( \overrightarrow{a} , \overrightarrow{b} , \overrightarrow{c} \right)$ in this case is $4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2$
Putting all cases together, the number of vector tuples $\left( \overrightarrow{a} , \overrightarrow{b} , \overrightarrow{c} \right)$ that are linearly independent is \[ 8^3 - 3!  - 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 - 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 10 - 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 = \boxed{338}. \] ~Steven Chen (Professor Chen Education Palace, www.professorchenedu.com) The answer is $\boxed{338}$

**Problem:** 

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions, which means the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, takes on the values $\frac{m}{100}$, $0$, $-\frac{m}{100}$ twice each.

This implies that the equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \pm \frac{m}{100}$ has two distinct solutions.

First, consider the equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$.

If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, then $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. This equation has two solutions if $2 + \frac{m}{100} > 0$, which gives $m > -200$.

If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$, then $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. This equation has two solutions if $2 - \frac{m}{100} > 0$, which gives $m < 200$.

Therefore, the positive integer $m$ must satisfy $-200 < m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from $1$ to $199$. 

So there are $199$ positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. The answer is: $\boxed{199}$.

**Problem:** 

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 1 and 2. This is because the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a graph that is a series of V-shapes, with each "V" having a width of 1. So, for $f(x)$ to have 4 distinct solutions, the right hand side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be strictly between 1 and 2.
This means that $\frac{m}{100} > 1$ and $\frac{m}{100} < 2$. The first inequality gives $m > 100$, and the second inequality gives $m < 200$. Combining these inequalities, we find that $100 < m < 200$.
The number of positive integers $m$ in this range is $200 - 100 - 1 = 99$. Therefore, there are 99 positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions. The answer is $\boxed{99}$

**Problem:** 

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 0 and 2, because the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a graph that resembles a "V" shape with its minimum value at $x=1$, and its maximum value is 2. So the equation has 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 0 and 2, which gives us $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Multiplying all sides of the inequalities by 100, we get $0 < m < 200$.

Now we want to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $0 < m < 200$. This is simply the number of positive integers from 1 to 199, inclusive. To find this, we simply subtract the smallest integer from the largest integer and then add 1. So the number of positive integers from 1 to 199 is $199 - 1 + 1 = 199$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 199. The answer is: 199

**Problem:** 

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:



The equation $| |x-1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions.

First, consider the absolute value equation $| |x-1| - 2| = k$. The graph of $y = ||x-1| - 2|$ is a two-peaked V-shape with the peaks at $y = 1$ and $y = 3$. So, for the equation to have four distinct solutions, $k = \frac{m}{100}$ must be between $1$ and $3$, i.e., $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 3$ or $100 < m < 300$.

However, $m$ must be a positive integer, so the possible values of $m$ are $101, 102, \dots, 299$, which gives us $199$ possible values of $m$.
The answer is: $199$.

First, to be linearly independent, these two vectors are distinct.
Second, to be linearly independent, we cannot have one vector $(1,1,1)$ and another one that is a diagonal vector on the plane that is perpendicular to the first selected vector.

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


We first note that the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be nonnegative.
This implies that $m$ must be a nonnegative integer.
The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions
if and only if the equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2=\pm \frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.
We can solve the equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2=\frac{m}{100}$ by considering two cases.
Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2=\frac{m}{100}$.
This equation is equivalent to $\vert x-1 \vert =2+\frac{m}{100}$.
So we have $x-1=2+\frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1=-2-\frac{m}{100}$.
The first equation gives $x=3+\frac{m}{100}$ and the second equation gives $x=-1-\frac{m}{100}$.
Case 2: $\vert x-1 \vert -2=-\frac{m}{100}$.
This equation is equivalent to $\vert x-1 \vert =2-\frac{m}{100}$.
So we have $x-1=2-\frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1=-2+\frac{m}{100}$.
The first equation gives $x=3-\frac{m}{100}$ and the second equation gives $x=-1+\frac{m}{100}$.
In order for the four solutions to be distinct, we need the four values of $x$ to be different.
For Case 1, the four solutions are $3+\frac{m}{100}$, $-1-\frac{m}{100}$, $3-\frac{m}{100}$, and $-1+\frac{m}{100}$.
For Case 2, the four solutions are $3-\frac{m}{100}$, $-1+\frac{m}{100}$, $3+\frac{m}{100}$, and $-1-\frac{m}{100}$.
The only way for these four solutions to be distinct is if $\frac{m}{100}$ is less than $2$.
This is because otherwise, two of the solutions in each case will coincide.
So we have $\frac{m}{100}<2$ which implies $m<200$.
Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is the number of positive integers less than $200$.
This is equal to $199$. The answer is $\boxed{199}$
