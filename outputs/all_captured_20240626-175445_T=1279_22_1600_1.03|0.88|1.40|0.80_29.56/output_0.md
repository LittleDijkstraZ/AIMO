"Let $w_1, w_2, \dots, w_n$ be complex numbers .  A line $L$ in the complex plane is called a mean line for the points $w_1, w_2, \dots, w_n$ if $L$ contains points (complex numbers) $z_1, z_2, \dots, z_n$ such that \[\sum_{k = 1}^n (z_k - w_k) = 0.\] For the numbers $w_1 = 32 + 170i$ $w_2 = - 7 + 64i$ $w_3 = - 9 + 200i$ $w_4 = 1 + 27i$ , and $w_5 = - 14 + 43i$ , there is a unique mean line with $y$ -intercept 3.

Let's think step by step:
The mean line for $w_1, . . ., w_5$ must pass through the mean (the center of mass) of these points, which, if we graph them on the complex plane, is $(\frac{3}{5}, \frac{504i}{5})$ . Since we now have two points, namely that one and $(0, 3i)$ , we can simply find the slope between them, which is $\boxed{163}$ by the good ol' slope formula. The answer is $\boxed{163}$

**Problem:** 

"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


First, let's find the $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$.
Setting $y = 4$ in the equation of the parabola, we have $4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l$.
Rearranging, we get $kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0$.
Since $A$ and $B$ are the solutions to this equation, we know that the distance between them is $6$.
By the quadratic formula, the solutions to $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ are given by $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$.
The distance between the solutions is $\frac{\sqrt{(2k)^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{k} = \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{k} = \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}}{k} = \frac{\sqrt{4k(k - l + 4)}}{k}$.
We are given that this distance is $6$, so we have $\frac{\sqrt{4k(k - l + 4)}}{k} = 6$.
Squaring both sides, we get $\frac{4k(k - l + 4)}{k^2} = 36$.
Simplifying, we have $4(k - l + 4) = 36k$.
Expanding, we get $4k - 4l + 16 = 36k$.
Rearranging, we have $32k = 4l - 16$.
Dividing by $4$, we get $8k = l - 4$.
Now, we want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin.
The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$.
For point $A$, the distance to the origin is $\sqrt{(x_1)^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2} = \sqrt{x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2}$.
For point $B$, the distance to the origin is $\sqrt{(x_2)^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2} = \sqrt{x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2}$.
The sum of the squares of the distances is then $\sqrt{x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2} + \sqrt{x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2}$.
To find this sum, we can substitute the expressions for $l$ and $k$ from our earlier work.
From $8k = l - 4$, we have $l = 8k + 4$.
Substituting into $4k(k - l + 4) = 36k$, we get $4k(k - (8k + 4) + 4) = 36k$.
Simplifying, we have $4k(k - 8k - 4 + 4) = 36k$, which becomes $4k(k - 8k) = 36k$.
Expanding, we have $4k(-7k) = 36k$.
Simplifying, we have $-28k^2 = 36k$.
Dividing by $4k$, we have $-7k = 9$.
Thus, $k = -\frac{9}{7}$.
Substituting into $l = 8k + 4$, we have $l = 8(-\frac{9}{7}) + 4 = -\frac{72}{7} + \frac{28}{7} = -\frac{44}{7}$.
Now, we can substitute these values into the sum of the squares of the distances.
For point $A$, the distance to the origin is $\sqrt{x_1^2 + (k(x_1)^2 - 2k(x_1) + l)^2} = \sqrt{x_1^2 + (-\frac{9}{7}x_1^2 + \frac{18}{7}x_1 - \frac{44}{7})^2}$.
For point $B$, the distance to the origin is $\sqrt{x_2^2 + (k(x_2)^2 - 2k(x_2) + l)^2} = \sqrt{x_2^2 + (-\frac{9}{7}x_2^2 + \frac{18}{7}x_2 - \frac{44}{7})^2}$.
We can simplify these expressions by finding the value of $x_1$ and $x_2$.
From the quadratic formula, we know that $x_1$ and $x_2$ are given by $\frac{-(-2k) \pm \sqrt{(-2k)^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k} = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k} = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}}{2k}$.
Substituting the values of $k$ and $l$, we have $x_1 = \frac{2(-\frac{9}{7}) \pm \sqrt{4(-\frac{9}{7})^2 - 4(-\frac{9}{7})(-\frac{44}{7} + 4)}}{2(-\frac{9}{7})} = \frac{-\frac{18}{7} \pm \sqrt{-\frac{324}{49} + \frac{324}{49}}}{-\frac{18}{7}} = \frac{-\frac{18}{7} \pm 0}{-\frac{18}{7}} = 1$.
Similarly, $x_2 = -\frac{18}{7} + \frac{18}{7} = 0$.
Thus, the sum of the squares of the distances is $\sqrt{1^2 + (-\frac{9}{7} + \frac{18}{7} - \frac{44}{7})^2} + \sqrt{0^2 + (-\frac{9}{7}(0)^2 + \frac{18}{7}(0) - \frac{44}{7})^2} = \sqrt{1 + (-\frac{44}{7})^2} + \sqrt{0 + (-\frac{44}{7})^2} = \sqrt{1 + \frac{1936}{49}} + \sqrt{\frac{1936}{49}} = \sqrt{\frac{1937}{49}} + \frac{44}{7}$.
Finally, we simplify the expression.
Since $\sqrt{\frac{1937}{49}} = \frac{\sqrt{

**Problem:** 

"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:



The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$, so we can set $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$. This simplifies to $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$. Let's call the roots of this equation $x_1$ and $x_2$, which represent the x-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$. Given that $A$ and $B$ are 6 units apart, we know that $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 36$, or $(x_2 - x_1) = 6$. From the quadratic formula, we know that $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$. We can then use the difference of squares identity $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = (x_2 + x_1)^2 - 4x_1x_2$ to get $36 = 4 - 4\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right)$, which simplifies to $\frac{l - 4}{k} = - 7$. Solving for $l$, we find that $l = k(4 - 7k)$.

The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is given by $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. We want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The coordinates of $A$ and $B$ are $(x_1, kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)$ and $(x_2, kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)$ respectively. So the sum of the squares of the distances is:

\begin{align*}
& (x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2) + (x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2) \\
&= x_1^2 + k^2x_1^4 - 4k^2x_1^3 + 4k^2x_1^2 - 2klx_1 + l^2 + x_2^2 + k^2x_2^4 - 4k^2x_2^3 + 4k^2x_2^2 - 2klx_2 + l^2 \\
&= (x_1^2 + x_2^2) + k^2(x_1^4 + x_2^4) - 4k^2(x_1^3 + x_2^3) + 4k^2(x_1^2 + x_2^2) - 2kl(x_1 + x_2) + 2l^2 \\
&= (x_1^2 + x_2^2) + k^2(x_1^2 + x_2^2)^2 - 4k^2(x_1 + x_2)(x_1^2 + x_1x_2 + x_2^2) + 4k^2(x_1^2 + x_2^2) - 2kl(x_1 + x_2) + 2l^2 \\
&= (x_1^2 + x_2^2) + k^2(x_1^2 + x_2^2)^2 - 4k^2(x_1 + x_2)(x_1^2 + \frac{l - 4}{k}) + 4k^2(x_1^2 + x_2^2) - 2kl(x_1 + x_2) + 2l^2 \\
&= (x_1^2 + x_2^2) + k^2(x_1^2 + x_2^2)^2 - 4k^2(2)(x_1^2 + \frac{l - 4}{k}) + 4k^2(x_1^2 + x_2^2) - 2kl(2) + 2l^2 \\
&= (x_1^2 + x_2^2) + k^2(x_1^2 + x_2^2)^2 - 8k^2(x_1^2 + \frac{l - 4}{k}) + 4k^2(x_1^2 + x_2^2) - 4kl + 2l^2.
\end{align*}

We know that $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 2^2 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = 4 - 2(-7) = 18$ and $l = k(4 - 7k)$, so we can substitute these into the expression to get:

\begin{align*}
& 18 + k^2(18)^2 - 8k^2(18 + \frac{k(4 - 7k) - 4}{k}) + 4k^2(18) - 4k(4 - 7k) + 2(k(4 - 7k))^2 \\
&= 18 + k^2(324) - 8k^2(18 + 4 - 7k - 4) + 72k^2 - 16k + 28k^2(4 - 7k)^2 \\
&= 18 + 324k^2 - 8k^2(18) + 72k^2 - 16k + 28k^2(16 - 56k + 49k^2) \\
&= 18 + 324k^2 - 144k^2 + 72k^2 - 16k + 28k^2(16 - 56k + 49k^2) \\
&= 18 + 180k^2 - 16k + 28k^2(16 - 56k + 49k^2).
\end{align*}

Now we can simplify the last term:

\begin{align*}
28k^2(16 - 56k + 49k^2) &= 28k^2 \cdot 16 - 28k^2 \cdot 56k + 28k^2 \cdot 49k^2 \\
&= 448k^2 - 1568k^3 + 1372k^4.
\end{align*}

So the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and

**Problem:** 

"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


The points of intersection of the parabola and the line $y = 4$ are the solutions of the equation $4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l$. This equation can be rewritten as $kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0$. By the quadratic formula, the solutions for $x$ are given by
\[x = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k} = 1 \pm \sqrt{1 - (l - 4)}.\]
Since the points of intersection are distance 6 apart, we have
\[\sqrt{1 - (l - 4)} = 3.\]
Squaring both sides gives $1 - (l - 4) = 9$, so $l - 4 = -8$, and $l = -4$.
The points of intersection are then given by $x = 1 \pm \sqrt{1 - (-4)} = 1 \pm \sqrt{5}$.
Let $A = (1 + \sqrt{5}, 4)$ and $B = (1 - \sqrt{5}, 4)$.
The distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin are $\sqrt{(1 + \sqrt{5})^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{6 + 2\sqrt{5}}$ and $\sqrt{(1 - \sqrt{5})^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{6 - 2\sqrt{5}}$, respectively.
The sum of the squares of these distances is
\[\left(\sqrt{6 + 2\sqrt{5}}\right)^2 + \left(\sqrt{6 - 2\sqrt{5}}\right)^2 = 6 + 2\sqrt{5} + 6 - 2\sqrt{5} = 12.\]
So the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is 12. The answer is $\boxed{12}$.

**Problem:** 

"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:



The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at points $A$ and $B$. This means that for the x-coordinates of $A$ and $B$, we have $4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l$. Rearranging terms gives us $kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0$.

The distance between $A$ and $B$ is given to be 6. By the quadratic formula, the x-coordinates of $A$ and $B$ are given by $x = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{(-2k)^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k} = 1 \pm \frac{3}{k}$.

Now, let's find the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. Using the distance formula, the distance of a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. For point $A$, which has x-coordinate $1 - \frac{3}{k}$ and y-coordinate 4, the distance is $\sqrt{(1 - \frac{3}{k})^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{6}{k} + \frac{9}{k^2} + 16} = \sqrt{\frac{17k^2 - 6k + 9}{k^2}}$. Similarly, for point $B$, which has x-coordinate $1 + \frac{3}{k}$ and y-coordinate 4, the distance is $\sqrt{(1 + \frac{3}{k})^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{\frac{17k^2 + 6k + 9}{k^2}}$.

We are asked to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. This is equal to $\left(\sqrt{\frac{17k^2 - 6k + 9}{k^2}}\right)^2 + \left(\sqrt{\frac{17k^2 + 6k + 9}{k^2}}\right)^2 = \frac{17k^2 - 6k + 9}{k^2} + \frac{17k^2 + 6k + 9}{k^2} = \frac{34k^2 + 18}{k^2}$.

Now, let's use the given condition that the points $A$ and $B$ are distance 6 apart. This gives us $\sqrt{\left(1 - \frac{3}{k} - \left(1 + \frac{3}{k}\right)\right)^2 + 0} = 6$, or $\sqrt{\frac{-12}{k}^2} = 6$. Squaring both sides gives us $\frac{144}{k^2} = 36$, or $k^2 = 4$. Thus, $k = 2$.

Substituting $k = 2$ into our expression for the sum of the squares of the distances, we get $\frac{34(2)^2 + 18}{(2)^2} = \frac{34 \cdot 4 + 18}{4} = \frac{146}{4} = 36.5$.

However, we must have made a mistake somewhere, because the sum of the squares of two distances should be a nonnegative number. Let's retrace our steps.

The equation $kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0$ is a parabola that opens upwards. If $A$ and $B$ are distance 6 apart, then the distance between the roots of this equation should be 6. But this means that the discriminant of the quadratic, $(-2k)^2 - 4k(l - 4) = 4k^2 - 4k(l - 4)$, should be equal to $6^2 = 36$. Simplifying this gives $4k^2 - 4k(l - 4) = 36$, or $k^2 - (l - 4) = 9$. But we know that $k^2 = 4$, so substituting this in gives $4 - (l - 4) = 9$, or $8 - l = 9$, which gives us $l = -1$.

Substituting $k = 2$ and $l = -1$ into the equation $4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l$, we get $4 = 2x^2 - 4x - 1$, or $2x^2 - 4x - 5 = 0$. By the quadratic formula, the roots of this equation are $x = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{4^2 - 4 \cdot 2 \cdot (-5)}}{2 \cdot 2} = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{76}}{4} = \frac{4 \pm 2\sqrt{19}}{4} = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{19}}{2}$. So the x-coordinates of $A$ and $B$ are $1 - \frac{3}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{2} - 3}{\sqrt{2}}$ and $1 + \frac{3}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{2} + 3}{\sqrt{2}}$.

Now, let's find the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. For point $A$, the distance is $\sqrt{\left(\frac{\sqrt{2} - 3}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}/2 + 9/2 + 16} = \sqrt{\frac{26 - 3\sqrt{2}}{2}}$. Similarly, for point $B$, the distance is $\sqrt{\left(\frac{\sqrt{2} + 3}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} + 3\sqrt{2}/2 + 9/2 + 16} = \sqrt{\frac{26 + 3\sqrt{2}}{2}}$.

We are asked to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. This is equal to $\left(\sqrt{\frac{26 - 3\sqrt{2}}{2}}\right)^2 + \left(\sqrt{\frac{26 + 3\sqrt{2}}{2}}\right)^2 = \frac{26 - 3\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{26 + 3\sqrt{2}}{2} = 26$.

Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is 26. The mistake we made earlier was that we incorrectly assumed that the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin should be equal to $\frac{146}{4}$, which is not a nonnegative number.

The distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, so the difference of the roots of the equation is 6, which means the absolute value of the coefficient of $x$ in the quadratic is $\sqrt{6^2k^2 - 4(-1)(l-4)} = \sqrt{36k^2 + 4l - 16}$. By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the squares of the roots is $(\sqrt{36k^2 + 4l - 16})^2 = 36k^2 + 4l - 16$. The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is the sum of the squares of the roots of the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l$, which is $(\sqrt{4k^2 - 4(-1)(l)})^2 = 4k^2 + 4l$. Adding these two quantities, we have \[36k^2 + 4l - 16 + 4k^2 + 4l = 40k^2 + 8l - 16.\]By Vieta's formulas, $k^2 = \frac{4}{2} = 2$ and $l = \frac{4 + 16}{4} = 5$, so our desired sum is \[40(2) + 8(5) - 16 = 80 + 40 - 16 = 104.\]Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is 104. The answer is $\boxed{104}$.

**Problem:** 

"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. So we can set $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$, which simplifies to $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$. Let $x_1$ and $x_2$ be the x-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$ respectively. By the distance formula, the distance between $A$ and $B$ is $|x_2 - x_1| = \frac{6}{1}$, which is the absolute value of the difference of the roots of the quadratic equation. By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots is $\frac{2k}{k} = 2$, and the product of the roots is $\frac{l - 4}{k}$. We are given that $|x_2 - x_1| = 6$, so from the formula for the difference of roots $\sqrt{(\text{sum of roots}^2 - 4 \cdot \text{product of roots})} = 6$. Substituting the values we have:
$$\sqrt{(2^2 - 4 \cdot \frac{l - 4}{k})} = 6.$$
Simplifying, we get:
$$\sqrt{(4 - \frac{4l - 16}{k})} = 6.$$
Squaring both sides, we have:
$$4 - \frac{4l - 16}{k} = 36.$$
Multiplying through by $k$, we have:
$$4k - 4l + 16 = 36k.$$
Rearranging, we have:
$$36k - 4k = 4l - 16,$$
$$32k = 4l - 16.$$
Dividing through by $4$, we have:
$$8k = l - 4.$$
Now we can use the distance formula to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The coordinates of $A$ and $B$ are $(x_1, 4)$ and $(x_2, 4)$ respectively. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. So the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is:
$$(x_1^2 + 4^2) + (x_2^2 + 4^2) = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32.$$
Using the identity $(x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = (x_1^2 + x_2^2)$, we know that $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (2)^2 - 2\frac{l - 4}{k} = 4 - 2\frac{l - 4}{k}$. Substituting this into the previous equation, we have:
$$4 - 2\frac{l - 4}{k} + 32.$$
Using the equation $8k = l - 4$, we can solve for $l$:
$$l = 8k + 4.$$
Substituting this into the previous equation, we have:
$$4 - 2\frac{8k + 4 - 4}{k} + 32 = 4 - \frac{16k}{k} + 32 = 4 - 16 + 32 = 20.$$
So the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is 20. The answer is $\boxed{20}$.

**Problem:** 

"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


The points of intersection of the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ and the line $y = 4$ are the solutions of the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$.
Let $x_1$ and $x_2$ be the roots of this equation. By the distance formula, the distance between the points of intersection is $\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2 + (4-4)^2} = |x_2 - x_1|$. We are given that this distance is 6, so $|x_2 - x_1| = 6$. By Vieta's formulas, $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$. We can then write $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = (x_2 + x_1)^2 - 4x_1x_2 = 4 - 4\left(\frac{l-4}{k}\right) = 4 - \frac{4l-16}{k} = \frac{16 - 4l}{k}$. Since $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 36$, we have $\frac{16 - 4l}{k} = 36$, or $16 - 4l = 36k$.

Now we want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. For point $A$, this is $\sqrt{x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2} = \sqrt{x_1^2 + k^2x_1^4 - 4k^2x_1^3 + 4k^2x_1^2 - 2klx_1^2 + l^2}$. Similarly, the distance from point $B$ is $\sqrt{x_2^2 + k^2x_2^4 - 4k^2x_2^3 + 4k^2x_2^2 - 2klx_2^2 + l^2}$. The sum of the squares of these distances is then
\[x_1^2 + k^2x_1^4 - 4k^2x_1^3 + 4k^2x_1^2 - 2klx_1^2 + l^2 + x_2^2 + k^2x_2^4 - 4k^2x_2^3 + 4k^2x_2^2 - 2klx_2^2 + l^2.\]

We can simplify this to
\[(x_1^2 + x_2^2) + k^2(x_1^4 + x_2^4) - 4k^2(x_1^3 + x_2^3) + 4k^2(x_1^2 + x_2^2) - 2kl(x_1^2 + x_2^2) + 2l^2.\]

By Vieta's formulas, $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 2^2 - 2\left(\frac{l-4}{k}\right) = 4 - \frac{2l-8}{k} = \frac{8 - 2l}{k}$. Also, $x_1^3 + x_2^3 = (x_1 + x_2)(x_1^2 - x_1x_2 + x_2^2) = 2\left(2^2 - \frac{l-4}{k}\right) = 2\left(4 - \frac{l-4}{k}\right) = \frac{16 - 2l + 8}{k} = \frac{24 - 2l}{k}$. And $x_1^4 + x_2^4 = (x_1^2 + x_2^2)^2 - 2(x_1^2x_2^2) = \left(\frac{8 - 2l}{k}\right)^2 - 2\left(\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right)^2\right) = \frac{(8 - 2l)^2 - 2(l - 4)^2}{k^2} = \frac{64 - 32l + 4l^2 - 2(l^2 - 8l + 16)}{k^2} = \frac{64 - 32l + 4l^2 - 2l^2 + 16l - 32}{k^2} = \frac{52 - 20l + 2l^2}{k^2}$.

Substituting these results into the expression for the sum of the squares of the distances, we get
\[\frac{8 - 2l}{k} + k^2\cdot\frac{52 - 20l + 2l^2}{k^2} - 4k^2\cdot\frac{24 - 2l}{k} + 4k^2\cdot\frac{8 - 2l}{k} - 2kl\cdot\frac{8 - 2l}{k} + 2l^2.\]

Simplifying this, we find
\[\frac{8 - 2l}{k} + \frac{52 - 20l + 2l^2}{k} - 96k + 8k^2 + 16lk - 4l^2k + 2l^2.\]

Combining like terms, we have
\[\frac{60 - 42l + 2l^2}{k} + 8k^2 + 16lk - 4l^2k + 2l^2.\]

Since we have the equation $16 - 4l = 36k$, we can solve for $l$ to get $l = 4 + 9k$. Substituting this into the expression above, we have
\[\frac{60 - 42(4 + 9k) + 2(4 + 9k)^2}{k} + 8k^2 + 16k(4 + 9k) - 4(4 + 9k)^2k + 2(4 + 9k)^2.\]

Simplifying this, we find
\[\frac{60 - 168 - 378k + 2(16 + 72k + 81k^2)}{k} + 8k^2 + 64k + 144k^2 - 4(16 + 72k + 81k^2)k + 2(16 + 7

**Problem:** 

"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


First, we need to find the $x$-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$. They are the solutions to the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$. By the quadratic formula, the solutions are given by $\frac{2k \pm \sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(l-4)}}{2k} = 1 \pm \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(l-4)}}{2k}$. We are given that the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, which is equal to $\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (4 - 4)^2} = \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(l-4)}}{k}$. Squaring both sides gives $36 = \frac{4k^2 - 4k(l-4)}{k^2}$, or $36k^2 = 4k^2 - 4k(l-4)$. Simplifying gives $32k^2 = 4k(l-4)$, or $8k = l - 4$.

The distance from $A$ (or $B$) to the origin is given by $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + (kx^2 - 2kx + l)^2}$. For $A$, this is $\sqrt{(1 + \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(l-4)}}{2k})^2 + (k(1 + \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(l-4)}}{2k})^2 - 2k(1 + \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(l-4)}}{2k}) + l)^2}$. Similarly, for $B$, it's $\sqrt{(1 - \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(l-4)}}{2k})^2 + (k(1 - \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(l-4)}}{2k})^2 - 2k(1 - \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(l-4)}}{2k}) + l)^2}$.

We want to find the sum of the squares of these distances, which is a bit of a pain to compute directly. However, we can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from a point to the vertices of an equilateral triangle is constant, and that the three vertices of the equilateral triangle are $A$ and $B$ and the origin. Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is equal to the square of the side length of the equilateral triangle.

The side length of the equilateral triangle is the distance between $A$ and $B$, which is 6. Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $6^2 = 36$.

So the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is 36. The answer is: $\boxed{36}$.

**Problem:** 

"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


First, we find the coordinates of $A$ and $B$. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ when $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$. This simplifies to $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$.

By the distance formula, the distance between two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ in the plane is $\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$. If $A$ and $B$ are distance 6 apart, then $\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (4 - 4)^2} = 6$, which simplifies to $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 36$.

The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $x_1^2 + y_1^2 + x_2^2 + y_2^2$. Since $y_1 = y_2 = 4$, this is equal to $x_1^2 + 16 + x_2^2 + 16 = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32$.

By the quadratic formula, the solutions to $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$ are $x = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{(-2k)^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k} = 1 \pm \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{k}$.

Let $x_1 = 1 - \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{k}$ and $x_2 = 1 + \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{k}$. Then $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = \left(\frac{2\sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{k}\right)^2 = \frac{16k^2 - 32k^2 + 32k^2}{k^2} = 36$, so $16k^2 = 36k^2$, which implies $k = \frac{3}{4}$.

Substituting $k = \frac{3}{4}$ into the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$ gives $\frac{3}{4}x^2 - \frac{3}{2}x + l - 4 = 0$. The discriminant of this quadratic is $\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2 - 4\left(\frac{3}{4}\right)(l - 4) = \frac{9}{4} - 3(l - 4) = \frac{9}{4} - \frac{3}{4}l + 12 = 0$, so $\frac{3}{4}l = \frac{57}{4}$ and $l = 19$.

Finally, we find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. $x_1 = 1 - \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{k} = 1 - \frac{\sqrt{9 - 3(19 - 4)}}{3/4} = 1 - \frac{\sqrt{-36}}{3/4} = 1$, and $x_2 = 1 + \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{k} = 1 + \frac{\sqrt{9 - 3(19 - 4)}}{3/4} = 1 + \frac{\sqrt{-36}}{3/4} = 1$. So $x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32 = 1^2 + 1^2 + 32 = 34$.
The answer is $\boxed{34}$.

**Problem:** 

"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


First, we find the points of intersection by setting $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$. Rearranging gives $kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0$.
Let the roots of this equation be $x_1$ and $x_2$, corresponding to the $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$. Since the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, we have $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 36$, or $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 36$. By Vieta's formulas, we know that $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$. We can use the difference of squares identity to write $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = (x_2 + x_1)^2 - 4x_1x_2$, so we have $36 = 4 - 4\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right)$, or $9 = 1 - \frac{l - 4}{k}$, or $\frac{l - 4}{k} = -8$, or $l - 4 = -8k$.
The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. Thus, the square of the distance from $A$ to the origin is $x_1^2 + (k x_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2$, and the square of the distance from $B$ to the origin is $x_2^2 + (k x_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2$. The sum of these squares is
\begin{align*}
&x_1^2 + (k x_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2 + x_2^2 + (k x_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2 \\
&= x_1^2 + x_2^2 + (k x_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2 + (k x_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2.
\end{align*}
By Vieta's formulas, $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 4 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = 4 + 16 = 20$. Also, $k x_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l = -4$ and $k x_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l = -4$, so $(k x_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2 = (-4)^2 = 16$ and $(k x_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2 = (-4)^2 = 16$. Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $20 + 16 + 16 = 52$. The answer is $\boxed{52}$.

10_**Problem:** 

"Let $w_1, w_2, \dots, w_n$ be complex numbers .  A line $L$ in the complex plane is called a mean line for the points $w_1, w_2, \dots, w_n$ if $L$ contains points (complex numbers) $z_1, z_2, \dots, z_n$ such that \[\sum_{k = 1}^n (z_k - w_k) = 0.\] For the numbers $w_1 = 32 + 170i$ $w_2 = - 7 + 64i$ $w_3 = - 9 + 200i$ $w_4 = 1 + 27i$ , and $w_5 = - 14 + 43i$ , there is a unique mean line with $y$ -intercept 3.  Find the slope of this mean line."
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:
The mean line for $w_1, . . ., w_5$ must pass through the mean (the center of mass) of these points, which, if we graph them on the complex plane, is $(\frac{3}{5}, \frac{504i}{5})$ . Since we now have two points, namely that one and $(0, 3i)$ , we can simply find the slope between them, which is $\boxed{163}$ by the good ol' slope formula. The answer is $\boxed{163}$

**Problem:** 

"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Put your final answer with $\boxed{}$.


**Solution:** 

Let's think step by step:


First, we find the points $A$ and $B$ by setting the $y$-values of the parabola and line equal to each other: $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$. 
This simplifies to $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$. 
Let the roots of this equation be $x_1$ and $x_2$, corresponding to the $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$. 
By Vieta's formulas, we know that $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$. 
Given that the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, we can use the distance formula to write $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 6^2 = 36$. 
Expanding, we have $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = (x_2 + x_1)^2 - 4x_1x_2 = 4^2 - 4\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = 16 - \frac{4(l - 4)}{k}$. 
But we know that $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 36$, so we have $16 - \frac{4(l - 4)}{k} = 36$. 
Simplifying, we find $\frac{4(l - 4)}{k} = -20$, and further simplifying, we find $l - 4 = -\frac{5k}{1}$. 
Since $l > 0$, we must have $l = 4 + 5k$. 

Now we want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. 
The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. 
For point $A$, which has coordinates $\left(x_1, kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + 4\right)$, the distance to the origin is $\sqrt{x_1^2 + \left(kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + 4\right)^2}$. 
Similarly, for point $B$, the distance to the origin is $\sqrt{x_2^2 + \left(kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + 4\right)^2}$. 

Let's denote the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin as $S$. 
We can write $S$ as $S = x_1^2 + \left(kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + 4\right)^2 + x_2^2 + \left(kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + 4\right)^2$. 
Since $x_1 + x_2 = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k} = \frac{5k}{k} = 5$, we can simplify this expression using the identity $(x_1 + x_2)^2 = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 2x_1x_2$: $S = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 + \left(kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + 4\right)^2 + \left(kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + 4\right)^2$. 
Substituting $x_1 + x_2 = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = 5$, we get $S = 4 - 2(5) + \left(kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + 4\right)^2 + \left(kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + 4\right)^2$. 
This simplifies to $S = -6 + \left(kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + 4\right)^2 + \left(kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + 4\right)^2$. 

We can further simplify this expression by noting that $kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + 4$ and $kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + 4$ are the $y$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$, which are both equal to 4 (since $y = 4$ is the equation of the line). 
Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $S = -6 + 4^2 + 4^2 = -6 + 32 = 26$. 

However, this result doesn't make sense, as the sum of the squares of distances should be positive. 
We must have made a mistake in our calculations. 
Let's retrace our steps and check our work. 

We found that $l = 4 + 5k$. 
Substituting this into the equation $kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l = 4$, we get $kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + 4 + 5k = 4$. 
Simplifying, we find $kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + 5k = 0$. 
This equation should be satisfied for $x_1$, the $x$-coordinate of point $A$. 

However, when we substitute $l = 4 + 5k$ into the equation $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 36$, we get $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = (x_2 + x_1)^2 - 4x_1x_2 = 4^2 - 4\left(\frac{4 + 5k - 4}{k}\right) = 16 - \frac{20}{k}$. 
But this equation simplifies to $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 16 - \frac{20}{k}$, not $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 36$. 

We must have made an error in our calculations. 
Let's go back and check our work again. 

After re-checking our work, we find that our mistake was in our substitution of $l = 4 + 5k$ into the equation $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 36$. 
The correct equation should be $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = (x_2 + x_1)^2 - 4x_1x_2 = 4^2 - 4\left(\frac{4 + 5k - 4}{k}\right) = 16 - \frac{20}{k}$, not $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 16 - \frac{20}{k}$. 

Correcting our mistake, we have $(x_2 - x_1)^2 =
