**Problem:** 
"How many distinct solutions are there to the equation $|x-7| = |x+1|$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
If $|x-7| = |x+1|$, then either $x-7 = x+1$ or $x-7 = -(x+1)$.  Simplifying $x-7=x+1$ gives $0=8$, which has no solutions, so no values of $x$ satisfy $x-7 = x+1$.  If $x-7 = -(x+1)$, then $x-7 = -x-1$, so $2x = 6$, which gives $x=3$.  So, there is $\boxed{1}$ solution.

Challenge: See if you can find a quick solution to this problem by simply thinking about the graphs of $y=|x-7|$ and $y=|x+1|$. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


To analyze the problem, we first need to understand that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. The expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ represents a "bump function" with 4 parts, each part a distance of $\frac{m}{100}$ away from the previous part.

The "bump function" $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a value of 0 at $x=1-2= -1$, $x=1$ (the "bump" starts), $x=1+2=3$ (the "bump" ends), and $x=3+2=5$. So the "bump" is from $x=-1$ to $x=5$, with a height of 2.

The distance of each part of the "bump" is $\frac{m}{100}$, so the total distance of the "bump" is $5 - (-1) = 6$, which must be divided into 4 parts. Therefore, each part has a length of $\frac{6}{4} = 1.5$.

So, we have $\frac{m}{100} = 1.5$, and solving for $m$ gives $m = 1.5 \times 100 = 150$.

So the value of $m$ that makes the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have 4 distinct solutions is $m = 150$. The answer is: $\boxed{150}$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many solutions does the equation \[\frac{(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)\dotsm(x-100)}{(x-1^2)(x-2^2)(x-3^2)\dotsm(x-100^2)} = 0\]have for $x$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Any solution to this equation must make the numerator of the left-hand side zero, while keeping the denominator non-zero. The numerator is zero when $x$ is one of the numbers $1, 2, 3, \dots, 100.$ However, for any value in this list that is a perfect square, the denominator will also be zero, so that value of $x$ will not be a root. Therefore, we want to find the number of integers in the list $1, 2, \dots, 100$ which are not perfect squares. The perfect squares in the list are $1^2, 2^2, \dots, 10^2,$ so there are $10$ perfect squares, and \[100 - 10 = \boxed{90}\]integers which are not perfect squares. The answer is $\boxed{90}$

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $1$ or $3$. This is because the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, changes its sign at $x=1$ and at $x=3$. Therefore, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be $1$ or $3$ to have four distinct solutions.

If $\frac{m}{100}=1$, then $m=100$.
If $\frac{m}{100}=3$, then $m=300$.

So the only possible values of $m$ are $100$ and $300$.

Now, we need to determine how many of these values actually give us 4 distinct solutions.

For $m=100$, the equation becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=1$. This equation has four distinct solutions: $x=0$, $x=3$, $x=-1$, and $x=4$.

For $m=300$, the equation becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=3$. This equation also has four distinct solutions: $x=-2$, $x=4$, $x=0$, and $x=5$.

Therefore, both $m=100$ and $m=300$ give us four distinct solutions. The number of such positive integers $m$ is $2$.

So the answer is $\boxed{2}$.

Here is a Python code to verify the solution:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def count_m():
    count = 0
    for m in [100, 300]:
        # equation: | |x - 1| - 2 | = m / 100
        # solve for x
        x1 = 1 + 2 + m/100
        x2 = 1 + 2 - m/100
        x3 = 1 - 2 - m/100
        x4 = 1 - 2 + m/100

        # check if the solutions are distinct
        if x1 != x2 and x1 != x3 and x1 != x4 and x2 != x3 and x2 != x4 and x3 != x4:
            count += 1
    return count

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let \[f(x) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
-x + 3 & \text{if } x \le 0, \\
2x - 5 & \text{if } x > 0.
\end{array}
\right.\]How many solutions does the equation $f(f(x)) = 4$ have?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
To solve the equation $f(f(x)) = 4,$ we first find the values $x$ such that $f(x) = 4.$

Either $f(x) = -x + 3$ (for $x \le 0$) or $f(x) = 2x - 5$ (for $x > 0$). If $-x + 3 = 4,$ then $x = -1.$ Note that this value satisfies $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = 4,$ then $x = 9/2.$ Note that this value satisfies $x > 0.$ Therefore, the solutions to $f(x) = 4$ are $x = -1$ and $x = 9/2.$

Next, we solve for the values $x$ such that $f(x) = -1.$ If $-x + 3 = -1,$ then $x = 4.$ This value does not satisfy $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = -1,$ then $x = 2.$ This value satisfies $x > 0.$

Finally, we solve for the values $x$ such that $f(x) = 9/2.$ If $-x + 3 = 9/2,$ then $x = -3/2.$ This value satisfies $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = 9/2,$ then $x = 19/4.$ This value satisfies $x > 0.$

Therefore, the equation $f(f(x)) = 4$ has the solutions $x = 2,$ $-3/2,$ and $19/4,$ for a total of $\boxed{3}$ solutions. The answer is $\boxed{3}$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many integers are solutions to the equation $$(x-2)^{(25-x^2)}=1?$$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
We need some basic facts from number theory: $a^0 = 1$ for any $a,$ $1^b = 1$ for any $b,$ and $(-1)^c = 1$ if $c$ is an even integer. Unless the base is a complex number (which is excluded since we are looking for integer solutions), there are no other ways to get an RHS of $1.$ Thus, either the exponent is zero $($giving the equation $25 - x^2 = 0),$ the base is $1$ $($giving $x -2 = 1),$ or the base is $-1$ and the exponent is even $($giving the simultaneous equations $x - 2 = -1$ and $25 - x^2 = 2n$ for some integer $n).$ Solving the first equation gives $x = \pm 5,$ and solving the second gives $x = 3.$ The third equation implies that $x = 1,$ in which case $25 - x^2 = 24$ is indeed even, so $x = 1$ is a valid solution. In all, there are $\boxed{4}$ integer solutions. The answer is $\boxed{4}$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"For certain ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ of real numbers, the system of equations
\[\begin{aligned} ax+by&=1 \\ x^2 + y^2 &= 50  \end{aligned}\]has at least one solution, and each solution is an ordered pair $(x,y)\,$ of integers. How many such ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ are there?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The graph of $ax+by=1$ is a line, while the graph of $x^2+y^2=50$ is a circle centered at the origin. Therefore, $(a, b)$ satisfies the conditions if and only if the line and circle intersect at least once, and they intersect only at lattice points (points with integer coordinates).

Knowing this, it makes sense to look for lattice points on the circle whose equation is $x^2+y^2=50$. Testing cases, we find that there are twelve lattice points on the circle: $(\pm 1, \pm 7)$, $(\pm 7, \pm 1)$, and $(\pm 5, \pm 5)$ (where the two $\pm$ signs in each pair are independent of each other).

There are $\tbinom{12}{2} = 66$ pairs of these points, and each pair determines a line. However, the graph of $ax+by=1$ can never pass through the origin $(0, 0)$, since if $x=y=0$, then $ax+by=0 \neq 1$. Therefore, the six pairs which consist of diametrically opposed points are invalid, since the line through them passes through the origin. This corrects our count to $66 - 6 = 60$.

In addition, for each of the twelve points, there is a line tangent to the circle at that point, so that the only solution to the system is that one point. This brings the final total to $60 + 12 = \boxed{72}$. The answer is $\boxed{72}$

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


We want to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly four distinct solutions. 

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be rewritten as two separate cases: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$. 

For the first case, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which gives us two separate equations: $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x-1 = -(2 + \frac{m}{100})$. 

Similarly, for the second case, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which gives us two separate equations: $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x-1 = -(2 - \frac{m}{100})$. 

Solving these equations, we find that for each value of $m$, there are four distinct solutions. 

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has exactly four distinct solutions is the number of positive integers $m$ such that $\frac{m}{100} \leq 2$. 

This gives us $m \leq 200$, and since $m$ is a positive integer, the number of such $m$ is $200$. 

However, we need to subtract the values of $m$ for which the solutions are not distinct. 

For $m = 0$, all four solutions are $x = 1$. 

For $m = 200$, the four solutions are $x = -3$, $x = 5$, $x = 1$, and $x = 3$. But $x = 1$ is a repeated solution, so we only count three distinct solutions. 

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has exactly four distinct solutions is $200 - 2 = 198$.
The answer is: $198$

Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**

The numerator is zero when $x$ is one of the numbers $1, 2, 3, \dots, 100.$ However, for any value in this list that is a perfect square, the denominator will also be zero, so that value of $x$ will not be a root. Therefore, we want to find the number of integers in the list $1, 2, \dots, 100$ which are not perfect squares. The perfect squares in the list are $1^2, 2^2, \dots, 10^2,$ so there are $10$ perfect squares, and \[100 - 10 = \boxed{90}\]integers which are not perfect squares. The answer is $\boxed{90}$

**Solution:** 


To solve the problem, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly 4 distinct solutions. 

We first observe that the right-hand side of the equation is always positive, so the left-hand side must also be positive. This means that $\vert x-1 \vert -2 > 0$, and thus $\vert x-1 \vert > 2$. This implies that $x-1 > 2$ or $x-1 < -2$, which gives us $x > 3$ or $x < -1$.

Now, let's consider the two cases separately:

1. If $x > 3$, then $|x-1| = x-1$. So the equation becomes $|x-1 - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$, or $|x-3| = \frac{m}{100}$. This equation has two solutions for each positive $m$, namely $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$. However, we only want the solutions in the range $x > 3$, so we only consider $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$. This gives us a solution if $3 + \frac{m}{100} > 3$, which simplifies to $m > 0$.

2. If $x < -1$, then $|x-1| = 1-x$. So the equation becomes $|1-x - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$, or $|-x-1| = \frac{m}{100}$. This equation has two solutions for each positive $m$, namely $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$. However, we only want the solutions in the range $x < -1$, so we only consider $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$. This gives us a solution if $-1 - \frac{m}{100} < -1$, which simplifies to $m > 0$.

So in both cases, we only get a solution for positive $m$. The number of distinct solutions is then the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly 4 distinct solutions. 

To find these values of $m$, we can use a loop in Python to check for each positive integer $m$ whether the equation has exactly 4 distinct solutions.

The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly 4 distinct solutions is 400. However, this result is incorrect. The problem lies in the fact that we have not considered the case where the absolute value expression equals a negative number. We need to modify our approach to account for this.

Let's reconsider the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. The right-hand side of the equation is always positive, so the left-hand side must also be positive. This means that $\vert x-1 \vert -2 > 0$, and thus $\vert x-1 \vert > 2$. This implies that $x-1 > 2$ or $x-1 < -2$, which gives us $x > 3$ or $x < -1$.

Now, let's consider the three cases separately:

1. If $x > 3$, then $|x-1| = x-1$. So the equation becomes $|x-1 - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$, or $|x-3| = \frac{m}{100}$. This equation has two solutions for each positive $m$, namely $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$. 

2. If $x < -1$, then $|x-1| = 1-x$. So the equation becomes $|1-x - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$, or $|-x-1| = \frac{m}{100}$. This equation has two solutions for each positive $m$, namely $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

3. If $-1 \le x \le 3$, then $|x-1| = 1 - x$. So the equation becomes $|1-x - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$, or $|-x-1| = \frac{m}{100}$. This equation has two solutions for each positive $m$, namely $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$. However, we only want the solutions in the range $-1 \le x \le 3$, so we only consider $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$. This gives us a solution if $-1 + \frac{m}{100} \le 3$, which simplifies to $m \le 400$.

So in the third case, we only get a solution for $m \le 400$. The number of distinct solutions is then the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly 4 distinct solutions. 

To find these values of $m$, we can use a loop in Python to check for each positive integer $m$ whether the equation has exactly 4 distinct solutions.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many distinct solutions are there to the equation $|x-7| = |x+1|$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
If $|x-7| = |x+1|$, then either $x-7 = x+1$ or $x-7 = -(x+1)$.  Simplifying $x-7=x+1$ gives $0=8$, which has no solutions, so no values of $x$ satisfy $x-7 = x+1$.  If $x-7 = -(x+1)$, then $x-7 = -x-1$, so $2x = 6$, which gives $x=3$.  So, there is $\boxed{1}$ solution.

Challenge: See if you can find a quick solution to this problem by simply thinking about the graphs of $y=|x-7|$ and $y=|x+1|$. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let \[f(x) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
-x + 3 & \text{if } x \le 0, \\
2x - 5 & \text{if } x > 0.
\end{array}
\right.\]How many solutions does the equation $f(f(x)) = 4$ have?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
To solve the equation $f(f(x)) = 4,$ we first find the values $x$ such that $f(x) = 4.$

Either $f(x) = -x + 3$ (for $x \le 0$) or $f(x) = 2x - 5$ (for $x > 0$). If $-x + 3 = 4,$ then $x = -1.$ Note that this value satisfies $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = 4,$ then $x = 9/2.$ Note that this value satisfies $x > 0.$ Therefore, the solutions to $f(x) = 4$ are $x = -1$ and $x = 9/2.$

Next, we solve for the values $x$ such that $f(x) = -1.$ If $-x + 3 = -1,$ then $x = 4.$ This value does not satisfy $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = -1,$ then $x = 2.$ This value satisfies $x > 0.$

Finally, we solve for the values $x$ such that $f(x) = 9/2.$ If $-x + 3 = 9/2,$ then $x = -3/2.$ This value satisfies $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = 9/2,$ then $x = 19/4.$ This value satisfies $x > 0.$

Therefore, the equation $f(f(x)) = 4$ has the solutions $x = 2,$ $-3/2,$ and $19/4,$ for a total of $\boxed{3}$ solutions. The answer is $\boxed{3}$

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


This problem is not straightforward to solve with Python because it involves a mathematical understanding of the absolute value function and its properties. However, we can solve it manually by analyzing the equation and considering the possible values of $m$.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to 2. This is because the absolute value function "flattens" the graph, and the inner absolute value function "flattens" it again. The result is a "V" shape with the "bottom" of the "V" at $\frac{m}{100}$. To have 4 distinct solutions, this value must be 2, so $m = 200$.

Therefore, the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 200. The answer is: $200$

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

Let's break down the steps to solve this problem:

1. We can start by analyzing the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. The expression on the left side can take on three different forms depending on the value of $x$:
   - If $x \leq 1$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = 2 - x$.
   - If $1 < x \leq 3$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = x - 3$.
   - If $x > 3$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = x - 1$.

2. Now, we need to find the values of $x$ for which each of these expressions equals $\frac{m}{100}$.
   - For $x \leq 1$, the equation becomes $2 - x = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. Since $x \leq 1$, we have $2 - \frac{m}{100} \leq 1$, which gives $m \geq 100$.
   - For $1 < x \leq 3$, the equation becomes $x - 3 = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$. Since $1 < x \leq 3$, we have $1 < 3 + \frac{m}{100} \leq 3$, which gives $0 < \frac{m}{100} \leq 2$, or $0 < m \leq 200$.
   - For $x > 3$, the equation becomes $x - 1 = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = 1 + \frac{m}{100}$. Since $x > 3$, we have $1 + \frac{m}{100} > 3$, which gives $\frac{m}{100} > 2$, or $m > 200$.

3. To have 4 distinct solutions, we need to have one solution in each of the intervals $x \leq 1$, $1 < x \leq 3$, and $x > 3$. This means that the values of $m$ that we are looking for are those in the intervals $100 \leq m \leq 200$ and $m > 200$. However, we are only interested in positive integers $m$, so we only consider the interval $100 \leq m \leq 200$.

4. The number of positive integers in the interval $100 \leq m \leq 200$ is $101$. Therefore, there are 101 positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

The result is: 101.
The answer is: $101$

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


To solve this problem, we need to understand the behavior of the function $| |x-1| - 2|$. This function has three different forms depending on the value of $x$. When $x < 1$, the function is equivalent to $|-(x-1) - 2| = |-x-1|$. When $1 \leq x < 3$, the function is equivalent to $|x-1 - 2| = |x-3|$. And when $x \geq 3$, the function is equivalent to $|x-1 - 2| = |x-3|$.

The function $|x-3|$ has a single discontinuity at $x=3$, and it increases from $0$ to $\infty$ as $x$ increases from $3^-$ to $3^+$. The function $|x-3|$ is $0$ for $x=3$, positive for $x > 3$, and negative for $x < 3$.

The function $|x-3|$ intersects the line $y = \frac{m}{100}$ at three points when $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, at one point when $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, and does not intersect the line when $\frac{m}{100} > 2$.

Therefore, the equation $| |x-1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, which means $m = 200$. So the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 200. The answer is: $1$

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $2$. This is because the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a graph that is a series of $V$s with the maximum value $2$ and the minimum value $1$. So, the equation $f(x) = \frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $2$.

To find the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy this condition, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. This is equivalent to finding the number of positive integers $m$ such that $100 < m < 200$. The number of such integers is $200 - 100 - 1 = 99$.

So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $99$.
