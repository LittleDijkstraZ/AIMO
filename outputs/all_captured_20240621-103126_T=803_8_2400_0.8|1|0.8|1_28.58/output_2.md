Approach:


We want to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. We can start by analyzing the equation. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $2$. This can be written as $1<\frac{m}{100}<2$, which simplifies to $100<m<200$. The positive integers in this range are the integers from $101$ to $199$, inclusive. To find the number of these integers, we can subtract the smallest integer in the range from the largest integer in the range and then add $1$. This gives us $199-101+1=100$. Therefore, there are $100$ positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

Solution:
The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $100$. The answer is: $100$

The number of distinct solutions to the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to 4 if and only if $\frac{m}{100}=1$. Therefore, $m=100$. The value of $m$ that satisfies the condition is 100. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 1. The answer is: $1$

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"

Approach:


We can start by understanding the structure of the problem. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. We need to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which this is true.

First, we can observe that the right hand side, $\frac{m}{100}$, is a fraction with a denominator of 100 and a numerator that's a positive integer $m$. This means $m$ must be a positive integer from 1 to 100.

Next, we need to find how many of these values of $m$ will result in the equation having 4 distinct solutions. We can do this by solving the equation for each value of $m$ from 1 to 100 and counting the number of distinct solutions.

We can use Python and the Sympy library to solve this problem. Here's a script that does this:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Abs, solveset, S

def count_solutions_for_m(m):
    """Count the number of distinct solutions for the given value of m in the equation | |x - 1| - 2 | = m / 100."""
    x = symbols('x')
    equation = Abs(Abs(x - 1) - 2) - m/100
    solutions = solveset(equation, x, domain=S.Reals)
    return len(solutions)

m_values = list(range(1, 101))
distinct_solutions = [count_solutions_for_m(m) for m in m_values]

# Count how many of the m values result in 4 distinct solutions
num_m_values = sum(1 for count in distinct_solutions if count == 4)
print(num_m_values)
```

100

CODE RESULTS 100

```output
100
```
However, this counts the number of m values that result in 4 distinct solutions. But we only want the number of those m values, not the m values themselves. So we need to filter out the m values that result in other numbers of distinct solutions.

Let's modify the script to only count the m values that result in 4 distinct solutions:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

m_values = list(range(1, 101))
distinct_solutions = [count_solutions_for_m(m) for m in m_values]

# Filter out the m values that result in 4 distinct solutions
m_values_4_solutions = [m for m, count in zip(m_values, distinct_solutions) if count == 4]

print(len(m_values_4_solutions))
```

Running this corrected script will output the correct number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

```output

100
100

CODE RESULTS 100

INTERMEDIATE OUT :

```
The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $\boxed{100}$.

This means there are 100 positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions. The answer is $\boxed{100}$.

Approach:


1. We need to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.
2. This equation is of the form $|A| = B$, which can be split into two cases: $A = B$ and $A = -B$.
3. Applying this to our equation, we have two cases: $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ and $| |x-1| - 2 | = -\frac{m}{100}$.
4. The first case, $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$, can be further split into two sub-cases: $|x-1| - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $|x-1| - 2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.
5. The second case, $| |x-1| - 2 | = -\frac{m}{100}$, doesn't have any solutions because the absolute value of a quantity is always non-negative.
6. The first sub-case, $|x-1| - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$, can be further split into four sub-cases depending on the value of $x$ being greater or less than 1 and the absolute value being positive or negative.
7. These four sub-cases can be solved for $x$ and the number of distinct solutions can be counted.
8. The same process is repeated for the second sub-case, $|x-1| - 2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.
9. The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is the number of times the count of distinct solutions for the first sub-case is equal to 4.

The entire script:
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

def count_m():
    x, m = symbols('x m')
    count = 0

    # First sub-case: |x - 1| - 2 = m/100
    # Four sub-cases for different values of x
    for side in ['+', '-']:
        if side == '+':
            equation = Eq((x - 1) - 2, m/100)
            solution = solve(equation, x)
        else:
            equation = Eq(-((x - 1) - 2), m/100)
            solution = solve(equation, x)
        # Count the number of distinct solutions
        count += len(set(solution))

    return count

result = count_m()
print(result)
```

After running the script, we find that the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 2.
However, this result doesn't seem correct.
Let's go back and re-examine our approach and the equations we are solving.

We have two cases: $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ and $| |x-1| - 2 | = -\frac{m}{100}$.
The second case, $| |x-1| - 2 | = -\frac{m}{100}$, doesn't have any solutions because the absolute value of a quantity is always non-negative.
So, we only need to consider the first case, $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$.

The first case, $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$, can be further split into two sub-cases: $|x-1| - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $|x-1| - 2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.
The second sub-case, $|x-1| - 2 = -\frac{m}{100}$, doesn't have any solutions because the absolute value of a quantity is always non-negative.
So, we only need to consider the first sub-case, $|x-1| - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$.

Now, let's solve the sub-case $|x-1| - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$ for $x$:

If $x - 1 \ge 0$, then $x - 1 - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$, which gives $x = 1 + 2 + \frac{m}{100} = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.
If $x - 1 < 0$, then $- (x - 1) - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$, which gives $x = 1 - 2 - \frac{m}{100} = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Now, for the equation $|x-1| - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$ to have 4 distinct solutions, the expressions $3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $-1 - \frac{m}{100}$ must each have two distinct solutions for $m$.

For $3 + \frac{m}{100}$, we need $0 < 3 + \frac{m}{100} < 4$, which gives $-300 < m < 100$. The number of positive integers in this range is 200.

For $-1 - \frac{m}{100}$, we need $0 < -1 - \frac{m}{100} < 4$, which gives $-100 < m < -300$. However, there are no positive integers in this range.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 200.

So, the final answer is 200.
The answer is: $200$

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"

The problem asks for the value of $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ represents a family of piecewise linear functions, each corresponding to a specific value of $m$. The function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has three 'corners' at $x= -1, 3, 5$. The function $\frac{m}{100}$ is a family of lines with slope 0 and varying $y$-intercepts.

For the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, the line $\frac{m}{100}$ must intersect the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ in four different places. This occurs exactly when the slope of the line $\frac{m}{100}$ is between 1 and 2. In other words, $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which implies $100 < m < 200$.

The only positive integer value of $m$ in this range is 101. So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 1. The answer is: 1
