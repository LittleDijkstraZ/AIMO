 The problem states that we need to find the maximum number of yellow numbers in a set of three-digit numbers from 111 to 999 such that the sum of any two yellow numbers is a blue number.

Let's consider the smallest and largest three-digit numbers: 111 and 999. The sum of these two numbers is 1110, which is a four-digit number. So the sum of any two yellow numbers must be a three-digit number.

Let's denote the maximum number of yellow numbers as $y$. According to the problem's conditions, the sum of any two yellow numbers must be a blue number. This means that the blue numbers must cover all possible sums of two yellow numbers.

The smallest possible sum of two yellow numbers is $111 + 111 = 222$, and the largest is $999 + 999 = 1998$. Since we want the sum of any two yellow numbers to be a three-digit number, the possible sums of two yellow numbers must be from 222 to 1998. The total number of these sums is $\frac{(1998 - 222)}{1} + 1 = 1777$.

Because each blue number corresponds to one sum of two yellow numbers, there can be at most $\frac{1777}{2} = 888.5$. But the number of yellow numbers must be an integer, so the maximum number of yellow numbers $y$ must be less than 889.

By trial and error, we find that if we choose $y = 888$, the sum of any two yellow numbers will exceed 1998. Therefore, the maximum number of yellow numbers must be less than 888.

If we choose $y = 887$, the sum of any two yellow numbers will not exceed 1998. Therefore, the maximum number of yellow numbers is $y = 887$.

So the maximum possible number of yellow numbers is 887. The answer is: $887$

 The problem states that every pair of yellow numbers must add up to a blue number. This means that the sum of any two yellow numbers must be a blue number, but not necessarily the other way around. 

The smallest blue number is $111 + 111 = 222$, and the largest is $999$, the largest possible three-digit number. 

Therefore, the possible blue numbers are all the multiples of $111$ from $222$ to $999$, which are $2, 3, 4, ..., 8, 9$. 

This means that there are 8 possible blue numbers. 

Since every pair of yellow numbers must add up to a blue number, the maximum number of yellow numbers is achieved when each yellow number adds up with another to form all possible blue numbers exactly once. 

This is a classic problem of combinatorics and can be solved using the concept of triangular numbers. The nth triangular number is given by the formula $\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$. 

We want to find the largest triangular number that is less than or equal to the number of blue numbers, which is 8. The largest triangular number less than or equal to 8 is the 7th triangular number, because $\frac{7(7+1)}{2} = 28 > 8$ and $\frac{6(6+1)}{2} = 21 \leq 8$. 

However, this would mean using the 7th triangular number, which is 28, when only 8 blue numbers are available. So we must use the 6th triangular number instead. The 6th triangular number is $\frac{6(6+1)}{2} = 21$. 

So the maximum number of yellow numbers is 21. The answer is: $21$

 First, let's list the constraints and conditions from the problem:

1. The numbers $111$ to $999$ are colored either blue or yellow.
2. The sum of any two yellow numbers must equal a blue number.
3. We want to maximize the number of yellow numbers.

To solve this problem, let's use the fact that the maximum number of colors we can use when coloring a complete graph (where each vertex is connected to every other vertex) is one more than the maximum degree of a vertex in the graph. In this case, the complete graph is the set of numbers $111$ to $999$, and the vertices are the numbers. The edges are the pairs of numbers whose sum is a blue number.

The maximum degree of a vertex in this graph is $998$, because any vertex (number) can be added to the number $111$ to get $1002$, $1012$, ..., $999 + 111 = 1110$, which is the largest possible sum. Thus, the maximum number of colors we can use is $998 + 1 = 999$.

However, we only have two colors (blue and yellow) to color the numbers. So, the maximum number of yellow numbers we can have is half of the total number of vertices (numbers) in the graph, which is half of the numbers from $111$ to $999$. This is given by:

$$\frac{(999 - 111 + 1)}{2} = \frac{888}{2} = 444.$$

Therefore, the maximum possible number of yellow numbers there can be is $444$. The answer is: $444$.

 The constraints, conditions, and related knowledge for the problem are:

1. The sum of any two yellow numbers must equal a blue number.
2. Each of the three-digit numbers from 111 to 999 are either blue or yellow.

We are trying to maximize the number of yellow numbers. To do this, we can start by listing some blue numbers that can be formed by the sum of two yellow numbers. The smallest blue number is $111 + 111 = 222$, and the largest is $999 - 111 = 888$. So the blue numbers we have are: $222, 333, 444, ..., 888$. There are 678 such numbers in total.

Now, let's consider the yellow numbers. If we can show that we can choose at most one yellow number from each blue number's "neighborhood", we can maximize the number of yellow numbers. For a blue number $b$, its neighborhood consists of the yellow numbers that sum to $b$. For example, the neighborhood of $222$ is the yellow numbers $111$ and $111$, and the neighborhood of $333$ is the yellow numbers $111$ and $222$.

When we choose a yellow number from a blue number's neighborhood, we remove all the sums involving that yellow number from the available sums. Therefore, we should choose at most one yellow number from each neighborhood to maximize the number of yellow numbers.

The number of yellow numbers is then the number of neighborhoods we can choose from, which is equal to the number of blue numbers. So the maximum number of yellow numbers is 678. The answer is: $678$

 The problem constraints are as follows:
- We are given a set of numbers from 111 to 999.
- Each number is colored either blue or yellow.
- The sum of any two yellow numbers must be a blue number.
- We want to find the maximum number of yellow numbers.

To solve this problem, we can use the Pigeonhole Principle, which states that if there are n pigeonholes and n+1 pigeons, at least one pigeonhole must contain more than one pigeon. In this case, the pigeonholes are the possible sums of two yellow numbers, and the pigeons are the numbers 111 to 999.

The minimum possible sum of two yellow numbers is $111 + 111 = 222$, and the maximum possible sum is $999 + 999 = 1998$. So the possible sums of two yellow numbers form an interval of integers from 222 to 1998. The number of integers in this interval is $1998 - 222 + 1 = 1777$.

If we were to color all 1777 possible sums of two yellow numbers with distinct colors, we would have 1777 yellow numbers. However, this would mean that for any two yellow numbers, their sum would be a blue number. But if we add one more yellow number, say $Y$, to our set, the sum of $Y$ with any of the existing 1777 yellow numbers would have to be a blue number, but since there are only 1777 blue numbers, by the Pigeonhole Principle, there must be at least one blue number that is the sum of $Y$ with two different existing yellow numbers, which contradicts our condition.

Therefore, the maximum number of yellow numbers is 1777. However, this is an upper bound, and we need to determine if it's achievable.

Consider the numbers 111, 222, ..., 999. These are 900 numbers in total. If we color all of them yellow, and for any two of them, their sum is a number from 222 to 1998, then we would have achieved the maximum number of yellow numbers.

To check if this is achievable, we need to see if there are at least 1777 distinct sums of two numbers from the set {111, 222, ..., 999}. The smallest sum is $111 + 111 = 222$, and the largest sum is $999 + 999 = 1998$. The possible sums form an interval of integers from 222 to 1998, which contains $1998 - 222 + 1 = 1777$ integers. Therefore, it is achievable to color 900 numbers yellow such that the sum of any two of them is a blue number.

So, the maximum number of yellow numbers is indeed 1777. The answer is: $1777$

The constraints, conditions, and related knowledge are as follows:

1. Each of the three-digit numbers from 111 to 999 is colored either blue or yellow.
2. The sum of any two yellow numbers is a blue number.
3. We want to maximize the number of yellow numbers.

To solve this problem, we can use the Pigeonhole Principle. The Pigeonhole Principle states that if there are n pigeonholes and n+1 pigeons, at least one pigeonhole must contain more than one pigeon.

Let's consider the sum of any two yellow numbers. The minimum sum is $111 + 111 = 222$ and the maximum sum is $999 + 999 = 1998$. So the possible sums form an arithmetic sequence from 222 to 1998 with a common difference of 111. The number of terms in this sequence is $\frac{1998 - 222}{111} + 1 = 17$.

Now, let's consider the yellow numbers as pigeons and the possible sums as pigeonholes. According to the Pigeonhole Principle, if we have more pigeons than pigeonholes, at least one pigeonhole must contain more than one pigeon. This means that at least one sum (i.e., one possible yellow-yellow combination) must be repeated.

This means that the maximum number of yellow numbers is 17, because if we try to have 18 or more yellow numbers, we would have more yellow numbers than possible yellow-yellow combinations, and by the Pigeonhole Principle, at least one sum would be repeated, which contradicts the condition that the sum of any two yellow numbers is a blue number.

Therefore, the maximum possible number of yellow numbers is 17. The answer is: $17$

 The problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge are:

1. Each of the three-digit numbers from $111$ to $999$ is colored either blue or yellow.
2. The sum of any two yellow numbers is a blue number.

We want to maximize the number of yellow numbers. Let's start by listing all the blue numbers that can be formed by summing two yellow numbers. These blue numbers are the sums of all possible pairs of two-digit numbers from $11$ to $99$. There are $\binom{90}{2} = 405$ such pairs, and their sums form the set of blue numbers.

Now, consider any yellow number $y$. By the second constraint, $y + y$ must be a blue number. That is, $2y$ must be a blue number. However, since all blue numbers are formed as sums of two yellow numbers, $2y$ must also be a sum of two yellow numbers. Therefore, $2y$ must be a blue number. This implies that $y$ itself must be a blue number, because if $y$ were yellow, then $2y$ would be yellow, and then $2y$ would be a yellow number, which is a contradiction because $2y$ is a blue number.

So, no yellow number can be half of a blue number. The only numbers in the range from $111$ to $999$ that are not divisible by $2$ are the odd numbers. So, all yellow numbers must be odd.

The maximum number of yellow numbers is achieved by selecting all the odd numbers in the range from $111$ to $999$. There are $450$ odd numbers in this range. So the maximum number of yellow numbers is $450$.

The answer is: $450$

 The problem states that the sum of any two yellow numbers must be a blue number. This means that the set of blue numbers must be closed under addition. Also, all numbers from 111 to 999 must be colored either blue or yellow.

The maximum number of yellow numbers can be achieved when the set of blue numbers contains as few numbers as possible. To minimize the number of blue numbers, we want to use the smallest possible blue numbers. The smallest three-digit number is 111, so we can use it as one of the blue numbers. Then, we can use the sum of any two 111's as a blue number: $111 + 111 = 222$. We can continue this pattern to get the following blue numbers: 111, 222, 333, ..., 999. There are 9 such numbers, which are all the possible multiples of 111 in the range of 111 to 999.

Now, we want to determine the maximum number of yellow numbers. Since any sum of two yellow numbers must be a blue number, the number of possible yellow numbers is limited by the number of blue numbers. The maximum number of yellow numbers is achieved when each yellow number is used only once in the sum operation. Therefore, the maximum number of yellow numbers is equal to the number of "unused" numbers, which are not multiples of 111 in the range of 111 to 999.

To count the number of such numbers, we can subtract the number of multiples of 111 from the total number of three-digit numbers. The total number of three-digit numbers is 999 - 111 + 1 = 899. The number of multiples of 111 in the range of 111 to 999 is 9 (as mentioned earlier). Therefore, the number of "unused" numbers (which can be colored yellow) is 899 - 9 = 890.

So, the maximum number of yellow numbers is 890. The answer is: $890$

 The problem states that the sum of any two yellow numbers must be a blue number. This means that the set of all yellow numbers must form an abelian group under the operation of addition modulo 1000. The maximum order of an abelian group of order 1000 is the product of the maximum powers of the prime factors of 1000, which are 2, 5. The maximum power of 2 that divides 1000 is 10 (because $2^{10} = 1024 > 1000$), and the maximum power of 5 that divides 1000 is 3 (because $5^3 = 125 < 1000$ and $5^4 = 625 > 1000$). So the maximum order of an abelian group of order 1000 is $2^{10} \cdot 5^3 = 1024 \cdot 125 = 128000$. However, this is clearly impossible, as the number of elements in an abelian group can't exceed the order of the group.

The problem also states that the numbers range from 111 to 999. This means that the maximum possible number of yellow numbers must be less than or equal to 999 - 111 + 1 = 889.

The best we can do is to let the yellow numbers be the multiples of a large prime number that divides 1000. The largest such prime number is 5, and the largest multiple of 5 in the range from 111 to 999 is 995. The number of multiples of 5 in this range is $\frac{995 - 115}{5} + 1 = \frac{880}{5} + 1 = 176 + 1 = 177$. So the maximum possible number of yellow numbers is 177.

Therefore, the maximum possible number of yellow numbers there can be is 177. The answer is: $177$

 Let's think about this problem. We want to find the maximum number of yellow numbers that can be colored under the given condition. The condition is that the sum of any two yellow numbers must be a blue number. This means that all possible sums of two yellow numbers must be blue numbers.

Let's consider the smallest and largest possible blue numbers: $111+111=222$ and $999+999=1998$. So the blue numbers must be in the range of $222$ to $1998$.

Now, let's consider the number of blue numbers in this range. The number of three-digit numbers in the range of $222$ to $1998$ is $1998-222+1=1777$.

However, this is not the maximum number of yellow numbers. We can use the concept of triangular numbers to find the maximum number of yellow numbers. A triangular number is the sum of the first n natural numbers, given by the formula $\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$. We want to find the largest triangular number that is less than or equal to $1777$, because that will be the maximum number of yellow numbers.

To find the largest triangular number less than or equal to $1777$, we need to solve the equation $\frac{n(n+1)}{2} \leq 1777$. Solving this equation gives $n \approx 62.5$. Since $n$ must be a natural number, we take the largest integer less than or equal to $62.5$, which is $62$. Then the triangular number is $\frac{62(62+1)}{2}=1953$.

However, $1953$ is larger than $1998$, so we need to find the largest triangular number less than or equal to $1777$ that is also less than or equal to $1998$. We can try different values of $n$ to find the largest triangular number that fits these conditions. By trial and error, we find that $n=61$ gives a triangular number of $1953$, which is the largest triangular number less than or equal to $1998$.

Therefore, the maximum number of yellow numbers is the number of blue numbers minus one (because one blue number is redundant, which we can eliminate by choosing the largest triangular number), which is $1777-61+1=1717$.
The answer is: $1717$

 The problem states that the sum of any two yellow numbers must be a blue number. This implies that the set of all blue numbers must form an Abelian group under the operation of addition modulo 1000. The identity element of this group is 0, and the maximum possible order of an element (the maximum cycle length in the group) is 1000. The only Abelian groups of order 1000 are cyclic groups of order 1000 (Z_1000), which means that all non-negative integers modulo 1000 form an Abelian group under addition modulo 1000.
The maximum possible number of yellow numbers is half the number of elements in the group, because in any group of order n, the number of elements of each order divides n, and the sum of the orders of all elements in a group is equal to n. In this case, n = 1000, and the only divisors of 1000 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, 25, 40, 50, 100, 125, 200, 250, 500, and 1000. The only value of n that allows for the number of elements in each order to be an integer is n = 1000.
Therefore, the maximum possible number of yellow numbers is half the number of elements in the group, which is 500. However, this is not possible because the number of yellow numbers must be less than or equal to the number of blue numbers.
The only other possible value for n that allows for the number of elements in each order to be an integer is n = 250. However, this would mean that there would be 125 yellow numbers and 125 blue numbers, which does not satisfy the condition that the number of yellow numbers must be less than or equal to the number of blue numbers.
The only remaining possibility is n = 125, which means there are 625 blue numbers and 625 yellow numbers. This satisfies the condition that the number of yellow numbers must be less than or equal to the number of blue numbers.
Therefore, the maximum possible number of yellow numbers is 625. The answer is: 625

The constraints of the problem are as follows:
- Each of the three-digit numbers from 111 to 999 is colored either blue or yellow.
- The sum of any two yellow numbers is a blue number.

We want to find the maximum number of yellow numbers that can be colored under these conditions.

Let's consider the numbers from 111 to 999. The total number of these numbers is $999 - 111 + 1 = 899$. Let's denote the maximum number of yellow numbers as $y$. Then the number of blue numbers is also $y$ since each blue number is the sum of two yellow numbers. So the total number of numbers, $2y$, should not exceed 899, i.e., $2y \leq 899$. Therefore, the maximum number of yellow numbers $y$ is at most $\frac{899}{2} = 449.5$. Since the number of yellow numbers must be an integer, we have $y \leq 449$.

Now we need to check if it's possible to have $449$ yellow numbers. We can construct a set of 449 yellow numbers as follows:

$$\{111, 112, 113, \dots, 119, 121, 122, \dots, 128, 131, \dots, 137, \dots, 191, \dots, 199, 212, \dots, 299, \dots, 999\}$$

It can be verified that the sum of any two numbers in this set does not exceed 999 and is still a member of this set or a blue number.

Therefore, the maximum number of yellow numbers is $449$. The answer is: $449$

 Let's denote the number of yellow numbers as $y$ and the number of blue numbers as $b$.

From the problem, we know that every sum of two yellow numbers is a blue number. This means that for every pair of yellow numbers, their sum is a blue number. Therefore, we have the inequality $y(y-1)/2 \leq b$. This is because each pair of yellow numbers gives a unique blue number when added together, and the total number of pairs of $y$ items is $y(y-1)/2$.

The total number of three-digit numbers is $999 - 111 + 1 = 890$, which is the number of blue numbers. So we have $b = 890$.

We want to maximize the number of yellow numbers $y$, subject to the inequality $y(y-1)/2 \leq 890$. 

To find the maximum value of $y$, we can start by rearranging the inequality $y(y-1)/2 \leq 890$ to get $y^2 - y - 2*890 \leq 0$.

This is a quadratic equation in $y$, and we can solve it to find the maximum value of $y$. The solutions to the quadratic equation $y^2 - y - 2*890 = 0$ are given by the quadratic formula $y = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 4*2*890}}{2} = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{7121}}{2} = \frac{1 \pm 84.97}{2}$.

Since $y$ must be a natural number, we only consider the positive root of the square root, which gives us $y = \frac{1 + 84.97}{2} = \frac{85.97}{2} = 42.985$.

However, $y$ must be an integer, so we take the integer part of $42.985$ which is $43$. But this is not a valid solution because $43(43 - 1)/2 = 903.5$, which is greater than $890$. Therefore, $y$ must be less than $43$.

Let's try $y = 42$. Then $42(42 - 1)/2 = 861$, which is greater than $890$, so $y$ cannot be $42$.

Let's try $y = 41$. Then $41(41 - 1)/2 = 820$, which is less than $890$. So $y = 41$ is the maximum value that satisfies the inequality $y(y-1)/2 \leq 890$.

Therefore, the maximum possible number of yellow numbers is $41$. The answer is: $41$

 To solve this problem, we first need to understand the given conditions. The sum of any two yellow numbers must be a blue number. This implies that the set of blue numbers must contain all possible sums of pairs of yellow numbers.

The minimum and maximum possible blue numbers are $111+111=222$ and $999+999=1998$, respectively. So, the blue numbers are the integers from 222 to 1998, inclusive. The total number of blue numbers is therefore $1998-222+1=1777$.

Now, let's consider the maximum number of yellow numbers. If we choose one yellow number, then the sum of this yellow number with any other yellow number must be a blue number. Therefore, choosing more than one yellow number would necessarily lead to some blue numbers being the sum of two different yellow numbers, violating the given conditions.

So, the maximum number of yellow numbers is 1. But this does not seem to satisfy the condition that the sum of any two yellow numbers is a blue number.

To resolve this, let's consider choosing two yellow numbers, say $a$ and $b$, with $a < b$. The sum of $a$ and $b$ can be anywhere from $2a$ to $2b$. If we choose $a = 222$ and $b = 1998$, then the sum of $a$ and $b$ is exactly 2220, which is outside the range of blue numbers.

This means that the sum of any two yellow numbers cannot be a blue number. However, we can try to find a set of yellow numbers that maximizes the number of blue numbers that can be the sum of two different yellow numbers.

We can start with one yellow number, say $a = 222$. Then the sum of any other yellow number and $a$ must be a blue number. The largest yellow number that works is $b = 999$, because the sum of $a$ and $b$ is 1221, which is the smallest blue number greater than $a + b$.

So, we can choose $a = 222$ and $b = 999$ as yellow numbers, and all blue numbers in the range from $2a = 444$ to $2b = 1998$ can be expressed as the sum of two different yellow numbers. The number of such blue numbers is $1998 - 444 + 1 = 1555$.

Since the sum of any two yellow numbers must be a blue number, the number of blue numbers that can be the sum of two different yellow numbers must be at least half of the total number of blue numbers, or 777.5. But the number of blue numbers that we found, 1555, is more than this, so our choice of yellow numbers is valid.

Therefore, the maximum number of yellow numbers is 2. The answer is: $2$

 The problem states that the sum of any two yellow numbers should be a blue number. This means that the set of all possible sums of two yellow numbers should be a subset of the set of all blue numbers. 

The smallest blue number is 111 + 111 = 222 and the largest is 999, so there are 787 possible blue numbers (from 222 to 999).

Now, we want to find the maximum number of yellow numbers that can be chosen such that the sum of any two of them is a blue number. This is a classic combinatorics problem that can be solved using the Pigeonhole Principle.

The Pigeonhole Principle states that if there are $n$ pigeonholes and $n+1$ pigeons, at least one pigeonhole must contain more than one pigeon.

In this case, the pigeonholes are the blue numbers, and the pigeons are the yellow numbers. We want to find the maximum number of pigeons (yellow numbers) such that each pigeonhole (blue number) contains at most one pigeon (yellow number).

The number of pigeonholes (blue numbers) is 787. By the Pigeonhole Principle, the maximum number of pigeons (yellow numbers) is 787.

Therefore, the maximum possible number of yellow numbers is 787. The answer is: $787$

 The problem states that the sum of any two yellow numbers must be a blue number. This means that if we have $n$ yellow numbers, the sum of any two of them must be one of the $n$ yellow numbers or a blue number. Therefore, the set of all possible sums of two yellow numbers must be a subset of the set of all yellow and blue numbers.

The set of all possible sums of two three-digit numbers from 111 to 999 is the set of numbers from 222 to 1998. This set has 1777 numbers.

If we have $n$ yellow numbers, the set of all possible sums of two yellow numbers has at most $\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ numbers (this is the number of combinations of $n$ items taken two at a time). Therefore, we must have $\frac{n(n+1)}{2} \leq 1777$.

To find the maximum value of $n$ that satisfies this inequality, we can solve the equation $\frac{n(n+1)}{2} = 1777$. Multiplying both sides by 2 gives $n^2 + n = 3554$. Rearranging terms, we get $n^2 + n - 3554 = 0$.

Using the quadratic formula, we find that $n = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{1 + 4 \cdot 3554}}{2} = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{14217}}{2}$. 

Since $n$ must be a natural number, we take the positive root and round down to the nearest integer, which gives $n = 62$.

Therefore, the maximum possible number of yellow numbers is 62. The answer is: $62$
