 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.
The first expression is zero when either $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
The second expression is zero when either $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The solutions to these equations are the vertices of a square with side length 10 and diagonals of length 16 (from the Pythagorean theorem).
To find the area of the square, we simply square the length of one side, so the area is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

The given equation is of the form $A \cdot B = 0$, which implies that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the given equation is satisfied if either of the following conditions hold:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first condition to be true, both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$, which gives us four lines in the plane: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

For the second condition to be true, both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$, which gives us four lines in the plane: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 10 (from the lines $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$), and a smaller square with side length 8 (from the lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$).

The area of the larger square is $10^2 = 100$ square units, and the area of the smaller square is $8^2 = 64$ square units.

The area of the convex polygon formed by the intersection of these lines is the difference of the areas of these two squares, which is $100 - 64 = 36$ square units.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 36 square units.

Here is a Python function to calculate the area of the polygon:

```python

    side_length_large_square = 10

The area of the convex polygon is 36 square units. The answer is $\boxed{36}$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

The given equation is equal to zero if and only if both the factors are equal to zero. This means that we have two separate systems of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first system, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$. This gives us the following four equations:
- $x + y = 10$ and $x = 8$
- $x + y = 10$ and $x = -8$
- $-(x + y) = 10$ and $x = 8$
- $-(x + y) = 10$ and $x = -8$

Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon:
- $(8, 2)$, $(8, -18)$
- $(-8, 18)$, $(-8, -2)$

For the second system, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us the following four equations:
- $x - y = 10$ and $y = 8$
- $x - y = 10$ and $y = -8$
- $-(x - y) = 10$ and $y = 8$
- $-(x - y) = 10$ and $y = -8$

Solving these equations, we get the same vertices of the polygon:
- $(8, 2)$, $(8, -18)$
- $(-8, 18)$, $(-8, -2)$

Thus, the polygon is a rectangle with sides of length 16 and 32. The area of the rectangle is $16 \times 32 = 512$. The answer is: $512$

The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. For this equation to be true, either one of the two factors must be zero. If either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two lines passing through the origin at a 45-degree angle to the x and y axes, respectively. If either $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$, which are the equations of two lines parallel to the x and y axes at a distance of 8 units from the origin. The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 10 (the distance from the origin to the lines $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$) and a side length of 8 (the distance from the origin to the lines $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$). The area of this square is $10 \times 10 = 100$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units. The answer is: $100$

The given equation is of the form $AB = 0$, which implies that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the points that satisfy the equation are those that make either of the two factors equal to zero.

The factors are $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$, and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2$. The first two factors being zero means that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which are the equations of two lines passing through the origin with slopes of $+1$ and $-1$. The second two factors being zero means that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which are the equations of two lines passing through the origin with slopes of $+1$ and $-1$. The intersection points of these lines form a square with side length $16$.

The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256.
The answer is: $256$

 The given equation is equivalent to the product of two terms being zero, which means each term must be zero. This gives us the following systems of equations:

1. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10$
2. $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x - y \vert = 10$
3. $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8$
4. $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert y \vert = 8$

The solutions to these equations are:

1. $x + y = \pm 10$
2. $x - y = \pm 10$
3. $x = \pm 8$
4. $y = \pm 8$

These equations define a square with side length 16 (since the distance between the points $(8, 0)$ and $(-8, 0)$ is 16). The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, which means that either one of the terms must be zero. So, we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, or $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length 10.

For the second case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, or $y = -8$. These lines also form a square with side length 16.

The intersection of these two squares is a smaller square with side length 8. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $8^2 = 64$. The answer is: $64$

 The problem involves finding the area of a polygon that is enclosed by the points that satisfy the equation. The equation is given as:

$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$

The expression equals zero if either of the two terms equals zero. This gives us two sets of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first set of equations, $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us a square with side length 16 centered at the origin.

For the second set of equations, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This also gives us a square with side length 16 centered at the origin.

So the points that satisfy the equation form two squares that share the same center and vertices. The area of the convex polygon formed by the union of these two squares is the sum of their areas.

The area of a square is given by side length squared. Since each square has a side length of 16, the area of each square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $2 \times 256 = 512$. The answer is: $512$

The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.
The first expression is zero when both $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x-y| - 10 = 0$. This implies that $|x+y| = 10$ and $|x-y| = 10$.
The second expression is zero when both $|x| - 8 = 0$ and $|y| - 8 = 0$. This implies that $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$.
The solutions to these equations are:
1. For the first expression, $x+y = \pm 10$ and $x-y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives the vertices of the square with side length 10: $(5, 5)$, $(5, -5)$, $(-5, -5)$, $(-5, 5)$.
2. For the second expression, $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives the vertices of the square with side length 16: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$.
The convex polygon formed by the union of these two squares is a larger square with side length 18 (the maximum of 10 and 16).
To find the area of the square, we use the formula for the area of a square, which is the side length squared. So the area is $18^2 = 324$.
The answer is: $324$

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so it is equal to zero if and only if at least one of the expressions is zero. This gives us two separate conditions:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From condition 1, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These conditions imply that $x = 0$ and $y = 0$.

From condition 2, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These conditions imply that the points $(x, y)$ lie on a square with side length 16.

Therefore, the points satisfying the given equation are the vertices of a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

The answer is: $256$.

This problem seems to be a bit of a trick question, as the equation given is actually not an equation that can be solved directly to find the points that satisfy it. Instead, the equation is set to be equal to zero, which means that the product of two terms is zero if and only if at least one of the terms is zero. This gives us two separate equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From equations 3 and 4, we can see that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. 

From equations 1 and 2, we can see that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us four more equations:

5. $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$
6. $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$

Solving these four equations with $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$, we find that the points that satisfy the original equation are:

$(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(2, 8)$, $(-2, 8)$, $(2, -8)$, and $(-2, -8)$.

These points form a square with side length 10, so the area of the square is $10 \times 10 = 100$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100.
