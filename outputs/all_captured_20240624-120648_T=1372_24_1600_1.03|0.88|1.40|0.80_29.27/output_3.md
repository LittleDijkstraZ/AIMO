Assistant:

 The equation is satisfied if and only if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, or both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This means that either $|x+y| = 10$ and $|x-y| = 10$, or $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$.

The first set of equations implies that $x+y = \pm 10$ and $x-y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives four lines: $y = -x$, $y = x$, $y = -x + 20$, and $y = x - 20$.

The second set of equations implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives four more lines: $y = 8$, $y = -8$, $x = 8$, and $x = -8$.

Plotting these eight lines on the coordinate plane, we find that they enclose a square with side length 20. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 400.

The answer is: $400$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The equation $AB = 0$ implies that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The first equation implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, -2)$, and $(-8, 2)$.
The second equation implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$.
The combined solution is the union of these two squares, which forms a larger square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$. The area of this square is $(10\sqrt{2})^2 = 200$.
The answer is: $200$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 This problem is a bit tricky to solve directly, so let's take a step back and think about the equation given. The equation is of the form $AB=0$, which means that either $A=0$ or $B=0$. So we need to find the areas of the regions where each of the terms in the equation equals zero.

The terms $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ are zero when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two lines forming a cross shape.

The terms $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2$ are zero when $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two circles centered at the origin with a radius of 8.

Now we need to find the area of the convex polygon enclosed by these shapes. The cross shape formed by the lines intersects the circles at the points where the lines intersect the circles. These intersection points are the vertices of the polygon.

To find the vertices, we can solve the system of equations formed by the lines and the circles. The vertices are the points where the lines intersect the circles, which are four points: $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

The polygon formed by these vertices is a square with side length 16. The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of this polygon is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

The given equation is a product of two terms equals to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

The first term is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, and it equals to zero if and only if both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. 

The second term is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$, and it equals to zero if and only if both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

From $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, we can infer that the points lie on a square with side length $20$.

From $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, we can infer that the points lie on a square with side length $16$.

The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for. The side length of this polygon is the smaller side length, which is $16$.

The area of a square with side length $a$ is $a^2$, so the area of the convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$.

So the answer is $\boxed{256}$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The equation given is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. For the product of two numbers to be zero, either one of the numbers must be zero. Therefore, we have two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From case 1, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $-10 \leq x + y \leq 10$, $-8 \leq x \leq 8$, and $-8 \leq y \leq 8$. The solution set for this case forms a square with side length 16.

From case 2, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $-10 \leq x - y \leq 10$, $-8 \leq x \leq 8$, and $-8 \leq y \leq 8$. The solution set for this case also forms a square with side length 16.

The convex polygon formed by the union of the solution sets for both cases is a square with side length 16. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These two equations mean that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations gives the vertices of the square as $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$.

Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these four equations gives the vertices of the square as $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The vertices of the convex polygon are the intersection of the solutions to these two equations, which are the points $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The convex polygon formed by these vertices is a square with side length $16$. To find the area of this square, we use the formula for the area of a square, which is the side length squared. Therefore, the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the square as $(8, 2), (8, -2), (-8, -2), (-8, 2)$.

Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the square as $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, -8), (-8, 8)$.

The convex polygon formed by the intersection of these two squares is also a square, with side length equal to the diagonal of the smaller square. The diagonal of a square with side length 8 (the side length of the smaller square) is $\sqrt{8^2 + 8^2} = \sqrt{128} = 8\sqrt{2}$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $(8\sqrt{2})^2 = 128$.

The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. This equation is equal to 0 if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

This means that the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equation must satisfy either $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The lines $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$ are the sides of a square with side length 10.

The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$

To solve this problem, we first need to understand the conditions given in the equation. The equation is equal to zero if and only if either of the two products in the equation is zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The solutions to these equations are:
1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$
2. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$
3. $\vert x \vert = 8$
4. $\vert y \vert = 8$
These equations represent four lines in the coordinate plane. The first two equations represent lines with slope 1 and -1, passing through the point (0, 10) and (0, -10) respectively. The last two equations represent lines parallel to the x and y axes, passing through the points (8, 0) and (0, 8) respectively.

The four lines enclose a square with side length 16. To find the area of this square, we simply square the length of one of its sides. Therefore, the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$
