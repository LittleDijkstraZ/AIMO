 The problem involves finding the minimum value of a function $f(x, y) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ under the constraint $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$.

To solve this problem, we can first rewrite the constraint as $x - 2y + y - 2x = \pm 40$, which simplifies to $-x - y = \pm 40$ or $x + y = \pm 40$. 

Now we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. Define a new function $g(x, y, \lambda) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy - \lambda((x + y) - 40)$ if $x + y = 40$ and $g(x, y, \lambda) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy - \lambda((x + y) + 40)$ if $x + y = -40$.

To find the critical points, we take the partial derivatives of $g$ with respect to $x$, $y$, and $\lambda$ and set them equal to zero. This gives us the following system of equations:

1. $10x - 8y - \lambda = 0$
2. $10y - 8x - \lambda = 0$
3. $x + y - 40 = 0$ or $x + y + 40 = 0$

Solving this system of equations for $x$ and $y$ is quite involved, but it eventually leads to the solution $(x, y) = (20, 20)$. Substituting these values into the function $f(x, y)$ gives us the minimum value:

$f(20, 20) = 5(20)^2 + 5(20)^2 - 8(20)(20) = 2000$.

Therefore, the minimum value of the function $f(x, y) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ subject to the constraint $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$ is 2000. The answer is: $2000$

 The problem requires us to find the minimum value of the function $f(x, y) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ subject to the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.

First, let's simplify the constraint equation:
$$|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40 \implies |x-2y| = 40 - |y-2x|.$$
Squaring both sides, we get:
$$(x-2y)^2 = (40 - |y-2x|)^2.$$
Expanding the left side and simplifying the right side, we get:
$$x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2 = 1600 - 80|y-2x| + (y-2x)^2.$$
Rearranging terms and simplifying, we get:
$$5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = 1600 - 80|y-2x|.$$

Now, we know that $|y-2x|$ is always non-negative, so $80|y-2x|$ is also non-negative. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ subject to the constraint is achieved when $|y-2x| = 0$, which implies $y = 2x$. Substituting this into the constraint equation, we get:
$$|x-2(2x)| + |2x-4x| = 40 \implies |x-4x| + |2x-4x| = 40.$$
Simplifying further, we get:
$$-3x + 2x = 40 \implies -x = 40 \implies x = -40.$$
And since $y = 2x$, we have $y = 2(-40) = -80$.

Substituting these values into the function $f(x, y)$, we get:
$$f(-40, -80) = 5(-40)^2 + 5(-80)^2 - 8(-40)(-80) = 8000 + 32000 - 25600 = 14400.$$

So the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ subject to the given constraint is 14400. The answer is: $14400$.

 To solve this problem, we can use the method of completing the square and the properties of absolute value.

First, let's rewrite the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ as $|2y - x| + |2x - y| = 40$.

Now, let's consider the function $f(x, y) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$. We want to find the minimum value of this function subject to the constraint $|2y - x| + |2x - y| = 40$.

By completing the square, we can rewrite $f(x, y)$ as $f(x, y) = 5(x^2 - \frac{8}{5}xy + y^2) = 5[(x - \frac{4}{5}y)^2 + \frac{9}{5}y^2]$.

Now, let's introduce a new variable $z = x - \frac{4}{5}y$. Then, the constraint equation becomes $|2y - (z + \frac{4}{5}y)| + |2(z + \frac{4}{5}y) - y| = 40$, which simplifies to $|y - \frac{z}{2}| + |y + 2z| = 40$.

By the triangle inequality, we know that $|a| + |b| \geq |a + b|$ for all real numbers $a$ and $b$. Applying this to our equation gives us $|y - \frac{z}{2} + y + 2z| \leq 40$, which simplifies to $|3y + \frac{3}{2}z| \leq 40$.

Since $|3y + \frac{3}{2}z| \leq 40$, we know that $-40 \leq 3y + \frac{3}{2}z \leq 40$. Multiplying through by $\frac{2}{3}$ gives us $-\frac{80}{3} \leq y + \frac{z}{2} \leq \frac{80}{3}$.

Now, we want to minimize $f(z, y) = 5(z^2 + \frac{9}{5}y^2) = 5z^2 + 9y^2$. Since $y + \frac{z}{2}$ is bounded, $y$ is bounded as well. Therefore, to minimize $f(z, y)$, we should minimize $y^2$. By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we know that $(y^2 + (\frac{z}{2})^2)(1 + 1) \geq (y + \frac{z}{2})^2$. Substituting the bounds we found for $y + \frac{z}{2}$, we get $(y^2 + (\frac{z}{2})^2) \geq \frac{1600}{9}$.

Therefore, $f(z, y) \geq 5(\frac{1600}{9}) = \frac{8000}{9}$.

So, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $\frac{8000}{9}$. The answer is: $\boxed{\frac{8000}{9}}$

 This problem requires a bit of mathematical insight and manipulation to solve it programmatically. However, we can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to find the minimum value of the expression under the constraint.

By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have:
$$(1 + 4)(x^2 + y^2) \ge (x + 2y)^2$$
$$5(x^2 + y^2) \ge (x + 2y)^2$$
$$5(x^2 + y^2) \ge x^2 + 4xy + 4y^2$$
$$5x^2 + 5y^2 \ge x^2 + 4xy + 4y^2$$
$$4x^2 + y^2 - 4xy \ge 0$$
$$5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy \ge 0$$

Equality holds when $x = 2y$ or $y = 2x$. We know that $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$, so let's substitute $x = 2y$ into this equation:
$$|x - 2x| + |y - x| = 40$$
$$| -x | + |y - x| = 40$$
$$x + |y - x| = 40$$
Since $x = 2y$, we can substitute $x = 2y$ into this equation:
$$2y + |y - 2y| = 40$$
$$2y + | -y | = 40$$
$$2y + y = 40$$
$$3y = 40$$
$$y = \frac{40}{3}$$
$$x = 2y = \frac{80}{3}$$

So, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ occurs when $x = \frac{80}{3}$ and $y = \frac{40}{3}$. Let's substitute these values into the expression:
$$5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = 5\left(\frac{80}{3}\right)^2 + 5\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 - 8\left(\frac{80}{3}\right)\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)$$
$$= 5\left(\frac{6400}{9}\right) + 5\left(\frac{1600}{9}\right) - \frac{32000}{9}$$
$$= \frac{32000}{9} + \frac{8000}{9} - \frac{32000}{9}$$
$$= \frac{8000}{9}$$
$$= \frac{8000}{9}$$
The minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is $\frac{8000}{9}$. However, this value doesn't seem to be correct. Let's try another approach.

We know that $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$, and by the triangle inequality, we have:
$$|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| \ge |(x - 2y) - (y - 2x)|$$
$$|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| \ge |-x + y|$$
$$40 \ge |-x + y|$$
$$40 \ge |2y - y|$$
$$40 \ge |y|$$
$$|y| \le 40$$
$$-40 \le y \le 40$$

Now, let's substitute $x = 2y$ into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$:
$$5(2y)^2 + 5y^2 - 8(2y)y = 20y^2 + 5y^2 - 16y^2 = 19y^2$$
We want to minimize $19y^2$ subject to $-40 \le y \le 40$. Since $19y^2$ is always nonnegative, the minimum value occurs when $y$ is at its extreme values, i.e., $y = -40$ or $y = 40$. When $y = 40$, we have $x = 2y = 80$, and when $y = -40$, we have $x = 2y = -80$. Let's calculate the minimum value:
$$19y^2 = 19(-40)^2 = 19(1600) = 30400$$
$$19y^2 = 19(40)^2 = 19(1600) = 30400$$

So, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is 0, which occurs when $x = 0$ and $y = 0$. However, this solution doesn't satisfy the constraint $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ under the constraint must occur at one of the boundary points $y = -40$ or $y = 40$. Let's check these points:

When $y = 40$, we have $x = 80$, and the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ becomes:
$$5(80)^2 + 5(40)^2 - 8(80)(40) = 32000 + 8000 - 25600 = 10400$$

When $y = -40$, we have $x = -80$, and the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ becomes:
$$5(-80)^2 + 5(-40)^2 - 8(-80)(-40) = 32000 + 8000 - 25600 = 10400$$

So, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ under the constraint is 10400. The value $\frac{8000}{9}$ doesn't seem to be correct.

However, we made a mistake in our calculations. When we substitute $x = 2y$ into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$, we should get:
$$5(2y)^2 + 5y^2 - 8(2y)y = 20y^2 + 5y^2 - 16y^2 = 9y^2$$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 To solve this problem, we can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.
First, we rewrite the given condition as $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
Using the property $|a| + |b| = |a+b| + |a-b|$, we can rewrite the condition as $|x-2y+y-2x| + |x-2y-(y-2x)| = 40$, which simplifies to $|-x-y| + |x-3y| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, we have $|-x-y| + |x-3y| \geq |(-x-y) + (x-3y)| = |-4y| = 4|y|$.
So, $4|y| = 40$, which gives $|y| = 10$.
Since $|y| = 10$, we have $y = 10$ or $y = -10$.
If $y = 10$, then from the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we have $|x-20| + |10-2x| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, we have $|x-20| + |10-2x| \geq |(x-20) + (10-2x)| = |-10| = 10$.
So, we must have $|x-20| + |10-2x| = 10$.
By the triangle inequality again, we have $|x-20| + |10-2x| = 10 \geq |(x-20) + (10-2x)| = |-10| = 10$, which means equality must hold.
This implies that $x-20$ and $10-2x$ have the same sign, so we can rewrite the equation as $|x-20| = 10 - |10-2x|$.
If $x \geq 20$, then $x-20 \geq 0$, so $|x-20| = x-20$.
If $x < 20$, then $x-20 < 0$, so $|x-20| = 20 - x$.
If $10-2x \geq 0$, then $x \leq 5$, so $|10-2x| = 10 - 2x$.
If $10-2x < 0$, then $x > 5$, so $|10-2x| = 2x - 10$.
Therefore, we have two cases to consider:
1. $x \geq 20$: $x-20 = 10 - (10-2x)$, which simplifies to $x = 30$.
2. $x < 20$: $20 - x = 10 - (2x - 10)$, which simplifies to $x = 10$.
So, the possible values of $x$ are $10$ and $30$.
If $y = -10$, then we can similarly solve for $x$ using the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
We find that the possible values of $x$ are $-10$ and $-30$.
Now, we substitute these values of $x$ and $y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
1. If $x = 10$ and $y = 10$, then $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(10)^2 + 5(10)^2 - 8(10)(10) = 500 + 500 - 800 = 200$.
2. If $x = 30$ and $y = 10$, then $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(30)^2 + 5(10)^2 - 8(30)(10) = 4500 + 500 - 2400 = 2600$.
3. If $x = 10$ and $y = -10$, then $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(10)^2 + 5(-10)^2 - 8(10)(-10) = 500 + 500 + 800 = 1800$.
4. If $x = 30$ and $y = -10$, then $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(30)^2 + 5(-10)^2 - 8(30)(-10) = 4500 + 500 + 2400 = 7400$.
The minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $200$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $200$. The answer is: $200$

 To solve this problem, we first need to find the relationship between $x$ and $y$ from the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
After simplification, we find that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is equivalent to $x^2 + y^2 = 40$.
Now, we want to find the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ subject to the constraint $x^2 + y^2 = 40$.
Let's define $f(x, y) = 5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite $f(x, y)$ as $f(x, y) = 5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy = 5*40 - 8xy = 200 - 8xy$.
To minimize $f(x, y)$, we need to maximize $8xy$. From the constraint $x^2 + y^2 = 40$, we know that $x^2 + y^2 \geq 2xy$, so $8xy \leq 4(x^2 + y^2) = 4*40 = 160$.
Therefore, the maximum value of $8xy$ is 160, which occurs when $x = y = \sqrt{20}$.
Thus, the minimum value of $f(x, y)$ is $200 - 160 = 40$.
The answer is: $40$

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 To solve this problem, we first observe that the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ can be rewritten as $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2$.
This is because $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2 = x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2 + y^2 - 4xy + 4x^2 = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$.

Given the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we can apply the Triangle Inequality, which states that $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$ for all real numbers $a$ and $b$.
In this case, we have $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |(x-2y) + (y-2x)| = |x-2y+y-2x| = |-x-y| = |-(x+y)| = |x+y|$.
So, we know that $|x+y| = 40$.

Now, let's consider the expression $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2$.
Using the fact that $(a-b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2$, we can expand this expression as $(x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2) + (y^2 - 4xy + 4x^2) = 2(x^2 + y^2 - 4xy)$.

We know that $(x+y)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + 2xy$. Rearranging this equation gives $x^2 + y^2 = (x+y)^2 - 2xy$. Substituting this into our expression gives $2((x+y)^2 - 2xy - 4xy) = 2((x+y)^2 - 6xy)$.

We are given that $|x+y| = 40$, so $(x+y)^2 = 1600$. Thus, our expression becomes $2(1600 - 6xy)$.

To minimize this expression, we need to maximize the value of $xy$. From the equation $x^2 + y^2 = (x+y)^2 - 2xy$, we can solve for $xy$: $xy = \frac{(x+y)^2 - (x^2 + y^2)}{2} = \frac{1600 - (x^2 + y^2)}{2}$.

Since $x^2 + y^2 \geq 0$, the maximum value of $xy$ occurs when $x^2 + y^2 = 0$, which implies $x = y = 0$. In this case, $xy = 0$.

Substituting this into our expression gives $2(1600 - 6*0) = 3200$. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 3200.
The answer is: $3200$

The minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ subject to the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $\boxed{800}$.

Note: The SciPy's `minimize` function uses a Sequential Least Squares Programming (SLSQP) method which supports inequality and equality constraints. In this case, the constraint is an equality constraint and it is provided as a function of the variables $x$ and $y$. The constraint function must return 0 when the constraint is satisfied. The `minimize` function returns the minimum value of the objective function that satisfies the constraint.

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 To solve this problem, we can use the fact that the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is a quadratic form, and can be written in the form $ax^2+by^2-2cxy$, where $a=5$, $b=5$, and $c=-4$. The minimum value of a quadratic form $ax^2+by^2-2cxy$ subject to the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be found using the method of Lagrange multipliers.

The constraint equation can be rewritten as $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40 \Rightarrow |x-2y| = 40 - |y-2x|$. Squaring both sides, we get
\[(x-2y)^2 = (40 - |y-2x|)^2 \Rightarrow x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2 = 1600 - 80|y-2x| + y^2 - 4xy + 4x^2 \Rightarrow 3x^2 - 8xy + 3y^2 = 1600 - 80|y-2x|.\]
Now, let's introduce a new variable $\lambda$ (the Lagrange multiplier) and form the Lagrangian function:
\[L(x, y, \lambda) = 5x^2+5y^2-8xy - \lambda(3x^2 - 8xy + 3y^2 - 1600 + 80|y-2x|).\]
To find the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ subject to the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we need to find the critical points of the Lagrangian function by taking the partial derivatives with respect to $x$, $y$, and $\lambda$, and setting them equal to zero:
\[\frac{\partial L}{\partial x} = 10x - 8y - 6\lambda x + 8\lambda y = 0,\]
\[\frac{\partial L}{\partial y} = 10y - 8x - 6\lambda y + 8\lambda x + \frac{80(2x-y)}{\left|y-2x\right|} = 0,\]
\[\frac{\partial L}{\partial \lambda} = 3x^2 - 8xy + 3y^2 - 1600 + 80|y-2x| = 0.\]
Solving these equations simultaneously is quite involved and may not have a simple closed-form solution. However, we can make a reasonable guess based on the symmetry of the problem. Notice that if we let $x=2y$, the constraint equation is satisfied, and the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ simplifies to $5(x^2+y^2) - 16x^2 = -11x^2 + 5y^2$. This expression is minimized when $x=y=0$, giving a minimum value of 0.

Therefore, the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ subject to the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 0.
The answer is: $0$

Assistant:

 To solve this problem, we first need to express the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ in a simpler form.
Let's start by applying the triangle inequality: $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$, so we have $|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |(x-2y) + (y-2x)| = |-x - y| = |-(x+y)| = |x+y|$.
Since we know that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we can say $|x+y| = 40$.
Now let's consider the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite it as $5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x+y)^2 - 2xy] - 8xy = 5(40^2 - 2xy) - 8xy = 8000 - 10xy - 8xy = 8000 - 18xy$.
To minimize this expression, we need to maximize the value of $xy$.
Since $|x+y| = 40$, we can square both sides to get $(x+y)^2 = 40^2$, which simplifies to $x^2 + 2xy + y^2 = 1600$.
We also know that $x^2 + y^2 = (x+y)^2 - 2xy = 1600 - 2xy$.
Substituting this into our expression, we get $8000 - 18xy = 8000 - 18(1600 - x^2 - y^2) = 8000 - 28800 + 18(x^2 + y^2) = -20800 + 18(1600 - 2xy) = -20800 + 28800 - 36xy = 8000 - 36xy$.
To maximize $xy$, we can set the derivative of this expression with respect to $xy$ to zero: $-36 = 0$. This is not possible, so we must have found a maximum.
To find the maximum value of $xy$, we can use the fact that the product of two numbers is maximized when the numbers are equal. Since $|x+y| = 40$, the maximum value of $xy$ occurs when $x = y$. In this case, $x^2 + x^2 = 1600$, so $2x^2 = 1600$ and $x^2 = 800$. Taking the positive square root, we have $x = y = \sqrt{800} = 20\sqrt{2}$.
Substituting this back into the expression $xy$, we get $xy = (20\sqrt{2})(20\sqrt{2}) = 800$.
Finally, substituting this value back into our expression $8000 - 18xy$, we get $8000 - 18(800) = 8000 - 14400 = -6400$.
However, this value is not possible because we have assumed that $x = y$, and this would imply that $|x-2y| = 0$ and $|y-2x| = 0$, which is not possible given the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
Therefore, we must have made a mistake in our reasoning.
Let's reconsider our work.
We know that $x^2 + y^2 = 1600 - 2xy$. If we substitute this into our expression, we get $8000 - 18xy = 8000 - 18(1600 - x^2 - y^2) = 8000 - 28800 + 18(x^2 + y^2) = -20800 + 18(1600 - 2xy) = -20800 + 28800 - 36xy = 8000 - 36xy$.
To maximize $xy$, we can set the derivative of this expression with respect to $xy$ to zero: $-36 = 0$. This is not possible, so we must have made a mistake in our reasoning.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 This is a difficult problem to solve directly, so we will first try to simplify the problem. Let's define a new variable $z = x - 2y$. Then we have $y - 2x = -z$, and the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|z| + |-z| = 40$, which simplifies to $2|z| = 40$. Thus, $|z| = 20$, and $z = \pm 20$.
Now we can express $x$ and $y$ in terms of $z$: $x = 2y + z$ or $x = 2y - z$. We can substitute these expressions into the given expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ and simplify.
For the first case ($x = 2y + z$), we have:
$5(2y+z)^2+5y^2-8(2y+z)y = 20y^2 + 20yz + 5z^2 + 5y^2 - 16y^2 - 8yz = 5y^2 + 12yz + 5z^2$.
For the second case ($x = 2y - z$), we have:
$5(2y-z)^2+5y^2-8(2y-z)y = 20y^2 - 20yz + 5z^2 + 5y^2 - 16y^2 + 8yz = 5y^2 - 12yz + 5z^2$.
We can see that both expressions are the same, so we can just consider one of them. Let's consider $E = 5y^2 + 12yz + 5z^2$. Now we substitute $z = \pm 20$:
For $z = 20$, we have $E = 5y^2 + 12y(20) + 5(20)^2 = 5y^2 + 240y + 2000$.
For $z = -20$, we have $E = 5y^2 - 12y(20) + 5(20)^2 = 5y^2 - 240y + 2000$.
We can see that both cases give the same expression $E = 5y^2 \pm 240y + 2000$. Now we need to find the minimum value of this expression.
To find the minimum value of a quadratic expression $ax^2 + bx + c$, we can use the formula $x = -\frac{b}{2a}$. In our case, $a = 5$ and $b = \pm 240$. So the value of $y$ that minimizes $E$ is $y = -\frac{\pm 240}{2(5)} = \mp 24$.
Substituting $y = \mp 24$ into $E$, we get:
$E = 5(\mp 24)^2 \pm 240(\mp 24) + 2000 = 2880 \mp 5760 + 2000 = -1880$ or $960$.
Since we are looking for the minimum value, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $-1880$. However, this is not the correct answer.
Let's try a different approach.
We can rewrite the given expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x - y)^2 + 2xy] - 8xy = 5(x - y)^2 + 3xy$.
Now we need to minimize this expression under the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
Using the triangle inequality, we have $|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |(x-2y) - (y-2x)| = |x-2y - y+2x| = |3x - 3y| = 3|x-y|$.
So we have $3|x-y| = 40$, and $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$.
Now let's substitute $x-y = \frac{40}{3}$ into the expression $5(x - y)^2 + 3xy$:
$5\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 + 3xy = \frac{8000}{9} + 3xy$.
To minimize this expression, we need to minimize $3xy$.
Since $x$ and $y$ are related by $x-y = \frac{40}{3}$, we can express $y$ in terms of $x$: $y = x - \frac{40}{3}$.
Substituting this into $3xy$, we get $3x(x - \frac{40}{3}) = 3x^2 - 40x$.
To minimize this quadratic expression, we can use the formula $x = -\frac{b}{2a}$, where $a = 3$ and $b = -40$. So the value of $x$ that minimizes $3x^2 - 40x$ is $x = \frac{40}{6} = \frac{20}{3}$.
Substituting $x = \frac{20}{3}$ into $y = x - \frac{40}{3}$, we get $y = \frac{20}{3} - \frac{40}{3} = -\frac{20}{3}$.
Now we can substitute $x = \frac{20}{3}$ and $y = -\frac{20}{3}$ into the expression $\frac{8000}{9} + 3xy$:
$\frac{8000}{9} + 3\left(\frac{20}{3}\right)\left(-\frac{20}{3}\right) = \frac{8000}{9} - \frac{400}{3} = \frac{8000 - 1200}{9} = \frac{6800}{9}$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $\frac{6800}{9}$. However, this is not the correct answer either.
We made a mistake in our calculations. Let's try again.
We can rewrite the given expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x - y)^2 + 2xy] - 8xy = 5(x - y)^
