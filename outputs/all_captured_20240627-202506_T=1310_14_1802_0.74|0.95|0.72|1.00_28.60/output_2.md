**Problem:** 
"For certain ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ of real numbers, the system of equations
\[\begin{aligned} ax+by&=1 \\ x^2 + y^2 &= 50  \end{aligned}\]has at least one solution, and each solution is an ordered pair $(x,y)\,$ of integers. How many such ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ are there?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The graph of $ax+by=1$ is a line, while the graph of $x^2+y^2=50$ is a circle centered at the origin. Therefore, $(a, b)$ satisfies the conditions if and only if the line and circle intersect at least once, and they intersect only at lattice points (points with integer coordinates).

Knowing this, it makes sense to look for lattice points on the circle whose equation is $x^2+y^2=50$. Testing cases, we find that there are twelve lattice points on the circle: $(\pm 1, \pm 7)$, $(\pm 7, \pm 1)$, and $(\pm 5, \pm 5)$ (where the two $\pm$ signs in each pair are independent of each other).

There are $\tbinom{12}{2} = 66$ pairs of these points, and each pair determines a line. However, the graph of $ax+by=1$ can never pass through the origin $(0, 0)$, since if $x=y=0$, then $ax+by=0 \neq 1$. Therefore, the six pairs which consist of diametrically opposed points are invalid, since the line through them passes through the origin. This corrects our count to $66 - 6 = 60$.

In addition, for each of the twelve points, there is a line tangent to the circle at that point, so that the only solution to the system is that one point. This brings the final total to $60 + 12 = \boxed{72}$. The answer is $\boxed{72}$

Let's think step by step:
The graph of $ax+by=1$ is a line, while the graph of $x^2+y^2=50$ is a circle centered at the origin. Therefore, $(a, b)$ satisfies the conditions if and only if the line and circle intersect at least once, and they intersect only at lattice points (points with integer coordinates).

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $2$, i.e., $1<\frac{m}{100}<2$. Solving these inequalities gives $100<m<200$. The positive integers $m$ in this range are exactly the integers from $101$ to $199$, inclusive. To find the number of such integers, we subtract the smallest integer in the range from the largest and add $1$. So the number of positive integers $m$ is $199-101+1=100$.

The answer is: $\boxed{100}$.

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


To solve this problem, we need to analyze the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ and find for how many values of $m$ it has $4$ distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is a piecewise function, and it has $4$ distinct solutions when the right side $\frac{m}{100}$ falls into a specific range.

Let's start by analyzing the piecewise function:
- When $\vert x-1 \vert -2 > 0$, we have $\vert x-1 \vert > 2$, which implies $x-1 > 2$ or $x-1 < -2$, so $x > 3$ or $x < -1$. For these intervals, the equation becomes $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x-3 = \frac{m}{100}$ for $x > 3$ and $1-x-2 = \frac{m}{100}$, or $-x-1 = \frac{m}{100}$ for $x < -1$.
- When $\vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0$, we have $\vert x-1 \vert < 2$, which implies $-2 < x-1 < 2$, so $-1 < x < 3$. For this interval, the equation becomes $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = \frac{m}{100}$.

Now, let's find the range of $\frac{m}{100}$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions:
- For $x > 3$, we have $x-3 = \frac{m}{100}$, so $x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$. This gives us a solution only when $\frac{m}{100} + 3 > 3$, or $\frac{m}{100} > 0$, so $m > 0$. Also, since $x > 3$, we have $\frac{m}{100} + 3 < 4$, or $\frac{m}{100} < 1$, so $m < 100$. Therefore, $0 < m < 100$.
- For $x < -1$, we have $-x-1 = \frac{m}{100}$, so $x = -\frac{m}{100} - 1$. This gives us a solution only when $-\frac{m}{100} - 1 < -1$, or $-\frac{m}{100} < 0$, so $m > 0$. Also, since $x < -1$, we have $-\frac{m}{100} - 1 > -3$, or $-\frac{m}{100} > -2$, so $m < 200$. Therefore, $0 < m < 200$.
- For $-1 < x < 3$, we have $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = \frac{m}{100}$, so $-\vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100} - 2$. This gives us a solution only when $\frac{m}{100} - 2 < 0$, or $\frac{m}{100} < 2$, so $m < 200$. Also, since $-\vert x-1 \vert > 0$, we have $\frac{m}{100} - 2 > 0$, or $\frac{m}{100} > 2$, so $m > 200$. Therefore, $200 < m < 200$ is not possible.

Combining the ranges for $m$, we find that the equation has $4$ distinct solutions when $0 < m < 100$ or $100 < m < 200$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy this condition is the number of integers in the range $(0, 100) \cup (100, 200)$.

To find the number of integers in this range, we can simply count the number of integers in each range and add them together. The number of integers in the range $(0, 100)$ is $100 - 0 = 100$, and the number of integers in the range $(100, 200)$ is $200 - 100 = 100$. Therefore, the total number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition is $100 + 100 = 200$.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $200$.
The answer is: $\boxed{200}$

**Solution:**



To solve this problem, we first note that the equation $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if the value $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly less than 2 and strictly greater than 0. This is because the expression $| |x-1| - 2 |$ can take on values from 0 to 2, and it takes on the value $\frac{m}{100}$ exactly 4 times when $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly less than 2 and strictly greater than 0.

Therefore, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Multiplying all sides of the inequalities by 100, we get $0 < m < 200$. The number of positive integers in this range is 199. However, we must subtract 1 from this number because $m$ cannot be 0. So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is $199 - 1 = 198$.

The answer is: $198$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let \[f(x) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
-x + 3 & \text{if } x \le 0, \\
2x - 5 & \text{if } x > 0.
\end{array}
\right.\]How many solutions does the equation $f(f(x)) = 4$ have?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
To solve the equation $f(f(x)) = 4,$ we first find the values $x$ such that $f(x) = 4.$

Either $f(x) = -x + 3$ (for $x \le 0$) or $f(x) = 2x - 5$ (for $x > 0$). If $-x + 3 = 4,$ then $x = -1.$ Note that this value satisfies $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = 4,$ then $x = 9/2.$ Note that this value satisfies $x > 0.$ Therefore, the solutions to $f(x) = 4$ are $x = -1$ and $x = 9/2.$

Next, we solve for the values $x$ such that $f(x) = -1.$ If $-x + 3 = -1,$ then $x = 4.$ This value does not satisfy $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = -1,$ then $x = 2.$ This value satisfies $x > 0.$

Finally, we solve for the values $x$ such that $f(x) = 9/2.$ If $-x + 3 = 9/2,$ then $x = -3/2.$ This value satisfies $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = 9/2,$ then $x = 19/4.$ This value satisfies $x > 0.$

Therefore, the equation $f(f(x)) = 4$ has the solutions $x = 2,$ $-3/2,$ and $19/4,$ for a total of $\boxed{3}$ solutions. The answer is $\boxed{3}$

There are $\tbinom{12}{2} = 66$ pairs of these points, and each pair determines a line. However, the graph of $ax+by=1$ can never pass through the origin $(0, 0)$, since if $x=y=0$, then $ax+by=0 \neq 1$.

In addition, for each of the twelve points, there is a line tangent to the circle at that point, so that the only solution to the system is that one point. This brings the final total to $60 + 12 = \boxed{72}$. The answer is $\boxed{72}$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"For certain ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ of real numbers, the system of equations
\[\begin{aligned} ax+by&=1 \\ x^2 + y^2 &= 50  \end{aligned}\]has at least one solution, and each solution is an ordered pair $(x,y)\,$ of integers. How many such ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ are there?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The graph of $ax+by=1$ is a line, while the graph of $x^2+y^2=50$ is a circle centered at the origin. Therefore, $(a, b)$ satisfies the conditions if and only if the line and circle intersect at least once, and they intersect only at lattice points (points with integer coordinates).

Knowing this, it makes sense to look for lattice points on the circle whose equation is $x^2+y^2=50$. Testing cases, we find that there are twelve lattice points on the circle: $(\pm 1, \pm 7)$, $(\pm 7, \pm 1)$, and $(\pm 5, \pm 5)$ (where the two $\pm$ signs in each pair are independent of each other).

There are $\tbinom{12}{2} = 66$ pairs of these points, and each pair determines a line. However, the graph of $ax+by=1$ can never pass through the origin $(0, 0)$, since if $x=y=0$, then $ax+by=0 \neq 1$. Therefore, the six pairs which consist of diametrically opposed points are invalid, since the line through them passes through the origin. This corrects our count to $66 - 6 = 60$.

In addition, for each of the twelve points, there is a line tangent to the circle at that point, so that the only solution to the system is that one point. This brings the final total to $60 + 12 = \boxed{72}$. The answer is $\boxed{72}$

The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is $\boxed{1}$.

However, we made a mistake in our calculation. The equation should have 4 distinct solutions, but we are counting the number of positive integers $m$ where the equation has exactly 4 solutions. This means we need to check if the solutions to the equation are distinct for each value of $m$. 

Let's correct our code:

The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is $1$. However, this does not seem to be the correct answer. Let's think about the problem again.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when the right side of the equation (which is $\frac{m}{100}$) is equal to 1. This happens when $m=100$. So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 1, not 100. 

The mistake in our code was that we were checking if the number of solutions was exactly 4, which is not what the problem is asking for. The problem is asking for the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions, not exactly 4 solutions. 

To fix this, we need to change our code to check if the solutions to the equation are distinct for each value of $m$, and if they are, then increment the count. Let's correct our code again:

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many solutions does the equation \[\frac{(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)\dotsm(x-100)}{(x-1^2)(x-2^2)(x-3^2)\dotsm(x-100^2)} = 0\]have for $x$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Any solution to this equation must make the numerator of the left-hand side zero, while keeping the denominator non-zero. The numerator is zero when $x$ is one of the numbers $1, 2, 3, \dots, 100.$ However, for any value in this list that is a perfect square, the denominator will also be zero, so that value of $x$ will not be a root. Therefore, we want to find the number of integers in the list $1, 2, \dots, 100$ which are not perfect squares. The perfect squares in the list are $1^2, 2^2, \dots, 10^2,$ so there are $10$ perfect squares, and \[100 - 10 = \boxed{90}\]integers which are not perfect squares. The answer is $\boxed{90}$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let \[f(x) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
-x + 3 & \text{if } x \le 0, \\
2x - 5 & \text{if } x > 0.
\end{array}
\right.\]How many solutions does the equation $f(f(x)) = 4$ have?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
To solve the equation $f(f(x)) = 4,$ we first find the values $x$ such that $f(x) = 4.$

Either $f(x) = -x + 3$ (for $x \le 0$) or $f(x) = 2x - 5$ (for $x > 0$). If $-x + 3 = 4,$ then $x = -1.$ Note that this value satisfies $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = 4,$ then $x = 9/2.$ Note that this value satisfies $x > 0.$ Therefore, the solutions to $f(x) = 4$ are $x = -1$ and $x = 9/2.$

Next, we solve for the values $x$ such that $f(x) = -1.$ If $-x + 3 = -1,$ then $x = 4.$ This value does not satisfy $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = -1,$ then $x = 2.$ This value satisfies $x > 0.$

Finally, we solve for the values $x$ such that $f(x) = 9/2.$ If $-x + 3 = 9/2,$ then $x = -3/2.$ This value satisfies $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = 9/2,$ then $x = 19/4.$ This value satisfies $x > 0.$

Therefore, the equation $f(f(x)) = 4$ has the solutions $x = 2,$ $-3/2,$ and $19/4,$ for a total of $\boxed{3}$ solutions. The answer is $\boxed{3}$

**Solution:**



We need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has $4$ distinct solutions.

First, we can observe that the right-hand side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, should be a positive number, so $m$ should be a positive integer.

The number of solutions of the equation depends on the value of $\frac{m}{100}$. When $\frac{m}{100} < 2$, the equation has no solutions. When $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, the equation has $2$ solutions. When $2 < \frac{m}{100} < 3$, the equation has $4$ solutions. When $\frac{m}{100} = 3$ or $\frac{m}{100} > 3$, the equation has more than $4$ solutions.

Therefore, the only possible value of $m$ that makes the equation have $4$ distinct solutions is $m = 200$. So the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition is $1$.
The answer is: $1$

**Problem:** 
"How many distinct solutions are there to the equation $|x-7| = |x+1|$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
If $|x-7| = |x+1|$, then either $x-7 = x+1$ or $x-7 = -(x+1)$.  Simplifying $x-7=x+1$ gives $0=8$, which has no solutions, so no values of $x$ satisfy $x-7 = x+1$.  If $x-7 = -(x+1)$, then $x-7 = -x-1$, so $2x = 6$, which gives $x=3$.  So, there is $\boxed{1}$ solution.

Challenge: See if you can find a quick solution to this problem by simply thinking about the graphs of $y=|x-7|$ and $y=|x+1|$. The answer is $\boxed{1}$
