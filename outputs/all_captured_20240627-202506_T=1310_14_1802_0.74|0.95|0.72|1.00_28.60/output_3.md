**Problem:** 
"How many square units are in the area of the triangle whose vertices are the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the curve $y = (x-3)^2 (x+2)$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we need to find where this curve intersects the $x$ and $y$ axes.  If $y=0$, then $(x-3)^2(x+2)=0$, which has solutions of $x=3$ and $x=-2$.  If $x=0$, then $y=(-3)^2(2)=18$.  So, the curve has two $x$-intercepts and one $y$-intercept.  The length of the base along the $x$-axis is $3-(-2)=5$.  The height from this base is equal to the $y$-intercept, 18.  The area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 5\cdot 18=\boxed{45}$. The answer is $\boxed{45}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The equation $A \cdot B = 0$ is true if and only if either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the given equation is satisfied if and only if either $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$ or $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These conditions are satisfied by the points $(x, y)$ lying on the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$, which form a rectangle.

The equation $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These conditions are satisfied by the points $(x, y)$ lying on the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$, which form a square.

Therefore, the convex polygon is the intersection of the rectangle and the square, which is another square with side length 8. The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Five identical rectangles are arranged to form a larger rectangle $PQRS$, as shown.  The area of $PQRS$ is $4000$.  What is the length, $x$, rounded off to the nearest integer? [asy]
real x = 1; real w = 2/3;

// Draw outer square and labels
pair s = (0, 0); pair r = (2 * x, 0); pair q = (3 * w, x + w); pair p = (0, x + w);
draw(s--r--q--p--cycle);
label("$S$", s, SW); label("$R$", r, SE); label("$Q$", q, NE); label("$P$", p, NW);

// Draw other segments
draw((x, 0)--(x, w));
draw((0, w)--(2 * x, w));
draw((w, x + w)--(w, w)); draw((2 * w, x + w)--(2 * w, w));

// length labels
pair upper = (-0.1, x + w);
pair lower = (-0.1, w);
draw(lower--upper);
draw((-0.1 - 0.03, x + w)--(-0.1 + 0.03, x + w));
draw((-0.1 - 0.03, w)--(-0.1 + 0.03, w));
label("$x$", midpoint((-0.1, w)--(-0.1, x + w)), W);

pair left = (0, -0.1); pair right = (x, -0.1);
draw((0, -0.1 + 0.03)--(0, -0.1 - 0.03));
draw((x, -0.1 - 0.03)--(x, -0.1 + 0.03));
draw(left--right);
label("$x$", (x/2, -0.1), S);

[/asy]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Let $w$ be the width of each of the identical rectangles. Since $PQ=3w$, $RS=2x$ and $PQ=RS$ (because $PQRS$ is a rectangle), then $2x = 3w$, or $$w=\frac{2}{3}x.$$ Therefore, the area of each of the five identical rectangles is $$x\left(\frac{2}{3}x\right)=\frac{2}{3}x^2.$$ Since the area of $PQRS$ is 4000 and it is made up of five of these identical smaller rectangles, then $$5\left(\frac{2}{3}x^2\right)=4000$$ or $$\frac{10}{3}x^2 = 4000$$ or $x^2 = 1200$ or $x \approx 34.6$ which, when rounded off to the nearest integer, is $\boxed{35}.$ The answer is $\boxed{35}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Abs, solve

def calculate_polygon_area():
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # The equation is satisfied if either (|x + y| - 10) = 0 or (|x - y| - 10) = 0,
    # or if (|x| - 8) = 0 or (|y| - 8) = 0.
    # Therefore, the polygon is formed by the union of four lines:
    # x + y = 10, x + y = -10, x - y = 10, x - y = -10, x = 8, y = 8, x = -8, y = -8.
    # These lines form a square with side length 16.

    return 16**2

result = calculate_polygon_area()
print(result)
```

The area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is $\boxed{256}$.

## QUESTION 3 - 2

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $F_1 = (10,2)$ and $F_ 2= (-16,2).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that
\[|PF_1 - PF_2| = 24\]form a hyperbola.  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as
\[\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1.\]Find $h + k + a + b.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2).$  Thus, $h = -3$ and $k = 2.$

Also, $2a = 24,$ so $a = 12.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 26,$ so $c = 13.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 144 = 25,$ so $b = 5.$

Hence, $h + k + a + b = (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = \boxed{16}.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}$

**Problem**
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero, or the second expression is zero. 

The first expression is zero when either $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x - y| - 10 = 0$. These equations simplify to $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

The second expression is zero when either $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$. These equations simplify to $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersections of these lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$. The length of the rectangle is $16$ and the width is $16$, so the area of the rectangle is $256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $256$.

    length = 16
    width = 16

    # Calculate the area of the rectangle
    area = length * width

    return area

The area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is $\boxed{256}$.
