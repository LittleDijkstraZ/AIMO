The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

The first term is zero when $|\pm x \pm y| - 10 = 0$, which implies $|\pm x \pm y| = 10$. This equation represents a square with side length 20.

The second term is zero when $|\pm x| - 8 = 0$ or $|\pm y| - 8 = 0$, which implies $|\pm x| = 8$ or $|\pm y| = 8$. This equation represents a square with side length 16.

The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon that encloses the points that satisfy the equation. This convex polygon is a square with side length 8 (the smaller square).

The area of a square is given by the square of its side length. So, the area of the convex polygon is $8^2 = 64$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 64 square units. The answer is: $64$

 The expression $AB=0$ is true if and only if $A=0$ or $B=0$. So, the given equation is satisfied if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = \pm 10$.
From $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x - y = \pm 10$.
From $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert x \vert = 8$, which implies $x = \pm 8$.
From $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $y = \pm 8$.

These equations represent a square with side length 16 (since the distance between the lines $x + y = \pm 10$ is 16, and similarly for the other three lines).

The area of a square with side length $s$ is $s^2$. Therefore, the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero, the second term is zero, or both are zero.

The first term is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, and this equals to zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$, which gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

The second term is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$, and this equals to zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$, which gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 10 (the distance between the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$ or $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$). The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 100.

The python code to compute this is:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    side_length = 10
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 100

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
100
```
The area of the convex polygon is 100 square units. The answer is $\boxed{100}$.

To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

In order for the product of two terms to be zero, either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. This gives us two separate cases to consider.

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
This equation can only be true if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations gives us the vertices of the polygon.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This equation can only be true if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these four equations gives us the vertices of the polygon.

By analyzing both cases, we find that the polygon is a square with side length 16. To find the area of the square, we simply square the side length, which gives us $16^2 = 256$. So the area of the polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, let's understand the problem. We are given an equation and we are asked to find the area of the region that it encloses.
2. The equation is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
3. This equation is equal to zero if and only if both terms are equal to zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
4. Each of these equations implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
5. These equations represent four lines in the plane: $x + y = \pm 10$, $x - y = \pm 10$, $x = \pm 8$, and $y = \pm 8$.
6. The intersections of these lines form a rectangle with side lengths of 16 and 20.
7. The area of this rectangle is $16 \times 20 = 320$.

So the area of the region enclosed by the equation is 320. The answer is: $320$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, we notice that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to the system of equations:
   $$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0,$$
   $$(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0,$$
   $$(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0,$$
   $$(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0.$$

2. Each of these equations implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

3. Solving these equations, we get four pairs of $(x, y)$: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$. These points are the vertices of a square with side length 16.

4. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256.

The answer is: $256$
