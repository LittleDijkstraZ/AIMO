## QUESTION 2 - 3

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 To solve this problem, we first need to understand the structure of the equation. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is a double absolute value equation. The graph of this equation is a V-shape with two vertices. The distance between the two vertices determines the number of distinct solutions the equation has.

Since the equation has four distinct solutions, the distance between the two vertices should be $2$. This happens when $\frac{m}{100}=2$. 

Let's solve this equation for $m$:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import solve, symbols

def solve_for_m():
    m = symbols('m')
    equation = m/100 - 2
    solutions = solve(equation, m)
    return solutions

result = solve_for_m()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS [200]

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
[200]
```
The solution to the equation $\frac{m}{100}=2$ is $m=200$. Therefore, there is only $\boxed{1}$ positive integer $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions.
