After analyzing the problem and trying to solve it, it seems that there was an error in the code. The `abs` function is not imported from `sympy` and therefore cannot be used. This error was caused by mistakenly trying to import `abs` from `sympy`, when it was not needed and Sympy cannot import functions from other libraries.

Let's try to solve the problem without any libraries. We need to find the number of values of `m` for which the equation `||x-1|-2| = m/100` has four distinct solutions.

First, let's understand the equation. The equation `||x-1|-2| = m/100` represents the absolute value of the difference between `x` and `1`, minus `2`, equals to `m/100`.

The solutions of this equation are the values of `x` that satisfy the equation. The absolute value function `|x|` splits into two cases:

- If `x >= 0`, then `|x| = x`.
- If `x < 0`, then `|x| = -x`.

Applying these rules to the equation `||x-1|-2| = m/100`, we get two cases:

1. If `|x-1|-2 >= 0`, then `|x-1|-2 = x-1-2 = x-3`. So, the equation becomes `|x-3| = m/100`. Again, this splits into two cases:

   a. If `x-3 >= 0`, then `|x-3| = x-3`. So, the equation becomes `x-3 = m/100`.
   
   b. If `x-3 < 0`, then `|x-3| = -(x-3) = 3-x`. So, the equation becomes `3-x = m/100`.

2. If `|x-1|-2 < 0`, then `|x-1|-2 = -(x-1)-2 = -x+1-2 = -x-1`. So, the equation becomes `|-x-1| = m/100`. This splits into two cases:

   a. If `-x-1 >= 0`, then `|-x-1| = -x-1`. So, the equation becomes `-x-1 = m/100`.
   
   b. If `-x-1 < 0`, then `|-x-1| = -(x+1) = -x-1`. So, the equation becomes `-x-1 = m/100`.

From these cases, we can see that the equation `||x-1|-2| = m/100` splits into four cases, each of which is a line equation in `x`. Therefore, each case has infinitely many solutions, except possibly for some isolated points. However, since we are looking for the number of values of `m` that make the equation have four distinct solutions, we can ignore these isolated points and focus on the lines.

The four lines that correspond to the four cases are:

1. `x = 3 + m/100` (from the first case, equation `x-3 = m/100`)
2. `x = 3 - m/100` (from the first case, equation `3-x = m/100`)
3. `x = -1 + m/100` (from the second case, equation `-x-1 = m/100`)
4. `x = -1 - m/100` (from the second case, equation `-x-1 = m/100`)

The four lines intersect the x-axis at the points `m = 300`, `m = -300`, `m = 100`, and `m = -100`. These are the only points where `m` can be an integer and the equation has four distinct solutions.

Since we want the number of positive integers `m`, we count the number of positive values of `m` among `300`, `-300`, `100`, and `-100`. There are two positive values of `m`, namely `100` and `300`.

So, the equation `||x-1|-2| = m/100` has $\boxed{2}$ positive integer values of `m` that make it have four distinct solutions.

The Python code above attempts to calculate the number of positive integer values of 'm' for which the equation $| |x-1| - 2 | = m/100$ has four distinct solutions. However, the code is incomplete and it is not able to provide a correct solution. This is because the `solveset` function in Sympy is not able to handle the absolute value inside the piecewise function.

Let's solve this problem manually.

For the equation $| |x-1| - 2 | = m/100$ to have four distinct solutions, the right hand side $m/100$ must be less than $2$ since $| |x-1| - 2 |$ is at most $2$. Therefore, $m < 200$. The value $2 - m/100$ must also be greater than $0$ for the piecewise function to have two cases. Therefore, $m > 200 - 200 = 0$. So, $0 < m < 200$.

Since we need a positive integer 'm', the possible values of 'm' are $1, 2, 3, ..., 199$, of which there are $199$.

So, the number of positive integer values of 'm' for which the equation $| |x-1| - 2 | = m/100$ has four distinct solutions is $boxed{199}$.

Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 This problem involves interpreting the absolute value function and understanding how it affects the number of solutions to an equation. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be interpreted as two separate cases: $\vert x-1 \vert -2=\frac{m}{100}$ and $\vert x-1 \vert -2=-\frac{m}{100}$. 

For the first case, we have $\vert x-1 \vert=2+\frac{m}{100}$. This equation has two solutions for each value of $m$ because the right side is always positive and the absolute value on the left side splits into two separate cases. 

For the second case, we have $\vert x-1 \vert=2-\frac{m}{100}$. This equation has two solutions for each value of $m$ if $2-\frac{m}{100}>0$, or $m<200$. However, we also require that $2-\frac{m}{100}\geq0$, or $m\leq200$. So, the second case has solutions for $0\leq m < 200$.

Therefore, the total number of solutions to the original equation is the sum of the number of solutions for each case. Since each case has 2 solutions for each value of $m$, the total number of solutions is $2+2=4$. 

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{4}$.
