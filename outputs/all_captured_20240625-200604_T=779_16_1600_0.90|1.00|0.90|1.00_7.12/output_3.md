Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 We can rewrite the equation as:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ AND $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

2. The first equation implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$
3. The second equation implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$

From these equations, we can see that the points that satisfy the equation lie on the square with vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$.

This square has side length $16$, so its area is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{256}$.

Notice that in step 2, we solved the equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. These equations represent two perpendicular lines, and the intersection points of these lines are the vertices of the square.

In step 3, we found that the square has vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$.

In step 4, we calculated the side length of the square, which is $16$.

Finally, in step 5, we calculated the area of the square, which is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{256}$.
