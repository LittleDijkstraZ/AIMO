I apologize for the mistake. The problem is not solvable directly using Sympy's integration function due to the absolute value function. The absolute value function makes the problem non-linear and non-convex, which is not currently supported by Sympy's integration functions.

However, I can still analyze the problem and give an approximate numerical answer.

The given equations define a set of lines and circles in the XY plane. The intersection points of these lines and circles form the vertices of the polygon. 

The equation $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ represents a line passing through origin and $(10, 0), (-10, 0), (0, 10), (0, -10)$. 

The equation $|x-y| - 10 = 0$ represents a line passing through origin and $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0)$. 

The equation $|x| - 8 = 0$ represents a pair of lines $x = 8, x = -8$.

The equation $|y| - 8 = 0$ represents a pair of lines $y = 8, y = -8$.

The polygon formed by these lines and circles is a regular octagon with side length 16 units. The area of a regular octagon of side length $a$ is given by $\frac{2a^2}{\sqrt{2}}$.

Substituting $a = 16$ into the formula, the area of the octagon is approximately $\boxed{256}$ square units.
