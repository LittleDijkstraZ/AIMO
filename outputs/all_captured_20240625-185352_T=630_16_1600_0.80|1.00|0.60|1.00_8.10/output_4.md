 To solve this problem, we can use a recursive approach. First, we need to define the function $f(n)$ based on the given conditions. 

Let's start by applying the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. We can substitute $f(f(n))$ into the second condition to get $f(2f(f(n)))=2f(f(n))+1$. Now, we can substitute $8n-7$ into this equation to get $f(2(8n-7))=2(8n-7)+1$. Simplifying this equation gives us $f(16n-14)=16n-5$. 

Now, we can compare this equation with the first given condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. We can see that $f(f(f(n)))$ and $f(16n-14)$ have the same form. Therefore, we can conclude that $f(f(n))=16n-14$. 

Now, we can substitute $f(n)$ into the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to get $f(2f(n))=2f(n)+1$. Substituting $16n-14$ into this equation gives us $f(2(16n-14))=2(16n-14)+1$. Simplifying this equation gives us $f(32n-28)=32n-27$. 

Now, we can compare this equation with the first given condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. We can see that $f(32n-28)$ and $f(f(f(n)))$ have the same form. Therefore, we can conclude that $f(f(f(n)))=32n-28$. 

Now, we can find the value of $f(100)$ by solving the equation $f(f(f(n)))=32n-28$ for $n=100$. This gives us $f(f(f(100)))=3200-28=3172$. 

However, we are interested in the value of $f(100)$, not $f(f(f(100)))$. To find $f(100)$, we can reverse the steps we took to find $f(100)$ from $f(f(f(100)))$. 

First, we know that $f(f(100))=1600-14=1586$. 

Next, we know that $f(100)=1600-14=1586$. 

Therefore, the value of $f(100)$ is $\boxed{1586}$.

 To find $f(100)$, we can start by plugging in $n=50$ into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to get $f(100)=2f(50)+1$. Then, we can use the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to find $f(50)$ by plugging in $n=25$, which gives us $f(50)=8(25)-7=197$. Finally, we can plug $f(50)=197$ back into the equation $f(100)=2f(50)+1$ to get $f(100)=2(197)+1=395$. Therefore, $f(100)=\boxed{395}$.

However, this solution requires knowing $f(50)$ in advance. Is there a way to find $f(100)$ without knowing $f(50)$?

Let's try to find a pattern in the function $f(n)$. From the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we can see that $f(n)$ is a function that triples its argument and subtracts 2. So, let's try to see if this pattern holds for $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.

Plugging in $n=1$ into the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we get $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1$. Since $f(1)$ is the input that triples and subtracts 2 to get 1, we have $f(1)=3(1)-2=1$.

Now, plugging in $n=2$ into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we get $f(4)=2f(2)+1$. Since $f(2)$ is the input that triples and subtracts 2 to get $f(1)$, we have $f(4)=2(3(2)-2)+1=8$.

Finally, plugging in $n=4$ into the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we get $f(f(f(4)))=8(4)-7=21$. Since $f(4)$ is the input that triples and subtracts 2 to get 8, we have $f(4)=3(8)-2=22$.

However, plugging in $n=4$ into the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ gives us $f(f(f(4)))=8(4)-7=21$, but plugging in $n=4$ into the equation $f(4)=2f(2)+1$ gives us $f(4)=2(3(4)-2)+1=21$. These two values do not match, which means that the function $f(n)$ does not only triple its argument and subtract 2.

Therefore, there is no way to find $f(100)$ without knowing $f(50)$ from the given equations. The only way to find $f(100)$ is by plugging in $n=50$ into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to get $f(100)=2f(50)+1$ and then plugging in $n=25$ into the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to get $f(50)=197$, which gives us $f(100)=395$. The answer is $\boxed{395}$.

    # Since f(f(f(n)))=8n-7, we have f(f(100)) = 8*100 - 7 = 793
    # Now we need to find f(793) = f(f(f(100))). From the second condition, f(2n)=2f(n)+1,
    # we have f(2*396) = 2*f(396) + 1. So, f(792) = 2*f(396) + 1. 
    # However, we don't have the value of f(396) directly. 
    # But we know that f(f(f(396))) = 8*396 - 7 = 3167.

To solve this problem, we can use Python to iterate through the function and find the value of $f(100)$.

Since $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we can iterate through the function thrice to get the value of $f(n)$ when $n=100$. 

Also, since $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can use this relationship to find the value of $f(n)$ when $n=50$, then when $n=25$, and finally when $n=100$. 

Here is the Python code to do this:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def find_f_of_100():
    # Function to find f(f(f(n)))
    def fff(n):
        return 8*n - 7

    # Function to find f(2n)
    def f_2n(n):
        return 2 * n + 1

    # Iterate through the function thrice
    n = 100
    for _ in range(3):
        n = fff(n)

    return n

result = find_f_of_100()
print(result)
```
