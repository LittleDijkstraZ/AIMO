 This problem was inspired by the Russian Mathematical Olympiad problem 2017-2. 

We will use Python to solve this problem. First, we need to import the required libraries, such as `sympy`, to perform symbolic computations.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This equation is equal to zero if and only if one of the factors is zero. 

The factors are $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$, and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2$. Each of these factors is a square, so they are all nonnegative. The only way for a product of nonnegative numbers to be zero is if one of the numbers is zero. 

Thus, we have four cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

In all four cases, the equality is achieved when the absolute values equal 10 or 8. This gives us the following four sets of equations:

1. $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$
2. $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$
3. $x = 8$ or $x = -8$
4. $y = 8$ or $y = -8$

Solving these systems of equations gives us the vertices of the polygon:

1. $(5, 5)$, $(5, -5)$, $(-5, 5)$, and $(-5, -5)$
2. $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, and $(0, -10)$
3. $(8, 0)$ and $(-8, 0)$
4. $(0, 8)$ and $(0, -8)$

The first two sets of vertices form a square with side length 10, and the last two sets form two squares with side length 8. The total area of the four squares is $10^2 + 2 \cdot 8^2 = 100 + 128 = \boxed{228}$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 To solve this problem, we can use the property of absolute values that $\vert x \vert = 0$ if and only if $x = 0$. Therefore, we can split the equation into two cases:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
This implies that $x + y = 10$ and $x = \pm 8$.

Case 2: $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
This implies that $x - y = 10$ and $y = \pm 8$.

Now, we can analyze these cases:

Case 1: $x + y = 10$ and $x = \pm 8$
Substituting $x = \pm 8$ into the equation $x + y = 10$, we get $y = 10 - x = 10 - 8 = 2$ for $x = 8$ and $y = 10 - x = 10 - (-8) = 18$ for $x = -8$. So, we have two points $(8, 2)$ and $(-8, 18)$.

Case 2: $x - y = 10$ and $y = \pm 8$
Substituting $y = \pm 8$ into the equation $x - y = 10$, we get $x = y + 10 = 8 + 10 = 18$ for $y = 8$ and $x = y + 10 = -8 + 10 = 2$ for $y = -8$. So, we have two more points $(18, 8)$ and $(2, -8)$.

These four points $(8, 2)$, $(-8, 18)$, $(18, 8)$, and $(2, -8)$ form a rectangle whose side lengths are $18 - 2 = 16$ and $18 - (-8) = 26$. Therefore, the area of the rectangle is $16 \times 26 = 416$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{416}$.
