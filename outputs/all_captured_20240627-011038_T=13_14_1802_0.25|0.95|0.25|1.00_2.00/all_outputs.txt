**Problem:** 
"The smallest distance between the origin and a point on the parabola $y=x^2-5$ can be expressed as $\sqrt{a}/b$, where $a$ and $b$ are positive integers, and $a$ is not divisible by the square of any prime.  Find $a+b$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
By the distance formula, we are trying to minimize $\sqrt{x^2+y^2}=\sqrt{x^2+x^4-10x^2+25}$. In general minimization problems like this require calculus, but one elementary optimization method that sometimes works is completing the square.  We have $$\sqrt{x^2+x^4-10x^2+25}=\sqrt{(x^2-9/2)^2+(25-81/4)}.$$This expression is minimized when the square equals $0$, i.e. when $x=\pm 3/\sqrt{2}.$ For this value of $x$, the distance is $$\sqrt{25-\frac{81}{4}}=\frac{\sqrt{19}}{2}.$$Hence the desired answer is $\boxed{21}$. The answer is $\boxed{21}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve, sqrt

def sum_of_squares_of_distances():
    """Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"""
    x, k, l = symbols('x k l')

    # Equation of the parabola
    parabola = k*x**2 - 2*k*x + l - 4

    # Solve for x when the parabola intersects the line y = 4
    solutions = solve(parabola, x)

    # The distance between the two points of intersection is 6
    distance_formula = sqrt((solutions[1] - solutions[0])**2)
    distance_formula = distance_formula.subs(distance_formula**2, 6**2)

    # The sum of the squares of the distances from A and B to the origin
    # is the sum of the squares of the coordinates of the points of intersection
    sum_of_squares = sum([i**2 for i in solutions])

    return sum_of_squares

result = sum_of_squares_of_distances()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS (k - sqrt(k*(k - l + 4)))**2/k**2 + (k + sqrt(k*(k - l + 4)))**2/k**2

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
(k - sqrt(k*(k - l + 4)))**2/k**2 + (k + sqrt(k*(k - l + 4)))**2/k**2
```
The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $\boxed{36}$.
The answer is $\boxed{36}$.
