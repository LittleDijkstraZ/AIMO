**Problem:** 
"Let $
f(n) =
\begin{cases}
n^2+1 & \text{if }n\text{ is odd} \\
\dfrac{n}{2} & \text{if }n\text{ is even}
\end{cases}.
$

For how many integers $n$ from 1 to 100, inclusive, does $f ( f (\dotsb f (n) \dotsb )) = 1$ for some number of applications of $f$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we note that if $n$ is a positive integer, then $f(n)$ is also a positive integer.  We claim that $f ( f (\dotsb f (n) \dotsb )) = 1$ for some number of applications of $f$ only for $n = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32,$ and $64.$  (In other words, $n$ must be a power of 2.)

Note that $f(1) = 2,$ so $f(f(1)) = f(2) = 1.$  If $n > 1$ is a power of 2, it is easy to see that repeated applications of $f$ on $n$ eventually reach 1.

Suppose $n$ is an odd positive integer, where $n > 1.$  Write $n = 2k + 1,$ where $k$ is a positive integer.  Since $n$ is odd,
\[f(n) = n^2 + 1 = (2k + 1)^2 + 1 = 4k^2 + 4k + 2 = 2(2k^2 + 2k + 1).\]Since $2k^2 + 2k$ is always even, $2k^2 + 2k + 1$ is always odd (and greater than 1), so $f(n)$ can never be a power of 2 when $n$ is odd and greater than 1.

Now, suppose $n$ is even.  For example, if $n = 2^3 \cdot 11,$ then
\[f(2^3 \cdot 11) = f(2^2 \cdot 11) = f(2 \cdot 11) = f(11),\]which we know is not a power of 2.

More generally, suppose $n = 2^e \cdot m,$ where $e$ is nonnegative and $m$ is odd.  Then
\[f(2^e \cdot m) = f(2^{e - 1} \cdot m) = f(2^{e - 2} \cdot m) = \dots = f(m).\]If $m = 1,$ then $n$ is a power of 2, and the sequence eventually reaches 1.  Otherwise, $f(m)$ is not a power of 2.  We also know that $f(m)$ is odd and greater than 1, $f(f(m))$ is not a power of 2 either, and so on.  Thus, the sequence can never reach 1.

Therefore, $n$ must be one of the $\boxed{7}$ values 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, or 64. The answer is $\boxed{7}$

**Problem**
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 



We are given the function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ with two conditions:
1. $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$
2. $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$

We want to find $f(100)$.

To find $f(100)$, we can use the second condition repeatedly to express $f(100)$ in terms of $f(50)$, $f(25)$, and $f(12.5)$. Since $f$ is a function from natural numbers to natural numbers, $f(12.5)$ is not defined. Therefore, we need to find a way to express $f(25)$ and $f(50)$ in terms of values that we can compute.

We can use the second condition to express $f(2n)$ in terms of $f(n)$:
$$f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1.$$

This means that $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$. We can substitute this into the expression for $f(100)$:
$$f(100) = f(f(f(50))) = f(f(2f(25) + 1)).$$

Now we can use the first condition to express $f(f(f(n)))$ in terms of $n$:
$$f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7.$$

Setting $n = 2f(25) + 1$, we have
$$f(f(f(2f(25) + 1))) = 8(2f(25) + 1) - 7 = 16f(25) + 1.$$

Therefore, $f(100) = 16f(25) + 1$.

To find $f(25)$, we can use the second condition again:
$$f(50) = 2f(25) + 1.$$

We already know that $f(50) = f(f(f(25))) = 8(25) - 7 = 173$, so we can substitute this into the equation:
$$173 = 2f(25) + 1.$$

Solving for $f(25)$, we get
$$f(25) = \frac{173 - 1}{2} = 86.$$

Now we can substitute this back into the equation for $f(100)$:
$$f(100) = 16f(25) + 1 = 16(86) + 1 = 1376 + 1 = 1377.$$

So, $f(100) = 1377$. The answer is: $1377$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"The function $f$ is defined on the set of integers and satisfies \[f(n)= \begin{cases}  n-3 & \mbox{if }n\ge 1000 \\  f(f(n+5)) & \mbox{if }n<1000. \end{cases}\]Find $f(84)$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Denote by (1) and (2) the two parts of the definition of $f$, respectively. If we begin to use the definition of $f$ to compute $f(84)$, we use (2) until the argument is at least $1000$: \[f(84) = f(f(89)) = f(f(f(94))) = \dots = f^N(1004)\](where $f^N$ denotes composing $f$ with itself $N$ times, for some $N$). The numbers $84, 89, 94, \dots, 1004$ form an arithmetic sequence with common difference $5$; since $1004 - 84 = 920 = 184 \cdot 5$, this sequence has $184 + 1 = 185$ terms, so $N = 185$.

At this point, (1) and (2) are both used: we compute \[\begin{aligned} f^N(1004) &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-1}(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-1}(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(1000) \\ &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(997) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1002) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(999) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1004). \end{aligned}\]Repeating this process, we see that \[f^N(1004) = f^{N-2}(1004) = f^{N-4}(1004) = \dots = f^3(1004).\](The pattern breaks down for $f^k(1004)$ when $k$ is small, so it is not true that $f^3(1004) = f(1004)$.) Now, we have \[f^3(1004) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^2(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^2(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(1000) \stackrel{(1)}{=} \boxed{997}.\] The answer is $\boxed{997}$

**Solution:** 



We will start by setting $n = 1$ in the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$ to get $f(f(f(1))) = 1$. Since $f(f(f(1))) = 1$, we have $f(f(1)) = 1$ or $f(1) = 1$. 

Now, let's substitute $n = 1$ into the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2*1 + 1 = 3$.

Next, let's substitute $n = 2$ into the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to get $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2*3 + 1 = 7$.

Now, let's substitute $n = 4$ into the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$ to get $f(f(f(4))) = 8*4 - 7 = 25$. Since $f(f(f(4))) = 25$, we have $f(f(4)) = 25$ or $f(4) = 25$. But we know that $f(4) = 7$, which is a contradiction. So we must have $f(f(4)) = 25$, which implies $f(4) = 25$.

Now, let's substitute $n = 25$ into the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$ to get $f(f(f(25))) = 8*25 - 7 = 193$. Since $f(f(f(25))) = 193$, we have $f(f(25)) = 193$ or $f(25) = 193$.

Now, let's substitute $n = 25$ into the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to get $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1 = 2*193 + 1 = 387$.

Now, let's substitute $n = 50$ into the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$ to get $f(f(f(50))) = 8*50 - 7 = 393$. Since $f(f(f(50))) = 393$, we have $f(f(50)) = 393$ or $f(50) = 393$. But we know that $f(50) = 387$, which is a contradiction. So we must have $f(f(50)) = 393$, which implies $f(50) = 393$.

Now, let's substitute $n = 393$ into the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$ to get $f(f(f(393))) = 8*393 - 7 = 3139$. Since $f(f(f(393))) = 3139$, we have $f(f(393)) = 3139$ or $f(393) = 3139$.

Now, let's substitute $n = 393$ into the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to get $f(786) = 2f(393) + 1 = 2*3139 + 1 = 6279$.

Now, let's substitute $n = 786$ into the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$ to get $f(f(f(786))) = 8*786 - 7 = 6283$. Since $f(f(f(786))) = 6283$, we have $f(f(786)) = 6283$ or $f(786) = 6283$. But we know that $f(786) = 6279$, which is a contradiction. So we must have $f(f(786)) = 6283$, which implies $f(786) = 6283$.

Now, let's substitute $n = 6283$ into the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$ to get $f(f(f(6283))) = 8*6283 - 7 = 50259$. Since $f(f(f(6283))) = 50259$, we have $f(f(6283)) = 50259$ or $f(6283) = 50259$.

Now, let's substitute $n = 6283$ into the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to get $f(12566) = 2f(6283) + 1 = 2*50259 + 1 = 100519$.

Now, let's substitute $n = 12566$ into the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$ to get $f(f(f(12566))) = 8*12566 - 7 = 100519$. Since $f(f(f(12566))) = 100519$, we have $f(f(12566)) = 100519$ or $f(12566) = 100519$. But we know that $f(12566) = 100519$, which is a contradiction. So we must have $f(f(12566)) = 100519$, which implies $f(12566) = 100519$.

Now, let's substitute $n = 100519$ into the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$ to get $f(f(f(100519))) = 8*100519 - 7 = 804147$. Since $f(f(f(100519))) = 804147$, we have $f(f(100519)) = 804147$ or $f(100519) = 804147$.

Now, let's substitute $n = 100519$ into the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to get $f(201038) = 2f(100519) + 1 = 2*804147 + 1 = 1608295$.

Now, let's substitute $n = 201038$ into the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$ to get $f(f(f(201038))) = 8*201038 - 7 = 1608299$. Since $f(f(f(

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $
f(n) =
\begin{cases}
n^2+1 & \text{if }n\text{ is odd} \\
\dfrac{n}{2} & \text{if }n\text{ is even}
\end{cases}.
$

For how many integers $n$ from 1 to 100, inclusive, does $f ( f (\dotsb f (n) \dotsb )) = 1$ for some number of applications of $f$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we note that if $n$ is a positive integer, then $f(n)$ is also a positive integer.  We claim that $f ( f (\dotsb f (n) \dotsb )) = 1$ for some number of applications of $f$ only for $n = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32,$ and $64.$  (In other words, $n$ must be a power of 2.)

Note that $f(1) = 2,$ so $f(f(1)) = f(2) = 1.$  If $n > 1$ is a power of 2, it is easy to see that repeated applications of $f$ on $n$ eventually reach 1.

Suppose $n$ is an odd positive integer, where $n > 1.$  Write $n = 2k + 1,$ where $k$ is a positive integer.  Since $n$ is odd,
\[f(n) = n^2 + 1 = (2k + 1)^2 + 1 = 4k^2 + 4k + 2 = 2(2k^2 + 2k + 1).\]Since $2k^2 + 2k$ is always even, $2k^2 + 2k + 1$ is always odd (and greater than 1), so $f(n)$ can never be a power of 2 when $n$ is odd and greater than 1.

Now, suppose $n$ is even.  For example, if $n = 2^3 \cdot 11,$ then
\[f(2^3 \cdot 11) = f(2^2 \cdot 11) = f(2 \cdot 11) = f(11),\]which we know is not a power of 2.

More generally, suppose $n = 2^e \cdot m,$ where $e$ is nonnegative and $m$ is odd.  Then
\[f(2^e \cdot m) = f(2^{e - 1} \cdot m) = f(2^{e - 2} \cdot m) = \dots = f(m).\]If $m = 1,$ then $n$ is a power of 2, and the sequence eventually reaches 1.  Otherwise, $f(m)$ is not a power of 2.  We also know that $f(m)$ is odd and greater than 1, $f(f(m))$ is not a power of 2 either, and so on.  Thus, the sequence can never reach 1.

Therefore, $n$ must be one of the $\boxed{7}$ values 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, or 64. The answer is $\boxed{7}$

**Problem**
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


We are given two equations for the function $f$. We can start by substituting $n = 1$ into the second equation to find $f(2)$.

$f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.

Then we can substitute $f(2)$ into the second equation with $n = 1$ to find $f(1)$.

$f(f(1)) = 2f(1) + 1$.

But we are also given that $f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = 1$. So we can substitute $f(f(1))$ into the first equation.

$f(1) = 1$.

Now we can substitute $f(1)$ into the equation for $f(2)$ to find $f(2)$.

$f(2) = 2*1 + 1 = 3$.

Now we can use the second equation to find $f(3)$.

$f(3) = 2*2 + 1 = 5$.

And so on. We can continue this process to find $f(4)$, $f(5)$, and so on, until we find $f(100)$.

Here is a Python function that calculates $f(100)$:

```python

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"The function $f(n)$ is defined on the positive integers such that $f(f(n)) = 2n$ and $f(4n + 1) = 4n + 3$ for all positive integers $n.$  Find $f(1000).$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Consider the expression $f(f(f(a))).$  Since $f(f(a)) = 2a,$ this is equal to $f(2a).$  But taking $n = f(a)$ in $f(f(n)) = 2n,$ we get
\[f(f(f(a))) = 2f(a).\]Hence,
\[f(2a) = 2f(a)\]for all positive integers $a.$

Then
\[f(1000) = 2f(500) = 4f(250) = 8f(125).\]Taking $n = 31$ in $f(4n + 1) = 4n + 3,$ we get
\[f(125) = 127,\]so $f(1000) = \boxed{1016}.$ The answer is $\boxed{1016}$

**Solution:** 



To solve this problem, we can start by finding the value of $f(1)$. From the second condition, we have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. But from the first condition, we also have $f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = 1$, so $f(f(1)) = 1$. Then from the second condition again, we have $f(1) = 2f(1) + 1$, which implies $f(1) = -1$. However, this is a contradiction because the function $f$ is supposed to map from $\mathbb N$ to $\mathbb N$, and we cannot have a negative value.

Let's try another approach. From the first condition, we have $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. If we set $n = 1$, we get $f(f(f(1))) = 1$. Then from the second condition, we have $f(f(1)) = 2f(1) + 1$. Substituting this into the equation $f(f(f(1))) = 1$, we get $2f(1) + 1 = 1$, which implies $f(1) = 0$.

Now let's find $f(2)$. From the second condition, we have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2*0 + 1 = 1$. Then let's find $f(4)$. From the second condition, we have $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2*1 + 1 = 3$. Then let's find $f(8)$. From the second condition, we have $f(8) = 2f(4) + 1 = 2*3 + 1 = 7$.

Now let's find $f(100)$. We can write $100$ as $8*12 + 4$. Then from the second condition, we have $f(100) = 2f(8) + f(4) = 2*7 + 3 = 17$.

So the value of $f(100)$ is $17$. The answer is $\boxed{17}$.

First, let's find $f(1)$. We know that $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$, so $f(f(1))=1$ and $f(1)=1$.

Next, let's find $f(2)$. We know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, so $f(2)=2f(1)+1=2*1+1=3$.

Then, let's find $f(3)$. We know that $f(f(f(3)))=8*3-7=17$, so $f(f(3))=17$ and $f(3)=17$ because $f(3)$ cannot be less than $3$.

Next, let's find $f(6)$. We know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, so $f(6)=2f(3)+1=2*17+1=35$.

Then, let's find $f(17)$. We know that $f(f(f(17)))=8*17-7=127$, so $f(f(17))=127$ and $f(17)=127$ because $f(17)$ cannot be less than $17$.

Finally, let's find $f(100)$. We know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, so $f(100)=2f(50)+1=2(2f(25)+1)+1=2(2(2f(12.5)+1)+1)+1=2(2(2(2f(6.25)+1)+1)+1)+1=2(2(2(2(2f(3.125)+1)+1)+1)+1)+1=2(2(2(2(2(2f(1.5625)+1)+1)+1)+1)+1)+1=2(2(2(2(2(2(2f(0.78125)+1)+1)+1)+1)+1)+1)+1=2(2(2(2(2(2(2*1+1)+1)+1)+1)+1)+1)+1=2(2(2(2(2(3)+1)+1)+1)+1)+1=2(2(2(2(5)+1)+1)+1)+1=2(2(2(7)+1)+1)+1=2(2(15)+1)+1=2(31)+1=63$.

So, $f(100)=63$. The answer is: $63$

"The function $f$ is defined on the set of integers and satisfies \[f(n)= \begin{cases}  n-3 & \mbox{if }n\ge 1000 \\  f(f(n+5)) & \mbox{if }n<1000. \end{cases}\]Find $f(84)$."

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Denote by (1) and (2) the two parts of the definition of $f$, respectively. If we begin to use the definition of $f$ to compute $f(84)$, we use (2) until the argument is at least $1000$: \[f(84) = f(f(89)) = f(f(f(94))) = \dots = f^N(1004)\](where $f^N$ denotes composing $f$ with itself $N$ times, for some $N$). The numbers $84, 89, 94, \dots, 1004$ form an arithmetic sequence with common difference $5$; since $1004 - 84 = 920 = 184 \cdot 5$, this sequence has $184 + 1 = 185$ terms, so $N = 185$.

At this point, (1) and (2) are both used: we compute \[\begin{aligned} f^N(1004) &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-1}(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-1}(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(1000) \\ &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(997) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1002) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(999) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1004). \end{aligned}\]Repeating this process, we see that \[f^N(1004) = f^{N-2}(1004) = f^{N-4}(1004) = \dots = f^3(1004).\](The pattern breaks down for $f^k(1004)$ when $k$ is small, so it is not true that $f^3(1004) = f(1004)$.) Now, we have \[f^3(1004) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^2(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^2(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(1000) \stackrel{(1)}{=} \boxed{997}.\] The answer is $\boxed{997}$

To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step.

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we will first set $n = 1$ in the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$ to get $f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = 1$. Since $f(f(f(1))) = 1$, we have $f(1) = x$ for some $x$ such that $f(x) = 1$.

Now, we substitute $n = x$ in the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to get $f(2x) = 2f(x) + 1 = 2*1 + 1 = 3$. Since $f(2x) = 3$, we have $f(x) = y$ for some $y$ such that $f(y) = 3$.

From the above two equations, we have $x = y$. So, $f(1) = f(x) = y = 3$.

Now, we substitute $n = 3$ in the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to get $f(6) = 2f(3) + 1$. Since $f(1) = 3$, we have $f(3) = f(2*1 + 1) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2*3 + 1 = 7$.

Substituting $f(3) = 7$ into the equation $f(6) = 2f(3) + 1$, we get $f(6) = 2*7 + 1 = 15$.

Now, we substitute $n = 6$ in the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$ to get $f(f(f(6))) = 8*6 - 7 = 43$. Since $f(6) = 15$, we have $f(15) = 43$.

Finally, we substitute $n = 100$ in the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to get $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$. Since $f(15) = 43$, we have $f(43) = 15$.

Substituting $f(43) = 15$ into the equation $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$, we get $f(200) = 2*f(100) + 1$.

Since $f(200) = 43$, we have $43 = 2*f(100) + 1$. Solving this equation for $f(100)$, we get $f(100) = \frac{43 - 1}{2} = 21$.

So, the value of $f(100)$ is $21$. The answer is: $21$

**Solution:** 



To find $f(100)$, we can start by applying the function $f$ three times to $100$ and set it equal to $8 \cdot 100 - 7$. This gives us the equation $f(f(f(100))) = 793$.

We also know that $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. We can use this equation to find $f(f(100))$ and $f(100)$.

Let's start by finding $f(f(100))$. We know that $f(f(f(100))) = 793$, so $f(f(100)) = \frac{793 + 7}{2} = \frac{800}{2} = 400$.

Now we can find $f(100)$ by setting $f(f(100)) = 400$ and solving for $f(100)$. We know that $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, so if we let $n = f(100)$, we get $f(2f(100)) = 2f(f(100)) + 1$. Since $f(f(100)) = 400$, this becomes $f(2f(100)) = 2 \cdot 400 + 1 = 801$.

But we also know that $f(2f(100)) = f(f(f(100))) = 793$. So we have the equation $793 = 801$, which is clearly a contradiction. This means that our initial assumption that $f(f(f(100))) = 793$ was incorrect.

Let's try another approach. We know that $f(f(f(100))) = 793$, so let's try to find a value of $n$ such that $f(f(f(n))) = 793$. We can start by trying small values of $n$ and see if we find a pattern.

After trying a few values, we find that $f(f(f(1))) = 793$. So we have $n = 1$. Now we can find $f(1)$ by setting $f(f(f(1))) = 793$ and solving for $f(1)$. We know that $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, so if we let $n = 1$, we get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. But we also know that $f(f(f(1))) = 793$, so $f(f(1)) = \frac{793 + 7}{2} = \frac{800}{2} = 400$.

Now we can find $f(1)$ by setting $f(f(1)) = 400$ and solving for $f(1)$. We know that $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, so if we let $n = 1$, we get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. Since $f(f(1)) = 400$, this becomes $f(2) = 2 \cdot 400 - 1 = 799$.

But we also know that $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$, so we have the equation $2f(1) + 1 = 799$. Solving for $f(1)$, we get $f(1) = \frac{799 - 1}{2} = \frac{798}{2} = 399$.

Now we can find $f(100)$ by using the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. If we let $n = 50$, we get $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$. But we also know that $f(f(1)) = 400$, so $f(1) = \frac{400 + 7}{2} = \frac{407}{2} = 203.5$, which is not an integer. This means that our initial assumption that $f(f(f(1))) = 793$ was incorrect.

Let's try another approach. We know that $f(f(f(100))) = 793$, so let's try to find a value of $n$ such that $f(f(f(n))) = 793$. We can start by trying small values of $n$ and see if we find a pattern.

We know that $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, so if we let $n = 1$, we get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. But we also know that $f(f(f(1))) = 793$, so $f(f(1)) = \frac{793 + 7}{2} = \frac{800}{2} = 400$.

Now we can find $f(1)$ by setting $f(f(1)) = 400$ and solving for $f(1)$. We know that $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, so if we let $n = 1$, we get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. Since $f(f(1)) = 400$, this becomes $f(2) = 2 \cdot 400 - 1 = 799$.

But we also know that $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$, so we have the equation $2f(1) + 1 = 799$. Solving for $f(1)$, we get $f(1) = \frac{799 - 1}{2} = \frac{798}{2} = 399$.

Now we can find $f(100)$ by using the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. If we let $n = 50$, we get $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.

**Solution:** 



To solve this problem, we can use the second condition to find the value of $f(1)$ first. Then we can use the first condition to find the value of $f(f(f(1)))$ which is equal to $8*1-7=1$. So we can get the value of $f(1)$. After that, we can use the second condition to find the value of $f(2)$, $f(4)$, $f(8)$, $f(16)$, $f(32)$, $f(64)$, and $f(128)$, and so on, until we find the value of $f(100)$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $
f(n) =
\begin{cases}
n^2+1 & \text{if }n\text{ is odd} \\
\dfrac{n}{2} & \text{if }n\text{ is even}
\end{cases}.
$

For how many integers $n$ from 1 to 100, inclusive, does $f ( f (\dotsb f (n) \dotsb )) = 1$ for some number of applications of $f$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we note that if $n$ is a positive integer, then $f(n)$ is also a positive integer.  We claim that $f ( f (\dotsb f (n) \dotsb )) = 1$ for some number of applications of $f$ only for $n = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32,$ and $64.$  (In other words, $n$ must be a power of 2.)

Note that $f(1) = 2,$ so $f(f(1)) = f(2) = 1.$  If $n > 1$ is a power of 2, it is easy to see that repeated applications of $f$ on $n$ eventually reach 1.

Suppose $n$ is an odd positive integer, where $n > 1.$  Write $n = 2k + 1,$ where $k$ is a positive integer.  Since $n$ is odd,
\[f(n) = n^2 + 1 = (2k + 1)^2 + 1 = 4k^2 + 4k + 2 = 2(2k^2 + 2k + 1).\]Since $2k^2 + 2k$ is always even, $2k^2 + 2k + 1$ is always odd (and greater than 1), so $f(n)$ can never be a power of 2 when $n$ is odd and greater than 1.

Now, suppose $n$ is even.  For example, if $n = 2^3 \cdot 11,$ then
\[f(2^3 \cdot 11) = f(2^2 \cdot 11) = f(2 \cdot 11) = f(11),\]which we know is not a power of 2.

More generally, suppose $n = 2^e \cdot m,$ where $e$ is nonnegative and $m$ is odd.  Then
\[f(2^e \cdot m) = f(2^{e - 1} \cdot m) = f(2^{e - 2} \cdot m) = \dots = f(m).\]If $m = 1,$ then $n$ is a power of 2, and the sequence eventually reaches 1.  Otherwise, $f(m)$ is not a power of 2.  We also know that $f(m)$ is odd and greater than 1, $f(f(m))$ is not a power of 2 either, and so on.  Thus, the sequence can never reach 1.

Therefore, $n$ must be one of the $\boxed{7}$ values 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, or 64. The answer is $\boxed{7}$

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."

**Solution:** 



To solve this problem, we first need to find the value of $f(100)$ using the given conditions. We can start by substituting $n = 100$ into the second equation:
\[f(2 \cdot 100) = 2f(100) + 1.\]
This simplifies to:
\[f(200) = 2f(100) + 1.\]
Now, we can substitute $n = 200$ into the first equation:
\[f(f(f(200))) = 8 \cdot 200 - 7 = 1593.\]
And we know that $f(f(f(200))) = f(f(2f(100) + 1)) = f(2f(f(100)) + 1)$.
So we have:
\[f(2f(f(100)) + 1) = 1593.\]
Now, we can substitute $n = f(100)$ into the second equation:
\[f(2f(100)) = 2f(f(100)) + 1.\]
Let $f(100) = x$, then the equation becomes:
\[f(2x) = 2f(x) + 1.\]
And we know that $f(2x + 1) = f(2f(x) + 1)$.
So we have:
\[f(2f(x) + 1) = 1593.\]
Now, we can substitute $n = 2f(x) + 1$ into the first equation:
\[f(f(f(2f(x) + 1))) = 8(2f(x) + 1) - 7 = 16f(x) + 1.\]
And we know that $f(f(f(2f(x) + 1))) = f(f(16f(x) + 1)) = f(16f(f(x)) + 1)$.
So we have:
\[f(16f(f(x)) + 1) = 1593.\]
Now, we can substitute $n = 16f(f(x)) + 1$ into the first equation:
\[f(f(f(16f(f(x)) + 1))) = 8(16f(f(x)) + 1) - 7 = 128f(f(x)) + 1.\]
And we know that $f(f(f(16f(f(x)) + 1))) = f(128f(f(x)) + 1)$.
So we have:
\[f(128f(f(x)) + 1) = 1593.\]
Now, we can try to solve this equation for $f(x)$.
Since $f(100) = x$, we want to find the value of $x$.
We can start by setting $128f(f(x)) + 1 = 1593$, then $128f(f(x)) = 1592$, and $f(f(x)) = \frac{1592}{128} = 12.4375$.
But $f(f(x))$ must be an integer, so there must be an error in our calculations.
Let's try another approach.

We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, so we can try to find a pattern in the function $f$.
We can start by substituting $n = 1$ into the first equation:
\[f(f(f(1))) = 8 \cdot 1 - 7 = -1.\]
But $f(f(f(1)))$ must be an integer, so there must be an error in our calculations.
Let's try another approach.

We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, so we can try to find a pattern in the function $f$.
We can start by substituting $n = 1$ into the first equation:
\[f(f(f(1))) = 8 \cdot 1 - 7 = 1.\]
So we have $f(f(f(1))) = 1$.
Now, we can substitute $n = 2$ into the first equation:
\[f(f(f(2))) = 8 \cdot 2 - 7 = 9.\]
So we have $f(f(f(2))) = 9$.
Now, we can substitute $n = 3$ into the first equation:
\[f(f(f(3))) = 8 \cdot 3 - 7 = 17.\]
So we have $f(f(f(3))) = 17$.
Now, we can substitute $n = 4$ into the first equation:
\[f(f(f(4))) = 8 \cdot 4 - 7 = 27.\]
So we have $f(f(f(4))) = 27$.
Now, we can try to find a pattern in the function $f$.
We can see that $f(f(f(n))) = 1, 9, 17, 27, \dots$.
The pattern seems to be that $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$.
Now, we can substitute $n = 100$ into the first equation:
\[f(f(f(100))) = 8 \cdot 100 - 7 = 793.\]
Now, we can substitute $n = f(100)$ into the first equation:
\[f(f(f(f(100)))) = 8 \cdot f(100) - 7 = 8f(100) - 7.\]
And we know that $f(f(f(f(100)))) = f(793)$.
So we have:
\[f(793) = 8f(100) - 7.\]
Now, we can substitute $n = 793$ into the first equation:
\[f(f(f(793))) = 8 \cdot 793 - 7 = 6347.\]
And we know that $f(f(f(793))) = f(f(8f(100) - 7)) = f(6347)$.
So we have:
\[f(6347) = 8f(100) - 7.\]
Now, we can try to solve this equation for $f(100)$.
We can start by setting $6347 = 8f(100) - 7$, then $6354 = 8f(100)$, and $f(100) = \frac{6354}{8} = 794.25$.
But $f(100)$ must be an integer, so there must be an error in our calculations.
Let's try another approach.

We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, so we can try to find a pattern in the function $f$.
We can start by substituting $n = 1$ into the first equation:
\[f(f(f(1))) = 8 \cdot 1 - 7 = 1.\]
So we have $f(f(f(1))) = 1$.
Now, we can substitute $n = 2$ into the first equation:
\[f(f(f(2))) = 8 \cdot 2 - 7 = 9.\]
So we have $f(f(f(2))) = 9$.
Now, we can substitute $n

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"The function $f$ is defined on the set of integers and satisfies \[f(n)= \begin{cases}  n-3 & \mbox{if }n\ge 1000 \\  f(f(n+5)) & \mbox{if }n<1000. \end{cases}\]Find $f(84)$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Denote by (1) and (2) the two parts of the definition of $f$, respectively. If we begin to use the definition of $f$ to compute $f(84)$, we use (2) until the argument is at least $1000$: \[f(84) = f(f(89)) = f(f(f(94))) = \dots = f^N(1004)\](where $f^N$ denotes composing $f$ with itself $N$ times, for some $N$). The numbers $84, 89, 94, \dots, 1004$ form an arithmetic sequence with common difference $5$; since $1004 - 84 = 920 = 184 \cdot 5$, this sequence has $184 + 1 = 185$ terms, so $N = 185$.

At this point, (1) and (2) are both used: we compute \[\begin{aligned} f^N(1004) &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-1}(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-1}(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(1000) \\ &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(997) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1002) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(999) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1004). \end{aligned}\]Repeating this process, we see that \[f^N(1004) = f^{N-2}(1004) = f^{N-4}(1004) = \dots = f^3(1004).\](The pattern breaks down for $f^k(1004)$ when $k$ is small, so it is not true that $f^3(1004) = f(1004)$.) Now, we have \[f^3(1004) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^2(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^2(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(1000) \stackrel{(1)}{=} \boxed{997}.\] The answer is $\boxed{997}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
**Problem**
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we will use the second condition $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to find the value of $f(100)$.

First, we can find the value of $f(50)$ using the second condition: $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.

Next, we can find the value of $f(25)$ using the second condition: $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.

We can continue this process until we reach $f(1)$, which is given by the first condition: $f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = 1$. So $f(1) = 1$.

Now we can work our way back up:

$f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2*1 + 1 = 3$.

$f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2*3 + 1 = 7$.

$f(8) = 2f(4) + 1 = 2*7 + 1 = 15$.

$f(16) = 2f(8) + 1 = 2*15 + 1 = 31$.

$f(32) = 2f(16) + 1 = 2*31 + 1 = 63$.

$f(64) = 2f(32) + 1 = 2*63 + 1 = 127$.

$f(128) = 2f(64) + 1 = 2*127 + 1 = 255$.

$f(256) = 2f(128) + 1 = 2*255 + 1 = 511$.

Now we can find $f(50)$: $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1 = 2f(f(f(25))) = 2f(f(f(2*25))) = 2f(f(f(50))) = 2f(7*2^5 - 7) = 2f(127) = 2*127 = 254$.

And finally, $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2*254 + 1 = 509$.

However, this result contradicts the first condition $f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = 1$. This means that we made a mistake in our calculations. Let's go back and check our work.

We found that $f(1) = 1$, $f(2) = 3$, $f(4) = 7$, $f(8) = 15$, $f(16) = 31$, $f(32) = 63$, $f(64) = 127$, $f(128) = 255$, and $f(256) = 511$.

Now let's check if these values satisfy the first condition:

$f(f(f(1))) = f(f(1)) = f(3) = 9$, which does not equal $8*1 - 7 = 1$.

$f(f(f(2))) = f(f(3)) = f(7) = 15$, which does not equal $8*2 - 7 = 9$.

$f(f(f(4))) = f(f(7)) = f(15) = 31$, which does not equal $8*4 - 7 = 27$.

$f(f(f(8))) = f(f(15)) = f(31) = 63$, which does not equal $8*8 - 7 = 55$.

$f(f(f(16))) = f(f(31)) = f(63) = 127$, which does not equal $8*16 - 7 = 121$.

$f(f(f(32))) = f(f(63)) = f(127) = 255$, which does not equal $8*32 - 7 = 255$.

$f(f(f(64))) = f(f(127)) = f(255) = 511$, which does not equal $8*64 - 7 = 511$.

It seems that we made a mistake in our calculations. Let's go back and check our work.

We found that $f(1) = 1$, $f(2) = 3$, $f(4) = 7$, $f(8) = 15$, $f(16) = 31$, $f(32) = 63$, $f(64) = 127$, $f(128) = 255$, and $f(256) = 511$.

Now let's check if these values satisfy the first condition:

$f(f(f(1))) = f(f(1)) = f(3) = 9$, which does not equal $8*1 - 7 = 1$.

$f(f(f(2))) = f(f(3)) = f(7) = 15$, which does not equal $8*2 - 7 = 9$.

$f(f(f(4))) = f(f(7)) = f(15) = 31$, which does not equal $8*4 - 7 = 27$.

$f(f(f(8))) = f(f(15)) = f(31) = 63$, which does not equal $8*8 - 7 = 55$.

$f(f(f(16))) = f(f(31)) = f(63) = 127$, which does not equal $8*16 - 7 = 121$.

$f(f(f(32))) = f(f(63)) = f(127) = 255$, which does not equal $8*32 - 7 = 255$.

$f(f(f(64))) = f(f(127)) = f(255) = 511$, which does not equal $8*64 - 7 = 511$.

It seems that we made a mistake in our calculations. Let's go back and check our work.

**Solution:**


To solve this problem, we can use the second condition to find $f(100)$ in terms of $f(50)$ and then use the second condition again to find $f(50)$ in terms of $f(25)$. We can continue this process until we reach a value of $n$ for which we can directly compute $f(n)$.

Then, we find the value of $f(25)$ using the second condition again: $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.

Next, we find the value of $f(12.5)$, but since $12.5$ is not a natural number, we cannot use the second condition directly. However, we can use the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to find the value of $f(12.5)$.

If we let $n = 13$, then $f(f(f(13))) = 8*13 - 7 = 99$.

So, $f(f(13)) = f^{-1}(99)$.

We can continue to apply the first condition to find the value of $f(13)$: $f(f(13)) = 8*13 - 7 = 99$.

So, $f(13) = f^{-1}(99)$.

Now, we can substitute $n = 6.5$ into the first condition: $f(f(f(6.5))) = 8*6.5 - 7 = 47$.

So, $f(f(6.5)) = f^{-1}(47)$.

We can continue to apply the first condition to find the value of $f(6.5)$: $f(f(6.5)) = 8*6.5 - 7 = 47$.

So, $f(6.5) = f^{-1}(47)$.

Finally, we can substitute $n = 3.25$ into the first condition: $f(f(f(3.25))) = 8*3.25 - 7 = 21.5$.

So, $f(f(3.25)) = f^{-1}(21.5)$.

We can continue to apply the first condition to find the value of $f(3.25)$: $f(f(3.25)) = 8*3.25 - 7 = 21.5$.

So, $f(3.25) = f^{-1}(21.5)$.

Since $f(3.25) = f^{-1}(21.5)$ and $f(6.5) = f^{-1}(47)$, we can conclude that $f(6.5) = 21.5$.

Now, we can substitute $f(6.5) = 21.5$ into the equation $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$ to find the value of $f(50)$: $f(50) = 2*21.5 + 1 = 44$.

Finally, we can substitute $f(50) = 44$ into the equation $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$ to find the value of $f(100)$: $f(100) = 2*44 + 1 = 89$.

So, the value of $f(100)$ is $89$. The answer is: $\boxed{89}$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"The function $f$ is defined on the set of integers and satisfies \[f(n)= \begin{cases}  n-3 & \mbox{if }n\ge 1000 \\  f(f(n+5)) & \mbox{if }n<1000. \end{cases}\]Find $f(84)$."
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Denote by (1) and (2) the two parts of the definition of $f$, respectively. If we begin to use the definition of $f$ to compute $f(84)$, we use (2) until the argument is at least $1000$: \[f(84) = f(f(89)) = f(f(f(94))) = \dots = f^N(1004)\](where $f^N$ denotes composing $f$ with itself $N$ times, for some $N$). The numbers $84, 89, 94, \dots, 1004$ form an arithmetic sequence with common difference $5$; since $1004 - 84 = 920 = 184 \cdot 5$, this sequence has $184 + 1 = 185$ terms, so $N = 185$.

At this point, (1) and (2) are both used: we compute \[\begin{aligned} f^N(1004) &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-1}(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-1}(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-2}(1000) \\ &\stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(997) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1002) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^{N-3}(999) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^{N-2}(1004). \end{aligned}\]Repeating this process, we see that \[f^N(1004) = f^{N-2}(1004) = f^{N-4}(1004) = \dots = f^3(1004).\](The pattern breaks down for $f^k(1004)$ when $k$ is small, so it is not true that $f^3(1004) = f(1004)$.) Now, we have \[f^3(1004) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f^2(1001) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(998) \stackrel{(2)}{=} f^2(1003) \stackrel{(1)}{=} f(1000) \stackrel{(1)}{=} \boxed{997}.\] The answer is $\boxed{997}$

## QUESTION 4 - 13 
- TIME_SPENT : 962 secs

13_
**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Let $
f(n) =
\begin{cases}
n^2+1 & \text{if }n\text{ is odd} \\
\dfrac{n}{2} & \text{if }n\text{ is even}
\end{cases}.
$

For how many integers $n$ from 1 to 100, inclusive, does $f ( f (\dotsb f (n) \dotsb )) = 1$ for some number of applications of $f$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
First, we note that if $n$ is a positive integer, then $f(n)$ is also a positive integer.  We claim that $f ( f (\dotsb f (n) \dotsb )) = 1$ for some number of applications of $f$ only for $n = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32,$ and $64.$  (In other words, $n$ must be a power of 2.)

Note that $f(1) = 2,$ so $f(f(1)) = f(2) = 1.$  If $n > 1$ is a power of 2, it is easy to see that repeated applications of $f$ on $n$ eventually reach 1.

Suppose $n$ is an odd positive integer, where $n > 1.$  Write $n = 2k + 1,$ where $k$ is a positive integer.  Since $n$ is odd,
\[f(n) = n^2 + 1 = (2k + 1)^2 + 1 = 4k^2 + 4k + 2 = 2(2k^2 + 2k + 1).\]Since $2k^2 + 2k$ is always even, $2k^2 + 2k + 1$ is always odd (and greater than 1), so $f(n)$ can never be a power of 2 when $n$ is odd and greater than 1.

Now, suppose $n$ is even.  For example, if $n = 2^3 \cdot 11,$ then
\[f(2^3 \cdot 11) = f(2^2 \cdot 11) = f(2 \cdot 11) = f(11),\]which we know is not a power of 2.

More generally, suppose $n = 2^e \cdot m,$ where $e$ is nonnegative and $m$ is odd.  Then
\[f(2^e \cdot m) = f(2^{e - 1} \cdot m) = f(2^{e - 2} \cdot m) = \dots = f(m).\]If $m = 1,$ then $n$ is a power of 2, and the sequence eventually reaches 1.  Otherwise, $f(m)$ is not a power of 2.  We also know that $f(m)$ is odd and greater than 1, $f(f(m))$ is not a power of 2 either, and so on.  Thus, the sequence can never reach 1.

Therefore, $n$ must be one of the $\boxed{7}$ values 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, or 64. The answer is $\boxed{7}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
**Problem**
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


To find $f(100)$, we can use the second condition of the function $f$. We know that $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. So we can find $f(50)$ first, then $f(25)$, and finally $f(100)$.

1. $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.
2. $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.
3. $f(25) = 2f(12.5)$. But $f(12.5)$ is not a natural number, so we cannot use the second condition directly. We need to use the first condition instead.

From the first condition, we have $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. If we let $n = 12.5$, we get $f(f(f(12.5))) = 8*12.5 - 7 = 93$. Since $f(f(f(12.5))) = 93$, we can find $f(12.5)$ by solving the equation $f(f(x)) = 93$.

Again, we use the second condition. If we let $n = x$, we get $f(2x) = 2f(x) + 1$. If we let $x = f(12.5)$, we get $f(2f(12.5)) = 2f(f(12.5)) + 1$, or $f(93) = 2f(f(12.5)) + 1$. But we know that $f(f(f(12.5))) = 93$, so we can substitute this into the equation to get $f(93) = 2*93 + 1 = 187$.

Now we can solve the equation $f(f(x)) = 93$ for $x$. If we let $x = f(x)$, we get $f(f(x)) = f(x)$, so $f(x) = 93$. But we know that $f(93) = 187$, so $x = 93$. Therefore, $f(12.5) = 93$.

Now we can continue to find $f(25)$, $f(50)$, and finally $f(100)$.

4. $f(25) = 2f(12.5) = 2*93 = 186$.
5. $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1 = 2*186 + 1 = 373$.
6. $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2*373 + 1 = 747$.

So, $f(100) = 747$. The answer is: $747$
