**Problem:** 
"How many distinct solutions are there to the equation $|x-7| = |x+1|$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
If $|x-7| = |x+1|$, then either $x-7 = x+1$ or $x-7 = -(x+1)$.  Simplifying $x-7=x+1$ gives $0=8$, which has no solutions, so no values of $x$ satisfy $x-7 = x+1$.  If $x-7 = -(x+1)$, then $x-7 = -x-1$, so $2x = 6$, which gives $x=3$.  So, there is $\boxed{1}$ solution.

Challenge: See if you can find a quick solution to this problem by simply thinking about the graphs of $y=|x-7|$ and $y=|x+1|$. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The problem asks for how many positive integers $m$ the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be solved by considering the different cases for the absolute value expressions.

For each case, we can find the number of solutions and sum up the cases where the number of solutions is $4$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def count_m():
    """For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"""
    count = 0
    for m in range(1, 101):
        # Solve the equation for each m
        num_solutions = solve_equation(m)
        if num_solutions == 4:
            count += 1
    return count

def solve_equation(m):
    """Solve the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ and return the number of distinct solutions."""
    # Define the equation
    equation = abs(abs(symbols('x') - 1) - 2) - m / 100

    # Solve the equation for each case
    solutions_case1 = solve(equation.subs(symbols('x'), symbols('x') + 1), symbols('x'))
    solutions_case2 = solve(equation.subs(symbols('x'), symbols('x') - 1), symbols('x'))

    # Combine the solutions
    solutions = solutions_case1 + solutions_case2

    # Count the number of distinct solutions
    num_solutions = len(set(solutions))

    return num_solutions

result = count_m()
print(result)
```

INTERMEDIATE OUT :

The output indicates that there are no positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

However, upon revisiting the problem, we realize that we have misunderstood the problem. The question asks for the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has exactly $4$ distinct solutions. We have mistakenly counted the number of $m$ for which the equation has $4$ solutions in total, without considering the specific cases.

Let's correct this and solve the problem again.

For each case, we can find the number of solutions and sum up the cases where the number of solutions is exactly $4$.

## QUESTION 2 - 1

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"For certain ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ of real numbers, the system of equations
\[\begin{aligned} ax+by&=1 \\ x^2 + y^2 &= 50  \end{aligned}\]has at least one solution, and each solution is an ordered pair $(x,y)\,$ of integers. How many such ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ are there?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The graph of $ax+by=1$ is a line, while the graph of $x^2+y^2=50$ is a circle centered at the origin. Therefore, $(a, b)$ satisfies the conditions if and only if the line and circle intersect at least once, and they intersect only at lattice points (points with integer coordinates).

Knowing this, it makes sense to look for lattice points on the circle whose equation is $x^2+y^2=50$. Testing cases, we find that there are twelve lattice points on the circle: $(\pm 1, \pm 7)$, $(\pm 7, \pm 1)$, and $(\pm 5, \pm 5)$ (where the two $\pm$ signs in each pair are independent of each other).

There are $\tbinom{12}{2} = 66$ pairs of these points, and each pair determines a line. However, the graph of $ax+by=1$ can never pass through the origin $(0, 0)$, since if $x=y=0$, then $ax+by=0 \neq 1$. Therefore, the six pairs which consist of diametrically opposed points are invalid, since the line through them passes through the origin. This corrects our count to $66 - 6 = 60$.

In addition, for each of the twelve points, there is a line tangent to the circle at that point, so that the only solution to the system is that one point. This brings the final total to $60 + 12 = \boxed{72}$. The answer is $\boxed{72}$

**Solution:** 



To solve this problem, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

First, let's simplify the equation by multiplying both sides by $100$ to get rid of the fraction: $100 \cdot \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = m$. Now, let's denote $y = \vert x - 1 \vert - 2$. Then the equation becomes $100 \cdot \vert y \vert = m$. This means that $m$ must be a multiple of $100$.

Next, we need to find the number of solutions for $y$. The equation $\vert y \vert = \frac{m}{100}$ has two solutions: $y = \frac{m}{100}$ and $y = -\frac{m}{100}$.

Now, let's substitute $y = \vert x - 1 \vert - 2$ back into the equation:
1. $\vert x - 1 \vert - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$: This equation has two solutions for $x$.
2. $\vert x - 1 \vert - 2 = -\frac{m}{100}$: This equation also has two solutions for $x$.

Therefore, the original equation has a total of $4$ solutions.

Now, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which $m$ is a multiple of $100$ and $1 \leq m \leq 10000$. The positive multiples of $100$ in this range are $100, 200, 300, ..., 10000$. There are $100$ such numbers.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $100$.

The answer is: $100$

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 1 and 2. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ oscillates between 1 and 2, and the equation has 4 distinct solutions when the right side of the equation is strictly between these two values.

So we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Multiplying all sides of the inequalities by 100 gives $100 < m < 200$. The number of positive integers in this range is $200 - 100 - 1 = 99$.

Therefore, there are 99 positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions.

```python

def count_m():
    """Count the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions."""

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


To solve this problem, we need to analyze the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ and find for how many values of $m$ it has $4$ distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is a piecewise function with $4$ cases to consider:

1. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 > 0$, then the equation becomes $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$.
2. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0$, then the equation becomes $-( \vert x-1 \vert -2) = \frac{m}{100}$.
3. If $x-1 > 0$, then the equation in case 1 becomes $x-1 -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, and in case 2 becomes $-(x-1 -2) = \frac{m}{100}$.
4. If $x-1 < 0$, then the equation in case 1 becomes $-(x-1) -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, and in case 2 becomes $-( -(x-1) -2) = \frac{m}{100}$.

By solving these equations for $x$, we can find the values of $x$ that satisfy the equation for each value of $m$. Then we can count the number of distinct solutions for each value of $m$.

After analyzing the equations and the solutions, we find that the equation has $4$ distinct solutions when $m=200$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $1$. The answer is: $1$

## QUESTION 2 - 6 
- TIME_SPENT : 685 secs

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"For certain ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ of real numbers, the system of equations
\[\begin{aligned} ax+by&=1 \\ x^2 + y^2 &= 50  \end{aligned}\]has at least one solution, and each solution is an ordered pair $(x,y)\,$ of integers. How many such ordered pairs $(a,b)\,$ are there?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
The graph of $ax+by=1$ is a line, while the graph of $x^2+y^2=50$ is a circle centered at the origin. Therefore, $(a, b)$ satisfies the conditions if and only if the line and circle intersect at least once, and they intersect only at lattice points (points with integer coordinates).

Knowing this, it makes sense to look for lattice points on the circle whose equation is $x^2+y^2=50$. Testing cases, we find that there are twelve lattice points on the circle: $(\pm 1, \pm 7)$, $(\pm 7, \pm 1)$, and $(\pm 5, \pm 5)$ (where the two $\pm$ signs in each pair are independent of each other).

There are $\tbinom{12}{2} = 66$ pairs of these points, and each pair determines a line. However, the graph of $ax+by=1$ can never pass through the origin $(0, 0)$, since if $x=y=0$, then $ax+by=0 \neq 1$. Therefore, the six pairs which consist of diametrically opposed points are invalid, since the line through them passes through the origin. This corrects our count to $66 - 6 = 60$.

In addition, for each of the twelve points, there is a line tangent to the circle at that point, so that the only solution to the system is that one point. This brings the final total to $60 + 12 = \boxed{72}$. The answer is $\boxed{72}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $2$. This is because the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a graph that is a "V" shape with the "valleys" at $x= -1$, $x=1$, and $x=3$, and the "heights" at $y=1$ and $y=2$. The equation $f(x) = \frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $2$. This means $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, or $100 < m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ in this range are exactly the integers from $101$ to $199$, inclusive. The number of such integers is $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$. So the answer is $\boxed{99}$.
