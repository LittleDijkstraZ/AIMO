Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is between $1$ and $2$. Therefore, we have $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which implies $100 < m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from $101$ to $199$, inclusive. To find the number of these integers, we subtract the smallest integer from the largest integer and then add $1$: $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is $99$.
The answer is: 99

 The given equation is $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ and we want to find for how many positive integers $m$ this equation has 4 distinct solutions. 

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be solved by analyzing the different cases based on the value of $m$. 

For each case, we can find the number of distinct solutions for the equation and count how many cases give us 4 solutions.

However, this problem is not easily solved using code alone. It requires a deep understanding of the absolute value function and how it behaves. Therefore, it would be more appropriate to solve this problem by hand.

By analyzing the cases and solving the equation, we find that the only value of $m$ that gives us 4 distinct solutions is $m = 200$. 

So, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. The value of $m$ is 200.
The answer is: $1$

We will use the method of casework to analyze the possible values of $m$.
Case 1: $\frac{m}{100} = 0$
In this case, the equation becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=0$, which implies $\vert x-1 \vert =2$. This has two solutions $x=3$ and $x=-1$. So this case does not yield 4 distinct solutions.
Case 2: $\frac{m}{100} = 1$
In this case, the equation becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=1$, which implies $\vert x-1 \vert =3$ or $\vert x-1 \vert =1$. The first equation has two solutions $x=4$ and $x=-2$, and the second equation has two solutions $x=2$ and $x=0$. So this case yields 4 distinct solutions.
Case 3: $\frac{m}{100} = 2$
In this case, the equation becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=2$, which implies $\vert x-1 \vert =4$ or $\vert x-1 \vert =0$. The first equation has no solutions in integers, and the second equation has only one solution $x=1$. So this case does not yield 4 distinct solutions.
Case 4: $\frac{m}{100} = 3$
In this case, the equation becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=3$, which implies $\vert x-1 \vert =5$ or $\vert x-1 \vert =-1$. The first equation has no solutions in integers, and the second equation has only one solution $x=0$. So this case does not yield 4 distinct solutions.
Therefore, the only case that yields 4 distinct solutions is when $m=100$. So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 1. The answer is: $1$

Assistant:

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. This is because the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, changes its sign at $x=1$ and again at $x=3$, forming a "V" shape on the number line. The value of $\frac{m}{100}$ determines the height of the "V" shape. If $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, then the "V" shape has 4 distinct intersection points with the x-axis, which are the solutions to the equation.

To find the value of $m$ that satisfies $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 100 to get $m = 200$.

So the only positive integer $m$ that makes the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have 4 distinct solutions is 200. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{1}$.

Note: This question is a counting problem in disguise. The question is asking for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. In this case, there is only one such positive integer $m$, which is 200. Therefore, the numerical answer is 1.

```python

The answer is 1.
The number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 1.
The answer is $\boxed{1}$.
