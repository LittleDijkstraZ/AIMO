Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:


The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. 

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$ and it equals zero if and only if both $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only way this can happen is if $x = 0$ and $y = 0$.

The second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ and it equals zero if and only if both $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $x = 8$ or $x = -8$, and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

So, the points that satisfy the equation are the origin $(0, 0)$ and the points on the square with vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$.

The length of each side of the square is $16$, so the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is true if and only if at least one of the factors is zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

Each of these equations implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$. 

The solutions to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ are all points $(x, y)$ on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.
The solutions to $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ are all points $(x, y)$ on the lines $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.
The solutions to $\vert x \vert = 8$ are all points $(x, y)$ on the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.
The solutions to $\vert y \vert = 8$ are all points $(x, y)$ on the lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

These lines form a square with side length 10, so the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The given equation is of the form $A \cdot B = 0$, which means that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$.
The first term $A = ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$ equals zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
The second term $B = ((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ equals zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
These conditions imply that the points lie on a square with side length 16.
The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: 256

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The equation is satisfied only when both of the factors are zero. This means that either $|x+y| - 10 = 0$, $|x - y| - 10 = 0$, $|x| - 8 = 0$, or $|y| - 8 = 0$. 

From $|x+y| - 10 = 0$, we get $|x+y| = 10$. This is the equation of two lines: $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.
From $|x - y| - 10 = 0$, we get $|x - y| = 10$. This is the equation of two lines: $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.
From $|x| - 8 = 0$, we get $|x| = 8$. This is the equation of two lines: $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.
From $|y| - 8 = 0$, we get $|y| = 8$. This is the equation of two lines: $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

These lines enclose a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So the area of the convex polygon is 256.
