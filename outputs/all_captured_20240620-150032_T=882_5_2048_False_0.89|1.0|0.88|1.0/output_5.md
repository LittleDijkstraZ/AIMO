The outer absolute value $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ can take on a value of $\frac{m}{100}$ in four distinct ways:

1. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100} \implies \vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$
2. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100} \implies \vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$
3. $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = \frac{m}{100} \implies \vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$
4. $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = -\frac{m}{100} \implies \vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$

It's clear that the third and fourth cases are the same as the first and second cases respectively. So we only need to consider the first two cases.

Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$
This has two sub-cases:
- If $x-1 \ge 0$, then $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100} \implies x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$
- If $x-1 < 0$, then $-(x-1) = 2 + \frac{m}{100} \implies x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$

Similarly, for the second case:

Case 2: $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$
This also has two sub-cases:
- If $x-1 \ge 0$, then $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100} \implies x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$
- If $x-1 < 0$, then $-(x-1) = 2 - \frac{m}{100} \implies x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$

For the four distinct solutions to exist, we must have $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which gives $0 < m < 200$. Also, the four solutions must be distinct. This happens when the four values of $x$ are all different.

We can see that the solutions for Case 1 and Case 2 are different if and only if $2 < \frac{m}{100} < 4$, which gives $200 < m < 400$. Therefore, the only value of $m$ that satisfies both conditions is $m = 300$.

So the answer is $1$. However, as the problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$, we should count all possible values of $m$ in the range $0 < m < 400$. There are 199 such values.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 199.
The answer is: $199$

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $3$. This is because the expression on the left side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, takes on the values $0, 1, 2, 3$ exactly once as $x$ varies over the real numbers. Therefore, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be strictly between $1$ and $3$ in order for the equation to have $4$ distinct solutions.

So we want to find how many positive integers $m$ satisfy $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 3$. Multiplying all sides of the inequalities by $100$ gives $100 < m < 300$. The number of positive integers in this range is $300 - 100 - 1 = 199$. However, we must subtract $1$ because $m$ cannot be $100$ or $300$ (since $m$ must be strictly between $100$ and $300$). So the number of such $m$ is $199 - 1 = 198$.
The answer is: $198$.

QUESTION 5 - 2 - TIME_SPENT : 603 secs

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Approach:


1. Import the necessary libraries: In this case, we need to use the `sympy` library.
2. Define the equation: We want to solve the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ for a specific value of $m$.
3. Solve the equation: We will use a loop to iterate through different values of $m$ and count the number of distinct solutions.
4. Count the number of distinct solutions: For each value of $m$, we will solve the equation and count the number of distinct solutions.
5. Check if the number of distinct solutions is equal to 4: If the number of distinct solutions is equal to 4, we will increment the count of the number of such $m$ values.
6. After iterating through all possible values of $m$, print the number of $m$ values for which the equation has exactly 4 distinct solutions.

The entire script is as follows:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Abs, solveset, S

def count_m_values():
    x, m = symbols('x m')
    num_m_values = 0

    for m_val in range(1, 101):
        equation = Abs(Abs(x - 1) - 2) - m_val / 100
        solutions = solveset(equation, x, domain=S.Reals)
        num_solutions = len(solutions)

        if num_solutions == 4:
            num_m_values += 1

    return num_m_values

result = count_m_values()
print(result)
```

100

The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is $\boxed{1}$.
The answer is $\boxed{1}$.

The given equation has four distinct solutions, which means the right-hand side $\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal to one of the four values that make the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ have four distinct solutions.

From the properties of absolute value function, we know that $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ equals to one of the following four values:

1. $2- \vert x-1 \vert$, when $\vert x-1 \vert \geq 2$;
2. $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, when $0< \vert x-1 \vert < 2$;
3. $2 - (1-x)$, when $x \leq 1$;
4. $2 - (x-1)$, when $x > 1$.

Each of these four cases gives a separate equation that we need to solve. However, the solutions to these equations must also satisfy the condition that $\frac{m}{100}$ must be positive and an integer.

After solving these equations, we find that $\frac{m}{100}$ can only be equal to $1, 2,$ or $3$. Therefore, $m$ can be $100, 200,$ or $300$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

possible_m_values = [100, 200, 300]
print(possible_m_values)
```

[100, 200, 300]

CODE RESULTS [100, 200, 300]

```output

```
The values of $m$ that make the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have $4$ distinct solutions are $100, 200,$ and $300$. Therefore, there are $3$ possible values for $m$. The answer is: $3$.

The number of distinct solutions of the equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ is 4. This means that the right hand side, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be equal to 1, because only when $\frac{m}{100} = 1$ does the equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = 1$ have 4 distinct solutions.

So, we need to solve the equation $\frac{m}{100} = 1$ for $m$. Multiplying each side of the equation by 100 gives $m = 100$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 1. The answer is: $1$
