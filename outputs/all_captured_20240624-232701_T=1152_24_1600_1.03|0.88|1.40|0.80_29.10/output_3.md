Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is equal to zero if and only if at least one of the factors is equal to zero. This gives us four cases to consider:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
3. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
4. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For each case, we can find the corresponding points that satisfy the equations and plot them on a graph. The four cases give us the vertices of a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The equation $A \cdot B = 0$ implies that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the given equation implies either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which gives us a square with side length 10.

The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us a square with side length 16.

The smaller square is completely inside the larger square, so the convex polygon formed by the points satisfying the given equation is the larger square. The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side, so the area of this convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Assistant:

 The expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ is true only when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we find that the points must satisfy $x = y = 5$ or $x = -y = -5$.
Similarly, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ is true only when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
Putting these together, the points that satisfy the original equation are $(5,5)$, $(-5,-5)$, $(8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$. These points form a square with side length $10$, so its area is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$

The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero, which means either one of the expressions must be zero for the product to be zero.

The first expression is: $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. This expression equals zero if and only if both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. This means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these two equations are the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle.

The second expression is: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This expression equals zero if and only if both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. This means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these two equations are the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines also form a rectangle.

The two rectangles intersect to form a larger rectangle, which is the convex polygon in question. The dimensions of this rectangle are 20 units by 16 units. The area of this rectangle is $20 \times 16 = 320$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 320 square units.

Here's a Python function to calculate the area of the rectangle:

```python

def rectangle_area():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""

    area = width * height
    return area

result = rectangle_area()

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, which is zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the square: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, -2)$, and $(-8, 2)$.

The second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$, which is zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the square: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$.

Therefore, the points $\left(x, y\right)$ that satisfy the given equation are the vertices of two squares: one with side length 16 (formed by the vertices $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, -2)$, and $(-8, 2)$) and the other with side length 16 (formed by the vertices $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$).

The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side. So the area of the first square is $16^2 = 256$ and the area of the second square is also $16^2 = 256$. Adding these two areas together, the total area of the convex polygon is $256 + 256 = 512$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    side_length = 16
    area_of_square1 = side_length ** 2
    area_of_square2 = side_length ** 2
    total_area = area_of_square1 + area_of_square2
    return total_area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

The area of the convex polygon is $512$. The answer is: $\boxed{512}$

 The equation $AB = 0$ is equivalent to either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The equations $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ are all satisfied when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$. These equations represent four lines in the coordinate plane.

The lines $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ form a square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$, and the lines $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ form a square with side length 16. The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon we are interested in.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of the square formed by the lines $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which is $(10\sqrt{2})^2 = 200$. The answer is: $200$.

The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

The first term is zero when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us the system of equations:
1. $x + y = \pm 10$
2. $x - y = \pm 10$

Solving this system of equations, we find that the four lines $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$ form a square with side length 20. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.

The second term is zero when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us the system of equations:
1. $x = \pm 8$
2. $y = \pm 8$

Solving this system of equations, we find that the four lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$ form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

The convex polygon formed by the intersection of these two squares is a smaller square with side length 16 (the side length of the square formed by the lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$). The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

 The equation $AB=0$ implies that either $A=0$ or $B=0$. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This is only possible if $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$. So, the vertices of the polygon are $(10, 10)$, $(10, -10)$, $(-10, 10)$, and $(-10, -10)$.
The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So, the vertices of the polygon also include $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.
Therefore, the polygon is a square with side length $20$. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$. The answer is: $400$

Assistant:

 The problem statement provides a complex equation that encloses a region in the Cartesian plane. The task is to find the area of this region.

First, let's understand the equation. The equation is equal to zero, which means that one of the factors must be zero. This gives us two conditions to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first condition, both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ must be zero. This means that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only way this can be true is if $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$. This forms a square with side length 20.

For the second condition, both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2$ must be zero. This means that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The only way this can be true is if $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This forms a square with side length 16.

The area of the polygon formed by the intersection of these two squares is the area of the smaller square, which is $(16)^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:


The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
This equation is equal to zero if either of the two factors is equal to zero.
The first factor is zero when either $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$.
This gives us the equations $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
The second factor is zero when either $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.
This gives us the equations $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The solutions to these equations are as follows:
For $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, the solutions are the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.
For $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, the solutions are the lines $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.
For $\vert x \vert = 8$, the solutions are the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.
For $\vert y \vert = 8$, the solutions are the lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.
The intersection of these lines form a square with side length 16.
The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$.
