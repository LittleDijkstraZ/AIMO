Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 ```python
from scipy.optimize import minimize

def solve_problem():
    """Solve the problem of finding the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$."""
    # Define the function to minimize
    fun = lambda x: 5*x[0]**2 + 5*x[1]**2 - 8*x[0]*x[1]
    
    # Define the constraint
    cons = ({'type': 'eq', 'fun': lambda x: abs(x[0]-2*x[1]) + abs(x[1]-2*x[0]) - 40})
    
    # Define the initial guess
    x0 = [0, 0]
    
    # Perform the optimization
    result = minimize(fun, x0, constraints=cons, method='SLSQP')
    
    return result.fun

result = solve_problem()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 800.0

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
800.0
```
The minimum value of the function $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ subject to the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $\boxed{800}$.
