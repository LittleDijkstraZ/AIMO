Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, let's understand the problem. We are given an equation with absolute values and we are asked to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions.

The equation is $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.

This equation is equivalent to a piecewise function with four cases, depending on the value of $x$.

We can solve this problem by trying each possible value of $m$ from 1 to 100 and checking if the equation has 4 distinct solutions.

Here is a Python script to solve this problem:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

def number_of_solutions():
    x = symbols('x')
    m = symbols('m', integer=True)

    # Define the equation
    equation = Eq(abs(abs(x - 1) - 2), m/100)

    # Initialize the count of m values that give 4 solutions
    count = 0

    for m_value in range(1, 101):
        # Substitute the value of m into the equation
        equation_sub = equation.subs(m, m_value)

        # Solve the equation for x
        solutions = solve(equation_sub, x)

        # Check if the number of solutions is 4
        if len(solutions) == 4:
            count += 1

    return count

result = number_of_solutions()
print(result)
```

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"On the graph of $y=(x+2)^4-100$, how many points are there whose coordinates are both negative integers?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
A point $(x,y)$ is on the graph if and only if $y=(x+2)^4-100$, so we seek to determine all pairs of negative integers $(x,y)$ which satisfy this equation. We can obtain pairs by plugging in $-1,-2,-3,$ and so on for $x$: \begin{align*}
x=-1 &\Rightarrow y=1^4-100=-99 \\
x=-2 &\Rightarrow y=0^4-100=-100 \\
x=-3 &\Rightarrow y=(-1)^4-100=-99 \\
x=-4 &\Rightarrow y=(-2)^4-100=-84 \\
x=-5 &\Rightarrow y=(-3)^4-100=-19 \\
\end{align*}Starting at $x=-6$, the $y$-coordinates obtained in this way are positive. To be sure that there are no more solutions, we can solve the equation $$(x+2)^4-100 < 0,$$which yields $-2-\sqrt[4]{100}<x<-2+\sqrt[4]{100}$ (in decimals, this is roughly $-5.16<x<1.16$). Thus, the graph of $y=(x+2)^4-100$ passes through $\boxed{5}$ points with negative integer coordinates. The answer is $\boxed{5}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions, which means that the right side of the equation must be equal to $2$. This is because the absolute value function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ takes on the value of $2$ exactly $4$ times. Therefore, we have $\frac{m}{100}=2$, which gives $m=200$.

So the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $200$. The answer is: $200$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"For how many values of $a$ is it true that:
(1) $a$ is a positive integer such that $a \le 50$.
(2) the quadratic equation $x^2 + (2a+1)x + a^2 = 0$ has two integer solutions?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
If the quadratic equation $x^2 + (2a+1)x + a^2 = 0$ has two integer solutions, then $$x = \frac{-2a-1 \pm \sqrt{(2a+1)^2 - 4a^2}}{2}$$is an integer, so it follows that the discriminant $(2a+1)^2 - 4a^2 = 4a + 1$ must be a perfect square. Also, $1 \le a \le 50$, so it follows that $5 \le 4a+1 \le 201$. Clearly $4a+1$ can only be the square of an odd integer; conversely, the square of any odd integer $(2n+1)^2$ is of the form $4n^2 + 4n+1 = 4(n^2 + n) + 1$ and so can be written as $4a+1$. The odd perfect squares from $5$ to $201$ are given by $9 = 3^2, 5^2, 7^2, 9^2, 11^2, 169 = 13^2$, so it follows that there are $\boxed{6}$ such values of $a$. The answer is $\boxed{6}$
