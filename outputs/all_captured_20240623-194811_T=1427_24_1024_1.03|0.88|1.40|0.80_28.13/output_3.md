Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. For the product of two numbers to be zero, either one of the numbers must be zero. This means either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The first equation can only be true if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two lines: $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$.

The second equation can only be true if both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two lines: $x = 8$ and $y = 8$.

The four lines intersect to form a square with side length 10 (the distance between the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$). The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The equation given in the problem, $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$, is satisfied only when either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
For $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which gives $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
For $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which gives $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
For $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$, which gives $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
For $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.
Combining all these equations, we find that the points satisfying the equation are $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$. These points form a square with side length $16$. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if both factors are equal to zero. This means that either $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$, $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$, or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. 

From $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$, we get $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$. 
From $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, we get $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = \pm 10$. 
From $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$, we get $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$. 
From $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, we get $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = \pm 8$. 

These conditions define a square with vertices at $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$. The side length of this square is $16$, so the area is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.

The first term is zero when $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. This simplifies to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these equations are all the points on the lines $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. These lines form a square with side length 20.

The second term is zero when $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. This simplifies to $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are all the points on the lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. These lines also form a square with side length 16.

Therefore, the points that satisfy the given equation are those that lie on either the square with side length 20 or the square with side length 16. The convex polygon enclosed by these points is the intersection of these two squares, which is a square with side length 8.

The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$. So the area of the convex polygon is 64. The answer is: $64$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The problem statement is asking for the area of a polygon enclosed by the points that satisfy the given equation. The equation is:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$
The equation equals to zero if either of the two terms equals to zero. This gives us two systems of equations:
$$\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$$ and $$\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$$
and
$$\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$$ and $$\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$$
Solving these equations, we get the following vertices of the polygon:
$$(8,8), (8,-8), (-8,8), (-8,-8)$$
The polygon is a square with side length of 16 units. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is $256$.
The answer is: $256$

Assistant:

 The problem statement is quite complex, and requires a deep understanding of absolute value and inequalities. However, by analyzing the conditions given in the problem, we can find that the only way for the product of two non-negative numbers to be zero is if one or both of them are zero. Thus, we have four separate cases to consider:

1. $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x| - 8 = 0$ and $|y| - 8 = 0$.
2. $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x| - 8 = 0$ and $|y| - 8 \neq 0$.
3. $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x| - 8 \neq 0$ and $|y| - 8 = 0$.
4. $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x| - 8 \neq 0$ and $|y| - 8 \neq 0$.
5. $|x - y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x| - 8 = 0$ and $|y| - 8 = 0$.
6. $|x - y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x| - 8 = 0$ and $|y| - 8 \neq 0$.
7. $|x - y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x| - 8 \neq 0$ and $|y| - 8 = 0$.
8. $|x - y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x| - 8 \neq 0$ and $|y| - 8 \neq 0$.

For cases 1, 5, we get $x = y = 8$.
For cases 2, 3, 6, 7, we get $x = \pm 8$ and $y = 8$.
For case 4, we get $x = y = 0$.
For cases 8, we get $x = \pm 8$ and $y = 0$.

These points form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$
