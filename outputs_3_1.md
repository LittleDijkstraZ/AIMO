Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is satisfied if either of the factors is zero. 
The factors are:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$$ and $$((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$$

The first factor equals zero if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two squares in the coordinate plane, each with side length 20.

The second factor equals zero if $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two squares in the coordinate plane, each with side length 16.

Therefore, the points that satisfy the given equation are those that lie on the vertices of the four squares. 

The area of the convex polygon enclosed by these points is the sum of the areas of the four squares. The area of a square with side length $s$ is $s^2$, so the area of each square is:

- For the square with side length 20: $20^2 = 400$
- For the square with side length 16: $16^2 = 256$

Adding these areas together gives the total area of the convex polygon: $400 + 400 + 256 + 256 = 1312$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 1312 square units. The answer is: $1312$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

The given equation is $0$ if and only if both of the factors are $0$.
The first factor is $0$ if and only if $|x+y|=10$ or $|x-y|=10$.
The second factor is $0$ if and only if $|x|=8$ or $|y|=8$.
These conditions define a rectangle with vertices at $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.
To find the area of this rectangle, we simply multiply the lengths of two adjacent sides.
The length of the side parallel to the x-axis is $16$, and the length of the side parallel to the y-axis is $16$, so the area of the rectangle is $16 \times 16 = 256$. The answer is: 256
So the area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $\boxed{256}$.

 This problem is asking for the area of a polygon formed by the points that satisfy the given equation. The equation is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

If the product of two numbers is zero, then at least one of the numbers must be zero. So, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies that $x = 0$ and $y = 0$.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that $-8 \leq x \leq 8$ and $-8 \leq y \leq 8$.

So, the points that satisfy the equation form a square with side length 16. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: 256

To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation we have is $$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$

For the product of two numbers to be zero, one of them must be zero. So, either $$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0,$$ or $$(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0.$$

The first equation implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(5,5)$, $(-5,-5)$, $(5,-5)$, and $(-5,5)$.

The second equation implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us four more vertices: $(8,0)$, $(-8,0)$, $(0,8)$, and $(0,-8)$.

Now we have the vertices of the polygon: $(5,5)$, $(-5,-5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, $(8,0)$, $(-8,0)$, $(0,8)$, and $(0,-8)$.

To find the area of the polygon, we can split it into two rectangles and subtract the area of the smaller square from the total area. The side lengths of the rectangles are $10$ and $16$, so the total area is $10 \times 16 = 160$. The side length of the smaller square is $10$, so its area is $10 \times 10 = 100$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $160 - 100 = 60$. The answer is: $60$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The given equation is a product of two terms equals zero, so one of the terms must be zero. That is, either

1. $(|x+y| - 10)^2 + (|x-y| - 10)^2 = 0$, or
2. $(|x| - 8)^2 + (|y| - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first term to be zero, we must have $|x+y| = 10$ and $|x-y| = 10$. These are the equations of two orthogonal lines, namely $x+y = \pm 10$ and $x-y = \pm 10$.

For the second term to be zero, we must have $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$, which are the equations of two orthogonal lines, namely $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

The intersection of these lines form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. The final numerical answer is therefore 256.

Here is the python code to solve the problem:
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solve

def area_of_polygon():
    # The side length of the square is 16
    side_length = 16

    # Calculate the area of the square
    area = side_length**2

    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

256

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $\boxed{256}$.
