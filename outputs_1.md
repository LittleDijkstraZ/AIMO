**Problem:** 
"Find the minimum value of $2x^2 + 2y^2 + 5z^2 - 2xy - 4yz - 4x - 2z + 15$ over all real numbers $x,$ $y,$ $z.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
We can write the given expression as
\begin{align*}
&(x^2 - 4x + 4) + (x^2 - 2xy + y^2) + (y^2 - 4yz + 4z^2) + (z^2 - 2z + 1) + 10 \\
&= (x - 2)^2 + (x - y)^2 + (y - 2z)^2 + (z - 1)^2 + 10
\end{align*}The minimum value is then $\boxed{10},$ which occurs when $x = 2,$ $y = 2,$ and $z = 1.$ The answer is $\boxed{10}$

**Problem**
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


This problem is a bit tricky to solve directly. However, we can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to solve it. The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states that for any real numbers $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$ and $b_1, b_2, ..., b_n$, we have
\[(a_1^2 + a_2^2 + ... + a_n^2)(b_1^2 + b_2^2 + ... + b_n^2) \geq (a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 + ... + a_nb_n)^2.\]

Let's apply the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to the given problem. Let $a_1 = x - 2y$, $a_2 = y - 2x$, $b_1 = 1$, and $b_2 = 1$. Then we have
\[((x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2)(1^2 + 1^2) \geq ((x - 2y)(1) + (y - 2x)(1))^2.\]
Simplifying the left side gives
\[((x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2)(2) \geq (x - 2y + y - 2x)^2.\]
Simplifying the right side gives
\[((x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2)(2) \geq (-x + y)^2.\]
Since $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$, we have $-x + y = 20$. Substituting this into the inequality gives
\[((x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2)(2) \geq 20^2.\]
Simplifying the right side gives
\[((x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2)(2) \geq 400.\]
Dividing both sides by 2 gives
\[(x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2 \geq 200.\]
Now let's look at the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$. We can rewrite it as
\[5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = 5(x^2 - 2xy + y^2) + 5(y^2 - 2xy + x^2) = 5(x - y)^2 + 5(y - x)^2.\]
Since $(x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2 \geq 200$, we have
\[5(x - y)^2 + 5(y - x)^2 \geq 5 \cdot 200 = 1000.\]
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is 1000.

The answer is: $1000$

**Problem:** 
"What is the minimum value of the expression $x^2+y^2+2x-4y+8$ for real $x$ and $y$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Rearranging the expression, we have  \[x^2+2x+y^2-4y+8\]Completing the square in $x$, we need to add and subtract $(2/2)^2=1$. Completing the square in $y$, we need to add and subtract $(4/2)^2=4$. Thus, we have \[(x^2+2x+1)-1+(y^2-4y+4)-4+8 \Rightarrow (x+1)^2+(y-2)^2+3\]Since the minimum value of $(x+1)^2$ and $(y-2)^2$ is $0$ (perfect squares can never be negative), the minimum value of the entire expression is $\boxed{3}$, and is achieved when $x=-1$ and $y=2$. The answer is $\boxed{3}$

**Problem**
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


This problem is a bit tricky, and it requires some algebraic manipulation and the use of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. Here's the solution:

First, let's rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2$.

Now, let's use the given condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. By the triangle inequality, we know that $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$, so we have $|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |(x-2y) + (y-2x)| = |-x+y| = |y-x|$. Therefore, we have $|y-x| = 40$.

Now, let's use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. We have $(1+4)(y^2+x^2) \geq (y+2x)^2$, which simplifies to $5(y^2+x^2) \geq (y+2x)^2$.

Now, let's substitute $y+2x = 40$ (from the given condition) into the inequality: $5(y^2+x^2) \geq 40^2 = 1600$.

Finally, we have $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = (x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2 = (y+2x)^2 - 8xy = 40^2 - 8xy$.

To minimize this expression, we need to maximize $8xy$. By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have $8xy \leq 2(x^2+y^2)$, so $8xy \leq 2(y^2+x^2)$.

Substituting this into the expression $40^2 - 8xy$, we get $40^2 - 8xy \geq 40^2 - 2(y^2+x^2)$.

Since $5(y^2+x^2) \geq 1600$, we have $y^2+x^2 \geq \frac{1600}{5} = 320$.

Therefore, $40^2 - 2(y^2+x^2) \geq 40^2 - 2(320) = 40^2 - 640 = 1600 - 640 = 960$.

So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 960. The answer is: $960$

Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


```python

from sympy import symbols, solve, simplify

    # Given equation
    equation = abs(x - 2*y) + abs(y - 2*x) - 40

    # Solve the equation for y
    y_solution = solve(equation, y)[0]

    # Substitute y in the expression to minimize
    expression = 5*x**2 + 5*y_solution**2 - 8*x*y_solution

    # Take the derivative of the expression with respect to x
    derivative = expression.diff(x)

    # Solve the derivative equal to zero to find the minimum
    critical_points = solve(derivative, x)

    # Substitute the critical points in the expression
    values = [expression.subs(x, point) for point in critical_points]

    # Simplify the values

**Solution:**


This problem is a bit tricky to solve directly using Python. However, we can simplify it by using the fact that the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ can be rewritten as $(5x-4y)^2 + (5y-4x)^2$.

Now, let's denote $a = 5x - 4y$ and $b = 5y - 4x$. Then, the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|a| + |b| = 40$.

The minimum value of $a^2 + b^2$ subject to the constraint $|a| + |b| = 40$ can be found using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. The minimum value is achieved when $a = b = 20$, and the minimum value is $20^2 + 20^2 = 800$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 800.
