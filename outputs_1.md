Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
<<<<<<< HEAD
We can write the given expression as
\begin{align*}
&(x^2 - 4x + 4) + (x^2 - 2xy + y^2) + (y^2 - 4yz + 4z^2) + (z^2 - 2z + 1) + 10 \\
&= (x - 2)^2 + (x - y)^2 + (y - 2z)^2 + (z - 1)^2 + 10
\end{align*}The minimum value is then $\boxed{10},$ which occurs when $x = 2,$ $y = 2,$ and $z = 1.$ The answer is $\boxed{10}$
=======
We see that $(x + 2y)^2 = (x^2 + 4y^2) + 4xy = 4^2 = 16$. We want to find $x^2 + 4y^2$ and are given $xy = -8$. So, $x^2 + 4y^2 + 4xy = x^2 + 4y^2 + 4(-8) = 16$. It follows that $x^2 + 4y^2 = \boxed{48}$. The answer is $\boxed{48}$

**Problem**
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"

This problem is a bit tricky to solve directly. However, we can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to solve it. The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states that for any real numbers $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$ and $b_1, b_2, ..., b_n$, we have
\[(a_1^2 + a_2^2 + ... + a_n^2)(b_1^2 + b_2^2 + ... + b_n^2) \geq (a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 + ... + a_nb_n)^2.\]

Let's apply the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to the given problem. Let $a_1 = x - 2y$, $a_2 = y - 2x$, $b_1 = 1$, and $b_2 = 1$. Then we have
\[((x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2)(1^2 + 1^2) \geq ((x - 2y)(1) + (y - 2x)(1))^2.\]
Simplifying the left side gives
\[((x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2)(2) \geq (x - 2y + y - 2x)^2.\]
Simplifying the right side gives
\[((x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2)(2) \geq (-x + y)^2.\]
Since $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$, we have $-x + y = 20$. Substituting this into the inequality gives
\[((x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2)(2) \geq 20^2.\]
Simplifying the right side gives
\[((x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2)(2) \geq 400.\]
Dividing both sides by 2 gives
\[(x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2 \geq 200.\]
Now let's look at the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$. We can rewrite it as
\[5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = 5(x^2 - 2xy + y^2) + 5(y^2 - 2xy + x^2) = 5(x - y)^2 + 5(y - x)^2.\]
Since $(x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2 \geq 200$, we have
\[5(x - y)^2 + 5(y - x)^2 \geq 5 \cdot 200 = 1000.\]
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is 1000.

The answer is: $1000$

This problem is a bit complex and requires some mathematical insights. However, we can solve it using the following steps:

Step 1: We can rewrite the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$ by noting that $|a| = |-a|$.

Step 2: By the triangle inequality, we know that $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$. So, we have $|x-2y| + |2y-x| \geq |(x-2y) + (2y-x)| = |0| = 0$.

Step 3: But we are given that $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$, so we must have equality in the triangle inequality. This means that the signs of $x-2y$ and $2y-x$ must be the same, which implies that $x-2y$ and $2y-x$ must be either both positive or both negative.

Step 4: If they are both positive, then $x-2y = 2y-x$, which implies $x = 2y$. If they are both negative, then $x-2y = -(2y-x)$, which also implies $x = 2y$. So in both cases, we have $x = 2y$.

Step 5: Substituting $x = 2y$ into the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we get $|2y-y| + |y-4y| = 40$, which simplifies to $|y| + |-3y| = 40$, or $|y| + 3|y| = 40$, or $4|y| = 40$, or $|y| = 10$.

Step 6: Since $y$ can be either positive or negative, we have two possible solutions: $y = 10$ and $y = -10$. For $y = 10$, we have $x = 2y = 20$. For $y = -10$, we have $x = 2y = -20$.

Step 7: Now we substitute these values into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to find the minimum value. For $x = 20$ and $y = 10$, we get $5(20)^2 + 5(10)^2 - 8(20)(10) = 2000 + 500 - 1600 = 2400$. For $x = -20$ and $y = -10$, we get $5(-20)^2 + 5(-10)^2 - 8(-20)(-10) = 2000 + 500 - 1600 = 2400$.

Step 8: So in both cases, the value of the expression is 2400. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 2400.

**Problem:** 
"What is the minimum value of the expression $x^2+y^2+2x-4y+8$ for real $x$ and $y$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Rearranging the expression, we have  \[x^2+2x+y^2-4y+8\]Completing the square in $x$, we need to add and subtract $(2/2)^2=1$. Completing the square in $y$, we need to add and subtract $(4/2)^2=4$. Thus, we have \[(x^2+2x+1)-1+(y^2-4y+4)-4+8 \Rightarrow (x+1)^2+(y-2)^2+3\]Since the minimum value of $(x+1)^2$ and $(y-2)^2$ is $0$ (perfect squares can never be negative), the minimum value of the entire expression is $\boxed{3}$, and is achieved when $x=-1$ and $y=2$. The answer is $\boxed{3}$

Let's think step by step:
Rearranging the expression, we have  \[2x^2+8x+3y^2-24y+62\]We first complete the square in $x$. Factoring a 2 from the first two terms of the expression, we get  \[2(x^2+4x)+3y^2-24y+62\]In order for the expression inside the parenthesis to be a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(4/2)^2=4$ inside the parenthesis. Doing this, we have \[2(x^2+4x+4-4)+3y^2-24y+62 \Rightarrow 2(x+2)^2+3y^2-24y+54\]Now we complete the square in $y$. Factoring a 3 from the $y$ terms in the expression, we get \[2(x+2)^2+3(y^2-8y)+54\]In order for the expression inside the second parenthesis to be a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(8/2)^2=16$ inside the parenthesis. Doing this, we have \[2(x+2)^2+3(y^2-8y+16-16)+54 \Rightarrow 2(x+2)^2+3(y-4)^2+6\]Since the minimum value of $2(x+2)^2$ and $3(y-4)^2$ is $0$ (perfect squares can never be negative), the minimum value of the entire expression is $\boxed{6}$, and is achieved when $x=-2$ and $y=4$. The answer is $\boxed{6}$

**Solution:**


This problem is a bit tricky, and it requires some algebraic manipulation and the use of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. Here's the solution:

First, let's rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2$.

Now, let's use the given condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. By the triangle inequality, we know that $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$, so we have $|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |(x-2y) + (y-2x)| = |-x+y| = |y-x|$. Therefore, we have $|y-x| = 40$.

Now, let's use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. We have $(1+4)(y^2+x^2) \geq (y+2x)^2$, which simplifies to $5(y^2+x^2) \geq (y+2x)^2$.

Now, let's substitute $y+2x = 40$ (from the given condition) into the inequality: $5(y^2+x^2) \geq 40^2 = 1600$.

Finally, we have $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = (x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2 = (y+2x)^2 - 8xy = 40^2 - 8xy$.

To minimize this expression, we need to maximize $8xy$. By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have $8xy \leq 2(x^2+y^2)$, so $8xy \leq 2(y^2+x^2)$.

Substituting this into the expression $40^2 - 8xy$, we get $40^2 - 8xy \geq 40^2 - 2(y^2+x^2)$.

Since $5(y^2+x^2) \geq 1600$, we have $y^2+x^2 \geq \frac{1600}{5} = 320$.

Therefore, $40^2 - 2(y^2+x^2) \geq 40^2 - 2(320) = 40^2 - 640 = 1600 - 640 = 960$.

So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 960. The answer is: $960$

**Problem:** 
"What is the minimum value of the expression $x^2+y^2+2x-4y+8$ for real $x$ and $y$?"
=======

**Solution:**


This problem is a bit too complex to solve with simple Python code. However, we can solve it using the method of completing the square.

First, let's rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2$.

Next, we can substitute $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ into the equation. Since $|a| + |b| = 40$, we know that $a$ and $b$ have the same absolute value, which means $a = b$ or $a = -b$. So we have two cases to consider:

1. If $x - 2y = y - 2x$, then we can solve this equation to get $x = 4y/3$. Substitute this into the expression, we get $(4y/3 - 2y)^2 + (y - 2*4y/3)^2 = (y/3)^2 + (-y/3)^2 = 2/9 * y^2$.

2. If $x - 2y = -(y - 2x)$, then we can solve this equation to get $x = -2y/3$. Substitute this into the expression, we get $(-2y/3 - 2y)^2 + (y - 2*(-2y/3))^2 = (-8y/3)^2 + (5y/3)^2 = 89/9 * y^2$.

Now, we need to find the minimum value of $2/9 * y^2$ and $89/9 * y^2$. Since $2/9 < 89/9$, the minimum value is achieved when $x = 4y/3$.

Substitute $x = 4y/3$ into the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we get $|4y/3 - 2y| + |y - 2*4y/3| = 40$, which simplifies to $|y/3| + |-y/3| = 40$, which is true for all real numbers $y$.

So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is achieved when $x = 4y/3$. Substitute $x = 4y/3$ into the expression, we get $(4y/3 - 2y)^2 + (y - 2*4y/3)^2 = (y/3)^2 + (-y/3)^2 = 2/9 * y^2$.

To find the minimum value of $2/9 * y^2$, we can take the derivative with respect to $y$ and set it to zero. The derivative of $2/9 * y^2$ is $4/9 * y$, set it to zero, we get $y = 0$. Substitute $y = 0$ into the expression, we get $2/9 * 0^2 = 0$.

So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0.
The answer is: $0$

Doing this, we have \[2(x^2+4x+4-4)+3y^2-24y+62 \Rightarrow 2(x+2)^2+3y^2-24y+54\]Now we complete the square in $y$.

Doing this, we have \[2(x+2)^2+3(y^2-8y+16-16)+54 \Rightarrow 2(x+2)^2+3(y-4)^2+6\]Since the minimum value of $2(x+2)^2$ and $3(y-4)^2$ is $0$ (perfect squares can never be negative), the minimum value of the entire expression is $\boxed{6}$, and is achieved when $x=-2$ and $y=4$.

**Problem**
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is equivalent to $|x-2y| = |2x-y|$, which implies that $x-2y = \pm(2x-y)$.
If $x-2y = 2x-y$, then $y = x$, and if $x-2y = -(2x-y)$, then $x = 2y$.
So either $x = y$ or $x = 2y$.
Now, we substitute $x = y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to get $5x^2+5x^2-8x^2 = 2x^2$.
And we substitute $x = 2y$ into the expression to get $5(2y)^2+5y^2-8(2y)(y) = 20y^2+5y^2-16y^2 = 9y^2$.
Since $x$ and $y$ are real numbers, both $2x^2$ and $9y^2$ are non-negative.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0, which occurs when $x = y$ or $x = 2y$.
However, we need to find the minimum value under the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
By trying some values, we find that when $x = 10$ and $y = 5$, the constraint is satisfied.
So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the given constraint is $5(10)^2+5(5)^2-8(10)(5) = 500+125-400 = 225$.
The answer is: $0$

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"What is the minimum value of the expression $x^2+y^2+2x-4y+8$ for real $x$ and $y$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Rearranging the expression, we have  \[x^2+2x+y^2-4y+8\]Completing the square in $x$, we need to add and subtract $(2/2)^2=1$. Completing the square in $y$, we need to add and subtract $(4/2)^2=4$. Thus, we have \[(x^2+2x+1)-1+(y^2-4y+4)-4+8 \Rightarrow (x+1)^2+(y-2)^2+3\]Since the minimum value of $(x+1)^2$ and $(y-2)^2$ is $0$ (perfect squares can never be negative), the minimum value of the entire expression is $\boxed{3}$, and is achieved when $x=-1$ and $y=2$. The answer is $\boxed{3}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 To solve this problem, we can use the method of completing the square. First, we rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2$. Then, we substitute $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ into the equation.

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"Find the minimum value of $2x^2 + 2y^2 + 5z^2 - 2xy - 4yz - 4x - 2z + 15$ over all real numbers $x,$ $y,$ $z.$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
We can write the given expression as
\begin{align*}
&(x^2 - 4x + 4) + (x^2 - 2xy + y^2) + (y^2 - 4yz + 4z^2) + (z^2 - 2z + 1) + 10 \\
&= (x - 2)^2 + (x - y)^2 + (y - 2z)^2 + (z - 1)^2 + 10
\end{align*}The minimum value is then $\boxed{10},$ which occurs when $x = 2,$ $y = 2,$ and $z = 1.$ The answer is $\boxed{10}$

**Problem**
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


This problem is a bit tricky to solve directly using Python. However, we can simplify it by using the fact that the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ can be rewritten as $(5x-4y)^2 + (5y-4x)^2$.

Now, let's denote $a = 5x - 4y$ and $b = 5y - 4x$. Then, the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|a| + |b| = 40$.

The minimum value of $a^2 + b^2$ subject to the constraint $|a| + |b| = 40$ can be found using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. The minimum value is achieved when $a = b = 20$, and the minimum value is $20^2 + 20^2 = 800$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 800.
