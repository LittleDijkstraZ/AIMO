We need some basic facts from number theory: $a^0 = 1$ for any $a,$ $1^b = 1$ for any $b,$ and $(-1)^c = 1$ if $c$ is an even integer. Unless the base is a complex number (which is excluded since we are looking for integer solutions), there are no other ways to get an RHS of $1.$ Thus, either the exponent is zero $($giving the equation $25 - x^2 = 0),$ the base is $1$ $($giving $x -2 = 1),$ or the base is $-1$ and the exponent is even $($giving the simultaneous equations $x - 2 = -1$ and $25 - x^2 = 2n$ for some integer $n).$ Solving the first equation gives $x = \pm 5,$ and solving the second gives $x = 3.$ The third equation implies that $x = 1,$ in which case $25 - x^2 = 24$ is indeed even, so $x = 1$ is a valid solution.

=======
To solve the equation $f(f(x)) = 4,$ we first find the values $x$ such that $f(x) = 4.$

Either $f(x) = -x + 3$ (for $x \le 0$) or $f(x) = 2x - 5$ (for $x > 0$). If $-x + 3 = 4,$ then $x = -1.$ Note that this value satisfies $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = 4,$ then $x = 9/2.$ Note that this value satisfies $x > 0.$ Therefore, the solutions to $f(x) = 4$ are $x = -1$ and $x = 9/2.$

Next, we solve for the values $x$ such that $f(x) = -1.$ If $-x + 3 = -1,$ then $x = 4.$ This value does not satisfy $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = -1,$ then $x = 2.$ This value satisfies $x > 0.$

Finally, we solve for the values $x$ such that $f(x) = 9/2.$ If $-x + 3 = 9/2,$ then $x = -3/2.$ This value satisfies $x \le 0.$ If $2x - 5 = 9/2,$ then $x = 19/4.$ This value satisfies $x > 0.$

Therefore, the equation $f(f(x)) = 4$ has the solutions $x = 2,$ $-3/2,$ and $19/4,$ for a total of $\boxed{3}$ solutions. The answer is $\boxed{3}$

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $2$. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ oscillates between $1$ and $2$ for $x$ in the real numbers. Therefore, we have $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which implies $100 < m < 200$. The number of positive integers $m$ in this range is $200 - 100 - 1 = 99$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $99$.

To solve the problem, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. 
>>>>>>> 89a3ad19af0c82816952bbe7552084c95da6e171

First, we can rewrite the equation as $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. We know that the left side of the equation is always nonnegative, so the right side must also be nonnegative, which implies $m \ge 0$. However, since $m$ is a positive integer, we must have $m > 0$. So the smallest possible value for $m$ is $1$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many solutions does the equation \[\frac{(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)\dotsm(x-100)}{(x-1^2)(x-2^2)(x-3^2)\dotsm(x-100^2)} = 0\]have for $x$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Any solution to this equation must make the numerator of the left-hand side zero, while keeping the denominator non-zero. The numerator is zero when $x$ is one of the numbers $1, 2, 3, \dots, 100.$ However, for any value in this list that is a perfect square, the denominator will also be zero, so that value of $x$ will not be a root. Therefore, we want to find the number of integers in the list $1, 2, \dots, 100$ which are not perfect squares. The perfect squares in the list are $1^2, 2^2, \dots, 10^2,$ so there are $10$ perfect squares, and \[100 - 10 = \boxed{90}\]integers which are not perfect squares. The answer is $\boxed{90}$
=======
Now, let's consider the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. The right side $\frac{m}{100}$ is a positive number, so the left side $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ must be equal to a positive number. This means that $\vert x-1 \vert -2$ must be equal to a positive number. So $\vert x-1 \vert$ must be greater than $2$, which implies $x-1 > 2$ or $x-1 < -2$. This gives us $x > 3$ or $x < -1$.

Now, let's consider the case $x > 3$. In this case, $\vert x-1 \vert = x-1$, so the equation becomes $x-1 -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, or $x-3 = \frac{m}{100}$. This gives us $x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$. Since $x > 3$, we must have $\frac{m}{100} + 3 > 3$, or $\frac{m}{100} > 0$. This implies $m > 0$. So for $x > 3$, we must have $m > 0$.

Similarly, for $x < -1$, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = 1-x$, so the equation becomes $1-x -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, or $x+1 = \frac{m}{100}$. This gives us $x = \frac{m}{100} - 1$. Since $x < -1$, we must have $\frac{m}{100} - 1 < -1$, or $\frac{m}{100} < 0$. This implies $m < 0$. But we know that $m$ is a positive integer, so this case is not possible.

So the only case we need to consider is $x > 3$. In this case, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} + 3$ is greater than $3$ and less than $5$. This gives us $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, or $0 < m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ in this range are $1, 2, \ldots, 199$. However, we must also have $m$ such that $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

To find the values of $m$ for which this is true, we can plot the graph of $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ and the lines $y = \frac{m}{100}$ for $m = 1, 2, \ldots, 199$. The graph of $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ consists of three line segments: a line segment from $(-\infty, -1)$ with slope $1$, a line segment from $(-1, 3)$ with slope $-1$, and a line segment from $(3, \infty)$ with slope $1$. The lines $y = \frac{m}{100}$ for $m = 1, 2, \ldots, 199$ are horizontal lines.

By observing the graph, we can see that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions for $m = 1, 2, \ldots, 199$ except for $m = 200$. This is because when $m = 200$, the line $y = \frac{200}{100} = 2$ is outside the range of the graph of $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $199$. The answer is: $199$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We are given the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ and we want to find for how many positive integers $m$ it has 4 distinct solutions.

2. The function `solve` in Sympy can only solve equations for one variable. However, we can use a numerical approach to find the values of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions.

3. We will start by setting a range for $m$ and check for each value of $m$ how many distinct solutions the equation has.

4. To check for the number of distinct solutions, we can set up the equation and use a loop to vary the value of $m$. For each value of $m$, we can solve the equation and count the number of distinct solutions.

5. If the equation has 4 distinct solutions for a given value of $m$, we can increment a counter.

6. After iterating over all values of $m$, the counter will hold the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions.

Here's the Python code to do this:
>>>>>>> 89a3ad19af0c82816952bbe7552084c95da6e171

The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $100$. However, we are asked to find the number of positive integers $m$ that make the equation have exactly $4$ distinct solutions. Therefore, we need to consider the values of $m$ that result in a valid equation. Since $m$ is a positive integer and $\frac{m}{100}$ must be a non-negative number, the maximum value of $m$ is $100$. However, for $m = 100$, the equation becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=1$, which is a valid equation with $4$ distinct solutions. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that make the equation have exactly $4$ distinct solutions is $1$. The answer is $\boxed{1}$.

The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $100$. However, this result does not match the expected answer. We made a mistake in our approach. Let's reevaluate our steps and correct it.

Upon reevaluating our steps, we realize that we have solved the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ for a single value of $m$ each time, and then incremented the count if the number of solutions is $4$. However, we need to find the number of values of $m$ for which the equation has exactly $4$ distinct solutions.

Let's correct our approach:

```python

The output is still $0$. This indicates that our code is not working as expected. Let's try a different approach.

We can observe that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $1$. This is because the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, oscillates between $-1$ and $1$ for $4$ distinct values of $x$. Therefore, the value of $m$ that works is $100$.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $1$.

The value of $m$ that works is $100$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $1$.

The answer is $\boxed{1}$.

**Problem:** 
"How many solutions does the equation \[\frac{(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)\dotsm(x-100)}{(x-1^2)(x-2^2)(x-3^2)\dotsm(x-100^2)} = 0\]have for $x$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Any solution to this equation must make the numerator of the left-hand side zero, while keeping the denominator non-zero. The numerator is zero when $x$ is one of the numbers $1, 2, 3, \dots, 100.$ However, for any value in this list that is a perfect square, the denominator will also be zero, so that value of $x$ will not be a root. Therefore, we want to find the number of integers in the list $1, 2, \dots, 100$ which are not perfect squares. The perfect squares in the list are $1^2, 2^2, \dots, 10^2,$ so there are $10$ perfect squares, and \[100 - 10 = \boxed{90}\]integers which are not perfect squares. The answer is $\boxed{90}$

**Problem:** 
"How many integers are solutions to the equation $$(x-2)^{(25-x^2)}=1?$$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
We need some basic facts from number theory: $a^0 = 1$ for any $a,$ $1^b = 1$ for any $b,$ and $(-1)^c = 1$ if $c$ is an even integer. Unless the base is a complex number (which is excluded since we are looking for integer solutions), there are no other ways to get an RHS of $1.$ Thus, either the exponent is zero $($giving the equation $25 - x^2 = 0),$ the base is $1$ $($giving $x -2 = 1),$ or the base is $-1$ and the exponent is even $($giving the simultaneous equations $x - 2 = -1$ and $25 - x^2 = 2n$ for some integer $n).$ Solving the first equation gives $x = \pm 5,$ and solving the second gives $x = 3.$ The third equation implies that $x = 1,$ in which case $25 - x^2 = 24$ is indeed even, so $x = 1$ is a valid solution. In all, there are $\boxed{4}$ integer solutions. The answer is $\boxed{4}$

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly $4$ distinct solutions.

First, we need to understand the behavior of the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. This function has $4$ distinct pieces:

1. For $x < -1$, $f(x) = -(x - 1) - 2 = -x - 1$.
2. For $-1 \leq x < 1$, $f(x) = -(x - 1) - 2 = -x + 1$.
3. For $1 \leq x < 3$, $f(x) = (x - 1) - 2 = x - 3$.
4. For $x \geq 3$, $f(x) = (x - 1) - 2 = x - 3$.

So, the function $f(x)$ is a "V" shape with the "bottom" of the "V" at $x = 1$. The value of the function at this point is $f(1) = 2$.

Now, we want to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly $4$ distinct solutions. This is equivalent to finding the number of values of $m$ for which the line $y = \frac{m}{100}$ intersects the "V" shape of $f(x)$ exactly $4$ times.

The line $y = \frac{m}{100}$ intersects the "V" shape at its "bottom" (where $y = 2$) when $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, so $m = 200$. This is the only value of $m$ for which the line intersects the "V" shape exactly $4$ times.

Therefore, the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly $4$ distinct solutions is $m = 200$. The answer is $\boxed{200}$.
