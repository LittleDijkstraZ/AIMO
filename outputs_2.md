**Problem:** 
"How many solutions does the equation \[\frac{(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)\dotsm(x-100)}{(x-1^2)(x-2^2)(x-3^2)\dotsm(x-100^2)} = 0\]have for $x$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Any solution to this equation must make the numerator of the left-hand side zero, while keeping the denominator non-zero. The numerator is zero when $x$ is one of the numbers $1, 2, 3, \dots, 100.$ However, for any value in this list that is a perfect square, the denominator will also be zero, so that value of $x$ will not be a root. Therefore, we want to find the number of integers in the list $1, 2, \dots, 100$ which are not perfect squares. The perfect squares in the list are $1^2, 2^2, \dots, 10^2,$ so there are $10$ perfect squares, and \[100 - 10 = \boxed{90}\]integers which are not perfect squares. The answer is $\boxed{90}$

**Solution:**


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 1$. Therefore, $m = 100$.

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"

Assistant:

 To solve this problem, we need to analyze the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ and find the values of $m$ for which it has $4$ distinct solutions.

The expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a piecewise function that can take on three different forms depending on the value of $x$:

1. If $x < 1$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \vert -x+1 - 2 \vert = \vert -x - 1 \vert = x + 1 + 2 = x + 3$.
2. If $1 \leq x < 3$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \vert x - 1 - 2 \vert = \vert x - 3 \vert = 3 - x$.
3. If $x \geq 3$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \vert x - 1 - 2 \vert = \vert x - 3 \vert = x - 3$.

So the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be rewritten as one of the following three equations depending on the value of $x$:

1. If $x < 1$, then $x + 3 = \frac{m}{100}$.
2. If $1 \leq x < 3$, then $3 - x = \frac{m}{100}$.
3. If $x \geq 3$, then $x - 3 = \frac{m}{100}$.

For each of these equations, we need to find the number of distinct solutions and check if it equals $4$.

1. If $x + 3 = \frac{m}{100}$, then $x = \frac{m}{100} - 3$. The number of distinct solutions is determined by the number of integer values of $x$ that satisfy $x < 1$. This happens when $\frac{m}{100} - 3 < 1$, or $\frac{m}{100} < 4$, or $m < 400$.

2. If $3 - x = \frac{m}{100}$, then $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$. The number of distinct solutions is determined by the number of integer values of $x$ that satisfy $1 \leq x < 3$. This happens when $1 \leq 3 - \frac{m}{100} < 3$, or $0 \leq -\frac{m}{100} < 2$, or $0 \leq m < 200$.

3. If $x - 3 = \frac{m}{100}$, then $x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$. The number of distinct solutions is determined by the number of integer values of $x$ that satisfy $x \geq 3$. This happens when $\frac{m}{100} + 3 \geq 3$, or $\frac{m}{100} \geq 0$, or $m \geq 0$.

Combining these three conditions, we find that the values of $m$ that satisfy all three conditions and give $4$ distinct solutions are those that satisfy $0 < m < 200$. The number of positive integers in this range is $199$.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $199$. The answer is: $199$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We first need to understand that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions. This implies that the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be equal to $2$.

2. So, we set $\frac{m}{100}$ to $2$ and solve for $m$: $m = 200$.

3. Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ that makes the equation have four distinct solutions, and that is $m = 200$.

The answer is: $200$.

Assistant:

 The problem is asking for how many positive integers $m$ does the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have $4$ distinct solutions.

This equation is equivalent to a piecewise function with four cases, which can be solved by considering each case separately.

The number of solutions to the equation will be the number of times the piecewise function intersects the horizontal line $y = \frac{m}{100}$.

The piecewise function has the form:

- If $x < 1$, then $f(x) = |-(x-1) - 2| = | -x + 1 - 2| = | -x - 1| = x + 1 + 2 = x + 3$.
- If $1 \le x < 3$, then $f(x) = |x - 1 - 2| = |x - 3| = 3 - x$.
- If $3 \le x < 5$, then $f(x) = |x - 1 - 2| = |x - 3| = x - 3$.
- If $x \ge 5$, then $f(x) = |x - 1 - 2| = |x - 3| = x - 3$.

The function intersects the horizontal line $y = \frac{m}{100}$ four times if $\frac{m}{100}$ is in the interval $(1, 2)$. This occurs when $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which is equivalent to $100 < m < 200$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is the number of integers in the interval $(100, 200)$, which is $100$.

So, the answer is $\boxed{200}$.

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The number of distinct solutions to the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $4$ if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 1$.
To see this, consider the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$.
The graph of $f(x)$ has a shape of a "V" with $4$ branches.
The distance between each pair of branches is $1$.
Therefore, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 1$.
Solving this equation gives $m = 100$.
Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $1$.
The answer is: $1$
