**Problem:** 
"How many integers are solutions to the equation $$(x-2)^{(25-x^2)}=1?$$"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
We need some basic facts from number theory: $a^0 = 1$ for any $a,$ $1^b = 1$ for any $b,$ and $(-1)^c = 1$ if $c$ is an even integer. Unless the base is a complex number (which is excluded since we are looking for integer solutions), there are no other ways to get an RHS of $1.$ Thus, either the exponent is zero $($giving the equation $25 - x^2 = 0),$ the base is $1$ $($giving $x -2 = 1),$ or the base is $-1$ and the exponent is even $($giving the simultaneous equations $x - 2 = -1$ and $25 - x^2 = 2n$ for some integer $n).$ Solving the first equation gives $x = \pm 5,$ and solving the second gives $x = 3.$ The third equation implies that $x = 1,$ in which case $25 - x^2 = 24$ is indeed even, so $x = 1$ is a valid solution. In all, there are $\boxed{4}$ integer solutions. The answer is $\boxed{4}$

**Problem**
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $2$. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ oscillates between $1$ and $2$ for $x$ in the real numbers. Therefore, we have $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which implies $100 < m < 200$. The number of positive integers $m$ in this range is $200 - 100 - 1 = 99$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $99$.

    upper_bound = 200
    number_of_m = upper_bound - lower_bound - 1
    return number_of_m

result = number_of_m()

The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $99$. The answer is $\boxed{99}$.

**Example**

**Problem:** 
"How many solutions does the equation \[\frac{(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)\dotsm(x-100)}{(x-1^2)(x-2^2)(x-3^2)\dotsm(x-100^2)} = 0\]have for $x$?"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Any solution to this equation must make the numerator of the left-hand side zero, while keeping the denominator non-zero. The numerator is zero when $x$ is one of the numbers $1, 2, 3, \dots, 100.$ However, for any value in this list that is a perfect square, the denominator will also be zero, so that value of $x$ will not be a root. Therefore, we want to find the number of integers in the list $1, 2, \dots, 100$ which are not perfect squares. The perfect squares in the list are $1^2, 2^2, \dots, 10^2,$ so there are $10$ perfect squares, and \[100 - 10 = \boxed{90}\]integers which are not perfect squares. The answer is $\boxed{90}$

The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $100$. However, we are asked to find the number of positive integers $m$ that make the equation have exactly $4$ distinct solutions. Therefore, we need to consider the values of $m$ that result in a valid equation. Since $m$ is a positive integer and $\frac{m}{100}$ must be a non-negative number, the maximum value of $m$ is $100$. However, for $m = 100$, the equation becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=1$, which is a valid equation with $4$ distinct solutions. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that make the equation have exactly $4$ distinct solutions is $1$. The answer is $\boxed{1}$.

**Solution:** 


To solve this problem, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly $4$ distinct solutions.

First, we need to understand the behavior of the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. This function has $4$ distinct pieces:

1. For $x < -1$, $f(x) = -(x - 1) - 2 = -x - 1$.
2. For $-1 \leq x < 1$, $f(x) = -(x - 1) - 2 = -x + 1$.
3. For $1 \leq x < 3$, $f(x) = (x - 1) - 2 = x - 3$.
4. For $x \geq 3$, $f(x) = (x - 1) - 2 = x - 3$.

So, the function $f(x)$ is a "V" shape with the "bottom" of the "V" at $x = 1$. The value of the function at this point is $f(1) = 2$.

Now, we want to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly $4$ distinct solutions. This is equivalent to finding the number of values of $m$ for which the line $y = \frac{m}{100}$ intersects the "V" shape of $f(x)$ exactly $4$ times.

The line $y = \frac{m}{100}$ intersects the "V" shape at its "bottom" (where $y = 2$) when $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, so $m = 200$. This is the only value of $m$ for which the line intersects the "V" shape exactly $4$ times.

Therefore, the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly $4$ distinct solutions is $m = 200$. The answer is $\boxed{200}$.
