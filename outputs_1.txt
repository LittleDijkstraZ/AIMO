Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we rewrite the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ as $|2x-y| + |2y-x| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, $|a| + |b| \ge |a+b|$, so $|2x-y| + |2y-x| \ge |(2x-y) + (2y-x)| = |x+y|$.
Therefore, we have $|x+y| = 40$.
Now let $A = x+y$ and $B = x-2y$. Then we can rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x+y)^2 - 2xy] - 8xy = 5[A^2 - 2xy] - 8xy = 5A^2 - 18xy$.
We also have $B = x-2y \implies x = B+2y \implies y = \frac{x-B}{2} \implies xy = x\left(\frac{x-B}{2}\right) = \frac{x^2 - Bx}{2}$.
Substituting this into the expression $5A^2 - 18xy$, we get $5A^2 - 18\left(\frac{x^2 - Bx}{2}\right) = 5A^2 - 9(x^2 - Bx) = 5A^2 - 9x^2 + 9Bx$.
Now, from the equation $|x+y| = 40$, we know that $A = 40$, so the expression becomes $5(40)^2 - 9x^2 + 9Bx = 8000 - 9x^2 + 9Bx$.
To minimize this expression, we need to minimize $9Bx - 9x^2$.
By completing the square, we get $9Bx - 9x^2 = -9(x^2 - Bx) = -9\left(x^2 - Bx + \frac{B^2}{4} - \frac{B^2}{4}\right) = -9\left(\left(x - \frac{B}{2}\right)^2 - \frac{B^2}{4}\right) = -9\left(x - \frac{B}{2}\right)^2 + \frac{9B^2}{4}$.
The expression $-9\left(x - \frac{B}{2}\right)^2 + \frac{9B^2}{4}$ is minimized when $x = \frac{B}{2}$, at which point it equals $\frac{9B^2}{4}$.
Substituting $B = x-2y$ into $x = \frac{B}{2}$, we get $x = \frac{x-2y}{2} \implies 2x = x-2y \implies x = -2y$.
Substituting this into $x+y = 40$, we get $-y+y = 40$, which is a contradiction.
However, we made a mistake in our calculations. We assumed that $x = \frac{B}{2}$ would minimize the expression, but it turns out that the minimum is actually achieved when $x = \frac{B}{3}$.
So we have $9Bx - 9x^2 = -9\left(x^2 - Bx + \frac{B^2}{9} - \frac{B^2}{9}\right) = -9\left(\left(x - \frac{B}{3}\right)^2 - \frac{B^2}{9}\right) = -9\left(x - \frac{B}{3}\right)^2 + \frac{B^2}{3}$.
This expression is minimized when $x = \frac{B}{3}$, at which point it equals $\frac{B^2}{3}$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is achieved when $x = \frac{B}{3}$, and substituting this into the equation $x+y = 40$, we get $y = 40 - x = 40 - \frac{B}{3}$.
Substituting these values into $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get $5\left(\frac{B}{3}\right)^2 + 5\left(40 - \frac{B}{3}\right)^2 - 8\left(\frac{B}{3}\right)\left(40 - \frac{B}{3}\right)$.
Evaluating this expression, we find that it equals $\frac{2B^2}{3} + 5\left(1600 - \frac{80B}{3} + \frac{B^2}{9}\right) - \frac{320B}{3} + \frac{8B^2}{9}$.
Simplifying this, we get $\frac{2B^2}{3} + 8000 - \frac{400B}{3} + \frac{5B^2}{9} - \frac{320B}{3} + \frac{8B^2}{9}$.
Combining like terms, we get $\frac{13B^2}{9} - \frac{800B}{3} + 8000$.
Now, since $B = x-2y$, we can substitute this back into the expression. We have $B = x-2y \implies x = B+2y \implies y = \frac{x-B}{2}$.
Substituting $y = \frac{x-B}{2}$ into $x+y = 40$, we get $x + \frac{x-B}{2} = 40 \implies 2x + x - B = 80 \implies 3x - B = 80$.
Therefore, $B = 3x - 80$.
Substituting this into the expression $\frac{13B^2}{9} - \frac{800B}{3} + 8000$, we get $\frac{13(3x-80)^2}{9} - \frac{800(3x-80)}{3} + 8000$.
Expanding and simplifying, we find that this expression equals $-\frac{39x^2}{3} + 10400x - 104000$.
This is a quadratic function in $x$, and its minimum value is achieved at $x = \frac{-b}{2a} = \frac{-10400}{-78} = \frac{5200}{39}$.
Substituting this value of $x$ back into the equation $x+y = 40$, we get $y = 40 - x = 40 - \frac{5200}{39\cdot 3} = \frac{240}{39}$.
Substituting the values of $

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, let's denote $A = x - 2y$ and $B = y - 2x$. Then, we have $|A| + |B| = 40$. 

Now, let's consider the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$. We can rewrite this as $\frac{1}{2}(5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy) = \frac{1}{2}((x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2)$. 

So, $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = \frac{1}{2}(A^2 + B^2)$.

Now, using the triangle inequality, we know that $|A| + |B| \geq |A + B|$. Substituting the given $|A| + |B| = 40$, we get $40 \geq |A + B|$. 

Since $A + B = (x - 2y) + (y - 2x) = -x - y$, we have $|A + B| = |-x - y| = |-(x + y)| = |x + y|$. 

So, $40 \geq |x + y|$. 

Now, let's consider the expression $\frac{1}{2}(A^2 + B^2) = \frac{1}{2}((x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2)$. 

Expanding this out, we get $\frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2 + y^2 - 4yx + 4x^2) = \frac{1}{2}(5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy) = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 2(x^2 + y^2 - 2xy) = x^2 + y^2 - 2xy$. 

Now, using the inequality $|x + y| \leq |x| + |y|$, we have $|x + y|^2 \leq (|x| + |y|)^2$, or $(x + y)^2 \leq (|x| + |y|)^2 = x^2 + 2|x||y| + y^2$. 

So, we have $1600 \geq (x + y)^2 \geq x^2 + 2|x||y| + y^2$. 

Rearranging this inequality, we get $x^2 + y^2 - 2|x||y| \leq 1600$. 

Since $-2|x||y| \leq -2xy$, we have $x^2 + y^2 - 2xy \leq 1600$, or $x^2 + y^2 - 2xy \leq 1600$. 

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is $0$, when $x = 2y$ and $y = 2x$. 

However, when we substitute these conditions into the equation $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$, we get $0 + 0 = 40$, which is not possible. 

So, let's consider the case when $x = -2y$ and $y = -2x$. Substituting these conditions into the equation $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$, we get $|x + 2y| + |-y + 2x| = 40$. This is true, so the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is achieved when $x = -2y$ and $y = -2x$.

Substituting $x = -2y$ into $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$, we get $5(-2y)^2 + 5y^2 - 8(-2y)y = 20y^2 + 5y^2 + 16y^2 = 41y^2$.

And substituting $y = -2x$ into $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$, we also get $5x^2 + 5(-2x)^2 - 8x(-2x) = 5x^2 + 20x^2 + 16x^2 = 41x^2$.

Since $41y^2 = 41x^2$, we have $y^2 = x^2$. Since $y = -2x$, we have $y^2 = 4x^2$. So, $x^2 = y^2$. 

And since $x = -2y$, we have $x^2 = 4y^2$. So, $y^2 = 4y^2$. This implies that $y^2 = 0$, or $y = 0$. 

Since $y = -2x$, we have $0 = -2x$, or $x = 0$. 

However, this contradicts the condition $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$. So, there must be another way to achieve the minimum value.

Let's consider the case when $x = 2y$ and $y = 2x$. Substituting these conditions into the equation $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$, we get $|x - 4x| + |2y - 4y| = 40$, or $|-3x| + |-2y| = 40$, or $3|x| + 2|y| = 40$. 

Now, since $|x| = \frac{40}{3}$ and $|y| = \frac{20}{3}$, we can substitute these values into $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ to get $5(\frac{40}{3})^2 + 5(\frac{20}{3})^2 - 8(\frac{40}{3})(\frac{20}{3}) = \frac{8000}{9}$.

So, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is $\frac{8000}{9}$, when $x = 2y$ and $y = 2x$. 

However, this also contradicts the condition $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$. So, there must be another way to achieve the minimum value.

Let's consider the case when $x = -2y$ and $y = -2x$. Substituting these conditions into the equation $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$, we get $|-x + 4y| + |-y + 4x| = 40$, or $|-x + 4(-2

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ can be rewritten as $5(x^2 - \frac{8}{5}xy + y^2) = 5[(x - \frac{4}{5}y)^2 + \frac{1}{5}y^2]$.
Similarly, the expression $|x-2y| + |y-2x|$ can be rewritten as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = |x-2y| + |-1(x-2y)| = |x-2y| + |x-2y| = 2|x-2y|$.
We are given that $2|x-2y| = 40$, so $|x-2y| = 20$.
Now we want to minimize $5[(x - \frac{4}{5}y)^2 + \frac{1}{5}y^2]$.
Since $|x-2y| = 20$, we can rewrite this as $|x-2y| = \sqrt{(x-2y)^2} = \sqrt{(x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2)} = 20$.
Then, we square both sides to get $(x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2) = 400$.
Rearranging terms, we get $x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2 - 400 = 0$.
This equation can be rewritten as $(x - 2y)^2 - 400 = 0$.
So $(x - 2y)^2 = 400$.
Taking the square root of both sides, we get $x - 2y = \pm 20$.
Without loss of generality, let's assume $x - 2y = 20$.
Then, solving for $y$, we get $y = \frac{x - 20}{2}$.
Substituting this into the expression $5[(x - \frac{4}{5}y)^2 + \frac{1}{5}y^2]$, we get
\[5\left[\left(x - \frac{4}{5}\left(\frac{x - 20}{2}\right)\right)^2 + \frac{1}{5}\left(\frac{x - 20}{2}\right)^2\right] = 5\left[\left(x - \frac{2}{5}(x - 20)\right)^2 + \frac{1}{20}(x - 20)^2\right].\]
Expanding and simplifying, we get
\[5\left[\left(\frac{3}{5}x + \frac{4}{5} \cdot 20\right)^2 + \frac{1}{20}(x - 20)^2\right] = 5\left[\left(\frac{3}{5}x + 16\right)^2 + \frac{1}{20}(x - 20)^2\right].\]
This is a quadratic function with minimum value when $x = -\frac{b}{2a} = -\frac{-96}{2 \cdot \frac{3}{5}} = 80$.
Substituting $x = 80$ into the equation $y = \frac{x - 20}{2}$, we get $y = \frac{80 - 20}{2} = 30$.
Substituting $x = 80$ and $y = 30$ into the expression $5[(x - \frac{4}{5}y)^2 + \frac{1}{5}y^2]$, we get
\[5\left[\left(80 - \frac{4}{5} \cdot 30\right)^2 + \frac{1}{5} \cdot 30^2\right] = 5\left[\left(80 - 24\right)^2 + \frac{1}{5} \cdot 900\right] = 5 \cdot (56^2 + 180) = 5 \cdot (3136 + 180) = 5 \cdot 3316 = 16580.\]
So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 16580. The answer is: 16580

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, let's simplify the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.

By the property of absolute value, we can write $|a-b| = |-(b-a)|$, so the equation can be rewritten as $|x-2y| + |-(x-2y)| = 40$.

This simplifies to $|x-2y| + |-1| \cdot |x-2y| = 40$, which further simplifies to $2|x-2y| = 40$.

So $|x-2y| = 20$. This means either $x-2y = 20$ or $x-2y = -20$.

Now let's express $y$ in terms of $x$ from these two equations:

For $x-2y = 20$, we have $y = \frac{x}{2} - 10$.

For $x-2y = -20$, we have $y = \frac{x}{2} + 10$.

Now we substitute these expressions for $y$ into the expression we want to minimize: $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.

For $y = \frac{x}{2} - 10$, we have
\[5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5x^2+5\left(\frac{x}{2} - 10\right)^2 - 8x\left(\frac{x}{2} - 10\right).\]

Simplifying this gives
\[5x^2+5\left(\frac{x^2}{4} - 10x + 100\right) - 4x^2 + 80x = \frac{x^2}{4} + 80x + 500.\]

For $y = \frac{x}{2} + 10$, we have
\[5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5x^2+5\left(\frac{x}{2} + 10\right)^2 - 8x\left(\frac{x}{2} + 10\right).\]

Simplifying this gives
\[5x^2+5\left(\frac{x^2}{4} + 10x + 100\right) - 4x^2 - 80x = \frac{x^2}{4} - 80x + 500.\]

Now we can compare the two expressions. We can see that the expression for $y = \frac{x}{2} - 10$ is always greater than or equal to the expression for $y = \frac{x}{2} + 10$.

So to find the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we just need to minimize the expression for $y = \frac{x}{2} - 10$.

Setting the derivative of this expression with respect to $x$ equal to zero gives
\[\frac{x}{2} = 40,\]
which implies $x = 80$.

Substituting $x = 80$ into the equation $y = \frac{x}{2} - 10$ gives $y = 30$.

Substituting $x = 80$ and $y = 30$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ gives
\[5(80)^2 + 5(30)^2 - 8(80)(30) = 32000 + 4500 - 24000 = 13500.\]

So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 13500.
The answer is: 13500

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



Given the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we can split it into two cases based on the signs of $x-2y$ and $y-2x$.

Case 1: $x-2y \ge 0$ and $y-2x \ge 0$. This means $x \ge 2y$ and $y \ge 2x$. Substituting these inequalities into the equation gives $x - 2y + y - 2x = 40$, which simplifies to $-x - y = 40$. This is a contradiction because both $x$ and $y$ cannot be negative at the same time.

Case 2: $x-2y < 0$ and $y-2x < 0$. This means $x < 2y$ and $y < 2x$. Substituting these inequalities into the equation gives $-(x - 2y) - (y - 2x) = 40$, which simplifies to $x - 2y + 2x - y = 40$, and further simplifies to $3x - 3y = 40$. Dividing both sides by 3 gives $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$.

Now we need to minimize $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the condition $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$. We can rewrite the expression as $5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy$.

Using the identity $(x - y)^2 = x^2 + y^2 - 2xy$, we can express $xy$ in terms of $x - y$ and $x + y$. From $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$, we get $x + y = \frac{3}{2}(x - y) + y = \frac{3}{2} \cdot \frac{40}{3} + y = 20 + y$.

Substituting $x + y = 20 + y$ into the equation $(x - y)^2 = x^2 + y^2 - 2xy$ gives $\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 = (20 + y)^2 - 2xy$, which simplifies to $\frac{1600}{9} = 400 + 40y + y^2 - 2xy$.

Rearranging terms gives $2xy - 40y = y^2 - \frac{1600}{9} + 400$.

Since we want to minimize $5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy$, we want to minimize $-8xy$. From the equation above, we have $-8xy = -8(2xy - 40y) = -16xy + 320y = -16(y^2 - \frac{1600}{9} + 400) + 320y = -16y^2 + \frac{25600}{9} - 6400 + 320y$.

The minimum value of this expression is attained when the derivative with respect to $y$ is zero. Taking the derivative gives $-32y + \frac{25600}{9} - 6400 + 320 = 0$. Solving for $y$ gives $y = \frac{17600}{2880} = \frac{11}{18}$.

Substituting $y = \frac{11}{18}$ into the equation $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$ gives $x = \frac{40}{3} + \frac{11}{18} = \frac{240 + 11}{18} = \frac{251}{18}$.

Finally, substituting $x = \frac{251}{18}$ and $y = \frac{11}{18}$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ gives
\[5\left(\frac{251}{18}\right)^2 + 5\left(\frac{11}{18}\right)^2 - 8\cdot\frac{251}{18}\cdot\frac{11}{18} = -\frac{8845}{162} < 0.\]
This is impossible because the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is always nonnegative. We must have made a mistake in our calculations. Let's go back and check our work.

Upon re-examining our calculations, we realized that we made a mistake in the equation $-(x - 2y) - (y - 2x) = 40$. We should have $-(x - 2y) + (y - 2x) = 40$. This gives $x - 2y - y + 2x = 40$, and further simplifies to $3x - y = 40$. Dividing both sides by 3 gives $x - \frac{y}{3} = \frac{40}{3}$.

Now we need to minimize $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the condition $x - \frac{y}{3} = \frac{40}{3}$. We can rewrite the expression as $5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy$.

Using the identity $(x - \frac{y}{3})^2 = x^2 + \frac{y^2}{9} - \frac{2xy}{3}$, we can express $xy$ in terms of $x - \frac{y}{3}$ and $x + y$. From $x - \frac{y}{3} = \frac{40}{3}$, we get $x + y = 3\left(x - \frac{y}{3}\right) + y = 3 \cdot \frac{40}{3} + y = 40 + y$.

Substituting $x + y = 40 + y$ into the equation $(x - \frac{y}{3})^2 = x^2 + \frac{y^2}{9} - \frac{2xy}{3}$ gives $\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 = (40 + y)^2 - \frac{2}{3}xy$, which simplifies to $\frac{1600}{9} = 1600 + 80y + y^2 - \frac{2}{3}xy$.

Rearranging terms gives $\frac{2}{3}xy - 80y = y^2 - \frac{1600}{9} + 1600$.

Since we want to minimize $5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy$, we want to minimize $-8xy$. From the equation above, we have $-8xy = -8\left(\frac{2}{3}xy - 80y\right) = -\frac{16}{3}xy +

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we notice that the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is equivalent to $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$, which simplifies to $|x-2y| - |x-2y| = 40$. This is obviously not possible, so there must be a mistake in our reasoning.
Let's try to solve the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ again. We can rewrite it as $|x-2y| + |-1*(x-2y)| = 40$. Since $|a| + |b| = |a+b|$ if $a$ and $b$ have the same sign, and $|a| + |-b| = |a-b|$ if $a$ and $b$ have opposite signs, we can simplify the equation to $|x-2y + x-2y| = 40$ if $x-2y$ and $y-2x$ have the same sign, or $|x-2y - (x-2y)| = 40$ if $x-2y$ and $y-2x$ have opposite signs. In the first case, we get $|2(x-2y)| = 40$, or $2|x-2y| = 40$, so $|x-2y| = 20$. In the second case, we get $|-2(x-2y)| = 40$, or $2|x-2y| = 40$, so $|x-2y| = 20$ again.
Now let's solve the inequality $|x-2y| = 20$. This gives us two cases:
1) $x-2y = 20$: In this case, we can solve for $y$ to get $y = \frac{x}{2} - 10$.
2) $x-2y = -20$: In this case, we can solve for $y$ to get $y = \frac{x}{2} + 10$.
Substituting these expressions for $y$ into the given expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we can simplify it to:
1) $5x^2+5\left(\frac{x}{2} - 10\right)^2 - 8x\left(\frac{x}{2} - 10\right) = 5x^2+5\left(\frac{x^2}{4} - 10x + 100\right) - 4x^2 + 80x = \frac{x^2}{4} - 10x + 500$.
2) $5x^2+5\left(\frac{x}{2} + 10\right)^2 - 8x\left(\frac{x}{2} + 10\right) = 5x^2+5\left(\frac{x^2}{4} + 10x + 100\right) - 4x^2 - 80x = \frac{x^2}{4} + 10x + 500$.
In both cases, we can see that the expression is minimized when $x=0$. Substituting $x=0$ into either expression for $y$, we get $y = \pm 10$. Thus, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is achieved when $x=0$ and $y=\pm 10$, and is equal to $5(0)^2+5(10)^2-8(0)(10) = 500$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 500.
The answer is: 500

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we need to solve the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, we have $|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |(x-2y) - (y-2x)| = |x-2y-y+2x| = |3x-3y| = 3|x-y|$.
Thus, $3|x-y| = 40$, so $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$.
Now, let's substitute $z = x-y$. Then, $y = x - z$, and we have $|z| = \frac{40}{3}$.
We can rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $5(x^2+y^2)-8xy = 5[(x-y)^2+2xy] - 8xy = 5[z^2+2(x-z)y] - 8xy = 5z^2+10xy - 8xy = 5z^2+2xy$.
Since $z = x - y$, we have $y = x - z$, so $xy = x(x - z) = x^2 - xz$.
Thus, $5z^2+2xy = 5z^2+2(x^2 - xz) = 5z^2+2x^2 - 2xz$.
Now, we want to minimize this expression. Since $z = \frac{40}{3}$, we have $5z^2 = 5\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{8000}{9}$.
To minimize the expression, we want to minimize $2x^2 - 2xz = 2x(x - z)$. This occurs when $x = z = \frac{40}{3}$.
Thus, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $5z^2+2xz = \frac{8000}{9} + 2\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{8000}{9} + \frac{3200}{9} = \frac{11200}{9}$.
The minimum value is therefore $\frac{11200}{9}$.
The answer is: $\frac{11200}{9}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $5(x^2+y^2)-8xy$.
We know that $(x^2+y^2)-2xy=(x-y)^2$. So we can rewrite the expression as $5[(x-y)^2+2xy]-8xy = 5(x-y)^2 + 5(2xy) - 8xy = 5(x-y)^2 - 3xy$.
Now, let's look at the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. By the triangle inequality, we know that $|a+b| \leq |a| + |b|$, so $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |x-2y| + |2x-y| \geq |(x-2y) + (2x-y)| = |3x-3y| = 3|x-y|$. Therefore, $3|x-y| = 40$ and $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$.
Now, let's substitute $z = x-y$, so we have $|z| = \frac{40}{3}$.
Our expression now becomes $5z^2 - 3(y+z)y = 5z^2 - 3yz - 3y^2$.
To minimize this expression, we take the derivative with respect to $y$ and set it to zero: $-3z - 6y = 0$, so $y = -\frac{z}{2}$.
Now substitute $y = -\frac{z}{2}$ into our expression to get $5z^2 + \frac{9}{4}z^2 = \frac{29}{4}z^2$.
Since $|z| = \frac{40}{3}$, the minimum value of the expression is $\frac{29}{4} \left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{29 \cdot 1600}{36} = \frac{46400}{36} = \frac{11600}{9}$.
So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\frac{11600}{9}$. The answer is: $\frac{11600}{9}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we notice that the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is equivalent to $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$.
This can be rewritten as $|2y-x| + |x-2y| = 40$.
By the property of absolute value, we know that $|a| + |b| = |a+b|$ if and only if $ab \ge 0$.
In this case, we have $(2y-x)(x-2y) \ge 0$.
Expanding the expression, we get $-(x-2y)^2 \ge 0$.
This implies that $(x-2y)^2 \le 0$, and since the square of a real number is always non-negative, we must have $(x-2y)^2 = 0$.
This implies that $x-2y = 0$, or $x=2y$.

Now, substitute $x=2y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get
\[5(2y)^2+5y^2-8(2y)(y) = 20y^2+5y^2-16y^2 = 9y^2.\]
Since $y$ can be any real number, the minimum value of $9y^2$ is $0$, which occurs when $y=0$.
And since $x=2y$, when $y=0$, we have $x=0$.
So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $9(0)^2 = 0$. The answer is: 0

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To solve this problem, we first need to find the relationship between $x$ and $y$ from the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
Without loss of generality, we can assume that $x \geq y$. Then, the equation becomes:
\[(x-2y) + (2x-y) = 40.\]
Simplifying the left side gives:
\[3x-3y = 40,\]
\[x-y = \frac{40}{3}.\]
This means $x = y + \frac{40}{3}$. Now, we can substitute this back into the expression we want to minimize, $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
\[5\left(y + \frac{40}{3}\right)^2 + 5y^2 - 8y\left(y + \frac{40}{3}\right).\]
Expanding and simplifying gives:
\[5y^2 + 400y + \frac{8000}{9} + 5y^2 - 8y^2 - \frac{320y}{3} = \frac{1}{9}(54y^2 + 1200y + 8000).\]
Now, we can use the fact that the minimum value of $ax^2+bx+c$ occurs at $x = -\frac{b}{2a}$ to find the minimum value of this expression. The minimum value of $\frac{1}{9}(54y^2 + 1200y + 8000)$ occurs at $y = -\frac{1200}{2 \cdot 54} = -\frac{100}{9}$.
Substituting this back into the expression gives the minimum value:
\[\frac{1}{9}(54\left(-\frac{100}{9}\right)^2 + 1200\left(-\frac{100}{9}\right) + 8000) = \frac{1}{9}(5400 - 12000 + 8000) = \frac{1}{9}(1800) = 200.\]
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 200. The answer is: 200

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We are given the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
By the Triangle Inequality, we have $|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |x-2y + (y-2x)| = |x-2y-y+2x| = |x-3x+2y-y| = |-2x+y| = 2|y-x|$.
So, $2|y-x| = 40$, and thus $|y-x| = 20$.
This means $y-x = 20$ or $y-x = -20$.
We can solve these two cases separately.
Case 1: $y-x = 20$. Adding $x$ to both sides gives $y = x+20$.
Substituting this into the given expression, we have
\begin{align*}
5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy &= 5x^2 + 5(x+20)^2 - 8x(x+20) \\
&= 5x^2 + 5(x^2 + 40x + 400) - 8x^2 - 160x \\
&= 5x^2 + 5x^2 + 200x + 2000 - 8x^2 - 160x \\
&= 2x^2 + 40x + 2000.
\end{align*}
Let $f(x) = 2x^2 + 40x + 2000$. To find the minimum value of this quadratic function, we can find its vertex.
The $x$-coordinate of the vertex is $x = -\frac{b}{2a} = -\frac{40}{2(2)} = -10$.
Substituting this back into $f(x)$, we have $f(-10) = 2(-10)^2 + 40(-10) + 2000 = 200 - 400 + 2000 = 1800$.
Case 2: $y-x = -20$. Adding $x$ to both sides gives $y = x-20$.
Substituting this into the given expression, we have
\begin{align*}
5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy &= 5x^2 + 5(x-20)^2 - 8x(x-20) \\
&= 5x^2 + 5(x^2 - 40x + 400) - 8x^2 + 160x \\
&= 5x^2 + 5x^2 - 200x + 2000 - 8x^2 + 160x \\
&= -3x^2 - 40x + 2000.
\end{align*}
Let $g(x) = -3x^2 - 40x + 2000$. To find the minimum value of this quadratic function, we can find its vertex.
The $x$-coordinate of the vertex is $x = -\frac{b}{2a} = -\frac{-40}{2(-3)} = \frac{20}{3}$.
However, this value of $x$ does not satisfy the condition $|y-x| = 20$. So, we discard this case.

From case 1, we have found that the minimum value of the given expression is 1800.

So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 1800.
The answer is: $1800$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


Let $u = x - 2y$ and $v = y - 2x$. We are given that $|u| + |v| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, $|u| + |v| \geq |u + v|$. Thus, we have $|u + v| \leq 40$.
Since $u + v = (x - 2y) + (y - 2x) = -x - y$, we have $|-x - y| \leq 40$.
Now, let's consider the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$. We can rewrite it as
\[5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x - y)^2 + xy] - 8xy
= 5(x - y)^2 + xy.\]
By the AM-GM inequality, we have
\[(x - y)^2 \geq 0,\]
so $5(x - y)^2 \geq 0$. Thus,
\[5(x - y)^2 + xy \geq xy.\]
To minimize this expression, we need to maximize $xy$. But from $|u + v| \leq 40$, we have $|-x - y| \leq 40$, or $-40 \leq -x - y \leq 40$. Multiplying by $-1$ gives $40 \geq x + y \geq -40$.
Now, let's use the triangle inequality again. From $|u| + |v| = 40$, we have $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$. This simplifies to $|x - 2y| + |2x - y| = 40$. Again using the triangle inequality, we have
\[|(x - 2y) + (2x - y)| \leq 40,\]
which simplifies to $|3x - 3y| \leq 40$, or $|x - y| \leq \frac{40}{3}$.
By the AM-GM inequality, we have
\[xy \leq \left(\frac{x + y}{2}\right)^2 \leq \left(\frac{40}{6}\right)^2 = \frac{400}{9}.\]
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is $xy$, and its minimum value is $\frac{400}{9}$.
The answer is: $\boxed{\frac{400}{9}}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We are given the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
We can rewrite this as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$.
Using the property of absolute value $|a-b| = |b-a|$, we can simplify this to $|2y-x| + |x-2y| = 40$.
This equation is always true for all real numbers $x$ and $y$, so the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is always true.
Now we need to find the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.
We can rewrite this as $5(x^2+y^2)-8xy$.
Using the formula $(a-b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2$, we can rewrite $5(x^2+y^2)-8xy$ as $5[(x-y)^2 + 2xy] - 8xy$.
Simplifying further, we get $5(x-y)^2 + 2xy - 8xy = 5(x-y)^2 - 6xy$.
Now we want to minimize $5(x-y)^2 - 6xy$.
We know that $(x-y)^2$ and $xy$ are always non-negative.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5(x-y)^2 - 6xy$ occurs when $x=y$.
When $x=y$, the expression $5(x-y)^2 - 6xy$ simplifies to $5(0)^2 - 6x^2 = -6x^2$.
So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $-6x^2$.
To find the actual minimum value, we need to find the value of $x$ (or $y$) that minimizes $-6x^2$.
This occurs when $x=0$ (or $y=0$).
Substituting $x=0$ into the expression $-6x^2$, we get $-6(0)^2 = 0$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0. The answer is: 0

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we notice that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$, so $|x-2y| + |2y-x| \geq |(x-2y) + (2y-x)| = 0$.
The only way for the sum of two absolute values to equal 0 is if both absolute values are 0.
So we have $x-2y = 0$ and $2y-x = 0$, which means $x = 2y$.
Substituting $x = 2y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get $5(2y)^2+5y^2-8(2y)(y) = 20y^2+5y^2-16y^2 = 9y^2$.
Since $y^2$ is always nonnegative, the minimum value of $9y^2$ is 0, which occurs when $y = 0$.
Substituting $y = 0$ into $x = 2y$, we get $x = 0$.
Thus, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $9 \cdot 0^2 = 0$.
The answer is: 0.

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's simplify the given expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.
We can rewrite it as $(5x^2-8xy+5y^2)$, which can be factored as $(5x^2-10xy+5y^2+2xy)$.
The first three terms form a perfect square: $(5x^2-10xy+5y^2) = (5(x-y)^2)$.
So the expression becomes $(5(x-y)^2+2xy)$.
Now let's consider the constraint equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
We can rewrite it as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$, which simplifies to $2|x-2y| = 40$, or $|x-2y| = 20$.
This means that $x-2y = 20$ or $x-2y = -20$.
Without loss of generality, let's consider the case $x-2y = 20$.
Then we have $x = 2y + 20$.
Substitute this into the expression $(5(x-y)^2+2xy)$, we get
\[(5((2y+20)-y)^2+2(2y+20)y) = (5(y+20)^2+4y^2+40y) = 5(y^2+40y+400)+4y^2+40y = 5y^2+200y+2000+4y^2+40y = 9y^2+240y+2000.\]
Now we want to minimize this expression.
To find the minimum, we can find the derivative and set it equal to zero.
The derivative of $9y^2+240y+2000$ with respect to $y$ is $18y+240$.
Setting this equal to zero, we have $18y+240=0$, or $y=-\frac{240}{18}=-\frac{40}{3}$.
Substitute this back into $x = 2y + 20$, we get $x = 2(-\frac{40}{3}) + 20 = -\frac{80}{3} + 20 = \frac{20}{3}$.
Finally, substitute $x = \frac{20}{3}$ and $y = -\frac{40}{3}$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get
\[5(\frac{20}{3})^2 + 5(-\frac{40}{3})^2 - 8(\frac{20}{3})(-\frac{40}{3}) = \frac{2000}{9} + \frac{8000}{9} + \frac{6400}{9} = \frac{17400}{9} = \frac{5800}{3}.\]
Therefore, the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\frac{5800}{3}$.
The answer is: $\frac{5800}{3}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The given expression is $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite this as $(5x^2-8xy+5y^2)$. We recognize that $(5x^2-8xy+5y^2)$ is a perfect square trinomial, specifically $( \sqrt{5}x - \sqrt{5}y)^2$. Therefore, $(5x^2-8xy+5y^2) = (\sqrt{5}x - \sqrt{5}y)^2 \geq 0$.

Now let's consider the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. We can rewrite this as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$. Using the property $|a| = |-a|$, we can simplify this to $|x-2y| + |-1*(x-2y)| = 40$, which further simplifies to $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$, and finally $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$.

Using the property $|a| + |-a| = 2|a|$, we can rewrite the equation as $2|x-2y| = 40$, and then $|x-2y| = 20$. The absolute value equation has two solutions: $x - 2y = 20$ or $x - 2y = -20$.

We can analyze each case separately:

1) If $x - 2y = 20$, then $y = \frac{x - 20}{2}$. Substituting this into the expression $( \sqrt{5}x - \sqrt{5}y)^2$, we get $(\sqrt{5}x - \sqrt{5}\frac{x - 20}{2})^2 = (\sqrt{5}x - \frac{\sqrt{5}x}{2} + \sqrt{5}*10)^2 = (\frac{\sqrt{5}x}{2} + \sqrt{5}*10)^2$.

2) If $x - 2y = -20$, then $y = \frac{x + 20}{2}$. Substituting this into the expression $(\sqrt{5}x - \sqrt{5}y)^2$, we get $(\sqrt{5}x - \sqrt{5}\frac{x + 20}{2})^2 = (\sqrt{5}x - \frac{\sqrt{5}x}{2} - \sqrt{5}*10)^2 = (\frac{\sqrt{5}x}{2} - \sqrt{5}*10)^2$.

In both cases, the expression becomes a perfect square, and since a perfect square is always non-negative, the minimum value of $( \sqrt{5}x - \sqrt{5}y)^2$ is 0. But since the minimum value of $( \sqrt{5}x - \sqrt{5}y)^2$ is 0, the minimum value of the original expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is also 0.

Therefore, the minimum value of the given expression when $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 0. The answer is: $0$
